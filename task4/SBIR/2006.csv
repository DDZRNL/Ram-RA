Space Operations,Topic O2 Space Transportation,"Achieving space flight can be astonishing. It is an undertaking of great complexity, requiring numerous technological and engineering disciplines and a high level of organizational skill. Overcoming Earth's gravity to achieve orbit demands collections of quality data to maintain the security required of the range. The harsh environment of space puts tight constraints on the equipment needed to perform the necessary functions. Not only is there a concern for safety but the 2004 Space Transportation Policy directive that states that the US maintains robust transportation capabilities to assure access to space. Given this backdrop, this topic is designed to address technologies to enable a safer and more reliable space transportation capability. Automated collection of range data, automated tracking and identification of objects, and instrumentation for space transportation system testing are all required.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety,"
 The Aviation Safety Program focuses on the Nation's aviation safety challenges of the future. This vigilance for safety must continue in order to meet the projected increases in air traffic capacity and realize the new capabilities envisioned for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS). The Aviation Safety Program will conduct research to improve the intrinsic safety attributes of future aircraft and to eliminate safety-related technology barriers. The program is focusing on a foundational approach to advancing knowledge in core disciplines (e.g., fluid dynamics, computational methods, material science), which in turn is used to build integrated multidisciplinary system-level models, tools, and technologies. This approach focuses on furthering our understanding of the underlying physics, chemistry, materials, etc., of aeronautics phenomena when broken down to these most basic elements. The results at the fundamental level will be integrated at the discipline and multi-discipline levels to ultimately yield system-level integrated capabilities, methods, and tools for analysis, optimization, prediction, and design that will enable improved safety for a range of missions, vehicle classes, and crew configurations. The primary areas of program interest are research directed at the detection, prediction and mitigation/management of aging-related hazards of future civilian and military aircraft; designs of revolutionary adaptive flight decks; in-flight prognosis of aircraft health, preventative and adaptive systems for in-flight operability; informed logistics and maintenance graceful recovery from in-flight failures; software safety assurance and formal verification methods for safety-critical systems; system-level integrated resilient control technologies; as well as effective vehicle-based flight/mission management under adverse, upset, and hazards conditions.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics,"
 NASA is the Nation's leading government organization for civil aeronautical research. Within NASA's overall strategic plan Aeronautics has the goal to ""Advance knowledge in the fundamental disciplines of aeronautics, and develop technologies for safer aircraft and higher capacity airspace systems."" To address this goal NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) is organized into three separate Programs: Fundamental Aeronautics, Aviation Safety, and Airspace Systems. 

 The Fundamental Aeronautics Program is dedicated to the mastery and advancement of core aeronautics technologies across all flight regimes. NASA intends to invest broadly and deeply in these core competencies to produce knowledge, technology, and tools that are applicable across a broad range of air vehicles. The program encompasses cutting-edge, fundamental research in traditional aeronautical disciplines, as well as emerging fields with promising application to aeronautics. The overall program is long-term in scope as well as focused and integrated across disciplines. It is implemented through NASA's four research centers: the Ames Research Center, in Mountain View, California; the Dryden Flight Research Center in Edwards, California; the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio; and the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. 

 To achieve these objectives NASA has defined a four-level approach to technology development: (1) conduct foundational research to further our fundamental understanding of the underlying physics and our ability model that physics, (2) leverage the foundational research to develop technologies and analytical tools focused on discipline-based solutions, (3) integrate methods and technologies to develop multi-disciplinary solutions, and (4) solve the aeronautics challenges for a broad range of air vehicles with system-level optimization, assessment and technology integration. 

 The Fundamental Aeronautics will provide for results yielding the following:

   Technology innovation and integrated, multidisciplinary analysis tools; 
 Rapid evaluation of new concepts and technology; 
 Accelerated application of new technology to a wide array of vehicles; 
 Reduced environmental impact and increased public benefit of future aircraft: lower emissions, less noise, higher efficiency, and safer operation.


 Structurally, program is composed of four focused thrust areas: hypersonic flight, supersonic flight, subsonic fixed-wing aircraft and subsonic rotary-wing aircraft. Each thrust area, in turn, addresses specific discipline, multi-discipline, sub-system and system level technology issues relevant to that flight regime. However, a key aspect of the Fundamental Aeronautics program is that many technical issues are common across multiple flight regimes and may be best resolved in an integrated coordinated manner. As such, the Fundamental Aeronautics subtopics are organized by discipline, not by flight regime, with a special subtopic for rotary-wing issues. The full list of Fundamental Aeronautics subtopics are: (1) Materials and Structures, (2) Combustion, (3) Acoustics, (4) Aeroelasticity, (5) Aerodynamics, (6) Aerothermodynamics, (7) Control and Dynamics, (8) Experimental Capabilities and Flight Research, (9) Systems Analysis, Design and Optimization, and (10) Rotorcraft. 

 Each of the subsequent subtopic sections will describe the scope, key issues and technical content of the subtopic. It will also include the specific areas of interest spanning the four flight regimes. Individual proposals are not restricted to any one specific technical area or any single part of the full flight regime. They may address any or all areas included in a subtopic and may cover any or all parts of the entire flight regime.","A2.01Materials and Structures for Future Aircraft; A2.02Combustion for Aerospace Vehicles; A2.03Aero-Acoustics; A2.04Aeroelasticity; A2.05Aerodynamics; A2.06Aerothermodynamics; A2.07Aircraft Control and Dynamics; A2.08Experimental Capabilities and Flight Research; A2.09Aircraft Systems Analysis, Design and Optimization; A2.10Rotorcraft",A2.01; A2.02; A2.03; A2.04; A2.05; A2.06; A2.07; A2.08; A2.09; A2.10,"Materials and Structures for Future Aircraft; Combustion for Aerospace Vehicles; Aero-Acoustics; Aeroelasticity; Aerodynamics; Aerothermodynamics; Aircraft Control and Dynamics; Experimental Capabilities and Flight Research; Aircraft Systems Analysis, Design and Optimization; Rotorcraft"
Aeronautics Research,Topic A3 Airspace Systems,"
 NASA's Airspace Systems (AS) Program is investing in the development of innovative concepts and technologies to support the development of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS). The NGATS vision calls for a system-wide transformation leading to a new set of capabilities that will enable the system to respond to future needs of the nation for air transportation. NASA is working to develop, validate and transfer advanced concepts, technologies, and procedures through partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other government agencies represented in the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO), and in cooperation with the U.S. aeronautics industry and academia. The NGATS concept for 2025 envisions the safe, efficient, reliable, and secure movement of large numbers of people and goods throughout the air transportation system. It is a system founded on an underlying set of operating principles. Central to these principles is the requirement for a system-wide transformation involving change in organization, as well as culture and policy to assure that the system meets the requirements of the user. The NGATS will provide cost-effective services that are responsive to changing user needs. The system will be designed for environmental compatibility and global interoperability. The major technical challenges are to: 

   Accommodate projected growth in air traffic while maintaining safety; 
 Provide all airspace system users more flexibility and efficiency in their utilization of airports, airspace, and aircraft classes; 
 Reduce system delays; and, 
 Enable new modes of operation that support the transition to NGATS operations in a continually evolving technical environment.


 Key objectives of NASA's AS Program are to: 

   Improve mobility, capacity, efficiency and access of the airspace system; 
 Improve collaboration, predictability, and flexibility for the airspace users; 
 Enable accurate modeling and simulation of air transportation systems; 
 Accommodate operations of all classes of aircraft; and 
 Maintain system safety and environmental protection.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A4 Aeronautics Test Technologies,"NASA has implemented the Aeronautics Test Program (ATP) within its Aeronautics Mission Directorate. The purpose of the ATP is to ensure the long term availability and health of the large aeronautics ground test facilities that support NASA, DoD and U.S. industry research and development (R&D) and test and evaluation (T&E) needs. Furthermore, ATP provides rate stability to the aforementioned user community. The ATP facilities are located at the NASA Research Centers, including at Ames Research Center, Glenn Research Center and Langley Research Center. Classes of facilities within the ATP include low speed wind tunnels, transonic wind tunnels, supersonic wind tunnel, hypersonic wind tunnels, hypersonic propulsion integration test facilities, and air-breathing engine test facilities. A key component of ensuring a ground test facility's long term viability is to implement and continually improve on the efficiency and effectiveness of that facility's operations. To operate a facility in this manner requires the use of state-of-art test technologies and test techniques, creative facility performance capability enhancements, and novel means of acquiring test data. NASA is soliciting proposals in the areas of instrumentation, test measurement technology, test techniques and facility development to help in achieving the ATP goals of sustaining and improving our ground test capabilities. Proposals that describe products or processes that are transportable across multiple facility classes are of special interest. The proposals will also be assessed for their ability to develop products that can be implemented across government-owned, industry and academic institution ground test facilities.",A4.01Test Measurement Technology; A4.02Test Techniques and Facility Development,A4.01; A4.02,Test Measurement Technology; Test Techniques and Facility Development
Science,Topic S1 Robotic Exploration of the Moon and Mars,"

Science,Topic S2 Robotic Exploration Throughout the Solar System,"
 NASA's program for Solar System Exploration seeks to answer fundamental questions about the Solar System and life: How do planets form? Why are planets different from one another? Where did the makings of life come from? Did life arise elsewhere in the solar system? What is the future habitability of Earth and other planets? The search for answers to these questions requires that we augment the current remote sensing approach to solar system exploration with a robust program that includes in situ measurements at key places in the solar system, and the return of materials from them for later study on the Earth. We envision a rich suite of missions to achieve this including a comet nucleus sample return, a Europa lander, and a rover or balloon-borne experiment on Saturn's moon, Titan, to name a few. These robotic explorers will pursue compelling scientific questions, demonstrate breakthrough technologies, identify space resources, and extend an advanced telepresence that will send stunning imagery back to Earth. Numerous new technologies will be required to enable such ambitious missions. This topic includes investments in technology to enable the delivery and access of scientific instruments to planetary surfaces and atmospheres. This includes landing, flying, roving, and digging, as well as sample acquisition for delivery to instruments.

Science,Topic S4 Exploration of the Universe Beyond our Solar System,"
 The Universe division of the NASA/GSFC is charged with exploring the universe beyond the solar system - out to its very edges. To do this requires ever more sophisticated instruments (surpassing Chandra, Spitzer, and Hubble) with larger and better optics and more sensitive detector systems. Future mission may include spacecraft in formation-flyin; optics that fold and deploy and can be assembled on orbit; as well as larger arrays of detectors: bolometers, microcalorimeters, and room temperature semiconductors. Some of these arrays may contain billions of pixels. Our missions cover the full range of the electromagnetic spectrum (from sub-mm to gamma-rays) and gravitational waves. Some of our major science goals are to identify dark matter, to understand dark energy, to produce a census of black holes, to image material in the accretion disks around black holes and to measure gravitational waves from a wide range of sources. In addition, we are exploring new technologies for terrestrial sub-orbital platforms including long duration balloons, tethered balloons, and airships. We are soliciting ideas and concepts in six areas covering optical systems, UV, visible, IR and sub-mm detectors, x-ray and gamma-ray detectors, lasers for gravitational wave measurements, and sub-orbital platforms.

Science,Topic S5 Instrument Technologies for Solar Science,"
 We live in the extended atmosphere of an active star. While sunlight enables and sustains life, the Sun's variability produces streams of high energy particles and radiation that can harm life or alter its evolution. Under the protective shield of a magnetic field and atmosphere, the Earth is an island in the Universe where life has developed and flourished. The origins and fate of life on Earth are intimately connected to the way the Earth responds to the Sun's variations. Understanding the Sun, Heliosphere, and Planetary Environments as a single connected system is the goal of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program. In addition to solar processes, our domain of study includes the interaction of solar plasma and radiation with Earth, the other planets, and the Galaxy. By analyzing the connections between the Sun, solar wind, planetary space environments, and our place in the Galaxy, we are uncovering the fundamental physical processes that occur throughout the Universe. Understanding the connections between the Sun and its planets will allow us to predict the impacts of solar variability on humans, technological systems, and even the presence of life itself. There are three primary objectives that define the multi-decadal studies needed: 

   To understand the changing flow of energy and matter throughout the Sun, Heliosphere, and Planetary Environments; 
 To explore the fundamental physical processes of space plasma systems; and
 To define the origins and societal impacts of variability in the Earth-Sun System.


 A combination of interrelated elements is used to achieve these objectives. They include complementary missions of various sizes; timely development of enabling and enhancing technologies; and acquisition of knowledge through research, analysis, theory, and modeling.",S5.01Voltage Supplies and Charge Amplifiers  for Solar Science Missions; S5.02Sensors for Measurement of Particles and Fields,S5.01; S5.02,Voltage Supplies and Charge Amplifiers  for Solar Science Missions; Sensors for Measurement of Particles and Fields
Science,Topic S6 Earth Science Instrument and Sensor Technology,"
 NASA's Earth Science (ES) Division is committed to studying how our global environment is changing. Using the unique perspective available from spaceborne and airborne platforms, NASA is observing, documenting, and assessing large-scale environmental processes with emphasis on atmospheric composition, climate, carbon cycle and ecosystems, the Earth's surface and interior, the water and energy cycles, and weather. A major objective of ES instrument development programs is to implement science measurement capabilities with small or more affordable spacecraft so development programs can meet multiple mission needs and therefore make the best use of limited resources. The rapid development of small, low-cost remote sensing and in situ instruments is essential to achieving this objective. Consequently, the objective of this SBIR topic is to develop and demonstrate instrument component and subsystem technologies that reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of Earth observing instruments and to enable new Earth observations measurements. The following subtopics are concomitant with this objective and are organized by measurement technique.

Science,Topic S7 Science Spacecraft Systems Technology,"
 The Science Mission Directorate will carry out the scientific exploration of our Earth, and the planets, moons, comets, and asteroids of our Solar System and beyond; chart the best route of discovery; and reap the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society. A major objective of the NASA science spacecraft systems development programs is to implement science measurement capabilities with small or more affordable spacecraft so development programs can meet multiple mission needs and therefore, make the best use of limited resources. NASA is fostering innovations in cross-cutting technologies that can be leveraged by spacecraft and other platforms to enable new investigations of Earth space, the solar system, and the universe. These missions all require propulsion, power, and guidance and navigation systems that must be implemented at minimal mass and cost to maximize the scientific return for a given budget. To this end, innovations are sought in the areas of Guidance, Navigation and Control, Command and Data Handling, Electric Propulsion, Advanced Chemical and Propellantless Propulsion, Platform Power Management and Distribution (including power electronics and packaging), and Thermal Control Technologies for Science Spacecraft. These technologies need not be limited to spacecraft, but can also be applicable to other platforms such as piloted and unpiloted aircraft, balloons, drop sondes, and sounding rockets.

Exploration Systems,Topic X1 Systems Analysis and Integration,"
 Definition of large, complex systems requires an understanding of system performance, cost and risk during each of the system's lifecycle phases (i.e., design, development, testing, deployment and operations). Accurate representations of the system's: (1) functional and physical interfaces are required to facilitate the analysis, design, and integration of the system and its elements; (2) costs, operational plans, and risks are required to balance the programmatic aspects of the system; and (3) performance projections and margins are required to understand payload options. Achieving an understanding of these complex interactions requires the development, analysis and refinement of models and simulations (M&S) across the lifecycle of the system in order to support a variety of analysis activities. Models currently being developed for Exploration Systems and Space Operations are categorized as subjective, constructive, operator-in-the-loop, hardware- and software-in-the-loop, and in-service operations. These models and simulations are used to address requirements generation, design definition, verification of requirements, testing and sustaining engineering. SBIR Topic X1 is aimed at addressing pressing issues that are still lingering in the area of analysis and M&S. Data required to perform analysis and execute models/simulations must be consistent, valid and cohesive across the analyses. Approaches to dealing with analysis data management and manipulation through the lifecycle are sought. The integration of cost and risk models early in the lifecycle of a system's analyses must be achieved to ensure that programmatic factors drive our plans.

Exploration Systems,Topic X4 Lunar In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU),"
 Instead of bringing everything from Earth, a key to fulfilling the goal of sustained and affordable human and robotic exploration will be the ability to use resources that are available at the site of exploration to ""live off the land"", known as In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). Past studies have shown making propellants and other mission critical consumables (life support and power) in situ can significantly reduce mission mass and cost, and also enable new mission concepts (e.g. surface hoppers). The ability to excavate and manipulate regolith can also have significant mass and risk reduction benefits. The primary objectives for the following ISRU subtopics are to develop technologies and systems that meet Lunar Precursor and Robotic Program (LPRP) and human lunar exploration mission objectives in the following areas: (1) Lunar regolith excavation, handling, and material transportation; (2) Oxygen production from lunar regolith processing; and (3) Lunar volatile resource extraction, separation, and storage, especially in the permanently shadowed craters at the lunar poles. To support future LPRP and human missions, the technologies and systems developed must meet the following: 

   LPRP payload mass and power requirements are unknown at this time, however notional payloads should be designed to < 100 kg, not to exceed 500 Watts of average power. 
 Technology and systems for lunar human Sortie mission demonstrations should be notionally 1/5th scale of early Outpost mission needs and no smaller than 1/10th scale. Payloads should be nominally 100 to 200 kg and no greater than 500 kg in mass.
 The current estimate for lunar human Outpost needs are 2 MT of oxygen per year for life support and EVA usage, and 7 MT of oxygen per year for propulsion to support two ascent missions per year.",X4.01Lunar Regolith Excavation and Material Handling; X4.02Oxygen Production from Lunar Regolith; X4.03Lunar Polar Resource Prospecting and Collection,X4.01; X4.02; X4.03,Lunar Regolith Excavation and Material Handling; Oxygen Production from Lunar Regolith; Lunar Polar Resource Prospecting and Collection
Exploration Systems,Topic X5 Extreme Environment Mechanisms,"
 In early robotic missions, and later in outpost missions, permanently shadowed regions of the Lunar surface (e.g., the bottoms of craters in the polar regions). These areas appear to remain at temperatures of 50°K to 80°K (-223°C to -193°C). Current surface exploration hardware has demonstrated capability to operate in the range of 158K to 273K (-115°C to 0°C) on Mars. However, the technical challenges of developing and demonstrating hardware that can operate over 100°C colder than current capabilities are significant. The major technology drivers of the low temperature mechanism technology development are to significantly enhance operation of mechanized parts by (1) lowering the operating temperature for the life of the component and (2) improving mechanism performance (e.g., torque out put, actuation performance, lubrication state) at the lunar environment conditions of cold and vacuum. The targeted application of the technology is to provide for operation of motors and drive systems, lubricated mechanisms, and actuators of lunar rovers and mobility systems, ISRU machinery, robotic systems mechanisms, and surface operations machinery (i.e. cranes, deployment systems, airlocks), lunar sortie and the lunar outpost missions.

Exploration Systems,Topic X6 Lightweight Structures and Materials,"
 The SBIR topic area of Structures and Materials centers on developing lightweight structures technologies to support Lunar Lander, and Lunar Habitats, with relevant technology made available to the CEV and CLV programs. Lightweight structures have been identified as a critical need since the reduction of structural mass translates directly to additional up and down mass capability that would facilitate additional logistics capacity and increased science return for all mission phases. The Lightweight Structures program utilizes and combines multi-center R&D teams into a focused activity for developing lightweight structure technology for the primary load bearing structure of the pressurized elements of the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) program. In addition, development for non-pressurized primary structures will be considered where there is synergy with the development of the pressurized structures. The major technology drivers of the lightweight structure technology development are to significantly enhance structural systems for man-rated pressurized structures by (1) lowering mass and/or improving efficient volume for reduced launch costs, (2) improving performance to reduce risk and extend life, and (3) improving manufacturing and processing to reduce costs. This topic area is responsible for mid-level technology research, development, and testing through experimental and/or analytical validation.

Exploration Systems,Topic X7 Operations of Exploration Equipment,"
 This call for technology development is in direct support of the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) Technology Development Program. The purpose of this research is to develop new technologies to support low-Earth orbit (LEO), robotic precursor, and human exploration missions, providing systems that interact with humans, handle surface equipment and move people and their payloads across planetary surfaces. The objective is to produce new technology that will reduce crew extra-vehicular activity (EVA) and intra-vehicular activity (IVA) workloads and risk in LEO, and Lunar operations and reduce the total mass and volume of equipment and materials required to support missions. The proposals should focus on technology to improve the operations of exploration equipment, allowing for less expensive, more productive and less risky missions. This research will provide technology for the critical functions that fall into three phases of surface exploration. The first phase of surface exploration will be functions that are needed prior to crew arriving at a site. These precursors may be hours, days, weeks or years ahead of the crew landing on the surface. The second phase of surface exploration will be during a crew's stay at the site. This work will include supporting the crew in IVA and in EVA tasks. The third phase of surface exploration will include long-term maintenance of the facility, as well as supporting science performed between crews.","X7.01Supportability Technologies for Long-Duration Space Missions; X7.02Human-System Interaction; X7.03Surface Handling and Mobility, Transportation, and Operations Equipment (Lunar or Mars)",X7.01; X7.02; X7.03,"Supportability Technologies for Long-Duration Space Missions; Human-System Interaction; Surface Handling and Mobility, Transportation, and Operations Equipment (Lunar or Mars)"
Exploration Systems,Topic X8 Energy Generation and Storage,"
 This topic intends to develop power capabilities that are on the critical path to enabling human exploration beyond Earth orbit. Areas of primary interest are: power generation/actuation for launch vehicles utilizing non-toxic fluids; orbital and planetary surface energy storage; and non-solar power generation. The Exploration Systems Assessment Study (ESAS) architecture desires nontoxic fluids to reduce ground processing facility requirements and to increase safety for the crew. Hydrazine (toxic) is currently used to drive the Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) and Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) Auxiliary Power Units (APUs), which in turn provide power for actuation for engine gimbal. Development efforts using nontoxic power generation for launch vehicles is required. ESAS architecture elements, including the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM), robotic missions, and surface systems, require long-life/ high-capacity/high-density energy storage on the order of up to 10 kW. Lithium ion batteries are required to be human-rated at load profiles that are currently higher than state-of-the-art, and, are required to operate over a greater range of temperatures for the lunar environment. The ESAS architecture requires advanced fuel cells to meet LSAM and surface system design margins. Fuel cell systems provide power largely independent of environment (solar incidence), which allows greater mission flexibility and will typically provide larger power levels for less total mass for short-duration missions. The exploration architecture identifies permanent human lunar habitation shortly following a set of crewed sortie missions. The permanent habitation phase requires lunar night stays, extended EVAs, expanded science and surface operations and the utilization of ISRU to demonstrate and validate capabilities needed for Mars exploration. The expected power requirements will exceed that practically furnished by conventional technologies. The ESAS study identified surface nuclear fission systems to satisfy the power requirements for lunar extended stays, particularly at non-polar regions and nuclear power extensibility to Mars exploration.",X8.01Non-Toxic Launch Vehicle Power for Thrust Vector and Engine Actuation; X8.02Space Based Nuclear Fission Power Technologies; X8.03Space Rated  Batteries and Fuel Cells for Surface Systems,X8.01; X8.02; X8.03,Non-Toxic Launch Vehicle Power for Thrust Vector and Engine Actuation; Space Based Nuclear Fission Power Technologies; Space Rated  Batteries and Fuel Cells for Surface Systems

Exploration Systems,Topic X10 Thermal Protection,"
 The Thermal Protection System (TPS) protects a spacecraft from the severe heating encountered during hypersonic flight through a planetary atmosphere. In general, there are two classes of TPS: reusable and ablative. Typically, reusable TPS applications are limited to relatively mild entry environments like that of Space Shuttle. No change in the mass or properties of the TPS material results from entry with a significant amount of energy being re-radiated from the heated surface and the remainder conducted into the TPS material. Typically, a surface coating with high emissivity (to maximize the amount of energy re-radiated) and with low surface catalycity (to minimize convective heating by suppressing surface recombination of dissociated boundary layer species) is employed. The primary insulation has low thermal conductivity to minimize the mass of material required to insulate the primary structure. Ablative TPS materials, in contrast, accommodate high heating rates and heat loads through phase change and mass loss. All NASA planetary entry probes to date have used ablative TPS. Most ablative TPS materials are reinforced composites employing organic resins as binders. When heated, the resin pyrolyzes producing gaseous products that are heated as they percolate toward the surface thus transferring some energy from the solid to the gas. Additionally, the injection of the pyrolysis gases into the boundary layer alters the boundary layer properties resulting in reduced convective heating. However, the gases may undergo chemical reactions with the boundary layer gases that could return heat to the surface. Furthermore, chemical reactions between the surface material and boundary layer species can result in consumption of the surface material leading to surface recession. Those reactions can be endothermic (vaporization, sublimation) or exothermic (oxidation) and will have an important impact on net energy to the surface. Clearly, in comparison to reusable TPS materials, the interaction of ablative TPS materials with the surrounding gas environment is much more complex as there are many more mechanisms to accommodate the entry heating. NASA has successfully tackled the complexity of thermal protection systems for numerous missions to inner and outer planets in our solar system in the past; the knowledge gained has been invaluable but incomplete. Future missions will be more demanding. For example, if existing materials were to be used for the proposed Mars Sample Return mission, the TPS mass fraction would be on the order of 40%. The potential savings that could be achieved with some investment in TPS technology development is sizeable.",X10.01Ablative Thermal Protection System for CEV,X10.01,Ablative Thermal Protection System for CEV

 All spacecraft and extraterrestrial bases require thermal management systems. The long duration lunar bases that are foreseen in 15 years will present several challenges to the design and operation of active thermal control systems.

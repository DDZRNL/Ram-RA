Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications,"NASA's communications capability  is based on the premise that communications shall enable and not constrain  missions. Communications must be robust to support the numerous missions for  space science, Earth science and exploration of the universe. Technologies such  as optical communications, RF including antennas and ground based Earth  stations, surface networks, access links, reprogrammable communications  systems, communications systems for EVAs, advanced antenna technology, transmit  array concepts and communications in support of launch services including space  based assets are very important to the future of exploration and science  activities of the Agency. Emphasis is placed on size, weight and power  improvements. Even greater emphasis is placed on these attributes as small  satellites (e.g., micro and nano satellite) technology matures. Innovative  solutions centered around operational issues associated with the communications  capability are needed. Communications that enable the range safety data from  sensitive instruments is imperative. These technologies are to be aligned with  the Space Communications and Navigation Architecture as being developed by the  Agency. See https://www.spacecomm.nasa.gov/spacecomm/ for more details. A typical approach for flight hardware would include: Phase 1  - Research to identify and evaluate candidate telecommunications technology  applications to demonstrate the technical feasibility and show a path towards a  hardware/software demonstration. Bench or lab-level demonstrations are  required. Phase 2 - Emphasis should be placed on developing and demonstrating  the technology under simulated flight conditions. The proposal shall outline a  path showing how the technology could be developed into space-worthy systems.  The contract should deliver a demonstration unit for functional and  environmental testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety,"The Aviation Safety Program focuses on the Nation's aviation safety challenges of the future. This vigilance for safety must continue in order to meet the projected increases in air traffic capacity and realize the new capabilities envisioned for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). The Aviation Safety Program will conduct research to improve the intrinsic safety attributes of future aircraft and to eliminate safety-related technology barriers. The program is focusing on a foundational approach to advancing knowledge in core disciplines (e.g., computational methods, material science), which in turn are used to build integrated multidisciplinary system-level models, tools, and technologies. This year, the scope of the aviation safety subtopics has been focused to develop specific technologies that are needed to accomplish program goals. It is expected there will be approximately one award per A1 subtopic with quality proposals. 

 This approach focuses on furthering our understanding of the underlying physics, chemistry, materials, etc. of aeronautics phenomena when broken down to these most basic elements. The results at the fundamental level will be integrated at the discipline and multi-discipline levels to ultimately yield system-level integrated capabilities, methods, and tools for analysis, optimization, prediction, and design that will enable improved safety for a range of missions, vehicle classes, and crew configurations. 

 Example areas of program interest include research directed at the detection, prediction and mitigation/management of aging-related hazards of future civilian and military aircraft; designs of revolutionary adaptive flight decks; in-flight detection, diagnosis, prognosis of aircraft health, preventative and adaptive systems for in-flight operability; informed logistics and maintenance graceful recovery from in-flight failures; software safety assurance and formal verification methods for safety-critical systems; as well as system-level integrated resilient control technologies. 

 NASA seeks highly innovative proposals that will complement its work in science and technologies that build upon and advance the Agency's unique safety-related research capabilities vital to aviation safety.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics,"The Fundamental Aeronautics  Program (FAP) encompasses the principles of flight in any atmosphere, and at  any speed. The program develops focused technological capabilities, starting  with the most basic knowledge of underlying phenomena through validation and  verification of advanced concepts and technologies at the component and systems  level. Physics-based, multidisciplinary design, analysis, and optimization  (MDAO) tools will be developed that make it possible to evaluate radically new vehicle  designs and to assess, with known uncertainties, the potential impact of  innovative technologies and concepts on a vehicle's overall performance. The  development of advanced component technologies will realize revolutionary  improvements in noise, emissions, and performance. The program also supports  NASA's human and robotic exploration missions by advancing knowledge in  aeronautical areas critical to planetary Entry, Descent, and Landing. 
NASA has defined a four-level  approach to technology development: conduct foundational research to further  our fundamental understanding of the underlying physics and our ability model  that physics; leverage the foundational research to develop technologies and  analytical tools focused on discipline-based solutions; integrate methods and  technologies to develop multi-disciplinary solutions; and solve the aeronautics  challenges for a broad range of air vehicles with system-level optimization,  assessment and technology integration. 
Structurally, the FAP is composed  of four projects: hypersonic flight, supersonic flight, subsonic fixed-wing  aircraft and subsonic rotary-wing aircraft. 
 Hypersonics 
   Fundamental research in all disciplines to enable very-high speed flight and re-entry into planetary atmospheres 
 High-temperature materials; thermal protection systems; advanced propulsion; aero-thermodynamics; multi-disciplinary analysis and design; guidance, navigation, and control (GNC); advanced experimental capabilities 

 Supersonics 
   Eliminate environmental and performance barriers that prevent practical supersonic vehicles 
 Supersonic deceleration technology for Entry, Descent, and Landing into Mars 

 Subsonic Fixed Wing (SFW) 
   Develop revolutionary technologies and aircraft concepts with highly improved performance satisfying strict noise and emission constraints 
 Focus on enabling technologies: acoustics predictions, propulsion/combustion, system integration, high-lift concepts, lightweight and strong materials, GNC 

 Subsonic Rotary Wing (SRW) 
   Improve civil potential of rotary wing vehicles while maintaining their unique benefits 
 Key advances in multiple areas through innovation in materials, aeromechanics, flow control, propulsion 

 Each project addresses specific discipline, multi-discipline, sub-system and system level technology issues relevant to that flight regime. A key aspect of the Fundamental Aeronautics Program is that many technical issues are common across multiple flight regimes and may be best resolved in an integrated coordinated manner. As such, the FAP subtopics are organized by discipline, not by flight regime, with a special subtopic for rotary-wing issues.

The AS Program integrates the  two projects, NextGen Airspace and NextGen Airportal, to directly address the  fundamental research needs of NextGen vision in partnership with the member  agencies of the JPDO. The NextGen Airspace Project develops and explores fundamental  concepts and integrated solutions that address the optimal allocation of ground  and air automation technologies necessary for NextGen. The project will focus  NASA's technical expertise and world-class facilities to address the question  of where, when, how and the extent to which automation can be applied to moving  aircraft safely and efficiently through the NAS. The NextGen Airportal Project  develops and validates algorithms, concepts, and technologies to increase  throughput of the runway complex and achieve high efficiency in the use of  airportal resources such as gates, taxiways, runways, and final approach  airspace. NASA research in this project will lead to development of solutions  that safely integrate surface and terminal area air traffic optimization tools  and systems with 4-D trajectory operations. Ultimately, the roles and  responsibilities of humans and automation influence in the ATM will be  addressed by both projects. Key objectives of NASA's AS Program are to:

Aeronautics Research,Topic A4 Aeronautics Test Technologies,"NASA has implemented the  Aeronautics Test Program (ATP) within its Aeronautics Research Mission  Directorate (ARMD). The purpose of the ATP is to ensure the long term  availability and health of NASA's major wind tunnels/ground test facilities and  flight operations/test infrastructure that support NASA, DoD and U.S. industry  research and development (R&D) and test and evaluation (T&E) needs.  Furthermore, ATP provides rate stability to the aforementioned user community.  The ATP facilities are located at the NASA Research Centers, including at Ames  Research Center, Dryden Flight Research Center, Glenn Research Center and  Langley Research Center. Classes of facilities within the ATP include low speed  wind tunnels, transonic wind tunnels, supersonic wind tunnels, hypersonic wind  tunnels, hypersonic propulsion integration test facilities, air-breathing  engine test facilities, the Western Aeronautical Test Range (WATR), support  aircraft, test bed aircraft, and the simulation and loads laboratories. A key  component of ensuring a test facility's long term viability is to implement and  continually improve on the efficiency and effectiveness of that facility's  operations. To operate a facility in this manner requires the use of  state-of-the-art test technologies and test techniques, creative facility  performance capability enhancements, and novel means of acquiring test data.  NASA is soliciting proposals in the areas of instrumentation, test measurement  technology, test techniques and facility development that apply to the ATP  facilities to help in achieving the ATP goals of sustaining and improving our  test capabilities. Proposals that describe products or processes that are  transportable across multiple facility classes are of special interest.

Science,"Topic S1 Sensors, Detectors and Instruments","
  NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/)  encompasses research in the areas of Astrophysics (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/astrophysics),  Earth Science (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/earth-science),  Heliophysics (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/heliophysics),  and Planetary Science (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/planetary-science). A major objective of SMD instrument development  programs is to implement science measurement capabilities with smaller or more  affordable spacecraft so development programs can meet multiple mission needs  and therefore make the best use of limited resources. The rapid development of  small, low-cost remote sensing and in situ instruments is essential to  achieving this objective. For Earth Science needs, in particular, the subtopics  reflect a focus on instrument development for airborne and Unmanned Aerial  Vehicle (UAV) platforms. Astrophysics has a critical need for sensitive detector  arrays with imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetric capabilities which can be  demonstrated on ground, airborne, balloon, or suborbital rocket instruments.  Heliophysics, which focuses on measurements of the sun and its interaction with  the Earth and the other planets in the solar system, needs a significant  reduction in the size, mass, power, and cost for instruments to fly on smaller  spacecraft. Planetary Science has a critical need for miniaturized instruments  with in situ sensors that can be deployed on surface landers, rovers, and  airborne platforms. For the 2008 program year, two new subtopics have been  added. One subtopic solicits technology for geodetic instruments and  instruments to enable global navigation and very long baseline interferometry. A  second new subtopic requests proposals for technology to enable new lunar  science instruments. A key objective of this SBIR topic is to develop and  demonstrate instrument component and subsystem technologies that reduce the  risk, cost, size, and development time of SMD observing instruments and to  enable new measurements. Proposals are sought for development components that  can be used in planned missions or a current technology program.

Astrophysics applications  require large aperture light-weight highly reflecting mirrors, deployable large  structures and innovative metrology, control of unwanted radiation for  high-contrast optics, precision formation flying for synthetic aperture  telescopes, and cryogenic optics to enable far infrared telescopes. A few of  the new astrophysics telescopes and their subsystems will require operation at  cryogenic temperatures as cold a 4-degrees Kelvin. This topic will consider  technologies necessary to enable future telescopes and observatories collecting  electromagnetic bands, ranging from UV to millimeter waves, and also include  gravity waves. The subtopics will consider all technologies associated with the  collection and combination of observable signals. Earth science requires modest  apertures in the 2 to 4 meter size category that are cost effective.

  The Science Mission Directorate  will carry out the scientific exploration of our Earth, the planets, moons,  comets, and asteroids of our Solar System and beyond; chart the best route of  discovery; and reap the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society. A  major objective of the NASA science spacecraft systems development programs is  to implement science measurement capabilities using small, affordable  spacecraft enabling a single spacecraft to meet multiple mission requirements  thus making the best use of our limited resources. To accomplish this  objective, NASA is fostering innovations in propulsion, power, and guidance and  navigation systems (including advanced avionics for low cost small spacecraft  and technology) that significantly reduce the mass and cost while maximizing  the scientific return for future NASA missions. Innovations are sought in the  areas of power generation, energy storage, guidance, navigation,  command/control, on-board propulsion (electric propulsion, advanced chemical  and propellantless propulsion), propulsion technologies related to sample  return missions, and on-board power management and distribution (power  electronics and packaging).

Science,Topic S4 Low-cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies,"The Low-Cost Small Spacecraft and  Technologies Topic focuses on the technologies, subsystems, methodologies, and  mission concepts for space missions which lower the over-all cost for  scientific exploration. The ""Small"" of spacecraft and missions refers  to small spacecraft that have ""wet"" masses below 500 Kg. (compared to  micro satellites 10-100kg, nano satellite 1-10kg, or pico satellite <1kg),  are substantially less expensive, and will require different approaches to  solve traditional problems in development, operations and capability. The goal  of these low-cost missions is not to replace the major missions, but rather to  reduce the risks to, as well as the costs of, future major missions. Low-Cost  Small Spacecraft and Technologies Missions will be used as test beds for new  technologies, provide flight ""heritage"" for new instruments and  components. Increasing the number of flight opportunities per year enables missions  to be designed and flown during typical graduate and post-doctoral tenures,  provide training for a new generation of scientists and engineers. These small  spacecraft missions can also accomplish specific scientific investigations that  would be too narrow for a major mission but still scientifically important.  This topic is divided into two categories of subtopics: Small Spacecraft  Technologies and Enablers and Small Spacecraft Build.
Small Spacecraft Technologies and  Enablers: These subtopics will lower the barrier to entry for small spacecraft  missions by encouraging launch opportunities and creating open design and  spacecraft management tools. These subtopics include: 1. Nanosat launch  vehicles and technologies, 2. Rapid End-to-end Mission Design and Simulation 3.  Cost modeling. 
Small Spacecraft Build: When used  together, SBIR subtopics could create a small spacecraft mission. The subtopics  required to accomplish this effort extend beyond the Low-cost Small Spacecraft  and Technologies topic, and definition for such an effort is in progress (see  2.0, Mission Concept). In FY08, there will be multiple subtopics across the  topic portfolio participating toward this mission concept. 
Mission Concept: NASA announced a  mission concept at a Mission Concept Review (MCR) held February 8, 2008. The  spacecraft is a modular spacecraft that operates using standard protocols (high  speed: Ethernet, SpacewireTM; low speed: RS-422, I2C) and at 28V +/- 6V. With  this modularity, a requirement for the Low-Cost Small Spacecraft and  Technologies, components can be interchanged from a basic spacecraft design to  tailor for specific missions. 
The Low-Cost Small Spacecraft and  Technologies topic will invite to subsequent reviews those awardees current at  the time of the review; review titles and respective tentative dates follow: a)  System Requirements Review (SRR), tentatively August 2008; b) Mission  Definition Review (MDR), tentatively November 2008; c) Preliminary Design  Review (PDR), tentatively August 2009; Critical Design Review (CDR),  tentatively September 2010. NASA intends to make SBIR Phase 1 and Phase 2  awards to this effort, which NASA understands are a best effort by the SBIR  awardees and NASA alike. By 1QFY11, all Phase 2 and Phase 3 SBIR teams are  encouraged to deliver to NASA the hardware to be integrated and ready for  launch in 4QFY11. The Low-Cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies topic is  envisioned to launch one satellite per year or every other year, starting in  FY11, kicking off a new team at each cycle. NASA cannot direct SBIR awardees to  conform to the provisional schedule outlined above, however when brought  together this could create the opportunity for a spacecraft build.

Exploration Systems,Topic X3 Lunar In Situ Resource Utilization,"
  The purpose of In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) is to  harness and utilize resources at the site of exploration to create products and  services which can enable and significantly reduce the mass, cost, and risk of  near-term and long-term space exploration. In particular, the ability to make  propellants, life support consumables, fuel cell reagents, and radiation  shielding can significantly reduce the cost, mass, and risk of sustained human  activities beyond Earth. The ability to modify the lunar landscape for safer  landing, transfer of payloads from the lander to an outpost, dust generation  mitigation, and infrastructure emplacement and buildup are also extremely important  for long-term lunar operations. To perform these tasks on the lunar surface,  detailed knowledge of the terrain, local minerals and potential resources, and  subsurface futures is important for planning and operations at the start of  establishing long-term human presence on the lunar surface. Lastly, since ISRU  systems and operations have never been demonstrated before in missions, it is  important that ISRU concepts and technologies be evaluated under relevant  conditions (1/6 g and vacuum) as well as anchored through modeling to lunar  soil and environmental conditions. With this in mind, the ISRU Project within  the Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP) has initiated development  and testing of hardware and systems in three main focus areas: (1) Regolith  Excavation, Handling and Material Transportation; (2) Oxygen Extraction from  Regolith; and (3) ISRU Development & Precursor Activities. The purpose of  the following subtopics is to develop and demonstrate hardware and software  technologies that can be added to on-going analysis and ISRU capability  development and demonstration activities in ETDP to meet Outpost architecture  and surface manipulation objectives for near and long term human exploration of  the Moon.",X3.01Lunar Regolith Excavation and Material Handling; X3.02Oxygen Production from Lunar Regolith; X3.03Lunar ISRU Development and Precursor Activities,X3.01; X3.02; X3.03,Lunar Regolith Excavation and Material Handling; Oxygen Production from Lunar Regolith; Lunar ISRU Development and Precursor Activities
Exploration Systems,"Topic X4 Structures, Materials and Mechanisms","The SBIR topic area of  Structures, Materials and Mechanisms centers on developing lightweight  structures, advance materials technologies, and low-temperature mechanisms for  enabling Exploration Vehicles and Lunar Surface Systems. 
Lightweight structures and  advanced materials have been identified as a critical need since the reduction  of structural mass translates directly to additional up and down mass  capability that would facilitate additional logistics capacity and increased  science return for all mission phases. The major technology drivers of the  lightweight structure technology development are to significantly enhance  structural systems by 1) lowering mass and/or improving efficient volume for  reduced launch costs, 2) improving performance to reduce risk and extend life,  and 3) improving manufacturing and processing to reduce costs.   The targeted application of the technology  is the Ares V launch vehicle, Lunar Lander, and Lunar Surface Systems such as  the crew habitats.
Low-temperature mechanism  technology is being developed for reliable and efficient operation of  mechanisms in lunar temperatures including operations in lunar shadows at -230°C  and sustained surface operations thru varying lunar temperatures of -230°C to  +120°C for lunar surface rovers, robotics, and mechanized operations. The  technology drivers of the low temperature mechanism technology development are  to significantly enhance operation of mechanized parts by 1) lowering the  operating temperature for life of the component and 2) improving mechanism  performance (torque output, actuation performance, lubrication state) at the  lunar environment conditions of cold and vacuum over the required life of the  mechanism.  The targeted application of  the technology is to provide for operation of motors and drive systems,  lubricated mechanisms, and actuators of lunar rovers and mobility systems, ISRU  machinery, robotic systems mechanisms, and surface operations machinery (i.e.,  cranes, deployment systems, airlocks) for lunar surface operations. 
This topic area is to enhance and  fill gaps in technology development programs in the Exploration Technology  Exploration Program Structures, Materials, and Mechanisms Project.  Areas of development included in the SMM  project include: low temperature drive system, motor, and gearbox system,  personal kit radiation shielding materials, low density parachute material  systems, expandable structural systems, Friction stir welded spun-domes, and  advance composite structures.

Exploration Systems,Topic X5 Lunar Operations,"This call for technology  development is in direct support of the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate  (ESMD) Technology Development Program. The purpose of this research is to  develop component level technologies to support the Constellation Program’s  human lunar return missions.  These  initial missions will be heavily engaged in construction methods, establishing  self-sustaining power generation, and producing life support consumables in situ  in order to establish continuous operational capability via Earth based and  lunar based assets.
The objective is to produce new  technology that will reduce lunar operations workloads associated with crew  extra-vehicular activities (EVA) and intra-vehicular activities (IVA), and  reduce the total mass-volume-power of equipment and materials required to  support both short and long duration Lunar stays. The proposals must focus on  component technologies to maximize the operations of exploration hardware  allowing for less expensive, more productive and less risky missions.  
Lunar operations are a stepping  stone toward higher exploration goals. This research focuses on technology  development for the critical functions that will secure an extended human  presence on the Lunar surface and ultimately enable surface exploration for the  advancement of scientific achievements. Surface exploration begins with short  duration missions to establish extensible functional capabilities.  Successive buildup missions establish a  continuous operational platform from which to conduct scientific research while  on the lunar surface.  Reducing risk and  ensuring mission success depends on the coordinated interaction of many  functional systems including life support, power, communication infrastructure,  and transportation.

Exploration Systems,Topic X6 Energy Generation and Storage,"
  This topic includes technology development for batteries,  fuel cells, regenerative fuel cells, and fission and isotopic power systems for  the Altair lunar lander and surface operations on the Moon and Mars.  Technologies developed must be infused into  these Constellation program elements: primary fuel cells for the Altair lunar  lander descent stage, secondary batteries for the Altair ascent stage,  secondary batteries for extravehicular activities (EVA) suits, and regenerative  fuel cells, fission and isotopic power systems on the Moon and Mars to power  habitats, in situ resource production, and mobility systems. Specific  technology goals and component needs are given in the sub-topics.  General mission priorities for energy storage  and generation include:

EVA suits require secondary batteries sufficient to   power all portable life support, communications, and electronics for an   8-hour mission with minimal volume. Battery operation required for six   months and 100 recharge cycles with a shelf life of at least two years.   Mission priorities include human-safe operation; 8-hr duration; high specific   energy; and high energy-density.
Secondary batteries for the Altair ascent stage   require nominally 10 recharge cycles with 1.7 kW nominal power and 2 kW   peak power, operating for 7 hours continuously.  Mission priorities include human-safe,   reliable operation and high energy-density in a 0 – 30°C and 0 – 1/6   gravity environment. 
The Altair descent stage requires a fuel cell with a   nominal power level of 3 kW with 5.5 kW peak, operating for 220 hours   continuously.  Mission priorities include human-safe reliable   operation; the ability to scavenge available fuel; and high   energy-density.
 Regenerative fuel cells, which combine a fuel cell with a water electrolyzer, have been baselined for lunar surface system operations. Mission priorities include reliable, long-duration maintenance-free operation; human-safe operation; high specific-energy; and high system efficiency in a 0 - 100°C, 1/6 gravity environment. 
 Architecture studies have identified nuclear power technology to effectively satisfy high power requirements for extended duration lunar surface missions. Nuclear power generation is especially attractive for missions with significant solar eclipse periods, including non-polar locations and inside lunar craters, as well as Mars outposts.

Reliable knowledge of  low-gravity cryogenic fluid management behavior is lacking and yet is critical  for Altair and Ares in the areas of storage, distribution, and low-gravity  propellant management. Additionally, Earth-based and lunar surface missions  will require success in storing and transferring liquid and gas commodities.  Some of the technology challenges are for long-term cryogenic propellant  storage and distribution; cryogenic fluid ground processing and fluid  conditioning; liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen liquefaction processes on the  lunar surface. Furthermore, specific technologies are required in valves,  regulators, instrumentation, modeling, mass gauging, cryocoolers, and passive  and active thermal control techniques.

Exploration Systems,Topic X8 Protection Systems,"The Thermal Protection System  (TPS) protects a spacecraft from the severe heating encountered during  hypersonic flight through a planetary atmosphere. In general, there are two  classes of TPS: reusable and ablative. Typically, reusable TPS applications are  limited to relatively mild entry environments like that of Space Shuttle. No  change in the mass or properties of the TPS material results from entry with a  significant amount of energy being re-radiated from the heated surface and the  remainder conducted into the TPS material. Typically, a surface coating with  high emissivity (to maximize the amount of energy re-radiated) and with low  surface catalycity (to minimize convective heating by suppressing surface  recombination of dissociated boundary layer species) is employed. The primary  insulation has low thermal conductivity to minimize the mass of material  required to insulate the primary structure. Ablative TPS materials, in  contrast, accommodate high heating rates and heat loads through phase change  and mass loss. All NASA planetary entry probes to date have used ablative TPS.  Most ablative TPS materials are reinforced composites employing organic resins  as binders. When heated, the resin pyrolyzes producing gaseous products that  are heated as they percolate toward the surface thus transferring some energy  from the solid to the gas. Additionally, the injection of the pyrolysis gases  into the boundary layer alters the boundary layer properties resulting in  reduced convective heating. However, the gases may undergo chemical reactions  with the boundary layer gases that could return heat to the surface.  Furthermore, chemical reactions between the surface material and boundary layer  species can result in consumption of the surface material leading to surface  recession. Those reactions can be endothermic (vaporization, sublimation) or  exothermic (oxidation) and will have an important impact on net energy to the  surface. Clearly, in comparison to reusable TPS materials, the interaction of ablative TPS materials with the surrounding gas environment is much more  complex as there are many more mechanisms to accommodate the entry heating.  NASA has successfully tackled the complexity of thermal protection systems for  numerous missions to inner and outer planets in our solar system in the past;  the knowledge gained has been invaluable but incomplete. Future missions will  be more demanding. Better performing ablative TPS than currently available is  needed to satisfy requirements of the most severe CEV missions, e.g., Mars  Landing with 8 km/s entry and Mars Sample Return with 12-15 km/s entry.","X8.01Detachable, Human-Rated, Ablative Environmentally Compliant TPS",X8.01,"Detachable, Human-Rated, Ablative Environmentally Compliant TPS"
Exploration Systems,Topic X9 Exploration Crew Health Capabilities,"Human space flight is associated with losses in muscle strength, bone mineral density and aerobic capacity. Crewmembers returning from the International Space Station (ISS) can lose as much as 10-20% of their strength in weight bearing and postural muscles. Likewise; bone mineral density is decreased at a rate of ~1% per month. Although aerobic capacity has not been formally measured in returning ISS crew, short duration Space Shuttle crewmembers have been shown to undergo a 22% reduction in VO2max in response to space flight. During future exploration missions such physiological decrements represent the potential for a significant loss of human performance which could lead to mission failure and/or a threat to crewmember health and safety. The ability to estimate the physical cost of exploration tasks, monitor crew health and fitness, and to provide effective hardware for exercise countermeasures use will be valuable in supporting safe and successful space exploration.

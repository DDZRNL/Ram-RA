,Focus Area 1 In-Space Propulsion Technologies,"NASA is interested in technologies for advanced in-space propulsion systems to reduce travel time, reduce acquisition costs, and reduce operational costs for exploration and science spacecraft.  The future will require demanding propulsive performance and flexibility for more ambitious missions requiring high duty cycles, more challenging environmental conditions, and extended operation.  This focus area seeks innovations for NASA propulsion systems in chemical, electric, and nuclear thermal propulsion systems related to human exploration, sample return missions to Mars, small bodies (like asteroids, comets, and Near-Earth Objects), outer planet moons, and Venus.  Propulsion technologies will focus on a number of mission applications included ascent, descent, orbit transfer, rendezvous, station keeping, and proximity operations.",S3.02Propulsion Systems for Robotic Science Missions; Z10.01Cryogenic Fluid Management; Z10.02Methane In-Space Propulsion; Z10.03Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP),S3.02; Z10.01; Z10.02; Z10.03,Propulsion Systems for Robotic Science Missions; Cryogenic Fluid Management; Methane In-Space Propulsion; Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP)
,Focus Area 2 Power Energy and Storage,"Power is a ubiquitous technology need across many NASA missions.  Within the SBIR Program, power is represented across a broad range of topics in human exploration, space science, space technology and aeronautics.  New technologies are needed to generate electrical power and/or store energy for future human and robotic space missions and to enable hybrid electric aircraft that could revolutionize air travel.  A key goal is to develop technologies that are multi-use and cross-cutting for a broad range of NASA mission applications. In aeronautics, power technologies are needed to supply large-scale electric power and efficiently distribute the power to aircraft propulsors. In the space power domain, mission applications include planetary surface power, large-scale spacecraft prime power, small-scale robotic probe power, and smallsat/cubesat power. Applicable technology options include photovoltaic arrays, radioisotope power systems, nuclear fission, thermal energy conversion, motor/generators, fuel cells, batteries, power management, transmission, distribution and control. An overarching objective is to mature technologies from analytical or experimental proof-of-concept (TRL3) to breadboard demonstration in a relevant environment (TRL5). Successful efforts will transition into NASA Projects where the SBIR deliverables will be incorporated into ground testbeds or flight demonstrations.","S3.01Power Generation and Conversion; S3.03Power Electronics and Management, and Energy Storage; Z1.01High Power, High Voltage Electronics; Z1.02Surface Energy Storage; Z1.03Surface Power Generation",S3.01; S3.03; Z1.01; Z1.02; Z1.03,"Power Generation and Conversion; Power Electronics and Management, and Energy Storage; High Power, High Voltage Electronics; Surface Energy Storage; Surface Power Generation"
,Focus Area 3 Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration,"The exploration of space requires the best of the nation's technical community to provide the technologies that will enable human exploration beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO): to visit asteroids, and to extend our reach to Mars. Autonomous Systems technologies provide the means of migrating mission control from Earth to spacecraft and habitats. This is enhancing for missions in the Earth-Lunar neighborhood and enabling for deep space missions. Long light-time delays, up to 42 minutes round-trip between Earth and Mars, require time-critical control decisions to be closed on-board autonomously through automation and astronaut-automation teaming rather than through round-trip communication to Earth mission control. Long-term crewed spacecraft and habitats, such as the International Space Station, are so complex that a significant portion of the crew's time is spent keeping it operational under even under nominal conditions in low-Earth orbit, while still requiring significant real-time support from Earth. The considerable challenge is to migrate the knowledge and capability embedded in current Earth mission control, with tens to hundreds of human specialists ready to provide instant knowledge, to on-board automation that teams with astronauts to autonomously manage spacecraft and habitats. The autonomous agent subtopic addresses this challenge by soliciting proposals that leverage the growing field of cognitive computing to advance technology for deep-space autonomy. The technology challenge for autonomous crewed systems in off-nominal conditions is even more critical. In the majority of Apollo lunar missions, Earth mission control was needed to resolve critical off-nominal situations ranging from unexplained computer alarms on Apollo 11 to the oxygen tank explosion on Apollo 13 that required executing an 87 hour free return abort trajectory around the moon and back to earth. Through creative use of Lunar Module assets, Apollo 13 had sufficient resiliency to keep the three astronauts alive despite loss of the oxygen tank and many of the capabilities of the service module. In contrast to a lunar mission, a free return abort trajectory around mars and back to earth is on the order of two years – requiring a leap in resiliency.  To prevent Loss of Mission (LOM) or Loss of Crew (LOC) in deep space missions, spacecraft and habitats will require long-term resiliency to handle failures that lead to loss of critical function or unexpected expenditure of consumables. Long communication delays or accidents that cause loss of communication will require that the initial failure response be handled autonomously. The subtopic on resilient autonomous systems solicits technology for the design and quantification of resiliency in long-duration missions. The subtopic on sustainable habitats solicits technology for long-term system health management that goes beyond short-term diagnosis technology to include advances machine learning and other prognostic technologies. Enhancing the capability of astronauts is also critical for future long-duration deep space missions. Augmented reality technology can guide astronauts in carrying out procedures through various sensory modalities. The augmented reality subtopic within the human research program topic area is very relevant to autonomous systems technologies, and proposers are encouraged to review that subtopic description.",H6.02Resilient Autonomous Systems; H6.03Spacecraft Autonomous Agent Cognitive Architectures for Human Exploration,H6.02; H6.03,Resilient Autonomous Systems; Spacecraft Autonomous Agent Cognitive Architectures for Human Exploration
,Focus Area 4 Robotic Systems for Space Exploration,"This focus area includes development of robotic systems technologies (hardware and software) to improve the exploration of space. Robots can perform tasks to assist and off-load work from astronauts. Robots may perform this work before, in support of, or after humans. Ground controllers and astronauts will remotely operate robots using a range of control modes, over multiple spatial ranges (shared-space, line of sight, in orbit, and interplanetary) and with a range of time-delay and communications bandwidth. Technology is needed for robotic systems to improve transport of crew, instruments, and payloads on planetary surfaces, on and around small bodies, and in-space. This includes hazard detection, sensing/perception, active suspension, grappling/anchoring, legged locomotion, robot navigation, end-effectors, propulsion, and user interfaces.In the coming decades, robotic systems will continue to change the way space is explored. Robots will be used in all mission phases: as independent explorers operating in environments too distant or hostile for humans, as precursor systems operating before crewed missions, as crew helpers working alongside and supporting humans, and as caretakers of assets left behind. As humans continue to work and live in space, they will increasingly rely on intelligent and versatile robots to perform mundane activities, freeing human and ground control teams to tend to more challenging tasks that call for human cognition and judgment.Innovative robot technologies provides a critical capability for space exploration. Multiple forms of mobility, manipulation and human-robot interaction offer great promise in exploring planetary bodies for science investigations and to support human missions. Enhancements and potentially new forms of robotic systems can be realized through advances in component technologies, such as actuation and structures (e.g. 3D printing). Mobility provides a critical capability for space exploration. Multiple forms of mobility offer great promise in exploring planetary bodies for science investigations and to support human missions. Manipulation provides a critical capability for positioning crew members and instruments in space and on planetary bodies, it allows for the handling of tools, interfaces, and materials not specifically designed for robots, and it provides a capability for drilling, extracting, handling and processing samples of multiple forms and scales. This increases the range of beneficial tasks robots can perform and allows for improved efficiency of operations across mission scenarios. Manipulation is important for human missions, human precursor missions, and unmanned science missions.  Sampling, sample handling, transport, and distribution to instruments, or instrument placement directly on in-place rock or regolith, is important for robotic missions to locales too distant or dangerous for human exploration.Future space missions may rely on co-located and distributed teams of humans and robots that have complementary capabilities. Tasks that are considered ""dull, dirty, or dangerous"" can be transferred to robots, thus relieving human crew members to perform more complex tasks or those requiring real-time modifications due to contingencies. Additionally, due to the limited number of astronauts anticipated to crew planetary exploration missions, as well as their constrained schedules, ground control will need to remotely supervise and assist robots using time-delayed and limited bandwidth communications.  Advanced methods of human-robot interaction over time delay will enable more productive robotic exploration of the more distant reaches of the solar system.  This includes improved visualization of alternative future states of the robot and the terrain, as well as intuitive means of communicating the intent of the human to the robotic system.","S4.02Robotic Mobility, Manipulation and Sampling; Z5.01Payload Technologies for Free-Flying Robots; Z5.02Robotic Systems - Mobility Subsystems",S4.02; Z5.01; Z5.02,"Robotic Mobility, Manipulation and Sampling; Payload Technologies for Free-Flying Robots; Robotic Systems - Mobility Subsystems"
,Focus Area 5 Communications and Navigation,"NASA seeks proposals to produce high impact developments in communications and navigation technologies to support future science and exploration missions.  Missions are generating ever-increasing data volumes that require increased performance from communications systems while minimizing the impacts to the spacecraft. Similarly, missions have a need for more precise guidance, navigation, and control to meet their mission objectives. This focus area supports development of technologies in RF and optical communications systems; cognitive systems for communications; and ground-based and onboard guidance, navigation and control systems that will provide a significant improvement over the current state of the art.","H9.01Long Range Optical Telecommunications; H9.02Intelligent Communication Systems; H9.03Flight Dynamics and Navigation Technology; H9.04Advanced RF Communications; H9.05Transformational/Over-the-Horizon Communications Technology; S3.04Guidance, Navigation and Control",H9.01; H9.02; H9.03; H9.04; H9.05; S3.04,"Long Range Optical Telecommunications; Intelligent Communication Systems; Flight Dynamics and Navigation Technology; Advanced RF Communications; Transformational/Over-the-Horizon Communications Technology; Guidance, Navigation and Control"
,Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,"This Focus Area seeks key capabilities and technologies in areas of Habitation Systems, Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS), Environmental Monitoring, Radiation Protection and Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Systems.For future crewed missions beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO) and into the solar system, regular resupply of consumables and emergency or quick-return options will not be feasible, and spacecraft will experience a more challenging radiation environment in deep space than in LEO. Technologies are of interest that enable long-duration, safe and sustainable deep-space human exploration with advanced extra-vehicular capability.Habitation systems encompass process technologies, equipment and monitoring functions necessary to provide and maintain a livable environment within the pressurized cabin of crewed spacecraft. Vehicle outfitting provides the equipment necessary for the crew to perform mission tasks as well as provide a comfortable and safe habitable volume.  Three of the largest logistics consumables in spacecraft include logistical packaging, clothing, and food.  Special emphasis is placed on developing technologies that will fill existing gaps, reduce requirements for consumables and other resources including mass, power, volume and crew time, and which will increase safety and reliability with respect to the state-of-the-art.  Environmental control and life support focus in this solicitation includes aspects of atmosphere revitalization and environmental monitoring for air, water and microbial contaminants.Advanced radiation shielding technologies are needed to protect humans from the hazards of space radiation. All space radiation environments in which humans may travel in the foreseeable future are considered, including the Moon, Mars, asteroids, geosynchronous orbit (GEO), and low Earth orbit (LEO). Radiation of interest includes galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), solar energetic particles (SEP), and secondary neutrons.  Computational tools for the evaluation of the transport of space radiation through highly complex vehicle architectures as represented in detailed computer-aided design (CAD) models are needed.  Processing and construction that utilize in situ resources for radiation shielding for habitation systems on Mars are of interest.Advanced Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) needs include innovative, robust, lightweight pressure structures for the hard upper torso of the spacesuit, oxygen-compatible gas flow meters for in-suit operation, and advanced sensors to measure space suit interactions with the human body.Please review each subtopic for specific details on content of interest within this solicitation.","H3.01Habitat Outfitting; H3.02Environmental Monitoring for Spacecraft Cabins; H3.03Environmental Control and Life Support; H3.04Logistics Reduction; H4.01Damage Tolerant Lightweight Pressure Structures; H4.02Small, Accurate Oxygen Compatible Gas Flow Meter for Suit Operations; H4.03Sensors to Measure Space Suit Interactions with the Human Body; H6.01Integrated System Health Management for Sustainable Habitats; H11.01Radiation Shielding Technologies for Human Protection",H3.01; H3.02; H3.03; H3.04; H4.01; H4.02; H4.03; H6.01; H11.01,"Habitat Outfitting; Environmental Monitoring for Spacecraft Cabins; Environmental Control and Life Support; Logistics Reduction; Damage Tolerant Lightweight Pressure Structures; Small, Accurate Oxygen Compatible Gas Flow Meter for Suit Operations; Sensors to Measure Space Suit Interactions with the Human Body; Integrated System Health Management for Sustainable Habitats; Radiation Shielding Technologies for Human Protection"
,Focus Area 7 Human Research and Health Maintenance,"NASA’s Human Research Program (HRP) investigates and mitigates the highest risks to astronaut health and performance in exploration missions. The goal of the HRP is to provide human health and performance countermeasures, knowledge, technologies, and tools to enable safe, reliable, and productive human space exploration, and to ensure safe and productive human spaceflight. The scope of these goals includes both the successful completion of exploration missions and the preservation of astronaut health over the life of the astronaut. HRP developed an Integrated Research Plan (IRP) to describe the requirements and notional approach to understanding and reducing the human health and performance risks. The IRP describes the Program’s research activities that are intended to address the needs of human space exploration and serve HRP customers. The IRP illustrates the program’s research plan through the timescale of early lunar missions of extended duration. The Human Research Roadmap (http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov) is a web-based version of the IRP that allows users to search HRP risks, gaps, and tasks.The HRP is organized into Program Elements:Human Health Countermeasures.Behavioral Health & Performance.Exploration Medical Capability.Space Human Factors and Habitability.Space Radiation and ISS Medical Projects.Each of the HRP Elements address a subset of the risks, with ISS Medical Projects responsible for the implementation of the research on various space and ground analog platforms.

,Focus Area 8 In-Situ Resource Utilization,"As terrestrial explorers and settlers learned to use local resources for provisions, shelter, and fuel to stay alive and prosper, so too must future human explorers learn to live off the land and use the resources found in space.  Known as In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), this approach to exploration involves any hardware or operation that harnesses and utilizes ‘in-situ’ resources (natural and discarded) to create products and services for robotic and human exploration. By using and converting local resources into products, less material needs to be launched from Earth. The ability to make life support consumables (oxygen, nitrogen, and water), propellants for ascent and space transportation vehicles, and fuel cell reactants for energy generation and storage have the biggest influence on launch mass, crew and mission risk, and cost in current human exploration mission plans. These products can be used to reduce Earth launch mass or lander mass by not bringing everything from Earth, reduce risks to the crew and/or mission by reducing logistics and providing increased self-sufficiency, and reduce costs by needing less launch vehicles to complete the mission and/or through the reuse of hardware and lander/space transportation vehicles. The ISRU Focus Area in this year’s solicitation will concentrate on how to acquire carbon dioxide and water from the Mars atmosphere and soil resources. Because understanding resource characteristics is extremely important to designing larger scale systems to extract and process these resources, the ISRU Focus Area will also emphasize the need for small payloads to perform this task on future lunar missions.Since ISRU can be performed wherever resources may exist, ISRU systems will need to operate in a variety of environments and gravities and need to consider a wide variety of potential resource physical and mineral characteristics. ISRU hardware for Mars missions must be desired to operate continuously (day and night) for very long durations (480 days), and to environments specified in the table below. Proposers will need to address design and operation implications for yearly and day/night changes in surface pressure and temperature in the table below.Mars EnvironmentMinMaxSurface Pressure~700 Pa (0.1 psi)~1000 Pa (0.14 psi)Up to 10% variation in day/night pressureSurface Temperature-153 °C (120 K) at poles~20 °C (293 K) at equatorUp to 100 K change in day/night temperatureWater content in hydrated soils1.5%10%Water content in icy soils10%90%","H1.01Mars Atmosphere Acquisition, Separation, and Conditioning for ISRU; H1.02Mars Soil Acquisition and Processing for In Situ Water; H2.01Lunar Resources",H1.01; H1.02; H2.01,"Mars Atmosphere Acquisition, Separation, and Conditioning for ISRU; Mars Soil Acquisition and Processing for In Situ Water; Lunar Resources"
,"Focus Area 9 Sensors, Detectors and Instruments","NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/) encompasses research in the areas of Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics and Planetary Science. The National Academy of Science has provided NASA with recently updated Decadal surveys that are useful to identify technologies that are of interest to the above science divisions. Those documents are available at the following locations:Astrophysics - http://sites.nationalacademies.org/bpa/BPA_049810(link is external).Planetary - http://sites.nationalacademies.org/ssb/completedprojects/ssb_065878(link is external).Earth Science - http://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/decadal-surveys/.Heliophysics the 2014 technology roadmap can be downloaded here: http://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/.A major objective of SMD instrument development programs is to implement science measurement capabilities with smaller or more affordable spacecraft so development programs can meet multiple mission needs and therefore make the best use of limited resources. The rapid development of small, low-cost remote sensing and in situ instruments is essential to achieving this objective. For Earth Science needs, in particular, the subtopics reflect a focus on instrument development for airborne and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms. Astrophysics has a critical need for sensitive detector arrays with imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetric capabilities, which can be demonstrated on ground, airborne, balloon, or suborbital rocket instruments. Heliophysics, which focuses on measurements of the sun and its interaction with the Earth and the other planets in the solar system, needs a significant reduction in the size, mass, power, and cost for instruments to fly on smaller spacecraft. Planetary Science has a critical need for miniaturized instruments with in situ sensors that can be deployed on surface landers, rovers, and airborne platforms. For the 2017 program year, we are restructuring the Sensors, Detectors and Instruments Topic, adding new, rotating out, splitting and retiring some of the subtopics. Please read each subtopic of interest carefully. There are two new subtopics for this year.  The first solicits development of in situ instrument technologies and components to advance the maturity of science instruments focused on the detection of evidence of life, especially extant of life, in the Ocean Worlds.  The second seeks instruments and component technologies that will enable unambiguous determination of whether extant life is present in target environments on other solar system bodies. The microwave technologies subtopic has been split this year into two subtopics one focused on active microwave remote sensing and the second on passive systems such as radiometers and microwave spectrometers.  A key objective of this SBIR topic is to develop and demonstrate instrument component and subsystem technologies that reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of SMD observing instruments and to enable new measurements. Proposals are sought for development of components, subsystems and systems that can be used in planned missions or a current technology program. Research should be conducted to demonstrate feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards a Phase II prototype demonstration. The following subtopics are concomitant with these objectives and are organized by technology.","S1.01Lidar Remote Sensing Technologies; S1.02Technologies for Active Microwave Remote Sensing; S1.03Technologies for Passive Microwave Remote Sensing; S1.04Sensor and Detector Technology for Visible, IR, Far IR and Submillimeter; S1.05Detector Technologies for UV, X-Ray, Gamma-Ray and Cosmic-Ray Instruments; S1.06Particles and Field Sensors and Instrument Enabling Technologies; S1.07In Situ Instruments/Technologies for Planetary Science; S1.08Surface & Sub-surface Measurement Systems; S1.09Cryogenic Systems for Sensors and Detectors; S1.10Atomic Interferometry; S1.11In Situ Instruments/Technologies for Ocean Worlds Life Detection; S1.12Sample Processing For Life Detection Investigations for Ocean Worlds; S4.06Sample Collection For Life Detection in Outer Solar System Ocean World Plumes",S1.01; S1.02; S1.03; S1.04; S1.05; S1.06; S1.07; S1.08; S1.09; S1.10; S1.11; S1.12; S4.06,"Lidar Remote Sensing Technologies; Technologies for Active Microwave Remote Sensing; Technologies for Passive Microwave Remote Sensing; Sensor and Detector Technology for Visible, IR, Far IR and Submillimeter; Detector Technologies for UV, X-Ray, Gamma-Ray and Cosmic-Ray Instruments; Particles and Field Sensors and Instrument Enabling Technologies; In Situ Instruments/Technologies for Planetary Science; Surface & Sub-surface Measurement Systems; Cryogenic Systems for Sensors and Detectors; Atomic Interferometry; In Situ Instruments/Technologies for Ocean Worlds Life Detection; Sample Processing For Life Detection Investigations for Ocean Worlds; Sample Collection For Life Detection in Outer Solar System Ocean World Plumes"
,Focus Area 10 Advanced Telescope Technologies,"The NASA Science Missions Directorate seeks technology for cost-effective high-performance advanced space telescopes for astrophysics and Earth science. Astrophysics applications require large aperture light-weight highly reflecting mirrors, deployable large structures and innovative metrology, control of unwanted radiation for high-contrast optics, precision formation flying for synthetic aperture telescopes, and cryogenic optics to enable far infrared telescopes. A few of the new astrophysics telescopes and their subsystems will require operation at cryogenic temperatures as cold a 4°K. This topic will consider technologies necessary to enable future telescopes and observatories collecting electromagnetic bands, ranging from UV to millimeter waves, and also include gravity waves. The subtopics will consider all technologies associated with the collection and combination of observable signals. Earth science requires modest apertures in the 2 to 4 meter size category that are cost effective. New technologies in innovative mirror materials, such as silicon, silicon carbide and nanolaminates, innovative structures, including nanotechnology, and wavefront sensing and control are needed to build telescopes for Earth science.","S2.01Proximity Glare Suppression for Astronomical Coronagraphy; S2.02Precision Deployable Optical Structures and Metrology; S2.03Advanced Optical Systems and Fabrication/Testing/Control Technologies for EUV/Optical and IR Telescope; S2.04X-Ray Mirror Systems Technology, Coating Technology for X-Ray-UV-OIR, and Free-Form Optics",S2.01; S2.02; S2.03; S2.04,"Proximity Glare Suppression for Astronomical Coronagraphy; Precision Deployable Optical Structures and Metrology; Advanced Optical Systems and Fabrication/Testing/Control Technologies for EUV/Optical and IR Telescope; X-Ray Mirror Systems Technology, Coating Technology for X-Ray-UV-OIR, and Free-Form Optics"
,Focus Area 11 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,"The Science Mission Directorate will carry out the scientific exploration of our Earth, the planets, moons, comets, and asteroids of our solar system and the universe beyond. SMD’s future direction will be moving away from exploratory missions (orbiters and flybys) into more detailed/specific exploration missions that are at or near the surface (landers, rovers, and sample returns) or at more optimal observation points in space. These future destinations will require new vantage points, or would need to integrate or distribute capabilities across multiple assets. Future destinations will also be more challenging to get to, have more extreme environmental conditions and challenges once the spacecraft gets there, and may be a challenge to get a spacecraft or data back from. A major objective of the NASA science spacecraft and platform subsystems development efforts are to enable science measurement capabilities using smaller and lower cost spacecraft to meet multiple mission requirements thus making the best use of our limited resources. To accomplish this objective, NASA is seeking innovations to significantly improve spacecraft and platform subsystem capabilities while reducing the mass and cost that would in turn enable increased scientific return for future NASA missions. A spacecraft bus is made up of many subsystems like: propulsion; thermal control; power and power distribution; attitude control; telemetry command and control; transmitters/antenna; computers/on-board processing/software; and structural elements. High performance space computing technologies are also included in this focus area.  Science platforms of interest could include unmanned aerial vehicles, sounding rockets, or balloons that carry scientific instruments/payloads, to planetary ascent vehicles or Earth return vehicles that bring samples back to Earth for analysis. This topic area addresses the future needs in many of these sub-system areas, as well as their application to specific spacecraft and platform needs.  For planetary missions, planetary protection requirements vary by planetary destination, and additional backward contamination requirements apply to hardware with the potential to return to Earth (e.g., as part of a sample return mission). Technologies intended for use at/around Mars, Europa (Jupiter), and Enceladus (Saturn) must be developed so as to ensure compliance with relevant planetary protection requirements. Constraints could include surface cleaning with alcohol or water, and/or sterilization treatments such as dry heat (approved specification in NPR 8020.12; exposure of hours at 115°C or higher, non-functioning); penetrating radiation (requirements not yet established); or vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide (specification pending).

,"Focus Area 12 Entry, Descent, and Landing Systems","The SBIR focus area of Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) includes the suite of technologies for atmospheric entry as well as descent and landing on both atmospheric and non-atmospheric bodies. EDL mission segments are used in both robotic planetary science missions and human exploration missions beyond Low Earth Orbit, and some technologies have application to commercial space capabilities. Robust, efficient, and predictable EDL systems fulfill the critical function of delivering payloads to planetary surfaces through challenging environments, within mass and cost constraints. Future NASA missions will require new technologies to break through historical constraints on delivered mass, or to go to entirely new planets and moons. Even where heritage systems exist, no two planetary missions are exactly “build-to-print,” so there are frequently issues of environmental uncertainty, risk posture, and resource constraints that can be dramatically improved with investments in EDL technologies. New capabilities and improved knowledge are both important facets of this focus area. Because this topic covers a wide area of interests, subtopics are chosen to enhance and or fill gaps in the existing technology development programs.  Future subtopics will support one or more of four broad capability areas, which represent NASA’s goals with respect to planetary Entry, Descent and Landing: High Mass to Mars Surface.Precision Landing and Hazard Avoidance.Planetary Probes and Earth Return Vehicles.EDL Data Return and Model Improvement. A cross-cutting set of disciplines and technologies will help mature these four capability areas, to enable more efficient, reliable exploration missions. These more specific topics and subtopics may include, but are not limited to: Thermal Protection System materials, modeling, and instrumentation.Deployable and inflatable decelerators (hypersonic and supersonic).Guidance, Navigation, and Control sensors and algorithms.Aerodynamics and Aerothermodynamics advances, including modeling and testing.Precision Landing and Hazard Avoidance sensors.Multifunctional materials and structures.

,Focus Area 13 Information Technologies for Science Data,"NASA Missions and Programs create a wealth of science data and information that are essential to understanding our earth, our solar system and the universe. Advancements in information technology will allow many people within and beyond the Agency to more effectively analyze and apply these data and information to create knowledge. For example, modeling and simulation are being used more pervasively throughout NASA, for both engineering and science pursuits, than ever before. These tools allow high fidelity simulations of systems in environments that are difficult or impossible to create on Earth, allow removal of humans from experiments in dangerous situations, provide visualizations of datasets that are extremely large and complicated, and aid in the design of systems and missions. In many of these situations, assimilation of real data into a highly sophisticated physics model is needed. Information technology is also being used to allow better access to science data, more effective and robust tools for analyzing and manipulating data, and better methods for collaboration between scientists or other interested parties. The desired end result is to see that NASA data and science information are used to generate the maximum possible impact to the nation: to advance scientific knowledge and technological capabilities, to inspire and motivate the nation's students and teachers, and to engage and educate the public.",S5.01Technologies for Large-Scale Numerical Simulation; S5.02Earth Science Applied Research and Decision Support; S5.03Enabling NASA Science through Large-Scale Data Processing and Analysis; S5.04Integrated Science Mission Modeling,S5.01; S5.02; S5.03; S5.04,Technologies for Large-Scale Numerical Simulation; Earth Science Applied Research and Decision Support; Enabling NASA Science through Large-Scale Data Processing and Analysis; Integrated Science Mission Modeling
,Focus Area 14 In-Space and Advanced Manufacturing,"NASA is seeking technological innovations that will accelerate development and adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies supporting a wide range of NASA Missions. NASA has an immediate need for more affordable and more capable materials and processes across its unique missions, systems, and platforms. Cutting-edge manufacturing technologies offer the ability to dramatically increase performance and reduce the cost of NASA’s programs. This topic is focused on technologies for both the ground-based advancements and in-space manufacturing capabilities required for sustainable, long-duration space missions to destinations such as Mars.The terrestrial subtopic areas concentration is on research and development of advanced metallic materials and processes and additive manufacturing technologies for their potential to increase the capability and affordability of engines, vehicles, space systems, instruments and science payloads by offering significant improvements over traditional manufacturing methods. Technologies should facilitate innovative physical manufacturing processes combined with the digital twin modeling and simulation approach that integrates modern design and manufacturing. The in-space manufacturing subtopic areas which focus on the ability to manufacture parts in space rather than launch them from Earth represents a fundamental paradigm shift in the orbital supply chain model for human spaceflight.  In-space manufacturing capabilities will decrease overall launch mass, while increasing crew safety and mission success by providing on-demand manufacturing capability to address known and unknown operational scenarios.  In addition, advances in lighter-weight metals processing (on ground and in-space) will enable the delivery of higher-mass payloads to Mars and beyond.

,Focus Area 16 Ground & Launch Processing,"Ground processing technology development prepares the agency to test, process and launch the next generation of rockets and spacecraft in support of NASA’s exploration objectives by developing the necessary ground systems, infrastructure and operational approaches.This focus area seeks innovative concepts and solutions for both addressing long-term ground processing and test complex operational challenges and driving down the cost of government and commercial access to space. Technology infusion and optimization of existing and future operational programs, while concurrently maintaining continued operations, are paramount for cost effectiveness, safety assurance, and supportability.A key aspect of NASA’s approach to long term sustainability and affordability is to make test, processing and launch infrastructure available to commercial and other government entities, thereby distributing the fixed cost burden among multiple users and reducing the cost of access to space for the United States. Unlike previous work focusing on a single kind of launch vehicle such as the Saturn V rocket or the Space Shuttle, NASA is preparing common infrastructure to support several different kinds of spacecraft and rockets that are in development. Products and systems devised at a NASA center could be used at other launch sites on earth and eventually on other planets or moons.",H10.01Advanced Propulsion Systems Ground Test Technology; H10.02Improved Operations via Interface Design; H10.03Cryogenic Purge Gas Recovery and Reclamation,H10.01; H10.02; H10.03,Advanced Propulsion Systems Ground Test Technology; Improved Operations via Interface Design; Cryogenic Purge Gas Recovery and Reclamation
,Focus Area 17 Thermal Management Systems,"All spacecraft, regardless of size or power consumption, must be able to manage the flow of heat and energy.

,Focus Area 21 Small Spacecraft Technologies,"NASA’s technology, science, exploration, and space operations organizations are identifying a growing number of potential applications for very small spacecraft. Such spacecraft can accomplish missions at a fraction of the cost of larger conventional spacecraft and can be developed quickly and more responsively. In some cases, their small size and ability to be delivered in relatively large numbers may enable mission applications not possible with larger satellites. A small spacecraft can also serve as a low-cost platform for spaceflight testing of new technologies that are appropriate for spacecraft of any size.Small spacecraft, for the purpose of this solicitation, are defined as those with a mass of 180 kilograms or less and capable of being launched into space as an auxiliary or secondary payload. Small spacecraft are not limited to Earth orbiting satellites but might also include interplanetary spacecraft, planetary re-entry vehicles, and landing craft.  Cubesats are a special category of small spacecraft and are of particular interest because launch opportunities tend to be more frequent and affordable compared to other small spacecraft, due to the standard sizes and containerization of cubesats.Specific innovations being sought in this solicitation will be outlined in the subtopic descriptions. Proposed research may focus on development of new technologies but there is particular interest in technologies that are approaching readiness for spaceflight testing.  NASA’s Small Spacecraft Technology Program will consider promising SBIR technologies for spaceflight demonstration missions and seek partnerships to accelerate spaceflight testing and commercial infusion.Some of the features that are desirable for small spacecraft technologies across all system areas are the following:Simple design.High reliability.Low cost or short time to develop.Low cost to procure flight hardware when technology is mature.Small system volume or low mass.Low power consumption in operation.Suitable for rideshare launch opportunities or storage in habitable volumes (minimum hazards).Tolerant of extreme thermal and/or radiation environments.Able to be stored in space for several years prior to use.High performance relative to existing system technology.The following references discuss some of NASA’s small spacecraft technology activities:www.nasa.gov/smallsats.

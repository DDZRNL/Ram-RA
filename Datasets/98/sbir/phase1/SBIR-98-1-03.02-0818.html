<BLOCKQUOTE>
During aircraft landing and takeoff, the propulsive (engine) noise associated with a modern jetliner is a major contributor to the overall radiated sound.  With the enforcement of stricter noise regulations at most airports, further reduction and suppression of the noise generated by the various engine components has become an issue of great importance.  In particular, tip-clearance vortex noise has received little attention, even though the tip-clearance vortex competes with the rotor wake as the major source of fan noise for incoming aircraft.  An effective approach for reducing tip-vortex noise is through application of a proven passive control technique to the rotor tip thereby altering the vortex initiation regime and reducing the intensity of the vortex roll-up process.  The approach is innovative in the extension of a viable passive control strategy to complex unsteady flows, specifically to turbulent flows near airfoil tips as encountered in rotor tip-clearance spacing.  The effort focuses on the reduction of tip-clearance noise of an engine fan and simulation of the modified tip-clearance-vortex flowfield.  The lowering of engine fan noise will help NASA to meet its noise reduction goals under the agency's strategic pillars for success.

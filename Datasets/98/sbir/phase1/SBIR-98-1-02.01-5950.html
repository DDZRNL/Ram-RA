<BLOCKQUOTE>
     The objectives of the Phase-I research address the development of mechanics-based structural integrity analysis methodologies for composite 
sandwich panels with cracks. The methodologies and models will be 
implemented in a finite element code with STAGS which represent fracture 
mechanics capability for predicting the crack turning, the direction of 
failure progression, and residual strength. Further the line integrals 
developed will remove the complicated and time-consuming task of remeshing 
or adjusting the mesh direction as the crack extends or kinks, thereby 
accurately evaluating the critical crack-tip parameters for crack growth 
direction. Using the established fracture criteria for crack initiation and 
propagation, the direction of crack growth and residual strength of 
sandwich panels can be evaluated. It aims at establishing novel modeling 
capability of assessing and optimizing the residual strength of flat and 
curved sandwich panels.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
     The analytical and computational development of anisotropic fracture mechanics-based models will be combined to greatly improve our predictive 
capability on the damage tolerance of composite panels. The integrated 
design tool will allow, for the first time, the composite structures to be 
designed for aircraft applications with confidence. Airframe designers will 
use this tool by varying major design parameters to produce an optimal 
structure which not only provides fail-safe capability but also would 
improve the performance with the new technologies.

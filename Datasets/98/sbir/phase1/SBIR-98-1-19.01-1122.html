<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Aerospace composites cured by electron beam(EB) are being considered for military and civilian aircraft structures because they offer significant 
processing and cost advantages over thermally cured materials.  Epoxy 
resins reinforced with carbon fibers cured in the EB using a cationic 
initiator show promise, but  additional improvements in fracture toughness, 
compression strength and impact resistance are required. Science Research 
Laboratory (SRL) has assembled a three-way collaboration to address these 
deficiencies by combining state of the art tougheners with custom synthesis 
of carbon fiber sizing materials to strengthen the interface.  SRL has 
developed novel portable and high power electron beam curing equipment and 
EB-curable resins with excellent processing and material properties.  The 
University of Delaware Center for Composite Materials(CCM) has been a 
leading laboratory in the improvement of the fiber/matrix interface.  
Adherent Technologies (AT) has developed reactive fiber sizings for 
heat-cured and EB-cured composites and has demonstrated interface 
improvements using these sizings. The Phase I Program will include 
development and testing of fiber sizings in combination with resin 
tougheners for the newest generation of EB-curable composites.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Electron Beam cured composites are being considered for military and commercial aircraft structural applications, for the RLV cryogenic tanks 
and for spoolable composite tubing in the oil and gas drilling industry.  
EB-cured composites have significant processing and cost advantages for 
these applications, but are limited by poor interface strength combined 
with suitable toughened resins.  The proposed work will increase toughened 
composite properties associated with interface strength (compression, 
interlaminar shear and impact strengths) to produce EB-cured composites 
that meet the engineering specifications for these applications.

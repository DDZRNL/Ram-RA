<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Composite structure encompassing carbon nanotubes and diamond has recently attracted attention due to the promising electronic and structural properties. Such a structure has not been realized experimentally so far and has been studied only by theoretical simulations, taking into account experimental data for individual components. Due to the electrical properties of nanotubes and negative electron affinity of the wide-band-gap diamond, it is expected that the diamond coated nanotubes could be an ideal material for highly efficient electron sources. Theoretical simulations have shown that the composite structure made of nanotubes and diamond matrix would be a high modulus, low density material, stable to shear and other distortions. Both structures might prove useful for applications in a variety of spacecraft systems and components.	In response to the NASA-SBIR 98 Program Solicitation, the MER Corporation, in collaboration with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, proposes this program to develop the experimental procedure for the formation of diamond/carbon nanotube structures.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 	At this moment, at the very beginning of the development of proposed diamond/carbon-nanotube composite structures, it could be anticipated that the diamond coated carbon nanotubes have a strong marketing potential in the domain of different electron field emitters and electron sources in electronic industry, for cathode ray tubes, flat panel displays, very large display boards, signalization equipment, etc. The composite structure based on carbon nanotubes and diamond matrix have application potential for small-size heavy load construction elements, scratch-resistant, impact resistant and projectile penetration resistant panels, multi-layered structures and coatings.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
L'Garde has made significant advances in developing inflatable/rigidizable space structures for space applications. These types of structures have considerable advantage over alternate types of systems in terms of cost, weight and stowed volume reduction. The capability of fabricating inflatable/rigidizable structural truss members and frames which are complex and comprised of several different joints was developed and perfected under IRSS I and II programs. Under the IRSS II program, many critical aspects of these structures, such as vacuum deployability, packageability, life, environmental testing (vibration and thermal), and strength were studied and demonstrated. The IRSS II truss was only 5-ft long and deployed successfully in the vacuum under a 1g force without using any control hardware. Deployment of longer systems, however, may involve some unpredictable motion, which must be avoided or minimized. The need and importance of controlled deployment was well demonstrated in the NASA/L'Garde IAE, flown on the Space Shuttle Endeavor (STS-77) in May 1996. Although the antenna deployed very successfully, the long 100-ft struts went through an uncertain course before full deployment. The capability to controllably deploy and rigidize inflatable/rigidizable truss structures has not yet been developed. This proposed program is designed to address this issue.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Development of Inflatable/Rigidizable truss structures which can be deployed in a controlled and predictable manner will be very useful for various aerospace applications, particularly, for large space structures. The use of inflatable and then rigidizable construction has been proved to have considerable aedvantage over alternate types of structures in terms of weight and packaging volume reduction. Addition of "controlling devices" to the deployment mechanism of inflatable/rigidizable structures makes this technology more valued and reliable. This will create additional business opportunity in many aerospace areas, such as inflatable/rigidizable solar array and concentrators, communications satellites (antennas) SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) and many other structural components on commercial spacecraft. Thus, L'Garde sees a substantial business potential, both for R&D, and resulting products for space use.

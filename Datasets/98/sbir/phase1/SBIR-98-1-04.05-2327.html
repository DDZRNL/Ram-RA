<BLOCKQUOTE>
Kestrel Corporation proposes a new technology that generates spatially distributed wavenumber resolution spectral signature fingerprints that allow rocket ignition deviations from nominal to be noted in time to abort a launch or prevent initiation of auxiliary functions. The concept uses the rocket’s exhaust as a source of performance and health data that has not previously been fully exploited.  In this Phase I SBIR, we will demonstrate that a new tech-nology called Ultra Spectral Imaging (USI) can be used as a sensor to observe the mid wave infrared (MWIR) to long wave infrared (LWIR) spectral and spatial time varying flow of a liquid rocket engine and that these data can be processed to create a non intrusive rocket health and performance monitoring system.
The proposed technique takes advantage of  the presence of a predictable time and spatially varying MWIR to LWIR molecular spectra associated with a rocket ignition process.  These data, created by the purges, film cooling flows, and fuel-oxidizer flows, have uniquely definable time dependent and spatially distributed spectral features. By using a spatially modulated Fourier transform USI, a spatial map of these signature can be created in real time for comparison to a predicted distribution.  Unique to this approach is the wave number spectral resolution available in a USI and the real time data processing required to rapidly assess the exhaust flow.

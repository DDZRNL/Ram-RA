<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Triton Systems, Inc. proposes to develop the materials and processess to fabricate a chopped fiber interface for wound fiber preforms that functionally grades teh coefficient of  thermal expansion to minimize thermally induced stress at reinforcement volume fraction discontinuities in cast metal matrix composites.  This development will enable the fabrication of engine exit nozzle actuators for the High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) program that are half the weight of titanium with identical or longer service life.  The innovation is a technique to inject chopper fiber into the tow during the winding of the last few layers so that the chopped fibers will orient in the Z-direction on the outboard side of the winding.  No binders are required and a graded high strength interface structure is produced.  This stress minimization at volume fraction discontinuities will enable actuator designs taht can accommodate continuously reinforced material in actuator designs is necessary to fabricate all of the complex structural features of high performance actuators without using expensive braiding techniques.  The proposed phase I program will pave the way for HSCT exit nozzle actuator fabrication in phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The proposed interface preform technology will enable the fabrication of high temperature, lightweight, affordable, actuators for the High Speed Civil Transport Program.  Other high temperature, weight sensitive applications include actuators for military aircraft such as the F-22 and JSF.  Commercial flight applications include lightweight actuators for flight control surfaces and exit nozzle actuators.  Additional applications included temperature and weight components in automative applications.

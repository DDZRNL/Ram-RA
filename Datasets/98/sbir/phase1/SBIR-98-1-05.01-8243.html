<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 A major barrier for the advancement of cockpit systems lies in the display technology.  Vision Micro Design, Inc. (VmD) proposes to favorably impact this cost through application of low cost projection LCD techniques. The innovation lies in manufacturing cost reductions and increased performance by utilizing high volume COTS displays and redundantly projecting them onto an easily modifiable projection screen. The result should be a cockpit display system usable by any PFD or MFD manufacturer.  VmD will design a ‘proof of concept’ projected LCD display unit in Phase I and evaluate the feasibility through cost analysis and performance by flight testing. The goal is to complete a functioning ‘proof of concept’ unit and analysis of cost v.s. performance report. VmD has market demand for this innovation. No such process exits today in the GA market.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Commercialization for the projected graphic display will include all applications which need a low cost color graphic display. The specific aviation markets include: Primary Flight Displays (PFD); Multifunction Displays (MFD); Navigational Moving Map Displays; Engine Monitoring and Advisory Displays. Avionics information and control displays; Aircraft situational monitoring displays. The display technology will be marketed to all manufacturers of equipment in need of this type of display on an OEM basis.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The purpose of the proposed research is to show that significant improvements in the performance of electrically tunable microwave devices can be obtained using a novel type of superlattice structures. The approach is based on recent work at Neocera showing that tunability can occur in superlattices consisting of materials which themselves are non-tunable or only weakly tunable and can be chosen from a class of materials with much lower microwave losses than tunable ferroelectrics.The proposed research will evaluate a large number of superlattices using a novel microwave characterization technique, and tunable filters based on an existing device design will be fabricated and tested using the most promising superlattices. 
Electrically tunable microwave devices offer considerable savings in weight, size, and ease of use over conventional, mechanical alternatives. Such devices based on novel superlattice materials will afford significant improvement in performance over previous electrically tunable microwave filters based on ferroelectrics and will therefore be of great importance in earth satellite rf communications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Neocera Inc. is positioning itself as an important player in the area of tunable microwave filters. The proposed research will give Neocera an invaluable advantage over competing technologies. Currently, Neocera is negotiating sales of microwave components to a Government customer, and it is anticipated that tunable filters will find widespread acceptance within the next 3-5 years. The main markets will be the areas of wireless (PCS and PCN) telecommunications and satellite communications.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
     This project will determine whether the practical operating range of the Li/CuCl2 rechargeable battery can be extended from the present 52.9 Whr/kg at -70 C to below -100 C.  The high specific energy, high power (e.g. 181 Whr/kg, 190 W/kg at 23 C), low self-discharge rate (0.8%/month) and excellent safety make inorganic electrolyte Li/CuCl2 cells particularly suited for planetary spacecraft and probes where ultra low temperature operation is required.  The Li/CuCl2 battery with present technology may also be attractive for NASA applications from +75 to -70 C for communications, tools, robotic devices and computers.     During Phase I, it is anticipated that by employing several innovations such as new electrolyte cosolvents with freezing points below -100 C, it will be demonstrated that the Li/CuCl2 battery can provide greater than 25 Whr/kg at -90 C at 0.20 mA/cm2 and can be charged at -90 C or below.  About 45% of the proposed project would consist of the construction and testing of Li/CuCl2 cells to characterize and improve the ultra-low temperature charging performance.  A preliminary design for practical 5 Ahr or larger Li/CuCl2 cells in hermetically welded metal cases will be prepared for a specific NASA application.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
     The results of the proposed project could have potential use for civilian commercial applications such as power for outdoor communications, tools, lighting equipment for farmers, sportsmen, police, construction and highway crews.   With a breakthrough in electrolyte cosolvents, Li/CuCl2 would be the battery of choice for cellular telephones, portable civilian electronics, laptop computers and hybrid electric vehicles.

To reduce risk, future NASA missions will concentrate on using lower-cost spacecraft and will use more of them.  Compared with current designs, such spacecraft will be less expensive, smaller, lighter, and easier to manufacture.  The use of such spacecraft will diversify risk, and will almost certainly assure scientists of obtaining useful data.  Much engineering work must be done to build such smaller spacecraft, as many systems and parts need to be redesigned to be smaller and lighter.  One very important subsystem that needs to be developed is a miniature ion engine.  Currently, the exact low-flow characteristics through an ion engine system are unknown.  Therefore, we propose to fabricate a small, robust, accurate, highly reliable mass flow meter using MEMS-based pressure, temperature, and shear stress sensors.  The combination of this flow information will give the user a great deal of latitude in dealing with whatever flow conditions exist, either in the ion engine, or in other generic low-flow applications.  In fact, the development of this technology could lead to the development of ultra small mass flow meters or mass flow controllers for use by commercial entities ranging from semiconductor equipment manufacturers to automotive companies.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
United Micromachines has determined that there exists a great commercial need for MEMS based flow sensors.  There exists a definite need for mass flow meters and mass flow controllers capable of operating in the low-flow regime. 
· Semiconductor processing equipment often requires very precise control of low flows of gases.  As one example, Tylan has expressed interest in a MEMS-based mass flow controller.
· Modern automotive engines require feedback of gas flow information in order to run more efficiently and emit less exhaust.  Key components in such systems are precise, robust, low cost mass flow meters and controllers.
· Schlumberger, the world's second largest oil field services company, has expressed a very serious interest in buying low flow mass flow controllers capable of being used in harsh environments.

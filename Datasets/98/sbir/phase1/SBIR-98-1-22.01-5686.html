<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The Thermionic Thermal Detector (TTD) uses a thermally isolated Schottky diode as the sensing element.In reverse bias, the thermionic emission current is exponentially dependent on temperature and exhibits a high temperature coefficient. Test detectors demonstrate electrical characteristics that correspond to a noise equivalent temperature difference of 6 mK which is 5 times more sensitive than comparable VOx resistive bolometers. In addition, the TTD exhibits low 1/f noise and high uniformity; these features allow use of an integrating mode readout rather then the more standard pulse biased sampling schemes used for VOx bolometers. Development efforts are already underway to integrate the TTD with an existing VOx bolometer readout using thin film transfered techniques. The TTD bias voltage and charge capacity requirements are similar to long wave infrared (LWIR) photovoltaic detectors. In Phase I we will demonstrate TTD imaging using a 128x128 array readout using thermionic charge integration rather than the standard pulse biased sampling. A single Indium bump per detector will be used to interconnect the TTD array to the readout.

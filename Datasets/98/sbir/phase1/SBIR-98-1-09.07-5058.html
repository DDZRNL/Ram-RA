<BLOCKQUOTE>
In Phase I Aspen System proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of improving the insulating properties of polyimide foams by preparing microcellular, polyimide aerogels.  Conventional polyimide foams (millimeter cell sizes) have been used as insulating material for cyrogenic fuel tanks and shown to have a low thermal conductivity, are fire resistant, produce non-toxic degradation products, and are thermally stable at hypersonic flight environments.  Aerogels are a special class of open pore microcellular foams derived from the supercritical drying of inorganic or organic gels.  These materials are characterized by an extremely low density, ultrafine pore size, continuous porosity, high surface area, and a microstructure composed of interconnected colloidal-like particles or polymeric chains.  One of the most promising applications for aerogels is their use as thermal insulation.  The large thermal resistance of aerogels is attributed to the small cell size and high porosity of the cellular network, which consequently has a very small thermal conductivity.  In Phase II the  polyimides will be optimized to produce a robust aerogel material that can be used as a cryogenic insulation on reusable launch vehicles.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The successful completion of this project will identify polymeric materials that will be excellent insulation materials for cryogenic and high temperature applications.  The materials will be mechanically robust, lightweight, and have applications for use in reusable launch vehicles, as well as many other applications where polyimide foam insulation is currently used.

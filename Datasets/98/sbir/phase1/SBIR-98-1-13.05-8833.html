<BLOCKQUOTE>
This proposal is to develop a multi-Mega-pixel camera-on-a-chip usingstandard 0.3-micron complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) 
technology to process the chip on an 8-inch wafer. The camera-on-a-chip is 
a multi-Mega-pixel active-pixel array containing substantially more on-chip 
processing electronics then the current charge-coupled-device (CCD) arrays, 
aimed at high-resolution imaging applications. The proposed 
camera-on-a-chip contains the following on-chip signal processing 
electronics using standard CMOS cells for implementation: a 2,000 x 1,300 
array of photogates for imaging, a floating diffusion for temporary storage 
of photo-charges, an antiblooming circuit for reducing cross-talk at high 
illumination, vertical and horizontal decoders with clock generators for 
random-access readout, a correlated-double-sampler circuit for noise 
reduction, an input circuit for integration time control and an A/D 
converter for on-chip digitization. Phase 1 will identify current 
limitations and capabilities of on-chip circuits in current CMOS arrays and 
design a camera-on-a-chip with more signal processing circuits, including 
an A/D converter. Phase 2 will fabricate and test the multi-Mega-pixel 
camera-on-a-chip. Phase 3 will productize the camera as a sellable product 
to commercial customers.

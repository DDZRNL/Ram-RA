<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a multi-perspective 360 degree look-around integral 3-D projection display that will enable air traffic control crews to view and analyze all aircraft activity in the airspace simultaneously, without wearing special 3-D glasses.  The proposed integral 3-D display will be automultiscopic:  a series of narrow view perspective images of a 3-D scene or object are optically projected in a high-speed sequence, through the use of a ferroelectric liquid crystal spatial light modulator (FLC SLM), onto a spinning holographic optical disk.  This display will be in the form of a tabletop workbench, and will present multiple viewers around it with integrated 3-D images as seen from their own perspectives, overcoming the shortcomings of conventional stereoscopic 3-D displays.  In Phase I, POC will design a laboratory prototype and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method by integrating our high-speed FLC SLM with a holographic optical disk fabricated for the demonstration.  When fully developed, the proposed multi-observer viewable integral 3-D display will be able to show distortion free, high resolution, full color, gray scale 3-D images suitable for many NASA applications.

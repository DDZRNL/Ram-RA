<BLOCKQUOTE>
This SBIR project will develop a low cost and small size flight control and navigation system with applications to autonomous spacecraft. This system will combine our existing fully-coupled GPS/IMU and advanced flight control techniques. The system contains two main subsystems: a flight control subsystem and a GPS/IMU navigation subsystem. The flight control system will provide good dynamic stability, and achieve the desired spacecraft dynamic handling characteristics. It will insure the required flying qualities, and improve spacecraft performance to perform its flight mission. The GPS/IMU navigation system will provide accurate position data, as well as altitude, ground speed, time, and wind vector information. The unique solution of the combined flight control and GPS/IMU navigation systems will provide enhanced flight control and navigation qualities. In the Phase I project, the feasibility, as well as functions, specifications, hardware architecture, and software requirements of the system will be investigated and conducted. Through modeling the spacecraft and analyzing its flight characteristics, the design of an intelligent autopilot, which integrates nonlinear control, robust control, and intelligent control, will be emphasized. A software toolkit will also be developed for the design, analysis, and simulation of intelligent flight control systems.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The flight control and navigation system to be developed in this project will be commercialized as a Universal Vehicle Navigation and Control device. This commercial product has wide potential applications to autonomous ground vehicles, underwater vehicles, unmanned air vehicles (UAV), and low orbit space vehicles.

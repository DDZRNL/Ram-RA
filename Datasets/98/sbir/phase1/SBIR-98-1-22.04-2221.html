<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sunpower proposes to investigate the feasibility of single-stage and two-stage inertance tube cryocoolers based on recent advances in pulse-tube and linear compressor technologies.  If feasible, these new inertance tube cryocoolers would satisfy the long-life, high reliability, low mass, low cost, and high efficiency requirements of NASA SBIR Subtopic 22.04 (Cryogenic Support Systems) for cryocoolers in the range of 0.1 - 10 W of cooling at temperatures of 7 - 120 K.  In replacing the orifice of a single-orifice pulse tube cryocooler, an inertance tube exploits the pressure drop of a long narrow tube to achieve necessary phase relationships without the debilitating flow circulation effects of a second orifice.  The gas bearings and compliant suspension of Sunpower's advanced linear compressors contribute a unique combination of long life, high reliability, and low cost to Sunpower's Model M77 Stirling cryocoolers. This project will employ Sage software (Gedeon Associates) to model pulse tube cryocoolers with inertance tubes and Sunpower's linear compressors and to compare their performance to Sunpower's M77 Stirling cryocoolers.  Based on these models, mechanical layout drawings and electronic controls for a single stage and a two-stage inertance tube cryocooler will be designed for development in Phase II and commercial sales in Phase III.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Applications for small, low mass, highly reliable, efficient, low cost cryocoolers include medical, imaging, infra-red, communications and computing applications, as well as space missions.  New medical applications are emerging in the freezing of tissue for the treatment of heart disease, endometriosis, cancer, and other conditions.  The US military requires thousands of cryocooled focal plane arrays by the year 2010, and other military communications applications include encryption and COMSEC equipment. Markets are also growing for infra-red cameras, warning receivers, industrial testing equipment, and environmental services.  In addition, high temperature superconducting filters are forecast in advanced telephone systems, and chilled CMOS circuits in the most high performance computer workstations are expected to require thousands of cryocoolers annually.  Such commercial applications open the opportunity for NASA's space systems to benefit from cost reductions due to the amortization of development costs over high volume production rates.  Through rapid innovations in inertance tubes and linear compressors, Sunpower intends to lead the commercialization of small, low mass, highly reliable, efficient, low cost cryocoolers for these applications.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The goal of this  SBIR is to develop ultralightweight, stable, large aperture optics that are suitable for submillimeter, infrared, visible, and LIDAR instruments.  Phase I will demonstrate the application of a polymeric vapor deposition onto a graphite reinforced composite membrane to create a specular surface and mask fiber print-through. Recent vapor deposition of polymers (acrylate monomers) has successfully leveled  micro-roughened surfaces of polymer film. If successful, this fabrication approach could significantly reduce the  cost, delivery time, and weight of larger aperture mirrors for programs such as WIND LIDAR, NGST, and  FIRST.

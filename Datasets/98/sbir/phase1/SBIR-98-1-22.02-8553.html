<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Avyd Devices proposes proposes to develop a technology which entails minimization of the concentration of traps and inclusions in Cd1-X ZnX Te crystals and maximization of the hole carrier lifetime via post-growth processing of Cd1-X ZnX Te wafers under well defined thermodynamic conditions, and then to incorporate these conditions in the crystal growth of bulk Cd1-X ZnX Te ingots in both the high-pressure Bridgman and the classical non-high pressure vertical and horizontal Bridgman processes.
In phase I we plan to demonstrate and deliver to NASA  single element and linear arrays of gamma ray  detectors with very high performance fabricated in material modified by the annealing process.

At the end of the Phase II  effort, we  plan to  deliver large ingots of CdZnTe with state-of-the art resistivity and carrier lifetime characteristics.  Also, at the end of the Phase II  effort, we plan to deliver to NASA , well characterized gamma ray detectors in 256 x 256 array formats, exhibiting state-of-the art in detector performance.

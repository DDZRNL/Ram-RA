<BLOCKQUOTE>
A new optical fiber sensor technology for high-temperature strain measurement is proposed. This technology is based on a sensor consisting 
of Bragg gratings etched into silica channel waveguides. The transduction 
mechanism for this sensor follows the concept of in-fiber Bragg grating 
sensors, but with two-fold enhancement in thermal stability and operating 
temperature range. Using this technology, sensors capable of operating up 
to 1100°C and 2300°C can be produced when fabricated in silica and 
sapphire, respectively. The fabrication procedures for Bragg gratings are 
controllable, and show promise for cost effective mass production. The 
production technology of microelectronics industry is directly adaptable 
for fabricating the proposed sensors. During the Phase I feasibility study 
we will: 1) devise a high temperature sensor fabrication process, 2) 
develop high-temperature optical fiber to channel waveguide interconnect 
technology, 3) fabricate proof-of-concept high-temperature sensors in 
amorphous silica, 4) establish sensor bonding procedures, and 5) 
demonstrate high-temperature strain measurement capability at temperatures 
up to 1100°C. The Phase II effort will concentrate on resolving several 
challenging issues inherent to high temperature sensors and in building a 
prototype system. In phase III we will commercialize this sensor 
technology.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The broadest anticipated market for the proposed innovation is in the development of advanced aeropropulsion systems such as the X-33, X-34, RLV, 
NASP, and other hypervelocity vehicles where high temperature strain 
measurement in composite materials is critical for health monitoring and 
feedback control are critical. This technology will also benefit the study 
of constitutive properties of new high-temperature composite materials.

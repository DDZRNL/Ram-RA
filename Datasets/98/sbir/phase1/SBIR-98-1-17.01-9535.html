<BLOCKQUOTE>
We propose a new configuration for a 1.3-&#61549;m single-frequency, diode-pumped solid state laser in which the gain element is a birefringent crystal within a linear resonator. In Phase I, the proposed configuration would be adapted to the 1.3-&#61549;m transition in Nd:Vanadate to produce a suitable source for precision laser metrology at a wavelength where silicon photodetectors are insensitive.  Dispersion introduced by the crystal restricts oscillation to a single longitudinal mode while precession of the polarization state reduces spatial hole burning. The latter effect improves both the efficiency of operation and the robustness of the line-selection mechanism.  This will be the first demonstration of this effect in a laser host other than YLF, and at this wavelength.  In terms of long-term frequency stability, external-resonator geometries have advantages compared to monolithic structures because of a superior tolerance to fluctuations in pump power and ambient conditions, and may be operable without the need for external reference sources.  This is a significant advantage in space-based metrology applications.  The longer wavelength prevents scattered light from the metrology laser from contaminating the sensitive CCD-detectors in long base-line optical telescopes. . The Phase I program is expected to yield a preliminary design for an integrated source.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Commercial applications include coherent systems for precision metrology, precision interferometry, holography, and remote sensing. Monitoring of wind fields is a particularly important example of coherent remote sensing. The proposed source would also be used as a master oscillator for injection seeding in LIDAR systems and general scientific applications.

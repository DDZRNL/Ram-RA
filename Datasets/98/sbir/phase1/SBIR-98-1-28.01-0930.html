<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The proposed instrument will assist in the simultaneous chemical and mineralogic analysis of microsamples of soil, rocks and minerals by x-ray fluorescence and x-ray diffraction. The innovations include a compact, low-average power, high-peak power, microfocus x-ray source (tube) that uses a pulsed field emitter cathode (no thermionic emission) to produce a bright, x-ray microspot on the sample and an electronic array detector that records the diffracted x rays and the fluorescent x rays that are back scattered from the sample. The instrument's configuration allows flexibility in sample preparation-large samples as well as microsamples can be used without special preparation.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Aligning the fibers in the exact direction of load  will enable large wheels with more and versatility than the current cut-and-sewn wheel-tire approach.  Like a bicycle wheel, where the spokes are  radially oriented (laced) with respect to the axial, Federal Fabrics-Fibers (FFF) proposes to develop a net shape three dimensional  (NS3D) inflated wheel with the fibers oriented radially with respect to the driving axial. Such a wheel will enable a much wider range of inflation pressures, while reducing the weight, cost, and bulk of the wheel compared to a conventional cut and sewn roving wheel. Figure 1 is an schematic representation of a 36" diameter NS3D woven wheel with an axial interface, showing clearly the radial fiber arrangement

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 High performance tires from bicycle , racing cars to off road tractors will greatly benefit from reduce weight and bulk, which will result in lower rolling resistance leading to major fuel saving and cleaner environment.

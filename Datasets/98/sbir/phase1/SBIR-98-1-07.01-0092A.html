<BLOCKQUOTE>
The main motivation for a reconfigurable collision avoidance system is greater survivability, possible if the feedback system can reorganize itself in the presence of obstacles, actuator failures and surface damages.  This project develops an autonomous integrated reconfigurable collision avoidance system to enhance the reliability, availability and durability for high altitude aircraft.  The innovations of the project include: (1) development of fuzzy reconfigurable flight controllers; (2) development of a neural network based adaptive controller for performing self-optimization, on-line adaptation, and autonomous obstacle detection, fault detection and controller reconfiguration; (3) development of intelligent health monitoring techniques for aircraft, based on the integration of fuzzy neural work techniques with State Chi-Square Test (SCST) failure detection approaches; (4) development of an advanced decision aid system for collision avoidance; and (5) testing, demonstration and evaluation of the performance of the integrated intelligent health monitoring and reconfigurable flight control system via a nonlinear 6DOF aircraft simulation software environment. The deliverable of Phase I is a commercial product, Autonomous Integrated Reconfigurable Collision Avoidance System, which is a significant technological breakthrough with enormous commercial value.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This project will lead to autonomous integrated reconfigurable collision avoidance techniques which can significantly enhance the reliability, availability and durability of high altitude aircraft systems as well as other civil/military dynamic systems.  The developed software can design high-performance reconfigurable control systems for autonomous vehicles, aircraft, spacecraft, mechanical systems, etc.

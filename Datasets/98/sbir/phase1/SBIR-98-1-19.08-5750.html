<BLOCKQUOTE>
The goal of this research is to demonstrate the suitability of using new high temperature (high-Tc) SQUIDs for quantitative nondestructive evaluation (NDE) on aerostructures and to address the key issues impeding the acceptance of this technology.  There is an ever-increasing military and civilian need for more sensitive, more reliable, and easier-to-use instruments and techniques for NDE.  Both the military and civilian aircraft fleets are becoming older, are subject to repeated end-of-life extensions, and at their increased age are found to be subject to failure modes not considered during their original design and construction.  Of particular importance are sub-surface failures occurring in the second and third layers of wings and fuselages of aging aircraft.  Fatigue fractures in difficult-to-access main spars and landing gear support structures can also lead to catastrophic failure of aircraft.  The need is particularly high in critical areas such as the detection of second layer cracks in lap joints, where existing techniques have severe fundamental limitations.  Ultra-sensitive magnetic sensor technology based on high-Tc superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) offers the capability to identify, localize, and quantify sub-surface cracks, flaws, and corrosion damage.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The potential commercial applications include the development of a new NDE instrument capable of detecting small subsurface flaws in aircraft structures.  The commercial NDE market is approximately 512 million dollars per year in the U.S. alone.  Major inspection areas include aging aircraft as a significant portion of both civilian and military aircraft will exceed their design lifetime over next five years.

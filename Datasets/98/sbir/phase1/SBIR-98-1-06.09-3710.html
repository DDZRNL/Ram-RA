<BLOCKQUOTE>
A new method of manufacturing ceramic aeronautical models is proposed that promises to shorten the fabrication time from the current 2 - 3 weeks, down to 2 - 5 days.  In addition, the process will enable signficant advances in aerothermodynamic testing including models with embedded sensors and adjustable aerogeometry.  The process is based on stereolithography, a freeform fabrication approach that is widely used and recognized as providing high accuracy, excellent surface finish and fast build speeds.  The innovation is the development of photocurable ceramic slips that are compatible with commercial stereolithography machines.  The photocurable slips enable stereolithographic fabrication of green state ceramic models, which can subsequently be debound and sintered - directly analogous to the drying and sintering steps used in the current slip casting approach to ceramic model fabrication.  In addition to these benefits, the Phase I effort will explore the feasibility of using alternative ceramic materials that impart higher strength and toughness for more durable ceramic models than the current silica material.

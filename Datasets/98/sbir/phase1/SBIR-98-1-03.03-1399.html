<BLOCKQUOTE>
This proposal explores a variation of the Laser Induced Incandescence (LII) technique, and its integration with a multi-wavelength laser scattering/extinction technique, for measuring the soot concentration, soot primary size, and soot size distribution in the exhaust of aircraft engines with high temporal and spatial resolution. Recent research results show that the decay characteristics of the LII signal in the post-evaporative region could be used as a sensitive measure of the primary particle size. We seek elegant means of analyzing the LII signal. Furthermore, the novelty of our proposed research is that it seeks to combine the capabilities of LII with that of multi-wavelength extinction and scattering techniques to yield an integrated instrument that could be used for measuring soot concentration, size, and size distribution.  The rationale is that the additional pieces of information provided by LII (namely, soot concentration and primary particle size)  could be used to offset the one major limitation of laser based multi-wavelength scattering and extinction technique, namely the ambiguity of the refractive index. This proposal is a direct response to the NASA Subtopic 3.03 which calls for new instrumentation  techniques for measuring engine emissions including size and size distributions of aerosols and particulates.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The potential for  a measurement instrument of this kind is quite large and includes particulate emission measurement from Diesel engines, gasoline injection engines, gas turbine, and industrial burner related applications. In addition, there is the potential of using this instrument for monitoring and enforcing strict environmental laws.

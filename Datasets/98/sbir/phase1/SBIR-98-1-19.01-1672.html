<BLOCKQUOTE>
Advanced ceramics Hafnium Carbide can enable components for both oxygen-rich and high-temperature applications.  However, HfC and related refractory materials are difficult to produce and even more difficult to process into useful shapes.  Nanomaterials Research Corporation (NRC) proposes to develop a cost-effective process to produce ultrafine powders of HfC and related refractory materials.  The effort will not only help launch a U.S. based commercial source of these advanced materials, the nanoscale form of these powders will also enable rapid processing of these advanced materials into useful shapes.  Phase I would establish the proof-of-concept by producing HfC nanostructured powders and processing them.  Phase II will optimize the proposed technology, bulk produce refractory powders, develop and test prototypes with lead customers.  Phase III will commercialize the technology.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Proposed research would provide NASA will a reliable technology and source for advanced materials for both oxygen-rich and high-temperature applications.  Potential spin-off applications include enabling materials for uncooled nozzles, lines/ducts, refractory insulation, tool bits for ultra-fast cutting, and hypersonic aircraft.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	The proposed program addresses advanced electrocatalysis for the direct conversion of carbon dioxide into separated methane and oxygen under ambient temperature conditions.  This technology will have application in an advanced life support system for carbon dioxide atmospheric control in manned spacecraft.  This will be performed by adapting a unique cathode electrocatalysis strategy identified at Eltron for selectivity promoting the subject reaction.  Once fully developed , the proposed technical strategy will replace both the Sabatier reaction and subsequent water electrocatalysis steps currently used for spacecraft atmospheric carbon dioxide control.  This approach will be simpler, more efficient and less expensive than the current strategy.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Optimization and characterization of this proposed electrochemical technology will lead to the high rate and efficient conversion of carbon dioxide to methane as a key component in spacecraft atmospheric control systems.  The overall technology will also have technical commercial applications for the direct conversion of carbon dioxide to useful fuels and chemicals.

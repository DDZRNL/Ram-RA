<BLOCKQUOTE>
Using a proprietary graded porous net shape sapphire fabrication process, Foster-Miller will prove the feasibility of producing a compact furnace 
with an integrated sample containment system to allow fast, inexpensive 
microgravity experiments. A working demonstration furnace with a thermal 
shock resistant structure, built-in heating elements and suitable 
electrical connections will be fabricated and tested in Phase I.  In 
comparison to the current state of the art furnace that requires 4000 watts 
of input power, the Phase I furnace will require only 60 watts to reach 
temperatures up to 2000K.  It will have sufficient thermal shock resistance 
capability to reach 2000K in less than 30 seconds and will be reusable. Our 
innovative processing approach also eliminates temperature limiting braze 
joints, and flammability risk at operating temperature.

In the Phase I program, Foster-Miller will build a working prototype, and 
characterize the furnace for temperature, thermal cycling and thermal shock  
capability.  Foster-Miller has assembled a team consisting of an, end-user 
and suppliers.  The Phase I program is targeted to a specific NASA furnace 
application.  This furnace technology can also be of direct use for the 
microgravity processing programs at NASA MSFC and LeRC.

The Phase I proposal also presents a team, strategy and commitments to 
develop a pervasive commercial application based on this technology.   The 
follow-on Phase II program will refine Phase I technology, demonstrate 
repeatability, consistency and reliability, and conduct cost/benefits and 
producibility analyses.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The porous sapphire technology provides a refractory, thermal shock resistant and lightweight structural and electrically insulative material.  
Commercial applications for this technology exist in efficient lighting 
products for industrial/residential applications, ignitors for gas/oil 
fired industrial/residential furnaces and appliances, and functionally 
gradient tab materials used for joining of dissimilar refractory materials.  
Foster-Miller has assembled a Phase I team to develop superior lighting 
products using this technology.

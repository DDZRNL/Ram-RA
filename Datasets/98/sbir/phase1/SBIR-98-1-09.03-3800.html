<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The objective of this project is to develop and demonstrate a noninvasive, in-vivo, extravascular bubble detector and sizing instrument.  Bubbles in tissue are thought to be the precursors of DCS and that if the number of extravascular bubbles can be reduced by a certain operational regimen, the incidence of DCS can be reduced and other operational constraints relaxed.  This is particularly important to NASA where astronauts are currently required to prebreathe on oxygen for four hours prior to entering the space suit environment.  An improved understanding of DCS and how to safely minimize prebreathe time could greatly improve EVA efficiency.
The proposed instrument development will build upon our past successful demonstration of a noninvasive, in-vivo intravascular bubble sizing instrument.  The bubble size diameter of interest in the case of extravascular bubbles is 1 to 30 micron, and in the case of intravascular bubbles, 30 to 200 microns.  This is a significant difference, and the design of the instrument will be optimized accordingly.

In the Phase I project, we will optimize the instrument design, develop an in-vitro tissue phantom, and perform preliminary in-vitro testing.  Phase II will focus on further optimization of the instrument and involve in-vivo testing on an animal model.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The significant commercial potential of this work is indicated by applications in the areas of monitoring of bubbles and emboli in DCS and embolism research and therapy.  An improved understanding of DCS has significant cost, efficiency, and safety implications for NASA; recreational, commercial, and military diving; and military aviators.  Creare plans to fully realize the commercial potential of this project through:  (1) direct marketing of research bubble detection and sizing instruments to biomedical laboratories, (2) licensing of instrument designs for the clinical embolism and DCS monitoring market, and (3) licensing of proprietary instrument designs for clinical minimally invasive manometry markets.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 		A new design approach is proposed for partial communication liquid acquisition devices (LADs) with window screens for cryogenic applications. These "start-basket" devices differ from total communication devices in that liquid is retained in an auxiliary reservoir to make up for evaporation and liquid usage while the device is not in contact with liquid in the tank. Previous attempts to demonstrate start-basket LADs with cryogens were unsuccessful because critical design criteria had been neglected.  Preliminary work has identified additional criteria, which will be developed further and used to design, fabricate, and demonstrate a new start-basket LAD design capable of working with cryogens.  Phase I will demonstrate the concepts in 1-g, using high vapor pressure ambient fluids to simulate cryogens.  Phase II will demonstrate a device with cryogens in a l-g environment, as well as with an ambient fluid under simulated low-g conditions. 	Partial acquisition devices with window screens can offer significant advantages with respect to reduced size and weight.  Successful implementation of these devices has the potential for improving the performance (by reducing weight) and simplifying operations of all aerospace vehicles that use cryogenic propellants in a low or zero-g environment.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Potential applications include: VentureStar, Shuttle OMS upgrades, orbital-transfer vehicles, Mars missions, and other spacecraft applications requiring cryogenic propellant acquisition in low gravity.  Specific commercial aerospace applications include use on future communications satellites which may use cryogenic propellants or two-phase cooling systems which require vapor free, liquid acquisition of a high vapor pressure fluid in zero-g.

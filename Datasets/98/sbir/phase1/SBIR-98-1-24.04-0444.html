<BLOCKQUOTE>
The number airborne and space-based imagery sources is increasing, with expanding bandwidth of spectral information.  Deriving thematic information 
from this data requires an intuitive understanding of relationships between 
image measures and interpretation measures.  The Computer Assisted Data 
Analysis System (CADAS) proposed here employs innovative intelligence 
imagery interfaces to solve the data interpretation dilemma.

We designate four categories for classification of image analysis tools:  
image enhancement, feature selection and extraction, image segmentation, 
and geature recognition.  The project's goal is to provide image 
interpreters teh extra information needed to strengthen the advantages of 
current viewing methods while decreasing the probability of 
misinterpretation.  A prototype software interface that includes DAO 
databases, OpenGL graphics interface, and which is DCOM compliant will be 
the frame of application.  Research results will be validated through 
Thematic Mapper 30 meter 7 bands data and ATLAS 10 meter 13 band data of 
urban and non-urban environments of the Salt Lake Valley.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The association between TechniScan and the Center for Remote Senssing and Cartography (CRSC) will allow to combine TechniScan's goal of being at the 
forefront of imaging technology, and CRSC's goal of providing services to 
cities for analysis of urban environment.  This software analysis package 
will complement TechniScan's involvement in medical, ultrasound and sonar 
underwater imaging, ground penetrating radar.

Several marketing strategies will be followed simultaneously: (1) a 
partnership with an existing data analysis company, (2) a providing of 
services for large volume data analysis, using the tools initiated during 
this proposal in house, (3) a contract with a company developing satellites 
and remote sensors, to include a hardware pre-processing version of the 
algorithms initiated in this proposal, (4) Partnerships with other 
communities, such as ultrasound companies, to include software and hardware 
versions of the current algorithms onto the next generation imaging 
scanners.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 A versatile, reliable, lightweight and very efficient (>95%) variable speed AC motor controller is proposed for use in driving vapor compression cycle high lift heat pumps directly from a photovoltaic array.  Active thermal control system concepts are currently being investigated by NASA that utilize high lift heat pumps for long duration manned space travel and planetary bases in extreme thermal environments.  The proposed technology, and integrated control strategy, are key elements of these new thermal control systems which promise higher performance and lower mass than current technologies.  The expected results of this project are; a successful demonstration and integration of the power electronics with the NASA JSC prototype high lift vapor compression cycle heat pump, experience leading to comprehensive specifications for future space mission thermal control systems, and identification of commercial applications of the resulting technology in the refrigeration and HVAC industries (on and off-grid).

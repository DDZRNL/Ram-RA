<BLOCKQUOTE>
 	The proposed program is directed towards the development of a compact, "reagentless" technology for the efficient sterilization of spacecraft potable water systems through the in-situ electrolytic generation of hydrogen peroxide.  This technology will rely on a novel rotating drum electrolytic cell employing a solid polymer electrolyte and new variants of cathode electrocatalysts recently developed at Eltron Research, Inc.  The hydrogen peroxide produced will act as a short lived, noncorrosive biocide.  The addition of low concentrations of cupric ion will be used to enhance the disinfectant power of the hydrogen peroxide, after which the cupric ions will be removed by reduction to copper metal.  The technology will be compatible with spacecraft operation as it will be physically compact, robust, energy efficient, relatively immune to the effects of low gravity, will not require consumables, and will be an add-on for existing systems.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 	The technology should find application in industries requiring sterilization or low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant.  These include aqueous recirculation systems such as water purification and filtration units used in many industries, biofouling inhibition/removal in heat exchangers and cooling tower loops used extensively in the petrochemical and power generation industries, and sanitation for hospitals and the biotechnology industries.  The technology will also have application in water purification and wastewater treatment through hydrogen peroxide promoted advanced oxidation processes

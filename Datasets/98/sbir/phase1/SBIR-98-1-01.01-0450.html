<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 We propose to develop a novel computer interface for air traffic control specialists (ATCSs) that integrates voice recognition and eye-tracking to enable hands-free interaction with an ATC display. The proposed research is innovative in that it presents a novel, alternative approach for ATCSs to interact with graphical displays (using eye and voice) that can be efficient and cost-effective provided that eye-tracking can be made robust, non-intrusive and inexpensive.  The primary objectives of this R&D are: (1) to determine how eye/voice interaction can best be used in an ATC interface; and (2) to develop the necessary off-head eye-tracking technology to make an ATC eye/voice interface practical.  The ATCI concept depends on having off-head eye-tracking and will only be cost-effective when the price of eye-tracking drops.  We anticipate producing an eye-tracker design and engineering prototype that can be produced in large quantities for a few hundred dollars per unit.  The expected benefits of the ATCI are: (a) more efficient interaction by replacing some voice intensive interactions with natural use of point-of-gaze, and (b) improved performance over voice recognition only solutions in high noise, multiple speaker environments.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The proposed research will result in inexpensive eye-tracking that will both enable new applications and  provide an alternative to mouse and keyboard use.  Application areas include:  (1) hands-free operator-machine interaction for complex process control operations, e.g., air traffic control, space operations, and power plant control; (2)  hands-free interfaces for commercial and military aviation and space crewstations, (3) teleoperation of vehicles such as unmanned ground or aerial vehicles; (4) assistive device technology for persons with disabilities; and (5) general consumer computer use.

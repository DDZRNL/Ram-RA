<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A miniature, self-contained, high performance electric propulsion system is proposed for Phase I proof-of-concept development.  A unique pulsed thruster is described which is configured to operate on a highly integrated power source.  Total thruster system mass, including all propellant and the power source, is only 50 g.  Projected specific impulse levels are 500 - 1000 sec. at a continuous operation power requirement of 1.0 Watt.  Applications include increasing the mission usefulness and cost effectiveness of future NASA nano-satellites with mass levels of 10 kg or less.  The proposed thruster system concept offers NASA a high performance, economical, bolt-on, self-contained, non-intrusive propulsion capability for nano-satellites.

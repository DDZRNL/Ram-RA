All NASA Enterprises possesses large, complex databases.  Those of the Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) consist primarily of satellite images.  To analyze and use these voluminous amounts of data, NASA needs new database management methods that are efficient, real-time, and accurate.  In response to this challenge, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes an innovative image and data classification method, based on Hybrid Monte Carlo-Metropolis sampling and Fuzzy logic-based Classification (HMCFC).  The HMCFC will initially cluster the data by using a fuzzy c-means algorithm.  Next, the hybrid Monte Carlo-Metropolis algorithm will decide whether or not to accept the current classification.  This algorithm will be ideally suited for detecting and classifying events.  In addition to the use of the HMCFC for data classification, POC will introduce Gibbs sampling techniques to detect historical anomalies and trends.  With this combination of HMCFC and Gibbs sampling, the proposed system will efficiently detect, classify, and analyze any trends present in the data.  In the Phase I project, POC will use historical data and develop algorithms to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Laser-induced thermal acoustics (LITA) is a nonintrusive, transient-grating optical technique that provides simultaneous high-accuracy measurements of sound-speed/temperature and velocity (0.02% is readily achieved) and thermal diffusivity and density (~1%), among other parameters.  We are engineering a computer-controlled semi-portable LITA system for robust, long-baseline (0.5 to 2 m) measurements.  This novel system automatically adjusts beam-pointing mirrors using misalignment information extracted from signals in real time.  In Phase I, we propose to incorporate LITA velocimetry into this system, revise the system design to increase the measurement rate to >100 Hz, and implement measurements that simultaneously resolve fluid and flow properties along a line.  In Phase II, we will fully implement these extended capabilities and will pursue burst-mode acquisitions for measurement rates up to 1 MHz to accommodate demanding dynamic experiments.  We have made accurate LITA measurements in gases under one-tenth atmospheric density to well over 100 times atmospheric density, in sprays, in strong, compressible turbulence, and in luminous and particle-laden flows.  Our LITA system will feature self-alignment and self-calibration to prevent delayed experiments and lost data while lightening operator load and improving measurement accuracy.  Providing velocimetry and dramatically increased measurement rates, the proposed system will be ideal for high-value ground-test experiments.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Because LITA is the first non-intrusive flow diagnostic that can be used to measure instantaneous thermodynamic state and velocity simultaneously at a point in an unseeded flow, it may replace combinations of other diagnostic tools such as laser Doppler velocimetry.  Additionally, LITA provides accurate measurements over a wide range of conditions including high-pressure and reacting flows, making it a valuable technique for combustor and chemical reactor test and development. Because of its automatic alignment, calibration, and data analysis, the high-measurement-rate LITA-based instrument we propose will open new markets for unattended process monitoring.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The inertial navigation systems of today are large, heavy, expensive, power consumptive, precision instruments affordable only in high-end 
systems and platforms. Inertial navigation on a chip will create new 
capabilities, make high-end functionality affordable to low-end systems, 
and extend the operational performance and lifetimes of existing 
platforms.  Micromachined inertial navigation or measurement unit  (IMU) 
on a chip is proposed, which are composed of microaccelerometers and 
microgyroscopes. Top-Vu's innovation and high-payoff approach is to 
integrate the micromachined IMU’s and very large scale integration (VLSI) 
electronics on a gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate. The electronics will 
be implemented using GaAs complementary heterostructure field effect 
transistor (CHFET) technology. The objective of this project is to develop 
gallium arsenide (GaAs) based micromachined inertial measurement unit with 
GaAs electronics for future inertial navigation systems. The Phase I 
technical objectives (and anticipated results) include three key technical 
tasks: 1) inertial measurement unit design, 2) process integration, and 3) 
readout electronics.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The anticipated benefits include order-of-magnitude performance improvements, compared to silicon technology and others, and new 
applications where silicon fails to meet system requirements. These system 
requirements include low noise, high speed sensing response, low power, 
high radiation hardness, low temperature, high temperature, and optical 
integration. Commercialization is projected with high performance 
micromachined inertial measurement chips for future inertial navigation 
systems. Potential commercial applications abound in the aerospace, 
medical, marine, transportation, military, and automotive industries. The 
applications for this sensor fall into four categories: control, 
instrumentation, stabilization, and navigation. Top-Vu will generate a 
GaAs CHFET cell library readily applicable to high performance sensors, 
micromachines, signal processors and data acquisition systems for 
commercial industries. Our goal is to integrate these GaAs IMU’s with our 
other GaAs microsensors being developed to create powerful next generation 
microsensor systems. Top-Vu has received commercialization support from 
Minnesota Defense Consortium and others.

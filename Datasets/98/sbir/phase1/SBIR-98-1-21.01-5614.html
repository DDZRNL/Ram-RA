<BLOCKQUOTE>
Arkansas Microelectronics Development Corporation (AMDC) proposes to develop a thin film microtransformer for use in mixed signal and power system applications.  Present discrete, or surface mount, transformers require considerable surface real estate area.  By integrating thin film microtransformers directly into the substrate, or chip, the total area and weight would be greatly reduced.   A typical application might be a DC-to-DC converter that would convert  28 volt input to a 3.3 volt, 200 mA output.  NASA/JPL currently has a need for on-chip DC-DC converters for their System on a Chip (SOAC) program.  However, other applications with differing requirements could also be included.  In order to take advantage of outside expertise, AMDC will subcontract the University of Arkansas' High Density Electronics Center (HiDEC) for design and modeling assistance. This subcontract will also allow AMDC to use HiDEC's cleanroom and analytic facilities for fabrication and testing.  University of Arkansas faculty members currently involved with JPL's SOAC program will also be available through the subcontract.  Matching funds from the Arkansas Science and Technology Authority (ASTA) will also be pursued.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The driving forces for utilizing integrated microtransformers parallels the driving forces for utilizing higher specific functionality of microelectronics in general.  The consumer segment wants them for the purpose of reducing system mass and volume in portable applications such as cell phones, pagers, electronic personal assistants and briefcase-portable computers while higher performance is often a secondary consideration.  The high-performance users (military, aerospace, supercomputers) want them in order to solve problems associated with very high clock rates as well as for their compactness. 
Thin film microtransformers are a major emphasis area in JPLÕs SOAC program.  This program has a overall goal of full scale integration of the avionics system on one chip.  This is a difficult challenge requiring partnerships on all levels.  AMDC plans to work with JPL and major manufacturers such as Raytheon and/or and design/modeling firms such as Tanner Associates.  Optical Networks, Inc. has also expressed interest in AMDCÕs integrated passive development.

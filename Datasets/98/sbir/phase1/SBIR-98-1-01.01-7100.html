<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The augmented reality vision system for the Air Traffic Control (ATC) tower provides a controller-centered augmented reality display system improving human visual performance in monitoring airport surface operations under poor and zero visibility conditions. Aircraft identification, position, velocity and attitude and/or heading are data-linked to a tower-based data collection center.  A 3D Computer Generated Image (CGI) of the airport, all aircraft and surface vehicles, as would be seen by the tower controller in good visibility, is computer generated by dedicated computers.  The video signal is displayed to the controller by projecting the scene onto either a head-mounted augmented reality display or binoculars that provide augmented reality imagery.  Full 360° horizontal viewing is available to the air traffic controller by turning his/her head.  The air traffic controller uses this augmented reality display to monitor aircraft on arrival, direct aircraft to gates after landing, and back to the runway for take-off. The system concept also supports airport surface vehicle operations.  The system interfaces with FAA Ground Traffic Control for cleared taxi routes and with the Airport Movement Area Safety System (AMASS) for surface movement information.  This innovation will assist NASA by improving system capacity and capability and reducing aircraft accidents.

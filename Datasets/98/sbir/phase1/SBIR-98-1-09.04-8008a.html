<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 	This proposed program is directed towards development and evaluation of a fiber optic sensor for detection of ammonia in the 100 ppb - 500 ppm range. The sensor technology is based on immobilized triphenylmethane dyes which serve as the chemical transducer.  The advantage of this approach over standard techniques is that no additives are required to promote the reaction between ammonia and the triphenylmethane dye.  This is expected to lead to sensors with long-term stability and operational simplicity.	The triphenylmethane dyes will react reversibly with ammonia yielding adducts which exhibit an absorption spectrum different from the pure triphenylmethane dye.  These changes in the absorption spectrum will provide a mechanism for sensing ammonia.  These changes will be detected via an evanescent wave interaction.  This technology will be able to be implemented in a multisite distributed sensor network.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 	Successful completion of Phase I will result in identification of preferred components to be incorporated into a reversible fiber optic sensor for ammonia detection.  This sensor will find use in spacecraft life support systems, at chemical plants, waste treatment facilities and power generation plants where ammonia is used or produced.  The technology will also be potentially applicable to ammonia refrigerant leak detection.

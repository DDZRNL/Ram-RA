<BLOCKQUOTE>
Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop an analog phase-only diffractive liquid crystal spatial light modulator (LC-SLM) based on photo-alignment modulation (PAM) of liquid crystal phase.  In this device, a high resolution diffractive optic mask pattern is projected onto a thin LC cell with a photo-alignment layer, producing phase modulation of LC regions according to the intensity of light.  This approach not only avoids the objectionable effects of regular electrode pattern-alignment; it also reduces spurious diffraction from 10-30 percent to below 5 percent, correspondingly increasing diffractive efficiency.  A diffractive LC-SLM based on laser or UV pattern alignment will be fabricated and tested to demonstrate concept feasibility.  Producing stable and high quality photo-alignment and analog phase modulation with resolution of less than 10 micrometers and a domain wall less than 100 nanometers will be the core objective of this project.  Success of this project will lead directly to high-resolution, high-efficiency phase-only diffractive liquid crystal spatial light modulators.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
An analog phase only SLM device will revolutionize diffractive optics technology for optical image processing and optical communication.  Potential commercial applications include optical correlators for security, wavefront correctors for remote imaging, high efficiency tunable diffractive optical components for optical fiber interconnects, high density optical data storage, and holographic optical components.

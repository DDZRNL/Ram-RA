<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
State-of-the-art thermal control technologies are limited in their ability and increasingly unsatisfactory in their ability to provide the performance desired for chip level electronics and aerospace applications.  This effort seeks to develop novel Germanium-based quantum confined structures to enable solid state thermal control technology.  Phase I will establish the proof-of-concept, Phase II will optimize, while Phase III will commercialize the technology.

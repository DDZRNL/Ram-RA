<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The innovation offered by this Phase I SBIR proposal is a spacecraft data handling network with composite data bandwidths from near 30 Gbps to as high as 120 Gbps. Our innovation incorporates a combination of Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), and our new multiplexing approach referred to as Mode Group Multiplexing (MGM).  The combination of these techniques provides the maximum possible data routing flexibility for multimode fiber networks.  The high speed networks are offered in the two common topologies, a Star that uses a WDM/TDM technique,  and a Ring which uses a combination of WDM, TDM, and MGM.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Our ultra-high speed  fiber optic networks are primarily intended for the commercial and government aerospace markets, specifically satellite data busses.  Through our partnership with Litton and Orlando & Associates, Inc., our commercialization plan targets customers that include Loral, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, TRW, Hughes, and Ball Aerospace.  However, due to the planned wide growth in high speed local area networks (LANs), we anticipate broad commercial use of our fiber optic components.

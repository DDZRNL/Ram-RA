<BLOCKQUOTE>
An Electronic Transaxle MCM controller module was recently developed by automakers as the first under-the-hood polymer-substrate MCM.  A newly-created infrastructure is now positioned to supply the auto industry with millions of these MCMs.  Automakers are now developing a size-reduced, ruggedized and cost-reduced second generation controller.  Aerospace manufacturers want to use the same controller in space launch vehicles, if it can be qualified.  This presents an opportunity to simultaneously develop and qualify a new MCM package for both military and commercial use.  Plugging this Government application into the emerging infrastructure for automotive controllers will save millions in controller development costs.  Government use of this infrastructure for future MCMs will save billions in future electronics procurement costs.  Since 1996 Aguila Technologies has been developing advanced packaging materials and processes required for this dual-use application.  This project presents a golden opportunity to take these new technologies out of the lab into a real product of immense value.  Our goal is to apply Aguila's advanced materials and process developments to the new module and qualify it against real-world requirements.  This will create an immediate dual-use MCM capability of value to both automotive and aerospace users.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The resulting infrastructure that will emerge from this proposed effort will support far-reaching Government requirements and trigger rapid commercialization of these advanced packages.  Production implementation of this first generation MCM is slated for 1998 with a production volume of 400,000 in its first year.  A program to develop low cost and high performance materials for manufacturing infrastructure of MCMs is urgently needed for industry.  The realization of this technology should open a market that may exceed $220 annually within five years for high-density MCMs.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
NASA is faced with the competitive need to right size the total human resource requirements for their organization.  This need is common to traditional U.S. manufacturers who are competing in a global market.  Varied manpower requirements due to economic conditions and competition have driven companies to chase the most effective reorganization strategy.  Predictable models for varied markets and competitive situations are needed to direct NASA and the U.S. manufacturers alike.  To that means, a computer-generated expert system is presented as an innovative and timely solution.  This software will offer NASA and manufacturing companies prompt and accurate measures to direct their employment levels.  The specific innovation will continue to build on a platform and methodology of an expert system to measure, manage, and optimize manpower requirements at all levels of the organization including production, support, research, and management.  IET regularly works with clients on assignments including value-analysis of all positions and developing models and algorithms of optimal staffing levels based on current or forecasted economic conditions.  The proposed system will have the flexibility to handle a variety of defined environmental variables, provide "what if" analysis, and measures of confidence and risk.  In addition, the software must identify opportunities for improvement and measure performance.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
IET has worked with numerous clients on corporate cost improvement activities centered around improving total labor performance, establishing measures of performance that can be realistically tracked, and developing improvement programs for cost reduction.  Decision support models have been developed by IET to assist this effort.  A true intelligence based system that could be comercially available to companies could assist individuals or teams in the use of the software to manage this effort.  Areas of particular interest may include the following contract services common to manufacturing and service companies: total NASA manpower requirements for varied levels of shuttle launches, contract labor for space shuttle ground processing, peak manning for depot maintenance of large aircraft and military vehicles, temporary production support and enlisted versus officer manpower allocations.

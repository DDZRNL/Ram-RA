<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The program will develop a control mechanism to install in airbag vents. The device will help alleviate problems with air bag systems. The control 
valve mechanism will conserve gas as well as regulate the pressure in the 
airbag. As a result, gas generators can be made smaller without 
compromising protection in severe crashes. Even more important, the energy 
absorbing efficiency of the airbag will be substantially improved. Air bag 
size can then be reduced 50% without a loss in crash protection capability. 
This reduced size will prevent many airbag induced injuries otherwise 
inflicted on out of position occupants. For those occupants still exposed 
to airbag induced injury, the vent valve can be designed to quickly release 
gas and thereby minimize injury. Deployment velocity can also be lower 
without compromising system performamce in severe crashes. The vent control 
will be compatible with other new air bag technologies, including advanced 
inflators and occupant sensors.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The proposed application, for general aviation aircraft, is a commercial application. A very similar product can also be marketed in the automotive 
industry. The news media has high lighted airbag induced occupant injuries 
in automobile accidents for some time. Ready markets exist for products 
that can contribute to the reduction of the frequency and severity of these 
injuries. A product which also allows the use of smaller air bags and gas 
generators with out any loss of protection in severe crashes will be very 
easy to market worldwide.

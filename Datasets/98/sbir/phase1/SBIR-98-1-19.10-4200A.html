<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Triton Systems proposes two innovative methods to mitigate the premature tearing of thin film membrane materials under consideration for inflatable structures.  These two reinforcement techniques have already been demonstrated by Triton Systems to offer a significant increase in tear resistance of thin film membranes.  These techniques include (1) a flexible, ultra thin film plastic "rip stop" that is thermally bonded to the back surface of the inflatable membrane, primarily for Kapton, and emerging membrane materials such as TOR-LM, CP1 and CP2, and (2) a plastic "rip stop" grid that is integrated into the thickness of the inflatable membrane, primarily for the emerging membrane materials such as TOR-LM, CP1 and CP2 that are solution castable.  These two techniques developed under IR&D funding at Triton, have demonstrated a tenfold enhancement in tear propagation resistance of thin film membranes and offer a series of unique performance advantages as follows:
The proposed Phase I will develop the two proposed Triton reinforcement techniques by focusing on establishing a base line of properties for the reinforcements and their effect on candidate membrane materials.  Specifically, we will examine such broad issues as how the incorporation of a reinforcement affects the functionality of the membrane material.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The technology of inflatable space structures builds a conceptual bridge between the expandable structures and the space-manufactured objects, having removed to space the last fabrication step. Examples of such missions include radio frequency (RF) antennae for navigation, and communications, antennae for astronomic studies, and solar concentrator reflectors for solar propulsion applications.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A water-borne lignin-silicate primer/coating system is described that promises to significantly inhibit corrosion of the important base metals 
iron and aluminum.  The key to this technology is the use of sol gel 
chemistry to prepare the corrosion inhibiting primer.  The well known 
quinoidal, catecholic, and phenolic groups of lignin provide the corrosion 
inhibition.  The proposed technology is especially attractive since it 
involves only environmentally benign components, is easy to apply, and will 
be economical.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The innovative technology described herein will have application in the corrosion prevention of a wide variety of steel and aluminum substrates, 
including bridges and aluminum-hulled ships.  As such, there will be many 
large potential commercial applications after development through Phase II 
and III.

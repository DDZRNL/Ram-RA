<BLOCKQUOTE>
  We propose the development of an ultra-compact, light-weight, scan-free and low-cost spectrometer in the visible to near-infrared region based on a novel diffractive optics in conjunction with a one-dimensional solid-state detector array. The dispersive component in the proposed spectrometer is a specially-tailored phase hologram. When the holographic film is coupled to a solid-state detector array in such a way that each pixel in the array responds to a specific wavelength, the result is a full display of spectrum covering a broad spectral range with a resolution of 2 nm. The entire spectrometer can be contained in an integrated-circuit package along with data acquisition electronics to form a stand-alone wrist-watched-sized device. It can also be integrated into another instruments as a sensor for process monitoring. No other spectrometer in the market can competes with its simplicity, compactness, and low cost. During phase I, we will conduct a feasibility study which includes the fabrication and characterization of the phase hologram, operation of a rudimentary spectrometer based on the phase hologram, and investigation of application-related issues. At the end of phase I, we will have the blue print and performance specification of the compact spectrometer to be implemented in Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The proposed ultra-compact light-weight scan-free spectrometer system is expected to find wide applications in both commercial remote sensing and chemoemetric spectrometry for the detection and  analysis of chemical species.  The commercially-viable instrument, we envision, is an unique self-contained wrist-watch-sized spectrometer containing the proposed chip-sized spectrometer and data acquisition electronics for detection and identification of chemicals and environmental hazards in the industrial or military environment.  For the applications, which only require the measurement of a limited range of wavelength, an application-specific spectrometer  sensitive only in this limited range of wavelength can be also constructed.  Such simplified sensor device may be deployed at  fixed sites or  hand-carried as an accessory.  The proposed device can also be integrated into another instrument to provide real-time in situ analysis of chemicals  for automation in chemical, pharmaceutical, food, and petroleum industries.

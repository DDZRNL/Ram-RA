<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Future autonomous systems must learn optimal behavior by interacting with  imperfectly-known environments.  For space exploration, one definition of  optimal behavior is gathering a maximum amount of information with minimal cost  and risk.  Such complex and multiple-objective optimization problems cannot  be solved easily using traditional techniques, especially when the stochastic  natures of the environment, resources, and external interactive entities are  taken into account.  Reinforcement learning (RL) controllers are ideally  suited to such problems, but most RL approaches degrade when the system state  and action spaces are continuous and high-dimensional.  Recent research has  demonstrated that residual methods can preclude many of these problems.   The proposed work will investigate and refine residual reinforcement learning  techniques suitable for high-dimensional systems with many complex subsystem  interactions and characterized by an aggregation of continuous, discrete,  logical-element, and binary states.  The work shall demonstrate, via  simulation, residual reinforcement learning executives that gather information  in unknown environments.  The authors will demonstrate that improved  performance can be obtained using structure-learning nonparametric models to  store the continuous-time policies learned by the RL controller.  The  resulting methods will be directly applicable to numerous military and  commercial-sector systems, including reconnaissance, data mining, and  simulation-based optimization.

 In addition to space exploration, the RL algorithms can yield improved  routing and sensor-allocation strategies for single or multiple coordinated  unmanned vehicles.  In the commercial sector, approaches that seek to  maximize information gathered with minimal cost can be applied to challenging  tasks that range from data mining to autonomous Internet agents.   Additionally, when coupled with high-fidelity simulations, the proposed RL-based  agents can be used to help designers achieve complex system objectives that  cannot be achieved readily with traditional optimization  methods.

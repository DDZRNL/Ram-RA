<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 In this SBIR Phase I program, MicroPhotonics, Inc. proposes to develop a model force balance system that utilizes fiber optic sensors to provide accurate and reliable measurement of aerodynamics loads for use in both conventional and cryogenic wind tunnels.  The goal is to develop a system that has an accuracy of at least 0.01% of full-scale (FS) load that is insensitive to temperature gradients.  The proposed technical approach is based on newly developed fiber sensor technologies - "Self Calibrated Interferometric/Intensity-Based (SCIIB) Fiber Sensors" and "Absolute Displacement Fiber Optic Sensor (ADFOS)" both of which have full scale accuracies greater than 0.01% (greater than 0.001% FS for the ADFOS)
In this program, MicroPhotonics, Inc. will collaborate with Dr. Roger Simpson of the Aerospace Department, and with the Fiber & Electro-Optics Research Center (FEORC) at Virginia Tech, where the SCIIB sensor technology was initiated and developed.  The successful completion of this SBIR Phase I program will lead to clear demonstration of the technical feasibility of the proposed fiber-optic sensor based model force measurement system, and place a solid basis for Phase II work to develop the demonstrated technologies to the level where commercial products are viable.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The proposed fiber sensor balance system can be applied to loadcells which would be especially attractive in a wide range of harsh environment applications, where conventional loadcells are difficult to use.  Among many such applications include:  1) extreme temperature environments, 2) high radiation,  and 3) high EMI areas.  These combined advantages would allow to change the situation of sever lack of information in many harsh environment industrial processes.  The knowledge gained during this program would also be applicable to the development of sensors for measurement in petroleum wells and reservoirs where currently no reliable sensors are available, but such measurements are crucial for efficient and economical oil recovery.

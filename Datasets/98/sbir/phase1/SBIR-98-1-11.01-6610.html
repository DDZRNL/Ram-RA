<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This proposal addresses the development of a new and innovative dynamically controlled vapor diffusion system that will provide precise control of pre- 
and post-nucleation growth. Subtopic 11.01, Commercial Microgravity 
Research, is addressed in that a new and innovative approach will be 
developed to control protein crystal growth in real-time (dynamically). The 
system will have important biological and medical relevance in that it will 
provide crystals for new protein structure determinations and drug design. 
The overall project objectives for the Phase I effort are: 1)Design a 20 
chamber dynamically controlled vapor diffusion module that allows 
simultaneous and dynamic control of evaporation profiles of individual 
cells. 2)Use of an existing vapor duffusion system to crystallize 10-15 
proteins to demonstrate applicability of the proposed crystallization 
system. The proposed system will provide a powerful new approach for small 
and macromolecular crystal growth, benefiting NASA's long history of 
fundamental and commercial objectives in crystal growth.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The proposed innovative crystal growth system will be of tremendous value to crystallography, chemistry and pharmaceutical laboratories worldwide. 
The combined market for these scientific disciplines is substantial and the 
proposed device will play a vital role in their future. Protein crystal 
growth is generally recognized as the major bottleneck in crystallographic 
structural investigations, which are of paramount importance in elucidating 
fundamental structure/function relationships and in stucture-based drug 
design. These investigations take on further importance with the increasing 
emphasis on proteome research.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Magnetostrictive materials have the potential for a variety of applications from sensors to actuators for adaptive optics, robotics and automation, and linear motors.  Recently, several cryogenic magnetostrictive materials have been discovered with high saturation strains and excellent mechanical properties.  These materials are alloys of terbium and dysprosium with zinc.  The potential applications of these materials include valves, electromechanical actuators, micropositioners among others.  These magnetostrictors have been fabricated in small quantities and in single crystal form in order to understand their magnetostrictive behavior.  However, in order to realize their application potential, their costs must decrease and they must become more widely available. The focus of the research effort proposed herein is to develop low-cost scalable manufacturing processes for TbDyZn alloys. In order to apply these magnetostrictors, correlation between the grain morphology and the magnetostrictive, mechanical and electrical properties will be established.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 If successful, this project will make low-cost cryogenic magnetostrictive materials available to applications developers.  These types of actuators can be used for precise positioning systems such as used in optical systems, semiconductor fabrication, active vibration and acoustic control, precision valves and pumps.

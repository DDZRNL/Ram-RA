<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Vexcel Corporation proposes to directly address several of the most critical and challenging problems limiting the utility and use of repeat-pass interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar 
(IFSAR).  The proposed solutions to these challenges range from new processing algorithms, 
to new uses for existing or soon-to-exist data, to entirely new measurements which may 
become extremely valuable for IFSAR calibration.   Specifically we address the problems of 
coherence limitations, accurate determination of interferometric baselines, and atmospheric 
artifacts. With respect to coherence and phase unwrapping, Vexcel will develop a new 
techniques to correct coherence and phase calculations for local terrain slopes thereby 
reducing phase noise and achieving improved interferograms that may be more easily 
unwrapped.  For baseline determination, Vexcel will investigate the issues associated with 
using Shuttle Radar Terrain Mapping (SRTM) data to achieve automatic ground control point 
generation.  Finally, Vexcel will investigate using radar and other remote sensing techniques 
adopted from the meteorological community for providing data that will be useful for 
interpreting atmospheric effects within interferometric SAR data. We expect the results from 
this SBIR will significantly improve the utility of interferometric data, and facilitate the 
development of new ideas, possibly from fields other than SAR, for improving IFSAR data 
products.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The results of the Phase II effort will be directly applicable to Vexcel Corporation's interferometric SAR processing system, which is currently one of the few commercially 
available IFSAR processing systems in the world.  Ease of use, increased reliability and 
automation will contribute to increased sales.  In addition, the results from this SBIR work 
will have direct application into the NASA science community.  The challenges addressed and 
their solutions will be applicable to data from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topographic Mapping 
mission, as well as other spaceborne SAR sensors such as Radarsat, ERS, and JERS, and most 
importantly from future sensors such as LightSAR, Envisat and Radarsat-2.  The ability to 
produce improved data products will also greatly increase the utility and demand for IFSAR 
products, thus reducing the cost of production of higher level data products, and enabling 
increased commercial data production and sales

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Aspen Systems proposes to develop new Ultra-High Temperature Resistant Aerogels that will withstand temperatures as high as 2300 K for long periods of time.  The new insulation will be based Hafnium and Zirconium carbides. Refractory hafnium and zirconium carbides are known as a good candidates for ultra High Temperature Structural Application, because they have melting temperatures considerably higher than their associated oxides and have relatively good thermal shock resistance. These refractories materials are obtained at high reaction temperatures using carbide powders. Aspen Systems will use its expertise in aerogel manufacturing, as well as the extensive knowledge of its chemists in sol-gel science, to develop a low-temperature process for the production of refractory carbide aerogels. The proposed insulations will provide the materials needed for the thermal protection systems (TPS) of reusable launch and hypersonic vehicles.
For Phase I, we will synthesize the refractory aerogel materials and characterize them to prove the validity of the concept.  During Phase II, we will optimize the synthesis and supercritical drying parameters to further improve the properties of the materials.  Actual TPS concepts will be designed and tested to qualify the concept for flight missions.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Naturally occuring micrometeroids and man-made orbital debris pose severe impact hazards for spacecraft. A metallic shield has previously been used to protect spacecraft structures from catastrophic damage. It is possible to improve upon the shield concept through the use of a shape memory alloy (SMA) laminate structure.Shape memory alloys have frequently been used as large-force/high-strain actuators for space applications. However, these materials also have excellent material damping characteristics that allow them to be used for passive shock absorption. In addition, SMA's can exhibit measurable changes in resistance as they are strained. Hence, a shield that is a laminate of SMA wire and a backing material can be more effective than a simple metallic shield and serve multiple purposes. It could passively absorb much of the energy of a particle impact through the large strain capability of the SMA wire. It could determine when and where damage has occurred. Finally, the SMA wires could be used as actuators to modify the shape of the shield if needed once damage has occurred. The resulting shield would be lightweight, rugged, and could be applied over large surface areas. The electrical circuitry needed would be of standard design and could be miniaturized.

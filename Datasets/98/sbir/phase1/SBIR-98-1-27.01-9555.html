<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The objective of this SBIR research program is to develop the first electric field switchable, broadband near-infrared reflective circular polarizer.  Based on cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs), this unprecedented technology is in the form of a low cost thin film that has engineerable spectral bandwidth and center wavelength in the near-infrared.  The proposed Phase I work will explore the feasibility of electrically switchable polarizers by first studying the chemical and physical mechanisms responsible for the switchable broadband effect.  This knowledge will be used in two ways: designing near-infrared switchable polarizers, and providing insight into selecting the minimal chemical content necessary to achieve the desired properties, thereby facilitating substantial material and manufacturing cost reduction.  In addition to the potential commercial products, these results will facilitate the commercialization of many new and existing low cost, CLC-based products.  Furthermore, the scientific understanding obtained will be of tremendous benefit to liquid crystal polymer physics and chemistry.  The Phase II portion of the program will focus on polarizer size up-scaling and environmental stability testing and optimization, in addition to continuing the underlying fundamental research and cost reduction analysis.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The principal result of this program will be the first of its kind - a near-infrared switchable polarizer.  The results will have applicability to providing NASA with rugged, low cost control elements that are polarizing, filtering, and/or reflective in the near-infrared.  These devices have applications in space-based optical experiments and in fiber optic control devices.  In addition, this technology can be used to build a switchable, “smart” energy conservation window to pass or block solar near-infrared radiation while not attenuating the visible spectrum.

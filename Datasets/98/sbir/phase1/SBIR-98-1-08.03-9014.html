<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 	It is proposed to design and build a low mass, low power, low cost, high temperature furnace for use in space.  Vacuum and radiation insulation provide a means to almost eliminate heat losses from the furnace, allowing high temperatures to be achieved using low power.  A cylindrical configuration provides strength, access, simplicity, and low mass.  Vacuum pumping requirements are minimized by using the partial vacuum of space.  Temperatures in excess of 1200oC can be achieved using less than 1 kW of power.  Direct optical access will be included in the furnace design.  The furnace has the potential to be a centerpiece for research and development of materials processing in space.  Phase 1 will demonstrate design and operating principles; Phase 2 will develop and deliver a prototype to NASA.

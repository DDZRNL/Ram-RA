<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Most space and military applications require lightweight and extremely stable optical systems that must perform in adverse environments. Traditionally, beryllium, titanium or silicon carbide is used for such applications, but at severe cost penalties. Low microyield strength, and distortion attributed to Nabbarro creep are some of the property concerns. Currently used materials show adequate to favorable optical qualities but they are costly to manufacture and do not solve the micro-creep problem. New processes are being developed to address these issues but are resulting in higher manufacturing costs. 
Glassy metals combined with low cost manufacturing technologies will produce superior optical components. The selection of  glassy metals offers a unique solution for micro-creep. There is considerable reported data and experience with the materials that validates this important mechanical property. Glassy metals exhibit essentially no plastic yield when stressed to failure. This is desirable in the case of repeated loading due to high stress because there is essentially no hysteresis. This quality results in optical components that stay in focus through thermal cycling.  Glassy metals are more readily machined than HIP Be/BeO, silicon carbide-filled metal matrix alloys or silicon. Innovative manufacturing technologies are proposed to form near net optical components from glassy metals.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Applications include large earth based optics, optical benches, optical mirrors, cryogenic storage vessels, ducts, manifolds, fuel oil and hot water tanks, medical and residential oxygen tanks, gas cylinders, hazardous waste containers, and  protecting spacecraft from atomic oxygen. High potential in rapid tooling for molds, mandrels, dies, and complex free form metal components near net shape that require low-cost and lightweight.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The SBIR Phase I project is to formulate and assess some innovative parallel neural net (NN) technology-based computational methods for multidisciplinary analysis and design optimization of coupled aerodynamic-structural systems.  Both systemwise and disciplinary-wise NN model-based approaches will be used.  Also to be formulated and assessed are the following:  (i) a new neural biological computational model using the stochastic-type Integral Global/Local Optimization (IGLO) algorithm (developed by the Principal Investigator, PI), which is found to be one to two orders of magnitude more efficient than the Genetic Algorithms) for efficiently training an NN, particularly with discrete design variables; (ii) reduced NN optimization function models for enhancing NN training and optimization computational efficiencies; and (iii) an inverse NN method for directly finding an optimal design variable set as a function of constraint functions.  In Phase II, the formulated and validated methodologies will be implemented into a prototype software package, PASAONNS.  The use of NN technology in aeroelastic system analysis and design will result in almost instantaneous system response solution and computational speedup of optimization solution process by a factor of nearly one order of magnitude compared with finite element technique-based ones.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The general-purpose, parallel software package, PASAONNS, executable on both serial and parallel computer platforms, such as the IBM SP2 and inexpensive, single or networks of workstation(s) and PC clusters(s), will have great potential for commercial applications in various civilian and military industries (aerospace, automotive, etc.) for rapid preliminary analysis and design optimization.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Manufacturable technology for producing field emission cathodes from arrays of uniform and aligned carbon nanotubes will be developed. The approach is based on the templated synthesis of carbon nanotube arrays of very high, up to 10E12 cm-2, density. The uniqueness of this project is the growth of carbon nanotubes in the pores in the self-organized nanotemplates. Resulting arrays of carbon nanotubes will be compatible with the existing microfabrication technologies, therefore offering unique potential for integration of carbon nanotubes into displays, devices and circuits. Proposed technology will provide unmatched cost-effectiveness, and manufacturability, and can enable numerous application for field emitters based on carbon nanotubes, including those requiring high specific power. Phase I will establish the proof-of-concept. Phase II will extensively evaluate and optimize the technology and produce prototype devices. Phase III will commercialize the technology.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Proposed aligned arrays of carbon nanotubes can be readily used in a wide range of materilas and devices for magnetic, optical, and electronic application, including cold cathode field emitters with low operating voltage. Together with cost-effectiveness of production, efficiency, and emission current stability, the technology can spur new applications in vacuum microelectronics, flat panel displays, communications, electron emission sources for small electrostatic thrusters, batteries and capacitors, MEMS devices and sensors, nanoelectronics, and lubricated coatings.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 As microelectronic circuits used in space applications become more and more complex with greater capabilities, they require more chips, more memory, and more room.  This means increased size and weight which means increased launch costs.  One technique that is used to reduce the room required is stacking microelectronic die.  This saves room but creates some packaging problems, one of which is heat.Space Electronics Inc. (SEi) proposes to develop a low cost, radiation shielding, stackable packaging technology for advanced microcircuits (e.g. 4MEG fast SRAMs or 64 MEG DRAMS), suitable for space applications.  Stacking fast SRAM's gives the high density desired, but creates a heat problem.  Incorporating RAD-PAK®, SEi's flagship radiation shielding packaging material, directly into the stack will not only provide radiation shielding which is shared by all the die, but will also draw the heat away from the device.  A series of thermal vias connecting each heat sink with the device directly underneath it would provide a heat transfer path down through the stack and eventually to the printed circuit board.  Connecting the die directly to the heat sink would provide the most efficient thermal path, while also providing the smallest overall outline.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 A 1997 SBA  Tibbetts Award winner, Space Electronics Inc. has a demonstrated ability to rapidly insert SBIR technology into space programs.  The same density, heat and radiation problems exist for commercial and military satellites, making this a truly cross-cutting technology.  This technology is also applicable to ground-based applications where high density is desired.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In this proposal, we describe a breakthrough for extending the dynamic range of a high-speed analog-to-digital converter (ADC) by as much as several orders of magnitude com-pared to existing technology. One of the major challenges and critical needs in high-speed digitization is maximizing the dynamic range of detection, defined as the measurable range spanning the limit of weak to strong signal. The proposed method is based on an algorithm for a programmable signal processing that enables a transient digitizer to operate in a pulse counting mode simultaneous with detection of strong signal. Moreover the proposed pulse counting mode overcomes the problem of conventional binary pulse counters, which cannot distinguish multiple hits from single hits. For NASA requirements in LIDAR and laser range finding applications, this new technology can lead to more than an order of magni-tude greater range without any other changes in hardware. For airborne remote sensing, the proposed technology provides greatly increased capability as well as enabling more compact design and a reduced cost.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The proposed technology is a general purpose, high dynamic range digitizer that has many dual-use applications, such as laser range finding, time-resolved imaging, time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and high-speed waveform recording. The laser rangefinding applications include: (1) atmospheric and ecosystem monitoring (including space platforms), (2) pollution monitoring by detecting toxic and hazardous emissions, (3) plume tracking of industrial releases or rocket launches, (4) surveillance and night-time imaging and range finding, (5) landscape imaging and profiling. The only alternative to the proposed technology is the costly and operationally cumbersome method of employing two independent data acquisition systems, one based on a fast ADC and another based on pulse counting using a multichannel scaler (MCS). Syagen has developed a marketing, product development and capitalization plan for commercializing the results of this SBIR technology. Syagen has already obtained customer interest from the DOD, mass spectrometry industry and the research community. One of Syagen's core businesses is the development of innovative mass spectrometers based on time-of-flight for which this technology will also be applied.

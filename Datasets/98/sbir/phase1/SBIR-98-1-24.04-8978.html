<BLOCKQUOTE>
This SBIR project seeks to build on the success of Ultimode Systems'data-mining tool ACPro, automatic clustering/segmentation software.  ACPro
generates well-defined, interpretable, probabilistic models of data for
segmentation purposes.  This project would (1) install high-dimensional and
large-sample capability into ACPro, (2) allow incremental updating of ACPro
models, and (3) provide a reconfigurable capability into ACPro to allow
tuning to its computational platform.  We claim these three
capabilities are the minimum set of requirements to ready a probabilistic
modeling tool such as ACPro for deployment in NASA data-understanding
applications.  The combined capabilities would allow ACPro to be applied in
constrained environments such as on-board satellites where power and data
transmission are at a premium.  The reconfigurable front-end would allow
custom tuning of ACPro to parallel processes used in commercial
data mining, networks of workstations for internet mining, and the
space-hardened processor arrays planned for NASA deep-space missions.
Finally, the incremental capability would allow ACPro to operate in a data
``monitoring'' mode.  This project would develop these capabilities to
beta-test stage, and concurrently develop demonstrations of the tool on
high-profile, commercial and NASA databases accompanied with complementary
interpretative tools to aid the knowledge discovery process.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
High-dimensional, large-sample and incremental capabilities have thefollowing commercial applications: (1) for use as a consulting tool for our
high-end clients, (2) for licensing to database and data-mining software
houses, (3) for expansion into new markets where large samples and
high-dimension are the norm.  Ultimode's current growing client list
includes mining companies with datasets from satellites and aircraft-borne
instruments, and telecommunications companies with large customer 
databases.  While these existing clients could be better served with these
new tools, ability to handle increased size would greatly facilitate our
expansion into other markets such as internet-related modeling, marketing,
manufacturing, banking and finance.  Moreover, through our growing
partnership with a leading data-mining tools provider, and through future
partnerships with database vendors the reconfiguration capability would
allow distribution of high-performance code across a range of commercial
platforms.  Many database companies are still early on in their commercial
expansion into the data mining area.  With the success of our research, we
would have a unique combination of interpretative clustering, large-sample,
high-dimension clustering and parallel processing, and thus be competitively
placed.

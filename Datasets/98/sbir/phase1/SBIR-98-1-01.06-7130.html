<BLOCKQUOTE>
In-flight fire is a potential catastrophe.  The incident on July 17, 1996, involving TWA Flight 800, is one example.  Damage to life and property can be minimized, if not entirely eliminated, by employing a device that would detect the onset of fire and provide early warning.  A fire is preceded by an induction stage in which some marker compounds are released in the air.  For example, one can smell odors from an overheated electrical wire.  Examples of these markers include carbon monoxide, hydrogen chloride, oxides of nitrogen and hydrogen cyanide.  By detecting marker compounds  selectively and sensitively, this Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of a commercially viable fire onset monitoring system (FOMS).  FOMS, an all fiber optic device, will use an intracore tunable filter to perform correlation spectroscopy ­ a form of absorption measurements.  Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS), Inc. will construct and test these filters tailored to precisely match the spectral characteristics of the marker compounds in the near infrared region.  The use of intracore tunable filters will lead to a low cost, intrinsically safe, and field deployable system without using expensive wavelength-tunable laser diodes or bulky "reference cells" filled with target gases.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Aside from aircraft use, FOMS can be installed in large buildings for fire protection.  Spin-off products for chemical detection will have great commercial value in the remote monitoring of environmental contaminants, chemical process control, oil exploration, and mine safety.  NASA will directly benefit by installing FOMS in spacecraft and space stations.

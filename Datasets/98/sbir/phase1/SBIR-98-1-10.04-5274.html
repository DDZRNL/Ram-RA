<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The information revolution has resulted in an accelerated rate of change and currently managers are spending significant time to ensure that changes are inducted in an orderly manner, without introducing chaos into the system.  In industry, military, or NASA type of domains, changes could be because of process re-design, technological advancements, special one-time requirements, etc.  A tool that assists in analyzing the impact of changes on system elements and on system performance will be very useful.  Decision makers can use such a tool to evaluate the impact of contemplated changes, compare different options, and choose options that maximize organizational goals.The proposed "Change Management and Analysis Tool" captures three different types of models (process, product/object, and functional).  Changes are captured in terms of additions, deletions, and attribute value changes to processes, products, and functionality.  The impact of any change is propagated through the system using knowledge-based change propagation relationships.  Changes to system performance metrics (time, cost, risk, and safety) are then determined using quantitative and qualitative mechanisms.  Phase I will also result in the development of a systematic approach to determine system-wide safety metrics and safety interactions.  Fuzzy logic and neural networks will be used to facilitate this.

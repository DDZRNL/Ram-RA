<BLOCKQUOTE>
 	Improved methods for control of microbial growth are required to support long duration manned missions.  To further this aim, an investigation of the use of immobilized antibiotics and enzymes is proposed.  Potential areas of application of these materials include: control of surface populations (particularly in food preparation and personal hygiene areas, i.e., shower, urinal and commode), prevention of microbial colonization and decomposition of materials of construction, prevention of biofilm formation, treatment of hydroponic solutions, potentiation of chemical drinking water disinfection, endotoxin removal from aqueous streams, enhanced microbial control for biological experimentation, and control of airborne human and plant pathogens.  Preliminary experimentation has demonstrated destruction of gram positive and gram negative bacteria in aqueous flowing streams using immobilized antimicrobials. It is envisioned that the materials resulting from this effort will be suitable for deployment in packed beds for use in flowing air and water streams, and as surface coating materials for control of microbial populations on solids, and in air through passive contact. For the Phase I effort, packed beds of immobilized antimicrobials will be studied for the control of endotoxin and microorganisms in aqueous streams.  The potentiation of chemical disinfection will also be investigated.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Radiators are used to reject the heat generated by a spacecraft’s life support system.  Unfortunately, the heat loads are not constant and, in the cold environment of space, the radiators will sometimes freeze during low loads and then thaw and operate at their maximum heat rejection rate. The International Space Station radiators use thick walled tubes to resist the very high stresses generated during the freeze/thaw cycle. In order to greatly reduce the weight, TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes a radiator which will not burst on freezing, and which weighs substantially less than the current model.
TDA has identified several approaches to accommodate the volume change in the freeze/thaw cycle which will not generate high stresses (to minimize the tube wall weight).  TDA will test several approaches in Phase I and select one for Phase II.  Using the Trans-Hab for the Mars mission as a reference configuration, TDA will also prepare a conceptual design of the radiator that is indicative of the requirements of radiators in future spacecraft.

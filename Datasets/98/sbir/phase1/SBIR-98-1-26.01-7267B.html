<BLOCKQUOTE>
Transponders in small spacecraft must operate in multiples of frequency bands, both in microwave and millimeter wave frequencies.  Deep space probes have relied on X-band transponders in the past, but the new generation of spacecraft will require additional capabilities to operate in Ka-band frequencies at 32 GHz.  For modulation of the Ka-band carrier, an analog linear phase modulator is required, but it is not available today in MMIC form.  Hittite Microwave Corporation has developed a MMIC chip for a linear phase modulator operating in X-band, and proposes to extend the MMIC design to Ka-band frequencies.  The proposed approach, however, depends on a radically different circuit topology and advanced MMIC process.  The selected circuit approach depends more on amplitude control properties of GaAs devices than capacitance variations, as the ratio of capacitance variations is limited.  The most effective semiconductor process proposed for this application is a 0.25-micron p-HEMT process.  Preliminary analysis of phase modulators attainable by proposed circuit topologies and process is presented.  The design baseline will be established in Phase 1, to be followed by chip fabrication and demonstration in Phase 2.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The phase modulator itself will have limited commercial applications.  The circuit techniques developed for its implementation, however, will be applicable to phase shifters, switches, and other control circuits operating in Ka-band frequencies.  Such devices and integrated chips will be useful in phased array antennae in commercial systems for beam forming and steering.

Increased use of helicopters in the civilian sector combined with interests in tilt rotor technology have identified a unique need for a computational tool capable of providing the many iterative solutions required to reach design closure in a timely manner. In the industrial setup, a computational tool is successful only if turnaround time can be reduced to a level where design cycles can be conducted within schedule and cost. This research proposes such a tool based on unstructured Cartesian grid.
A finite-volume based numerical solver is proposed for solving vortex dominated flowfield of a rotor. The flowfield is modeled by the steady incompressible Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations discretized on unstructured Cartesian mesh. The rotor is modeled by a line of three-dimensional momentum sources. This project embodies important simplifications ensuring simplicity and efficiency. Unstructured Cartesian mesh allows refinement of grid only where necessary without compromising the advantages of structured Cartesian system. The resulting rotor simulation package will have the advantages necessary for industrial use.

Phase I will concentrate on developing unstructured Cartesian solver for rotor applications with local refinements and acts as a proof of concept. For Phase II, inclusion of aircraft bodies will be emphasized.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The software developed under this initiative will find wide usage in the U.S. helicopter industries and aircraft industries in general. If the technique is found to be effective for aerodynamic load calculations of the rotor and body, its usefulness can be extended to rotor acoustics in future initiatives.
In Phase III, the comprehensive aerodynamic prediction design tool will be wrapped with a Graphical User Interface with pre- and post-processing capabilities and will be licensed to the industry.

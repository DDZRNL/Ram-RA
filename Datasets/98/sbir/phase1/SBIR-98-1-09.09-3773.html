<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The intent of this proposal is to develop a synthetic muscle electromechanical actuator which is capable of large amplitude deformation (up to 30% in the direction of motion) and substantial force (0.6 lbs per square cm of perpendicular cross section at 65 volts). In addition, the actuator will be extremely lightweight (density about 1g/cc), vacuum compatible, capable of high speed proportional response, and mass manufacturable in sizes ranging from the Phase I prototype ( 0.6 cubic mm) to very large devices (> 1 cuft). The actuator is made of metallized plastic. In Phase I we will construct a prototype using VLSI techniques as well as identify non-VLSI mass production methods for use in Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The actuator, which may also serve as a sensor or generator, would be an enabling element in ultra-lightweight robotic, optical, fluid control, and haptic interface systems. Specific applications include: valve actuators, solenoid replacements, manipulator and locomotion drivers for autonomous robotic and microrobotic systems, endoscope steering mechanisms, mechanical scan drivers for ultrasound imaging, positioning drivers for optical interconnect elements, drivers for optical surface configuration in adaptive optics, tactile feedback mechanisms in haptic interfaces, and ul- timately active prostheses. The actuator's ability to simultaneously sense and effect motion is a significant control benefit in all the applications.

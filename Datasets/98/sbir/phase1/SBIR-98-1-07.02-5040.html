<BLOCKQUOTE>
 A real-time shock location sensor (SLS) with high dynamic response characteristics will be developed for high-speed flight applications. The innovation will use an array of surface hot-film sensors operated by Tao Systems' large bandwidth, high sensitivity constant voltage anemometer and associated instrumentation. Unique shock detection hardware based on a recently discovered relationship between the presence of shock and its surface signatures will be designed and fabricated. The Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed innovation for on-line detection. A prototype system will be built and tested in Phase II to establish the proof-of-concept in a real flight environment. The detection of shock and an understanding of shock-boundary-layer interactions is of primary importance to the safety and efficient performance of high-speed vehicles.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The SLS can be used in active air inlet control, active buffet control, and wave-drag reduction systems of high-speed flight vehicles to monitor and control shock. SLS will also find applications in CFD validation of high-speed vehicles, performance testing and design of hypersonic flight vehicles, high-speed propellers, and turbo-machines.

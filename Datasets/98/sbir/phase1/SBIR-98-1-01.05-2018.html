<BLOCKQUOTE>
Expert Microsystems and Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) will develop an innovative state determination algorithm to improve the performance of our real-time sensor validation system.  Automated detection of sensor failures provides an immediate return on NASA’s investment by reducing the manpower, schedule and uncertainty associated with sensor failure detection.  Our innovation is a system operating state determination algorithm which enables the sensor validation algorithm to be optimized for each operating state of the physical plant.  Our sensor validation system, recently developed for NASA, uses ANL patented algorithms which have been shown to provide high fidelity sensor validation for nuclear power stations.  The sensor validation technique is centered around implementations of the Sequential Probability Ratio Test and Multivariate State Estimation Technique algorithms.  We will augment these algorithms with a Learning Vector Quantization neural network algorithm to automatically characterize the current operating state of a physical plant.  Phase I culminates in production and delivery of a prototype run-time module which validates flight accelerometer data for the Space Shuttle Main Engine with high reliability across all operating states of the engine.  The resulting sensor validation system will be widely applicable to NASA launch vehicles, ground support systems, and industrial machinery monitoring.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Requirements for sensor data validation exist in mission critical aerospace and industrial control and safety systems where data integrity is essential.  The technology is applicable to any process or vehicle control application where: time-critical, closed-loop control and safety monitoring depend on sensor input; or unexpected process interruptions due to sensor failures or false alarms are uneconomical.  Launch vehicles clearly satisfy both criteria, as do many other NASA and DoD mission critical control and sensing applications.  Most power generation and chemical process plants also satisfy both criteria.  In 1996, ANL and Expert Microsystems entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to develop and commercialize an innovative methodology and software product addressing this wide-spread need.  Our Sensor Validation System automates the production of application specific sensor validation run-time modules which are embeddable in the users process control environment.  These real-time capable modules enable improved safety, reduced maintenance cost, and optimal economics for many process-oriented enterprises including aerospace vehicle and ground support systems, power generation plants, and chemical processing plants.

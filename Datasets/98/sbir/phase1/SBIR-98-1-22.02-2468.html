<BLOCKQUOTE>
 We propose to develop multi-channel silicon x-ray detector arrays, and their associated integrated circuit pulse-processing electronics, for high energy resolution remote x-ray fluorescence measurements for planetary geochemical analysis. The detectors will detect x-rays from planetary bodies, such as the moon, asteroids, comets and Mercury, which are produced by fluorescence from the solar x-ray flux.  The detectors will be sensitive in the 1 - 20 keV energy range, will have 200-400 eV FWHM energy resolution, will cover an area 100-200 cm2, and will operate without mechanical or cryogenic cooling. The detectors will be designed using one-dimensional strips delineating the individual detector elements, but will be fabricated on single monolithic substrates.  A detector ~2 cm2 will contain on the order of 100 strips, each strip will be connected to a single channel of an integrated circuit chip containing low noise amplification and processing electronics.  The 2 cm2 detector/chip modules will be tiled together, to achieve the total area required of 100-200 cm2. Although this general concept has been applied to the development of large area high energy physics detectors, this proposal addresses novel solutions to the challenges imposed by the simultaneous requirements of the large area detectors and ultra low noise x-ray detection in astrophysical applications. These detectors can be used in future Discovery missions, to replace the currently used proportional counters and filter systems, and will offer much better energy resolution, reduced power consumption, high reliability, and significantly reduced weight.   The detectors will be developed during Phase I, while the integrated circuits and system packaging will be developed during Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 These solid state detectors will have applications in x-ray fluorescence analytical techniques for chemical analysis of environmental, geochemical and materials science such as are found with scanning electron microscopes and in the steel industry; powder diffraction cameras; low noise synchrotron x-ray detectors for biological analysis.  The elimination of cryogenic cooling introduces many new possibilities for room temperature field portable applications in environmental monitoring.

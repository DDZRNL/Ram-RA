<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Infinite Materials & Products, Inc., (IMP) believes that continuous fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composite mirrors can be ground and polished in the same manner as glass mirrors. By using IMP's specially formulated optical epoxy modified with a very active filler material, the grinding and polishing of an epoxy mirror face would be successful. To date, no one else has been able to produce visual optical quality CFRP composite mirrors by grinding and polishing the optical surface. NASA has an ongoing requirement for ultra-lightweight mirrors. In addition, a requirement exists for ultra-smooth replicated mirrors in the 2-3   RMS range that are rigid and lightweight. IMP's epoxy resin has been specifically designed and formulated to fabricate visual optical quality CFRP composite mirrors and carbon foam mirrors, eliminating the past problems with aerospace and commercial epoxies. Filler materials and techniques have proven to be vital to IMP's epoxy resin formulations. IMP's technology will enable NASA to meet the goals of the "faster, better, cheaper" mandate for ultra-lightweight composite mirrors and the systems and spacecraft they are part of.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 IMP's specially formulated optical epoxy modified with a very active filler material will be used by IMP to fabricate a wide variety of visual optical mirrors, from the very small to the very large. IMP's mirror technology will be ideal for mirrors for ultra-lightweight telescopes of large aperture size and complete CFRP composite telescopes for amateur astronomy to complete directly with Celestron, Meade, and other manufacturers of conventional telescopes, for the Next Generation Space Telescope, for the deep space optical interferometer array to search for extrasolar planets, for new generation KH-11 optical reconnaissance satellites with ultra large mirrors for the NRO and the USAF, for a proposed ten kilometer wide optical interferometer array on the far side of the moon, and for flight simulators.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We propose a virtual rover agent that interacts with a virtual environment. This will enable the mission operations group and mechanical designers to check preliminary design characteristics before they begin detailed design and build physical prototypes. For Phase I, we will develop a tool to work with the Muse system utilized by the Network Engineering Section of Information Systems Development, headed by Norman Lamarra.  In this environment, a researcher will be able to guide a rover through mobility tests, deployment procedures, and scientific experiments, to chart its performance for sets of rover parameter choices.  The rover, guided by a joystick type controller, will be constrained to roam on a virtual terrain.  Analyses such as rigid body dynamics, stress, thermal, and power dissipation, may be performed simultaneously, enabling different rover designs to be evaluated in a virtual mission environment. For Phase II, we will create generic templates for simulating parameterized CAD models in virtual environments, and allow analyses with commercial codes to be performed simultaneously, as the model is being simulated.  The tool has wide commercial potential as CAD users will turn to virtual reality to get user feedback on products early in the design.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The product resulting from Phase II will be a tool for rapid creation of agents for mechanical and electro-mechanical products in virtual reality environments.  The agents will be parametric and will perform multidisciplinary analysis as part of their behavior, either through PDESolve or through connection to existing analysis codes.  We tentatively refer to this product as PDESolve/Virtual Agent. The market niche for PDESolve/Virtual Agent is designers and manufacturers of mechanical and electromechanical products in the aerospace, automotive, heavy industry and consumer products industries. These industries share a common problem with NASA: how to get feedback from the end user as early as possible in the design process. The commercial venture that will market the results of the work will be Beam. PDESolve/Virtual Agent will be an off-the-shelf add on to CAD tools. It will be sold through a network of resellers. Beam estimates it will have 2,000 seats in five years.

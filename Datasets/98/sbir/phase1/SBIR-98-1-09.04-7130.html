<BLOCKQUOTE>
Intelligent Optical Systems, Inc. (IOS), proposes developing a novel sensor system with built-in artificial intelligence for monitoring atmospheric gases.  Our system will feature a miniaturized, lightweight, low power, battery-operated sensor array and hybrid neural network signal processing hardware.  We estimate that the system, which will also offer wireless communication, will be smaller than a typical household smoke detector.  The sensors will be based on porous optical waveguides, which will serve as an immobilization substrate for chemical indicator dyes. These sensors will measure various gas concentrations and other parameters spectroscopically, with very high sensitivities.  Several different sensors can be incorporated into a single integrated optical chip so that oxygen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water vapor can be measured simultaneously.  The proposed system will use neural network hardware to achieve highly accurate results. The system will also be self-calibrating, so that changes in pressure and temperature affecting waveguide properties will not affect the accuracy of sensor results.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The proposed technology has the potential to result in an inexpensive and reliable sensor for an important set of gases. Such a technology could be used in many places where such detectors are currently too expensive ­ engines, diving suits, gas masks, office buildings, and hospitals, for example.

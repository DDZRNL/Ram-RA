<BLOCKQUOTE>
Active magnetic bearings (AMB) make potential revolutionary Flywheel Energy Storage Systems (FESS) designs possible.  However, their inability to sustain and operate through transients is limited.  Since bearing reliability, size and weight are crucial in space based FESS, a durable, compact high-speed touchdown bearing is needed.  A lightweight Zero Clearance Auxiliary Bearing (ZCAB) suitable for high-speed operation is proposed to meet this need.  MiTi has already demonstrated a ZCAB at speeds  to 10,000 rpm under 14-g shock loads and simulated AMB failure.  Under this program MiTi will 1) establish a preliminary design of a light-weight, high-speed ZCAB suitable for vacuum operation; 2) select the key materials and lubricants for the ZCAB; 3) Establish the Phase II preliminary test rig designs to qualify the ZCAB at high speed; and 4) Prepare a final report.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Once developed, the ZCAB will have significant commercial potential in almost every AMB system in operation.  Specific additional applications include FESS for terrestrial UPS and Power Quality Management, Hybrid Electric Vehicles, main propulsion gas turbine engines, marine gas turbines, pipeline compressors, as well as boil feed pumps for the utility industry.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This proposal is for the construction and preliminary testing of a simple crankcase scavenged, high speed, compression ignition, two-stroke engine which has a cylinder displacement suitable for a six cylinder engine of approximately 80 horsepower, primarily for light aircraft application.  The high speed capability would result from a compact, high capacity crankpin bearing configuration which enables high crankcase compression, and a very simple, low pressure, self-injection and combustion system which has already shown itself capable of very high rotational speeds.  It is anticipated that this configuration will combine the best features of crankcase scavenged two-stroke engines, namely, lowest cost, highest power to weight ratio, and simplicity, with the best features of compression ignition, namely, excellent fuel economy, greatly reduced fire hazard, and reduced impact on the environment because of the elimination of the need for leaded fuels.

It is estimated that the potential annual worldwide markets for this engine are as follows:Light Aircraft - 15,000 units per year
Portable fire pumps - 10,000 to 100,000 units per year
Unmanned Air Vehicles - 100 to 1000 units per year

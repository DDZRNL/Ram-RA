<BLOCKQUOTE>
Commercial coarse grain dielectric based ceramic capacitors are ineffective for use in high energy storage and delivery applications since the dielectric's permittivity decreases sharply when the applied voltage is increased.  Thus, the energy storage density is disproportionately lower than what is required for these applications.  Nanomaterials Research Corporation, in related work, has recently discovered that the unwanted decrease in permittivity that accompanies high electric fields can be greatly reduced by producing a capacitor that contains a formulation with nanocrystalline microstructure.  Nanomaterials Research Corporation proposes to develop this surprising discovery into multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCC) with energy densities significantly higher than the state-of-the-art while retaining the desirable properties of ceramic capacitors.  Phase I seeks to establish the proof-of-concept with MLCC energy densities in the 5 J/cc to 10 J/cc range.

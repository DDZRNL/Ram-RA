We propose to develop an empirical model for design of inductively generated plasma sources which operate in the presence of background magnetic fields. No such model exists for inductive breakdown in magnetic fields, though scaling rules have been developed for electrostatic breakdown between electrodes, and breakdown using radio-frequency fields. Plasma generation in the presence of a background magnetic field enables the background and plasma source magnetic fields to be used to control the location and movement of the plasma. Inductively generated plasma sources eliminate electrode contamination and wear, which are key lifetime considerations. Electrodeless (inductive) operation and the ability to generate plasma in a magnetic field are fundamental to several advanced propulsion schemes, from simple acceleration of a plasma in a magnetic nozzle, to propulsion based on magnetic fusion. Industrial applications for inductively generated plasma sources include an ion beam surface treatment process currently being commercialized. We propose to develop a model for the design of inductively generated plasma sources, to build and test an experimental plasma source (5cm diameter plasma slug, 1 kG background field, 10E16 cm(-3)density, 4 eV), to compare its performance with the model's predictions, and to refine the model.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Three applications of particular interest to APP are electric (plasma) thrusters for satellite station keeping and interplanetary spacecraft propulsion, pulsed plasmas used as ion sources for surface treatment of materials, and plasma sputter etch systems used extensively in the manufacture of semiconductors.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is now widely-accepted that the knowledge of boundary-layer transition onset is crucial for the prediction of aerodynamic performance of high-lift 
systems using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods.  Currently, no 
CFD code has a built-in reliable transition prediction capability which 
forces designers to rely on the wind tunnel data to fix transition in the 
CFD computations.  There are two problems with this approach.  First, 
transition onset data are not available for all the conditions on all 
airfoil elements.  Second, and more importantly, wind tunnel results do not 
scale to flight due to the environmental effects on transition.  This 
prevents CFD computations from accurately determining the performance of 
new high-lift devices under flight conditions.  A fast high-lift transition 
prediction module, which could be plugged into various CFD codes, is in 
dire need.  The proposed project is aimed at fulfilling this need.  A 
physics-based transition prediction module will be developed which could be 
easily incorporated in existing CFD codes for designing multi-element 
airfoils and for optimizing high-lift devices.  The proposed module, after 
phase I research and phase II development, will be suitable for production 
CFD codes.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This physics-based, transition prediction module will be employed in all CFD codes used to design high-lift systems for subsonic aircraft as well as 
High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT). In fact, this module will be of use in 
all aerodynamic designs, not just high-lift systems.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Facile and accurate measurements of the concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide, pH, electrolyte, and temperature are essential for the better understanding of many physiological, biological, photosynthetic, and metabolic process as well as the evolution of life in our solar system.  Currently available analytic technologies for analyzing these chemical species require frequent calibration and maintenance and are fargile, bulky, slow and not real-time.  Therefore, they are ill-suited for space exploration.  Amsen Technologies proposes a miniaturized and lower-power array sensor based on a novel molecular sensing concept that has the potential to provide rapid and real-time detection of aforementioned critical biological and physiological participants and process variables.  We shall establish the proof-of-concept by fabricating sensor prototype  during Phase I and conduct extensive optimization and field testing of the engineering prototypes in PhaseII.  Commercialization of the sensor technology will be done in Phase III.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The proposed innovation can provide NASA with low-power, miniaturized, real-time, highly selective, and sensitive sensors to detect a wide range of molecular species including oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, pH, and temperature.  Other NASA applications include human habitat monitoring and extraterrestrial environmental monitoring.  Spin-off applications include oceanographic monitoring, health care, and medical diagnostics.

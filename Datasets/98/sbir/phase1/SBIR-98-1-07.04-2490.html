<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Successful development of combined cycle propulsion systems will help us obtain the economic and technical potential of airbreathing hypersonic vehicles operating in low earth orbit or at speeds higher than Mach 8.  Due to their mechanical strength, light weight, and high temperature properties, continuous fiber ceramic matrix composites (CFCCs) compose a class of materials that will enable integration of propulsion elements into combined cycledesigns.  Refractory Composites, Inc. (RCI) has recently developed processing technologies to fabricate CFCCs of the size and complex geometries required of such components.  In this proposed SBIR program,  RCI will work to demonstrate and define the applicability of CFCCcomponents in combined cycle propulsion systems.  Specifically, in Phase I we will fabricate larger sized panels (6"x 15" and 6" x 30") which will be exposed to Mach 7 to 8 scram-jet combustor operating conditions.  The testing, analysis and related design tasks will be provided by RCI's team members at no cost to the SBIR program.  In addition RCI will fabricate a complex shaped CFCC component and which can be used to demonstrate that its
structural strength is sufficient for hypersonic applications and fabrication of highly integrated CFCC flow path structures is feasible.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This SBIR effort will intimately entwined with ongoing vehicle engine development programs.  On a broader scale, much of the work completed during the SBIR program would have direct application to many other hypersonic air-breathing product areas in terms of CFCC property data, design methodologies and manufacturability.  Applications include TPSand leading edges for RLVs and reentry vehicles.

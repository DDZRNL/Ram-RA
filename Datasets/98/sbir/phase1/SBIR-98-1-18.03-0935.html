<B>PROJECT TITLE:</B> Protective Thin Film Coating for FEP Based Thermal Control Materials
<P>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Recent data has shown that FEP based Thermal Control materials need much more protection from the LEO environment than originally believed.  The combination of AO, VUV, and soft x-rays (from solar flares) deteriorates FEP materials and shortens the useful lifetime of satellite passive thermal control systems.  Astral Technology Unlimited, Inc. proposes a thin film coating that will protect FEP materials in LEO ensuring nominal performance throughout the designed lifetime of a spacecraft.

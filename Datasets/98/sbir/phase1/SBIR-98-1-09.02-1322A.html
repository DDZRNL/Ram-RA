<BLOCKQUOTE>
Miniaturized, multi-analyte sensors need to be developed for in- flight monitoring of the life support habitat.  In particular, analytical techniques that are gravity-independent, low power/mass, and are capable of broad-spectrum analysis are sought.  This project seeks to develop an electroanalytical instrument platform based on stripping voltammetry integrated with simple, gravity-independent sampling methods for a number of key compounds.  The proposed techniques will contain electronic self-calibration capabilities.  Phase I will consist of development of an analytical platform for quantification of trace contaminants in water, and demonstration of the technology to determine concentration of several metals, including biocidal silver, at the bench level.  Phase II will consist of development and delivery of low mass/power instrumentation that has multi- analyte capabilities for analysis of metals, non-metals, and certain classes of organic compounds at sub-ppb levels.  This technology is ultimately expected to have the potential for analysis of 30-40 analytes in a total package less than 1 kg.

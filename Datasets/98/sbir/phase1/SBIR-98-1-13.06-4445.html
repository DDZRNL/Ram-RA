This project addresses the development of novel atmospheric retrieval and corrections methodology for air- or space-borne hyperspectral imaging that is based on a robust physical propagation model.  Atmospheric retrieval is a classical inverse problem that we cast as a global optimization problem.  The differences between the model computation and the sensor measurements define an error function in the parameter space that will be minimized using a novel global optimization paradigm developed by the proposal team and recently published in Science Journal.  Moreover, sensor measurement uncertainties and model parameter uncertainties are incorporated using sensitivity matrices, in order to achieve a consistent overall reduction in uncertainties, to identify the most plausible solution and define probabilities.  
NASA"s Atmospheric Emission Spectrometer and AVIRIS flight data will be used for the algorithm development and testing.  The Modtran atmospheric propagation model will be numerically enhanced to compute gradients with respect to the atmospheric variables to improve computational efficiency.  The gradient enhanced code is utilized for an efficient solution of the inverse problem.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
New remote sensing applications appear each day.  Hyperspectral imaging allows now performing precision detection from air- or space-borne platforms.  To fully exploit such measurements, errors due to atmospheric interference must be removed.  Lack of independent measurements of the atmosphere"s local parameters does not allow for effective solution.  The proposed approach will be used to improve image exploitation for all users of hyperspectral imaging including agriculture and precision farming, detection of pollutants, etc.  OKSI is working with potential customers and end-users in the precision farming area that have expressed interested in the technology.

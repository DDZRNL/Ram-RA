<BLOCKQUOTE>
This program addresses the need for active component technologies, with integrated methods of controlling structural properties such as overall shape, vibration, fatigue, noise and aerodynamics among other properties.  New materials and processing techniques for sensors and actuators, and novel polymers and deposition methods for integration within composites and other structural materials will allow active flow control technology development.  The integration of these actuation methods within structural materials provides a basis for quantum advances in control of shape and surface properties of many advanced applications, especially in aircraft and spacecraft systems.  At the same time, resulting cost savings and performance improvements open up many commercial product opportunities in automotive and transportation/infrastructure applications. In this program, we propose to 1) develop a software model to predict multifunctional structure properties on a macro and microscale, 2) develop a new self-assembled monolayer technique for the fabrication of piezopolymer actuator and sensor films, and 3) use the model to predict the performance of multifunctional active structures on three size scales, including macro-scale actuated composites, meso-scale THUNDER-like actuators with novel material combinations, and micro-scale MEMS devices sensed and actuated with new ISAM fabricated piezopolymer films.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Products that will result from the proposed development effort include ISAM-based piezopolymers to replace conventional Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) and multifunctional actuated systems for use in adaptive optics, microflaps, microfluidics, and flat tooling composites.  Major U.S. process control companies and aerospace manufacturers indicate immediate and substantial needs for these products.  The novel multifunctional actuated systems have generated significant interest in the marketplace because they have superior specifications to conventional products and enable the manufacture of cost-effective novel devices (i.e., adaptive optics systems).

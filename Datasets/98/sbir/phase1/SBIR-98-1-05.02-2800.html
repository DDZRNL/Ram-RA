<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
     The proposed project is the design and production of a novel rotary diesel engine for General Aviation aircraft using the patented Rand-CamTM fluid compression cycle. The innovation is the design of a light weight (1.0 lb./hp), highly fuel efficient (<0.30 lb./hp-hr), multi-fuel, low-noise/low-vibration engine which will reduce aircraft manufacturing costs, improve light aircraft performance, reduce fuel consumption, reduce engine noise and exhaust emissions.  Phase I will evaluate a 125 BHP Rand Cam diesel engine, which has been developed as a stationary power unit, to determine the operating characteristics of the engine in typical airplane missions. Phase I effort will also include the preliminary design of a 225 BHP class engine, to be fabricated and tested in Phase II, to assure the suitability of the engine for GA aircraft missions. The proposed project is consistent with the objectives of Subtopic 05.02 to effect dramatic reductions in light aircraft engine acquisition and life cycle costs; operate on multi-grade fuels, reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions; reduce community and cabin noise, increase aircraft performance, safety, and reliability; and increase passenger comfort.  The project is also consistent with the goals of the NASA General Aviation Propulsion Program (GAP) and the NASA Small Airplane Transportation System (SATS).

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The direct commercial potential for the proposed project is the manufacture and sale of:· A general aviation airplane incorporating the proposed diesel rotary engine technology.
· Production and sale of rotary diesel engines to other light aircraft manufacturers.
· Production & sale of rotary diesel engines to other users such as marine & auxiliary power units. 
 	
 	Global Aircraft Corporation is currently certifying its GT-3 Trainer airplane under FAA Part 23 Regulations.  The Company is in the process of starting production of a revolutionary new composite propeller that has been developed under the NASA SBIR Program. The Company currently has available funding to construct the initial production facility by November 1998. Global has adequate financial reserves in the current credit facility to finance production of the Rand Cam rotary diesel aircraft engine to be developed and FAA certified in Phase II.	
 	
 	Assuming the goals of the Phase I and Phase II Projects are achieved, Global Aircraft will team with an existing engine manufacturer to FAA certificate, produce, and market the rotary diesel engine to both domestic and international aviation markets.  Several engine manufacturers have indicated an interest in producing the engine when it is proven technically feasible.  A recent market survey by the Company indicates that the potential marine market for such an engine is ten times larger than the aviation market.  This market does not require the expensive costs of FAA certification and offers a lower cost start-up market for the engine.  The lower start-up costs and increased production volume for the marine market will greatly benefit the aviation market by lowering production cost and spreading development and manufacturing tooling costs over a substantially larger market volume.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Yardney Technical Products, Inc. proposes a collaborative program to develop and demonstrate an innovative type of Li-ion battery based on a novel mixed metal oxide negative electrode material optimized to NASA's high specific energy (150 Wh/kg), high energy density (300 Wh/l) and high cycle life (>1000 cycles) requirements for future rechargeable batteries. The negative electrode material will offer the exceptional reversible capacity demonstrated with tin oxide (500-650mAh/g)   without the irreversible capacity that has limited the applicability of tin oxide anode materials. The novel negative electrode material will be based on a mixed inorganic phase of lithium silicon, tin and iron or magnesium. The proposed materials are more stable than the carbonaceous materials currently used in Li-ion cells, thus a system with improved stability is possible. Further, the materials will offer broad materials compatibility facilitating development of a technology with improved low temperature performance. To maximize the specific energy and energy density of the cell, advanced materials will be incorporated into all aspects of the cell design. The result will be a cell which will offer high cycle life characteristic of Li-ion technologies, but with much improved performance.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The phenomenal commercial success of Li-ion technologies throughout the consumer and industrial markets speaks to the potential for an improved Li-ion technology. The current Li-ion technologies have been accepted due to their high energy density and high cycle life despite their high cost and device specificity. The proposed technology will offer rate and cycle life performance comparable to the current Li-ion technologies with improved energy density thus will enjoy a unique competitive advantage. Yardney technical products has developed a true prismatic cell design which as been scaled to large cell sizes (30Ah). The proposed technology in a large prismatic design will provide improved performance for target applications including electric wheelchairs, electric scooters, electric vehicles and GEO satellite power.

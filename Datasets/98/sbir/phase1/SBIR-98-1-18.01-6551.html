<BLOCKQUOTE>
The  innovation of the proposed effort is an advanced loop heat pipe (LHP) radiator with a liquid and/or vapor heat exchanger, with porous/solid metal elements, integrated with the high heat flux LHP evaporator. Solid metal elements (metal posts on the wall) are joined together with porous metal elements (sintered), thus forming a composite structure, to provide both high local fluid-to-structure heat transfer and  high fin efficiency of the structure. The proposed heat exchanger design can also be used for CPL-radiators.The result of this effort will be a high-efficiency low-weight radiator with a heat exchanger capable of working directly with both single-phase and two-phase fluid flows. The mass reduction and volume reduction are due to the shorter and/or smaller diameter LHP evaporators with heat exchangers versus conventional LHP radiators, which is possible due to combining high heat flux LHP evaporators with the proposed porous metal heat exchangers. 
An experimental liquid-cooled LHP with a single-phase heat exchanger integrated with a high heat flux evaporator will be modeled, designed, built and tested in Phase I of this effort (two samples will be built).
Three full-size advanced LHP-radiators with the porous metal heat exchangers will be built in the Phase II. Three heat exchangers integrated with the LHP radiators will be connected in parallel and tested with single phase liquid, two-phase fluid flow and single-phase saturated vapor at the inlet to demonstrate the robustness of the design and the possibility of putting together arrays of the LHP radiators.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The commercial product related to this proposed effort is loop heat pipes with compact universal heat exchangers integrated with LHP evaporators, capable of working with single-phase liquid, two-phase flows and gas at the inlet. LHPs with compact heat exchangers will be used in thermal control systems of future space stations, aircraft anti-icing systems and, possibly, in electronics cabinets cooling.

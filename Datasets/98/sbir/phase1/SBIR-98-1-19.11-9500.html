<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Global Aerospace Corporation is proposing to develop a totally new concept for latitude trajectory control system (TCS) for NASA’s Ultra Long Duration (ULDB) Balloons. The advantages of the TCS concept are that it uses little power, operates at night, is lightweight, does not require detailed knowledge of the wind field, and allows the balloon to fly at a constant altitude. The TCS enables the balloon to avoid populous areas and hazards to payload recovery, reach desirable targets, steer around no-fly zones and select convenient landing sites. Currently, when a balloon deviates significantly from a desired flight path, cut down often occurs, sometimes before mission objectives have been met. With a TCS, fewer flights will be terminated early. Furthermore, it will be easier to obtain permission to launch since the planned flight path can be achieved in a greater range of conditions. No longer will balloons be at the mercy of the winds.
Phase I will define TCS system requirements, develop a conceptual design, develop performance models, and draft a prototype flight validation system specification. The prototype to be built in Phase II will demonstrate the operation of the TCS on an actual Scientific Balloon Program flight.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Global Aerospace Corporation retains a competitive advantage in all applicable commercial applications of the balloon TCS because we are the sole inventor of the concept. Many classes of balloon systems could benefit from the Global Aerospace Corporation balloon TCS. Beyond the NASA ULDB Program, some of the more obvious commercial applications of such a balloon TCS are:
• Conventional and Long Duration Scientific Ballooning (U.S. & foreign)
• In Situ Upper Atmospheric Sensing on Scientific Balloons
• Sport Balloons and Around the World Balloon Challenges
• Planetary Exploration

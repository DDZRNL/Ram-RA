<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Quantum Photonics will design and implement  broadened waveguide semiconductor laser amplifiers with small linewidth enhancement factors, will AR coat the laser facets, will use a low thermal impedance die attach technique to mount these laser amplifiers to ensure high reliability operation and will life test these devices. Operation at 830, 935, and 1572 nm will be demonstrated. These tapered laser amplifiers will produce several watts of power in a diffraction limited output.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 High power semiconductor optical amplifiers will find both military and commercial applications.  These include communication system applications such as satellite crosslinks and line-of-sight terrestrial links as well as remote sensing applications such laser radar, laser range finding/altimetry, lidar spectroscopy and laser illumination.  High power amplifiers are particularly attractive for spectroscopic applications for use in master-oscillator-power-amplifier (MOPA) configurations where high-power narrow linewidth sources are required.  For many applications, operation in the eye-safe 1.55 mm wavelength regime is desirable because it enables compatibility with readily available fiber optic telecommunications components.  Hence, 1.55 mm high-power diffraction-limited laser diodes sources have many other promising commercial applications including the growing fiber optic sensing and medical markets.

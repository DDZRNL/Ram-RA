<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The Nitrous Oxide Based Oxygen Supply System (NOBOSS) is a method for storing oxygen and nitrogen for EVA breathing and mobility. Nitrous oxide, N2O, is a common storable chemical that potentially could be used as a convenient, low cost, lightweight, safe and reliable source of oxygen and nitrogen.  A nitrous oxide atmosphere supply would have the following advantages: easier storage with greater density at much lower pressure, no cryogenic insulation problems, longer duration oxygen supplies with less weight, and much lower fire hazard than compressed or liquid oxygen. In the NOBOSS, nitrous oxide is decomposed via heating in a catalytic reactor, and as the decomposition is exothermic, the N2O will continue to decompose without further energy input. The NOBOSS can be used to supply breathing gas to existing 4.3 psi space suits by employing an air separation membrane or molecular sieve to eliminate the nitrogen. The waste nitrogen could then provide propellant gas for an MMU. Alternatively, the 2/3 nitrogen, 1/3 oxygen gas mixture produced by N2O dissociation is the ideal gas supply for an 8 psi space suit. In addition, expansion of stored liquid N2O produces cold gas that can be used to help cool a spacesuit.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 There are many potential commercial application of nitrous oxide based oxygen supply systems.  The greatest advantage in using this system would be that of lower weight and longer duration breathing supplies.  A nitrous oxide based oxygen supply system would provide an excellent source of long duration breathable atmosphere for space suits and for the cabins of spacecraft for long duration flights.  Other commercial applications would be for fire fighters and hazardous material personnel who would benefit by having much lighter weight tanks to carry around which contained a greater supply of oxygen.  Scuba divers who do not descend below 100 feet, but need to spend considerable time underwater, would also be potential beneficiaries of this system.

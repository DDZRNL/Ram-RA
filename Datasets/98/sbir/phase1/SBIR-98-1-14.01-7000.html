<BLOCKQUOTE>
The design of large aperture, high precision, optical telescopes, for operation in the space environment, requires detailed analytical models capable of resolving the coupled multiphysics phenomena affecting the performance of the instrument.  Thermal, mechanical and optical properties must be simultaneously considered in design analysis.  Normally, SRS engineers perform coupled thermomechanical/optical analysis using a suite of analysis tools that includes ALGOR (3-D finite element modeling), OPTICAD and BEAM4 (optical ray tracing), SINDA/G (finite difference thermal analysis) and TRASYS (orbital radiation exchange).  Although each of the software packages reside on a common workstation, each requires a separate input file for describing the system, and performing coupled analysis requires tedious manual exchange of analysis results between models.  SRS proposes developing software to fully integrate the analysis capabilities of the individual codes to provide the telescope designer with a greatly simplified tool for complete design of large space optics.  This innovative analysis tool does not exist in currently available software packages.  The integrated tool will allow a broader evaluation to be performed on all design options by eliminating the requirement to create multiple data sets for the same design configuration.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is a significant need in the development of large aperture space telescopes for accurate analysis prediction tools.  Meeting the stringent optical alignment tolerances necessary for a high quality telescope is one of the primary concerns for this applications.  The advantages of having the proposed tool to obtain the optical metrics of the telescope are ease of use and time savings.  The proposed program allows the user to utilize all the tools necessary for an integrated analysis without the pre- and post-processing requirements that are necessary at this time.  The capabilities of this software offer a distinct advantage over the time consuming methods currently employed to design large telescopes.  There is no software currently available on the market that combines the specific software tools required for this unique analysis.  The proposal is to make a commercially available software package, which will move SRS Technologies to the forefront of the market in state-of-the-art integrated optical design evaluation tools.  This tool will not only be desirable to large aperture space telescope designers but will also meet the needs of evaluators of terrestrial telescopes.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Recent achievements obtained in the formation of surface aluminum matrix composites (AMC's) for wear resistant applications using a CO2 laser have strongly indicated a very high potential of joining AMC's using new and more powerful YAG lasers.  Triton Systems, Inc. proposes to use a Nd-YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) laser associated with an innovative dual powder feed system to join AMC's. This process enables the bonding of hard to join AMC's and produces high quality bonds as the joint is composed of the same material as the parent AMC material.  Additionally, the resulting bond will have a minimal heat affected zone (HAZ) due to the localized heat of the Nd-YAG laser. It is believed that the successful development of this technique will lead to the economic fabrication of complex shaped metal matrix composites and therefore advance the application of MMC's to a new stage. When associated with other techniques in MMC production, laser MMC joining will make it possible and much easier to produce the components that have a complicated shape, and therefore will widen the area of the application of AMC's in future space vehicles.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The proposed technology will enable the cost effective entry of complex shaped high specific strength and stiffness metal matrix composites into large commercial markets.  In addition to rocket system components, potential applications include military and commercial gas turbine engines, automotive parts and high-end recreational sporting goods such as bicycle frame components.

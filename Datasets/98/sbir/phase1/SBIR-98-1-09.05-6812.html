<BLOCKQUOTE>
The novel in vitro Edible Muscle Protein Production System (MPPS) concept is designed to answer the human need for animal protein food in the Space voyager's diet. A successful MPPS will provide a palatable and reliable source of animal protein on prolonged missions lasting 3-5 years or longer and enhance crew morale, performance and productivity. The experimental concept includes an assessment of feasibility of recycling anticipated organic wastes generated during human tenure in Space into useable components of MPPS culture media. The Phase I effort will concentrate on producing fish muscle constructs in vitro engineered to yield products as close to in vivo as possible. Culture, molding and cooking techniques will be employed to this end. A test panel of fish eaters will evaluate the suitability of the experimental products. Phase II research will expand the effort to fowl and mammalian muscle constructs. This work will also impact on NASA's interest (08.01) in "tissue engineering systems which take advantage of microgravity to grow 3-D tissue constructs".

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
MPPS produced products will meld easily into the rapidly growing "organic/natural" food industry since production of the end product is more tightly controlled than is current commercial meat production in vivo. Those advocating zero slaughter of animals are also a rapdily growing population for MPPS products. Military, peace-keeping and other operations in remote areas, where re-supply is difficult, will provide customers for MPPS-type devices and facilities. The MPPS concept has applications in human biomedical tissue engineering, as well.

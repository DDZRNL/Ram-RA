This small business innovation research phase I project explores the fabrication of high sensitivity, room temperature, stable, miniaturized magnetometers to be ideally applied to measure the dc magnetic field in interplanetary space. Typically, the sensitivity of fluxgate magnetometers is strongly dependent on the noise level of Barkhausen jumps generated from the motion of domain walls upon the application of a drive field. We propose to fabricate fluxgate magnetometers using insulating instead of metallic magnetic films, such as single crystal YIG thick films. This would totally eliminate domain wall motion. As such, the sensitivity of the fluxgate magnetometer can be enhanced, up to a limit set by the intrinsic rotational motion of the magnetization vector. For the proposed research we will model the performance of an insulating fluxgate magnetometer and complete proof-of-concept experiments. We will test prototype devices upon completion of the modeling. This research will seek to provide low-cost room-temperature techniques that will facilitate the commercialization of the device so that high-performance low-noise magnetometer can find broader applicability in the sensor industries.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The fluxgate sensor continues to be the preferred transducer for magnetic field vector measurements, not only because the supporting electronics is fairly simple and reliable, but also because new developments in materials sciences continue to push the noise figure to its intrinsic quantum limit. It is now approaching the point where the fluxgate device becomes an attractive alternative to the more complicated and costly SQUID fluxmeter. Fluxgate magnetometers have been used in a variety of applications, such as magnetic air-borne detection, search and surveillance operations, nondestructive testing of materials, palaeomagnetism, and exploration of magnetic fields in space. The increased sensitivity of the proposed device can further increase its applicability, for example, in medical imaging sensor applications. Our proposed device would result in the highest sensitivity, and, hence, its application is unlimited.

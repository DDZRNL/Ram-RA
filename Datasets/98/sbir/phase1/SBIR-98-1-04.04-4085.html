<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Performance enhancement of next generation rocket propulsion systems can be achieved through the incorporation of components fabricated from high temperature, high specific strength materials, such as continuous fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMCs). Design and fabrication of many key propulsion components from CMCs which require thick-section and/or complex geometries has been limited by current manufacturing technologies. Successful implementation of the proposed processing technique will enable the fabrication of thick-section (>1") and/or complex geometry components from high fiber volume, continuous fiber-reinforced CMCs. The objective of this Phase I program is to develop and characterize a reaction-formed silicon carbide (SiC) joint between SiC-based CMC sections.  The resultant bond joint is expected to have strength, temperature, lifetime and environmental durability characteristics comparable to the CVI SiC matrix material.  Once the feasibility of the joining technique is established, multiple joints will be used to fabricate a bulk, thick-section (nominally 1"-2" thick) part for delivery to NASA for possible NDE and spin testing.  The joining parameters will be further optimized in the Phase II program concentrating on the fabrication of full-scale, complex component geometries.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The successful implementation of the proposed technology will enhance the design of SiC-based materials in a majority of current applications, and will enable their use in applications which are currently manufacturing limited. Increased manufacturing capabilities include fabrication of complex-shape, thick-section, large scale components; the joining of lower cost simple geometry components to create complex geometries; and the repair of existing components.  These attributes have wide ranging applications in all of the industries which require one, or a combination of, the following material properties for their components; low density, high strength, high temperature, wear resistance, low thermal expansion, nonvolatile, corrosion resistant/environmentally durable, and low observable. These industries include aerospace, energy, electronics, nuclear, transportation, chemical/petrochemical and the pulp and paper industry.  Specific thick-section components include turbine wheels and impellers for gas turbine engines, liquid propulsion rocket engines, slurry and other pumps with aggressive operating environments. Applications for joining include manifolds; manifold assemblies; tube to tube joining for ducting, turbine wheel/shaft assemblies, and space truss structures and platforms.

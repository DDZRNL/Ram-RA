<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 AJT proposes to develop an innovative, automated propellant auto-coupler system, which would be applicable for propulsion ground test facilities.  Our approach is similar to the Russian auto-coupler methodologies of simple, rugged and reliable approach.  The concept is a scaleable (0.5 to 12" diameter) system which incorporates the coupler, compliance device, motion mechanism, purging elements and all necessary sensors, valves and control mechanism.  The auto-coupler system will reduce the time and costs of engine test stand operations.  
Our recent experience in the design engineering of the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) launch facilities at Cape Canaveral Air Station provided an in-depth experience in the design and implementation of cryogenic control and delivery systems for next generation propulsion systems.  The methods developed should help to reduce required labor and associated costs for testing and launch facilities.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 A number of commercial applications exist for auto-coupler tasks including:  commercial aircraft refueling, refueling of alternate fuel vehicles (liquefied natural gas, liquid hydrogen, etc.).  We are pursuing commercial implementation of this system for EELV RD-180 rocket engine test stands.  There a number of other engine test stands which could benefit from this system as well.  This process can also be used for new launch vehicles and facilities.

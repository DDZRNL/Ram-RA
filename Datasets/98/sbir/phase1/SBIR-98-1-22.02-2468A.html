<BLOCKQUOTE>
 For space- and balloon gamma-ray spectroscopy applications detector choice is limited to a scintillator/photomultiplier tube (PMT) combination or high-purity Ge. Scintillator / PMT systems have many drawbacks, associated mainly with the PMT light sensor.  Considering all the technologies for replacing the PMT, we propose that the best potential for large photodetector active areas and improved energy resolution is a bold new approach to develop a new photodetector technology, namely: large-area silicon drift photodetectors (SDP) coupled to scintillators such as CsI(Tl) and others.  Preliminary results with this new technology suggest that large-volume scintillation spectrometers of 5% energy resolution at 662 keV are possible. With this new technology the following limitations of scintillation spectrometers can be addressed: 1) Compared to conventional PMT-based scintillator system, the innovation offers smaller overall size and weight without decrease in detection efficiency, 2) improved energy resolution, 3) superior ruggedness, and 4) cost comparable with the photomultiplier tube.   All of these factors relate to issues of critical importance in NASA space missions.  In Phase I we will explore the feasibility of achieving these goals.  In Phase II we would fabricate and demonstrate SDP based spectrometers with 2-inch by 3-inch NaI equivalency or better.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 New gamma-ray scintillation detectors based on solid-state replacements of the PMTs that offer improved resolution compared with PMTs, without the cryogenic requirements of Ge, would be used in many space based and terrestrial high energy physics and nuclear science applications which today use either PMT based detectors or Ge.  Other commercial applications are for nuclear contraband monitoring at customs and other inspection points.  A very large commercial market exists for the new detectors in the field of nuclear medicine. Because these devices are fabricated in silicon using similar processes to existing mass production silicon techniques the cost would also be attractive.

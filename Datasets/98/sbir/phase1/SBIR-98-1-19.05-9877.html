<BLOCKQUOTE>
An innovative system for cost-effective, ground-based testing of candidate spaccraft materials is proposed.  The objective of this project is to develop an automated test system for exposing material a simulated combined space environment (including ultraviolet (UV), vacuum ultraviolet (VUV), and particulate radiation), and analyzing the samples in-situ.  The effort will include developing automated, ultra-high vacuum (UHV) compatible sample manipulation devices and sample analysis systems.  Results of the Phase I effort will include final system requirements and concepts, sample manipulation and analysis schemes, and user interface and control software requirements.  These results will lead directly to a Phase II design and build effort.  An automated, ground-based test system will provide NASA significant savings in time and cost compared to traditional systems.  Because of reduced personnel levels and increased requirements for material testing, such a system will enable NASA to meet critical program goals in a cost effective and timely manner.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
      The commercial potential for an automated space environmental effects system extends across NASA, DoD, and private industry.  With materials being developed for new generations of spacecraft, a cost- and time-effective system for materials testing is essential for meeting critical program goals. A number of Government agencies and private companies could benefit from such a system.  The techniques developed in this effort could also be applicable outside the aerospace industry.  Various configurations of this system could be used whenever automated sample handling and analysis are required in a UHV environment.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Abnormal weather patterns have caused an increase in fatal natural disasters.  To save lives, a nationwide personal warning system for communities is urgently needed.  Detection technology in the last 10 years, but a distribution system which can deliver the timely disaster warning information to the right people, at the right time, within a community is not available.  The basic goals are:
- To warn more people of impending disasters such as weather.
- Economical use of existing satellites and pager/cellular technologies.
- To increase warning time prior to impending disasters.

The proposed project will be aimed at integrating and demonstrating innovative ideas in distribution and use of remote sensing data and information technologies which hold promise for emergency management and search & rescue missions through integration of web technology, the latest paging technologies, satellite communication, GIS (Geographical Information System), and state-of-the-art microelectronics.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The efforts will result a family of special pagers and mobile units with the capability to receive weather, routing and disaster information from NOAA, NASA and FEMA.  These mobile units are equipped with wireless communication, embedded Internet applications, and GPS capability.  The commercial potential is significant.  According to NOAA, Home Shopping Network sold 65,000 low-level weather radio in 2 hours due to the recent unpredictable weather and lives lost as a result.  Because the foreseeable commercial value, AirTouch, a leading paging company, has agreed to provide free air time for testing of the system and wants to commercialize the result.  The weather capability and GPS capability in handheld units such as pagers will also have significant commercial value in commercial fishing, boating, hiking, trucking, traveling/touring, weather in cockpit, etc.

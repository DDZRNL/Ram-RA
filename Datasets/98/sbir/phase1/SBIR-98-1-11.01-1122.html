<BLOCKQUOTE>
 SRL is proposing to develop a new technology that has application to gene and cancer therapies, and therapies for treating space mission crewmembers receiving unexpected bursts of ionizing radiation. This new technology will allow us to rapidly isolate and purify hematopoietic stem cells from peripheral blood. When administered, the isolated/purified stem cells completely regenerate the blood and immune system of humans subjected to high doses of ionizing radiation and chemical toxins including chemotherapeutic agents used in cancer therapy.  For these applications, it is essential to separate cells having nearly the same diameter in ex vivo suspensions of peripheral blood cells. In this new technique, larger biological cells in a suspension are irreversibly electroporated leading to cell death, while the smaller cells remain viable. The size resolution of this electric field cell selection process is critically dependent on electric field gradients in the suspension, which are driven by cell density variations, which, in turn, are driven by settling (gravity) effects.  Our calculations show that these gravity effects limit the size resolution of cell selection too greater than 1 micron. However, many critical applications of this technology require sub-micron resolution.  Sub-micron resolution can potentially be obtained in the microgravity environment of space.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This SBIR project will result in a breakthrough technology that will make possible the cost effective commercial isolation of the hematopoietic stem cell, which is the progenitor of all blood/immune system cells.  Stem cells are forming the basis of therapies for treating cancers and immune system failure after chemotherapy; gene therapies for AIDS and leukemia; and as countermeasures for naturally occurring (Ebola) or mankind inflicted biological insults (biological weapons). The commercial market for stem cell isolation systems is at least 0.5 billion dollars.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop a breakthrough technology for fabricating near-net shape, functionally graded continuous fiber ceramic matrix composites (CMCs).  CCI’s proposed technique consists of electrophoretic infiltration (EPI)of SiC and/or HfC nano-particles into the macropores of the carbon fiber preform, followed by CCI’s proprietary reverse thermal gradient chemical vapor infiltration (RTG CVI) process to densify a matrix that is functionally graded from C to SiC (Phase II will optimize alternative functionally graded matrices).  The nano-particle infiltration process will serve two key purposes; 1) it will fill the macropores in the carbon fiber preform and provide more surface area onto which matrix deposition can readily occur during CVI, thereby reducing processing time and cost, and 2) the SiC and HfC particles will act to increase the high temperature oxidation and erosion resistance of the CMC components.  The RTG CVI process will utilize a reverse thermal gradient through the fiber preform and pulsed pressure to preclude pore closure and accelerate inside-out matrix densification in approximately one tenth the time of conventional CVI.  The combination of the nano-particle infiltration and RTG CVI processes is expected to yield high density (>90%), functionally graded CMCs with superior physical properties.

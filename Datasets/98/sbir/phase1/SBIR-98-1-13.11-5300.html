<BLOCKQUOTE>
 tHC proposes a virtual satellite (VirtualSat) platform environment.  In this environment, enhanced functionality and autonomy of navigation, guidance and control systems is provided by a virtual satellite simulating its dynamic behavior.  Within this virtual environment, it shall be possible to execute any associated software that would benefit from the knowledge of and possible interaction with the virtual satellite for advanced software architectures and formation flying control development.  This provides an environment where flight software can be developed, verified and validated.  This environment shall be independent of the flight hardware that will eventually host the flight software.  This independence shall encompass the specific hardware implementation and its availability. The independence allows flight software to be developed in parallel with the flight hardware or even before the flight hardware.  The flight software coded in C/C++ shall be compilable and loadable into the VirtualSat and will not require any special modifications.  Therefore, VirtualSat provides an innovative, low cost testbed development capability for multiple spacecraft control for master/slave strategies.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Any organization both large and small will be able to benefit from this virtual satellite environment.  Its generic capabilities allow it to be used to in-expensively verify control system designs, control system software, and overall satellite performance.  Through the use of OOD technology a satellite can be constructed starting with simple generic sensors and actuators.  This simulation models an ideal and becomes a generic truth model for further development of the satellite.  As the design progresses, specific sensor and actuator models replace the generic design.  The simulation then models the specifics.  The virtual satellite can be used as a test platform for flight s/w or as a core element for visualizing the performance of the satellite. 
A key aspect of VirtualSat will be its OOD.  Modeling elements shall be intelligent, allowing generic as well as specific satellite implementations to be simulated.  The VirtualSat environment is a useful tool for systems designers, analysts and software engineers.

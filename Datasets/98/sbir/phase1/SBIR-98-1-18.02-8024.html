<BLOCKQUOTE>
A high performance asymmetric-type supercapacitor exploiting the exceptional properties of nanostructured materials to yield both high power density and high energy density is proposed. Specifically, US Nanocorp’s developmental nanoscale gamma-phase manganese dioxide, MnO2,and a carbon nanofiber under development at Florida Atlantic Univ. (Prof. S. Lipka) are expected to play a synergistic role in the fabrication of a high voltage supercapacitor with specific energy expected to achieve 20 Wh/kg and power density in excess of 5-10 kW/kg.  The electrochemical couple formed from an exceptionally high surface area carbon nanofiber electrode (400 m2/g), in combination with a nanoscale gamma-MnO2 electrode is expected to result in a high voltage device with a fast charge/discharge response (> 100 Hz).  JME, Inc., a leader in supercapacitor design and modelling, will assemble and pre-test bipolar asymmetric supercapacitor cells, and will deliver proven cells to EnergizerR, who will do a complete performance verification of  prototype bipolar cells.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Key critical applications of high performance supercapacitors include hybrid electric vehicle (HEVs), portable pulse power (especially GSM-enabled mobile phones), memory backup, and UPS applications.  The low cost inherent to the proposed nanostructured active materials should enable widespread applications, including consumer devices.

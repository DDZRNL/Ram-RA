<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Amain Electronics Company has developed a cost effective digital readout and digital display technology for cameras. The technique offers low noise, great sensitivity, wide dynamic range, low power consumption, and small size. NASA requires a small telerobotic flying camera for ISS inspection by the crew. Amain's new camera technology offers less power and smaller size for both the imager and the display than previous technologies. Using the most popular analog to digital conversion technique in use today, Sigma Delta, Amain is the first company to consider its use for digital camera systems.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Besides offering smaller size, and less weight, Amain's camera system is cost effective. This award aims at designing a telerobotic flyimg camera that also could be a cornerstone design for a video conferencing system. The technology could result in an affordable system using existing phone lines for transmission with new compression algorithms developed at Amain. The application is large. The need exists. The limits today are bandwidth and cost. This development should overcome these barriers and provide the first competitive video conferencing system on the market.

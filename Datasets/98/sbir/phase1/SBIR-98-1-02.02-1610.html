<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Currently the engine companies have no reliable means for estimating and projecting the cost of the High Speed Civil Transport(HSCT) propulsion 
system. While HSCT development efforts concentrate on performance of 
component demonstrators and slave hardware made from conventional materials
affordability and producibility issues have yet to be addressed. Studies 
conducted by NASA and industry between 1987 and 1989 (ref. 1 & 2) 
indicated that a substantial market for HSCT exists early in the next 
century provided the plane is environmentally friendly and the fare 
premium over a subsonic does not exceed 20%. The latter depends, to a 
significant extent on acquisition affordability. In order to get a handle 
on affordability, a tool that could provide the design community a quick 
way of assessing cost and evaluating impact of design changes on cost is 
highly desired. An endorsement of this effort by the GEAE-HSCT Project 
Office (p.22) and allowing a link-up with the engine team underscores the 
importance of this innovation. Due to the presence of new materials, 
unique manufacturing processes, and challenging applications whose 
economics has not been modeled before, this program will be breaking new 
ground. In addition, manufacturing process oriented approach captures 
opportunities for cost reduction/avoidance, an imperative for targeting 
affordability.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The HSCT Engine Cost Assessment Program will result in an enabling technology for the HSCT propulsion system permitting the design community 
to view cost as a variable during numerous design studies.This technology 
will quickly find home with the OEMs and have a favorable impact on 
affordability of the HSCT propulsion system. Phase I (conducted in close 
collaboration with the engine team) will demonstrate the concept of a user-
friendly system, that can estimate cost by inputting physical parameters, 
normally available in the early phases of product development. In Phase 
II, we envision development of a stand-alone system for use by the HSCT 
engine OEMs and technology vendors. In Phase III, two products are to be 
targeted: Adapating this system for use by the turbine industry (code 
named CAC-Computer Aided Costing), and a second product to be integrated 
with CAD systems like Unigraphics, Auto Desk, Parametric Tech, etc. (code 
named C3AD-Cost Conscious Computer Aided Design) therby pushing the state 
of the art of design technology to a new frontier.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is a proposal to build a suite of visualization tools fordebugging and validating distributed autonomous systems.  These tools
will let the developer debug distributed, running autonomous systems
as they interact with the real world.  The cumbersome process of
monitoring and displaying system data, modifying this data in real
time and collecting the data for future analysis has often rested on
application-specific code written by developers as they debug their
autonomous systems.  Traditional software debugging tools are not
designed for distributed autonomous systems as these traditional tools
often involve setting breakpoints or stopping a program while it is
running, which is not possible with programs interacting autonomously
with the real world.  Our tools will allow for real-time data
collection analysis and display, and will be tailored for distributed
autonomous systems.  These tools will greatly increase the efficiency
of autonomous system designers and increase the reliability and safety
of deployed autonomous systems.  In developing these tools, Metrica
Inc. will be working closely with consultant Reid Simmons of Carnegie
Mellon University.  Dr. Simmons' experience with autonomous systems
and interprocess communication and Metrica's experience in fielding
space systems for NASA JSC create an ideal team to complete this
project successfully.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The increasing prevalence of automated systems, both robotic and other computer-controlled, makes it vital to provide effective tools for the development, debugging, testing, and verification of these systems.  The suite of visualization tools produced by this project will be an important part of the complete autonomous control architecture being developed by Metrica Inc.  Also, our data visualization tools will be generic and widely applicable.  Thus, these tools will be a powerful addition to any autonomous system developer's toolkit.

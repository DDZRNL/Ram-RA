<BLOCKQUOTE>
NASA seeks to develop advanced sensors for new and improved measurements of molecular composition of planetary atmospheres.  These in-flight sensors must not place heavy demand on system resources such as power, weight, volume, and cost,  particularly in the future solar system exploration missions. Mars is an important target of NASA exobiology research for understanding the origin and evolution of life.  The research needs include the analysis of Martian atmosphere for the isotopic abundance of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphor, sulfur, carbon dioxide, and methane. Gemfire Corporation proposes to develop a compact, solid-state, room-temperature, 4.3-micron tunable integrated optical sensor for isotopic ratio measurement of CO2 over a wide range of background pressure and temperature.  The sensor will employ a miniature three-stage channel waveguide frequency mixer pumped by two monolithic diode lasers.  In Phase I, we will prove the feasibility of our approach by building a laboratory instrument with output power and tuning range sufficient for isotope ratio measurement with 1% accuracy.  In Phase II, a 0.1% measurement accuracy will be achieved in a deliverable, optimized, compact, battery-powered sensor prototype built with commercial off-the-shelf components.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Compact instruments based on the Phase II prototype will become effective in high-volume, cost-sensitive commercial applications such as emissions monitoring in mining and drilling; air quality control in large buildings, hospitals, and aircraft;  traffic, agricultural, and landfill emissions monitoring; and combustion diagnostics in aircraft propulsion systems.

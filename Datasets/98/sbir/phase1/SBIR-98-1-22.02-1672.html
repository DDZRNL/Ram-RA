<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Advanced detectors and detector arrays for high energy sensing can significantly benefit from the availability of small, low-noise, wire bondable resistors with less than 4% resistance changes from room temperature to 1 K.  Similarly resistor arrays can reduce the bulk and simplify the circuitary in high energy detector arrays.  Currently, the real estate needed for the resistors is large and the reliability over large temperature range is low.  This effort seeks to develop resistors that overcome these limitations.  Phase I will establish the proof-of-concept.

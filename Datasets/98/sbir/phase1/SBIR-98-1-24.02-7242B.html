<BLOCKQUOTE>
 We propose to develop a new class of Web-based groupware that supports a much broader range of collaborative activities than previously possible. The new capabilities that we envision will support scientific inquiry and planning by enabling whole teams to participate in coordinated information discovery and evaluation. Our WebMediator system will leverage the existing work in computer supported collaborative work (CSCW) to provide for virtual meeting activities such as brain storming, planning, and decision making. In addition, we will draw on our experience with machine learning and human-computer interaction techniques in order to provide for effective collaborative Web browsing. Collaborative Web browsing will greatly facilitate group problem solving by qualitatively altering the ability of groups to quickly and more thoroughly uncover information on which decisions will be based. As an added benefit, the diverse stimulus available on the Web combined with the collaborative nature of the search will provide for more creative problem solving. By playing the role of bookkeeper and moderator, WebMediator will allow groups of users to more fully apply their cognitive abilities to the problems at hand. We will prove the feasibility of our approach by developing and demonstrating a proof-of-concept prototype in Phase I.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The techniques developed for NASA in the course of this project will be equally applicable to the multitudes of distributed teams of researchers, designers, planners, and managers that exist in today's networked work environments. Additionally, the WebMediator collaborative browsing architecture will be applicable to Web tutoring services.

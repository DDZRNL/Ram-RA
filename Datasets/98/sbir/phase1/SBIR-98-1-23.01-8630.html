<BLOCKQUOTE>
The proposal for Phase I funding will perform preliminary design and development of a X-Band, power efficient, low operating voltage, radio telemetry transponder. Availability of this type of equipment is primarily required in very small Earth orbiting satellites.  Such transponders transmit and receive commands and data to and from Earth, or in certain situations from or between other satellites.  Development of a transponder such as this is considered innovative due to the lack of any known commercial source for space qualified telemetry equipment that can fulfill this need with the attributes required for very small Earth orbiting satellites.  These include a high scale of integration, a very low mass and volume, a high level of power efficiency, and the ability to operate from low voltage supplies of 3 to 7 VDC.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The development of a miniature, highly power efficient telemetry transponder will contribute to a new generation of nanospacecraft. Presently, RF communications for these very small satellites present a huge stumbling block, due to their physical size, power requirements, cost, and long lead time for available hardware. Small transponders and component transmitters and receivers for this class of satellite should not have to be a large-scale development issue. The opportunity to develop a generic RF transponder and component transmitters and receivers is a unique commercial opportunity for a small, growing company focused on making this class of spacecraft a success.  In addition, AeroAstro will make subsequent RF component sales to other builders of micro/nanosatellites.  A small number of transponders manufactured per year will drive purchase prices down by a factor of ten.  Through the aid of a Phase I for development and a subsequent Phase II for the manufacture of prototype quantities, AeroAstro will be able to open up these small niche markets for telemetry transponders and RF components, as well as aid our own Bitsy program offering spacecraft development, components, and design assistance for micro/nanosatellite development within the community.

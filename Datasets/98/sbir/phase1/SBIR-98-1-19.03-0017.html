<BLOCKQUOTE>
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed toward the development of a low cost NiCoCrAlY coating on nickel based superalloy substrates by electrocodeposition.  Presently used methods such as electron beam- physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) or low-pressure plasma spraying (LPPS) require expensive equipment and sometimes result in high reject rate.  In contrast to the above processes which are operated at high temperatures, the proposed electrochemical codeposition of alloy particles in a metallic matrix can be carried out below 60 degrees Celsius.  Electroplating is an attractive method of producing metal coatings.  Electrocodeposition is an alternative in the field of composite coatings and it combines the advantages of metal electroplating with those of composite materials to produce low cost coatings, with the ability to vary the microstructure of the deposited coatings by adjusting process parameters.  Lynntech has obtained positive preliminary results on such electrocodeposited coatings with respect to their enhanced oxidation and corrosion resistance. It is proposed to characterize the electrodeposited bond coat- homogeneity, porosity, adherence, uniformity from batch to batch , and oxidation resistance by direct comparison with existing bond coats made by conventional techniques.

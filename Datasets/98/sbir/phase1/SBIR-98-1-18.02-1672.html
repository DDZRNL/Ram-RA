<BLOCKQUOTE>
Effective energy storage is a key issuer of NASA space power system. Secondary batteries are considered as candidates for the portable and rechargeable energy storage. The primary criteria for rechargeable batteries are high energy density and low cost. NASA's goal is to increase battery energy density over Ni-Cd (60 Wh/kg) and Ni-H2, (61 Wh/kg) and retain hundreds of cycles. Although, current Ni-LaNi5 type hydride battery already hits the energy density of 67 Wh/kg and life of 300 cycles, Nanomaterials Research Corporation (NRC) seeks to develop and demonstrate Ni-Mg batteries with more than 300 Wh/kg energy density using innovative materials and surface engineering. Phase I will systematically establish the proof-of-concept; Phase II will optimize, scale-up and fabricate prototype batteries for power supply applications; Phase III will commercialize the technology.

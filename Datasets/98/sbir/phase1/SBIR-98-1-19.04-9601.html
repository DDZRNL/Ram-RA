<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Advanced Analysis Package for High Speed Multi-Bearing Shaft Systems for rolling bearing supported rotors has Unique Features and Capabilities typical of industries current design needs. Among these are loosely coupled interfaces with commercial FEA codes for thermal and deformation/distortiondata and an innovative stress based discrete stressed volume probablistic life estimation that includes Hertzian Contact, press fit, centrifugal, residual and edge stress. A Windows 95/98/NT User Interface will facilitate data input and results preview via plot templets and 3-D color contour surface plots. Design optimization would be aided with Interactive Graphical "work spaces" . Phase I will produce a demonstrator version for a single high speed cylindrical roller bearing with crowned rollers. Phase II would expand these features into high speed ball, tapered and spherical bearing supported rotor analysis to provide enhanced innovative design tools for selection, life and optimization of critical bearing systems.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The high speed multi-bearing shaft systems analysis package developed under this project has unique features and capabilities not present in today's commercially available marketplace codes. This package will allow designers of critical bearing systems to reduce product cycle time, improve reliability and reduce weight. Aerospace, defense, machine tool spindle, commercial turbomachinery, pump and motor manufacturers, to name a few, can benefit from application of this technology.

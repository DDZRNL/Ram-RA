<BLOCKQUOTE>
An innovative integrated design tool using unstructured grid method with solution-adaptation and parallel computing strategy is proposed to predict the base heating and plume radiation. The CFD flow field with solution-adaptation and viscous/turbulence effects will be used for the heat transfer and fluid flow analyses. The proposed unstructured grid method can import grids from computer aided design (CAD) geometry and will simplify the grid generation and grid adaptation procedures for the numerical simulation of flow field around complicated geometries. Computational efficiency will be highly enhanced through parallel computing using multiple CPUs or network computers. Test cases of fluid flow and radiative heat transfer problems under limited conditions will be investigated in the Phase I effort. Complex three-dimensional analysis, the solution-adaptation procedure and user friendly graphics interface will be fully integrated with CAD systems in the Phase II proposal. The basic study and development of the proposed unstructured grid CFD method will enhance the cost effectiveness of the design and evaluation of fluid flow and heat transfer processes for launch vehicles.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The proposed integrated tool will significantly benefit the areas in which complex radiative heat transfer processes and fluid flow are involved. The technology to be developed in this SBIR project will be very useful in commercial applications for the design and analysis of advanced launch vehicle and propulsion systems. The other immediate applications can be found in the evaluation of the performance of gas turbine combustor, automobile combustion engine and industrial furnace etc.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This research will develop techniques in the areas of scheduling, planning and security that will enable distributed operations of multiple cooperative robots.  The primary innovations of this work are the significant extension of the goal-driven control algorithms and plan-merging techniques for automatic generation of efficient, coherent, and robust plans for cooperative robots.  The automated planner will also schedule the tasks so that the generated plans are guaranteed to meet the timing, resource, and safety constraints imposed by the coordination of multiple robots.
Controlling cooperative robots has become important because many industrial applications, such as containers transshipment tasks in harbors and airports, require the team effort of multiple robots to support and complement each other.  At the same time, the proposed techniques have direct NASA application for planetary rover missions which require the cooperation of multiple robotic systems, such as 1) mobile rover and its lander base, 2) mobile rover and its communication orbiter, and 3) multiple mobile rovers.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Cooperative multi-robots are necessary for tasks that require a team effort in which team members support and complement each other.  The resulting technologies will provide automated scheduling and planning capabilities for controlling such cooperative robots.  Potential commercial applications include material handling, remote mining, firefighting, and waste cleanup.  All these applications can benefit from multiple cooperative robots.  The resulting technologies will also be useful to military applications for controlling multiple unmanned aerial or ground vehicles.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
NASA has expressed a need for innovative fabrication methods for diffractive optical elements (DOE's). Such innovations are needed to fully exploit the inherent possibilities of DOE's to increase performance and to reduce the size, weight, and cost of optical systems. A prevalent limitation of diffractive technology is the inability to fabricate diffractive components on curved surfaces.
Digital Optics Corporation is proposing an innovative, low cost approach for fabrication of micro-optical components on curved surfaces. The proposed fabrication method offers the possibility of inexpensive production of micro-optics on non-planar surfaces over large areas for such applications as imaging spectrometers, lens systems, anti-reflection structures on conformal windows, and many others. This Phase I effort will demonstrate the fabrication of micro-optical elements on curved surfaces. Both analytical and experimental work will be performed to verify the objectives of the proposed project.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Research performed under this Phase I effort will provide fundamental support for the inexpensive fabrication of micro-optical structures on curved surfaces. These types of optical components can be used for imaging spectrometer systems, computed tomography, aberration correction, anti-reflection structures on widows for advanced sensors, and a host of other applications.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Altair Center proposes to develop a portable battery operated laser diode system for minimally-invasive surgery and other applications during extended duration NASA missions. It will generate light at two different wavelengths of 980 and 810 nm performing simultaneous tissue cutting and blood coagulation. The system will operate in CW or pulsed regime with variable repetition frequency. Two versions of the system suitable for different applications will be developed: the system generating 10 W of average power delivered via a 50 micron fiber and the system generating 30W of power delivered via 100 micron fiber. Combination of a number of revolutionary new technologies incorporated in the system design provides its high performance and power efficiency. This includes power efficient laser diode operation, efficient laser-to-fiber pigtailing and laser beam combining. The portable laser diode system having a laptop computer size, build-in memory for recording information on medical procedures and convenient digital control interface is suitable for many other field applications. As a multi-use system it can also be applied for material processing, cutting and drilling, soldering, micro-welding and sintering.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The portable battery operated laser diode system which is to be developed during the project will have a universal and flexible design. It is an excellent candidate as a product in several markets, including:  medical surgery, diagnostic and therapy, industrial cutting and welding, diode pump systems for parametric frequency conversion or doubling, diode pump systems for optical fiber lasers and amplifiers, etc.

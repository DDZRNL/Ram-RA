<BLOCKQUOTE>
This project will develop robust filtering algorithms and implementation for high precision tracking and pointing systems. The platform motion estimation and prediction algorithms, H&#61605; robustification algorithms, fuzzy logic based estimation enhancement, and factorized filter implementation are integrated seamlessly to ensure the performance and robustness of the tracking filter. The filter robustness against disturbances and uncertainties is emphasized. The extended Kalman filter is robustified by the H&#61605; techniques in the sense that the worst case performance is guaranteed. Fuzzy logic is introduced in a two-step measurement updating scheme which can potentially account for part of the errors involved in the modeling process, to further improve the robustness and performance of the estimator. A square root filter implementation is developed to alleviate the numerical problem, which accommodates the H&#61605; filter and the fuzzy enhancement. The algorithms, approaches, and techniques developed in this project will be applied to the image-based tracking and pointing testbed in our laboratory. The research and development results in a commercial product, the Robust Filtering Toolbox, which has the potential for wide applications to various areas.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 To address the NASA requirement for high temperature (350 oF, 60,000 hours) RTM resins Eikos has assembled a world class team of product development specialists that is best qualified to evaluate and develop processable, state-of-the-art, RTM / RFI resin systems based on the NASA Langley low viscosity PETI-5 or PERA-1 resin.  Eikos LLC will rapidly push the development and qualification of a 350oF RTM / RFI system into a commercial product with the use of private-sector investment.  For end-user qualification Eikos LLC has teamed with McDonnell-Douglas to evaluate these resins in RTM and S/RFI (stitched resin film infusion) panels.  Mr. Corey Arendt, (Boeing/MDC) will oversee the fabrication of composite panels / parts, along with neat resin samples of 3 structural variants of the NASA PERA-1 RTM resin and enhancement of the curing package for enhanced toughness and additional thermo-oxidative stability.  Mr. Piche is currently involved in the development and evaluation of high temperature RTM and RFI resins for a prime defense contractor and WPAFB, Materials Lab. In addition to providing a thorough evaluation of these PERA-1-based resin systems (TOS, DMA, TGA, hygrothermal testing) we will test these resins with the MDC proprietary stitching technology, (the state-of-the-art in Z direction reinforcement) for Damage Tolerance Improvement.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The development of this novel resin system will allow for the low cost fabrication of advanced composite parts with complex geometries.  This is an enabling technology that will reduce the weight of key aircraft components required to endure the increasing thermal requirements of advanced aircraft designs.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As a preliminary step towards the development of a low-cost portable Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation (AIR) Dosimeter for use by aircrews and frequent travelers aboard a future supersonic transport and on current subsonic airliners, a number of different passive and active ionizing radiation detectors will be investigated. Instrumentation and Methodology developed to meet NASA's radiation dosimetry needs aboard the Space Shuttle and on unmanned satellites is well suited for adaptation to dosimetry needs aboard both supersonic and subsonic aircraft. The complex composition of the radiation environment at stratospheric altitudes makes it unlikely that a single detector type will adequately measure all of the radiation components. In Phase I a complimentary selection of passive and/or active detectors will be sought that measures those particle species, in the energy ranges present at high altitudes, that are known to be of greatest risk to human health. Mass and volume constraints, ease of use, power consumption, and costs of manufacturing, processing and data analysis for each detector type will also be assessed. An initial market study is included in Phase I. In Phase II a functional prototype of the AIR Dosimeter will be developed, flight-tested and demonstrated to potential customers and investors.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The primary commercial market for an AIR Dosimeter is the airline industry. An AIR Dosimeter would be used to monitor personnel radiation exposure of pilots and flight attendants aboard future High Speed Civil Transport aircraft and who routinely fly routes at Northern latitudes aboard subsonic aircraft. Additional customers may include the United States Air Force and individual pilots, flight attendants, and frequent travelers who are concerned about the health risks associated with their radiation exposure.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Quality Research Associates proposes developing a software tool to automatically generate interface code that integrates user applications 
with object-oriented (OO) modules from a library of software fault 
tolerance techniques.  The approach involves generating high-level, OO code 
for inclusion in an application.  The tool-produced code includes subclass 
specifications and shells, as well as code that describes the application 
scenario to the appropriate fault tolerance technique executive from the 
library.
   The approach’s key innovations include automatically generating subclass 
shells, generating ‘infrastructure’ code to facilitate application 
integration, providing structured ‘hints’ within stub code comments to aid 
users, and designing the automated code generation tool to work in 
conjunction with a reusable code library and a Software Fault Tolerance 
Design Assistant (SWFTDA) tool for selecting fault tolerance techniques.
   By automating tedious integration coding, the proposed technology would 
remove a significant obstacle to using the library of software fault 
tolerance techniques, especially for legacy systems that are not designed 
around OO constructs.   Automating integration code generation and 
combining it with existing library and design utilities creates a powerful, 
end-to-end system that speeds development, reduces coding errors and 
increases developer productivity.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The technology assists system developers using software fault tolerance techniques for high-reliability computer systems, such as systems for 
commercial aircraft, plant control, medical device control, and transaction 
systems.  Our approach provides an important part of an end-to-end 
development tool for fault-tolerant applications.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This SBIR Phase I Research Proposal seeks to develop a new phenomena, high pressure electrokinetic (HPEK)pumping, for the development of high force, compact, and low power consumption actuators suitable for a variety of aerospace applications.  The Phase I Research will demonstrate the utility of HPEK-based systems by combining them with micromachined structures to effectively translate the high pressure hydraulic flow into usable work.  Specific applications are outlined which can employ HPEK technology, including an ultra-compact rock crushing device.  The key actuator system for this device will be constructed and tested in order to assess the feasibility for use in sample retrieval and handling systems.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The potential for aerospace as well as commercial applications based on the HPEK technology described in this proposal is extremely broad and significant.  These electrokinetic-based liquid pumps open the door for an entirely new class of compact devices for robotics and other applications.

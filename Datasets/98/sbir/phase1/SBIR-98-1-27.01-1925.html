<BLOCKQUOTE>
A new technique to fabricate ultra-lightweight glass mirrors using high-velocity abrasive-waterjets (AWJs) is proposed for the milling of pockets in glass blanks.  In a previous NASA Phase I SBIR program, it was successfully demonstrated that the AWJ milling process could be used for the lightweighting of glass materials.  The AWJ milling process is basically a stenciling process—an AWJ is rastered across a masked workpiece (where the mask contains the lightweighting pattern), and the unmasked areas are milled to precisely controlled depths.  This program will focus on improving the material removal rates, developing techniques to reduce wall taper, developing three-dimensional methods to mill plano-concave mirror blanks, and simplifying the masking strategy.  Several demonstration parts will be produced, an economic analysis will be conducted, and the process will be compared with other lightweighting methods.  Both Zerodur and ULE glass will be used in this study.  The demonstration part requirements will be obtained from NASA, Eastman Kodak, and Composite Optics, and the milled demonstration parts will be inspected by Kodak and Composite Optics.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This project will result in a new low-cost and high-speed technique for lightweighting mirrors.  Economical and technical benefits will be gained over existing methods.  Small- to large-scale mirrors can be lightweighted for government and commercial needs.  This milling process is well suited for mass production, where multiple mirror programs, such as Teledesic, can benefit.  The milling process can be applied to a wide variety of materials such as beryllium, silicon carbide, ceramics, and composites.  Outside the optics community, this process can be applied to the electronics, aerospace, automotive, and aircraft industries where the lightweighting of difficult-to-machine materials is used.

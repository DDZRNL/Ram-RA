<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The quality of retrieved surface spectral reflectance from hyperspectral imagery depends critically on the accuracy of the atmospheric compensation and surface retrieval algorithms.  This proposal addresses the need for an accurate, robust, and efficient means for algorithm validation.  The use of field measurements for algorithm validation is expensive, time-consuming, and it is very difficult to provide full and accurate supporting ground truth data for the surface and atmospheric properties.  We propose to develop high model fidelity hyperspectral image simulation software based on a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo approach for modeling 3D atmospheric radiative transport as well as 2D spatially inhomogeneous surfaces including Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function effects.  The computed hypercubes can serve both as a substitute for and also as a supplement to field validation data.  The approach is capable of treating both land and ocean surfaces and the effects of finite clouds with surface shadowing.  The Phase I technical objectives are (1) model development and implementation, (2) hyperspectral image simulation, and (3) analysis and algorithm validation.  In Phase II a fully generalized approach will be implemented based on a parallel processing PC architecture.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The commercial product is the computed hypercubes, which are intended for algorithm development and validation for the multitude of hyperspectral and multi-spectral satellite and aircraft sensors under development by DoD, NASA, and commercial companies.  These sensors span a diverse range of applications such as target detection and identification, precision agriculture, mineral exploration, forest management, ocean resource mapping, and surface pollution detection.  There is also potential application to climatological research on atmospheric radiation budget assessment via coupled analyses of ground, aircraft, and satellite based sensor data.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This proposal describes a novel optical fluid quality sensor (OFQS) and the objectives to produce a prototype sensor for in-line use in a cryogenic test facility.  The OFQS is non-intrusive and capable of instantaneous indication of the presence of two phase flow.  In addition, the fully developed sensor will be capable of determining relative concentrations of several different fluids and/or gases which may be present. Response time of the sensor will be capable of monitoring flow rates in excess of 17,000 gpm in cryogenic rocket engine test facilities. 

During Phase I a proof-of-concept experiment will be performed to validate the basic principle of operation.  The results of phase I will feed directly into the development of a working prototype sensor to be developed in Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The proposed OFQS will find applications in many government, civilian and military test stand facilities where fluid phase and quality are a concern.  In addition, the sensor could be used anywhere that fluid clarity or relative concentrations of different fluids need to be monitored such as in the medical or beverage industry.

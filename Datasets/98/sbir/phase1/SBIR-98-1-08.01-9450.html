<BLOCKQUOTE>
NASA will require highly automated and low power monitoring and control to support long-term bioprocessing in the space environment The proposed innovation entails microfabricated sensors based on hydrous Ir oxide anodically formed on Ir thin film microelectrodes. These films can be used both as high surface area amperometric electrodes and as pH electrodes. We have shown further that these oxides can be grown to encapsulate and protect a range of enzymes and probably other large biomolecules (antibodies, DNA strands, co-factors, etc.). Using this approach, amperometric and potentiometric biosensors can be prepared simply and economically on microfabricated thin film Ir arrays. Multifunctional electrochemical biosensors can be made "on a chip" for monitoring O2, CO2, H2O2 and a wide range of enzyme substrates, including glucose, lactate, urea and amino acids. The goal of Phase I is to demonstrate a long-lived microfabricated Ir oxide electrochemical sensor/biosensor array for monitoring a group of analytes typical to cell culture production in a typical culture medium. Phase II will integrate this array into a micro-total analytical system for noninvasive monitoring and control of a HARV or STLV bioreactor, and/or a NASA in-house system.

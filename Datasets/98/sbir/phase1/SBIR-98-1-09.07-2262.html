<BLOCKQUOTE>
The thermodynamic state of the cryogenic fluid in a storage and supply system cannot readily be determined using closed-form solutions or simple iterative techniques.  Detailed knowledge of the heat energy into and out of the system, fluid inflow and outflow, thermal capacity and elasticity of the storage vessel, and the thermodynamic properties of the cryogenic fluid at each instant of time are necessary.  To adequately define the time-varying-cryogenic fluid state requires a complex computer code that simultaneously calculates these variables and iterates quasi-steady-state solutions at each instant of time.
Technology Applications, Inc. (TAI) is proposing to develop a unique PC-based computer code that couples fluid property equations of state, heat transfer, pressure vessel structural and thermodynamic analysis.  This software will provide the cryogenic systems engineer a key tool that allows him to rapidly and accurately model the behavior and performance of complex cryogenic systems that operate over the terrestrial, space, and Martian environments.

The software that TAI is proposing to develop is critical to the analysis and design of the cryogenic storage and supply systems for near-term NASA programs, such as Non-Toxic OMS/RCS Upgrade, In-Situ Propellant Generation, and reusable launch vehicles.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Commercially available cryogenic system analysis programs do not exist.  A personal computer based tank analysis program, with accurate fluid property routines, is essential for conducting parametric analyses necessary to effectively design complex cryogenic systems.  These storage and supply systems are used in the aerospace, liquefied natural gas, transportation and medical industries.

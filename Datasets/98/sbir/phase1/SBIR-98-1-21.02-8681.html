<BLOCKQUOTE>
Currently, power devices for space applications generate heat in the range from 30W to 300W with power densities as high as 100 W/cm2.   Such power levels in small satellites impose a great challenge to diminish subsequent thermal effects.  Available heat dissipation mechanisms do not promise much more opportunity for innovation on thermal management.  New materials, design, fabrication and packaging methods are required for better survivability of microelectronics by introducing novel and effective heat dissipation mechanisms.  The chip-on-structure (COS) concept allows potential benefits by an effective heat dissipation through a selected substrate structure which has high thermal conductivity.k Technology Corporation proposes to develop a unique COS material with high conductivity (> 1000 W/mK), low coefficient of thermal expansion to match silicone or gallium arsenide, and low density (< 3.2 g/cm3).  This material can provide efficient conductive heat removal of COS electronics for space, airborne and ground applications.
The proposed material system is a macrocomposite comprised of thermal pyrolytic graphite (TPG) encapsulated within a composite shell.  TPG is a unique form of graphite manufactured by decomposition of a hydrocarbon gas at high temperature in a vacuum furnace.  TPG is highly aligned crystalline graphite with an in-plane thermal conductivity of 1700 W/mK.

The encapsulated TPG material to be demonstrated under this program would have applications in the commercial satellite market, as well as the obvious military and NASA uses.  Other applications include, heat spreaders for high power devices, substrates for multichip modules, electronic packages, and cold plates.

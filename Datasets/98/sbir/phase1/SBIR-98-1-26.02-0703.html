<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The cathode remains the main performance and life limiting component in almost all free electron devices — from cathode ray tubes to traveling wave tubes.  But nowhere are these limitations more onerous or costly than in the area of space communications.  The problem is largely due to inherent deficiencies in the osmium-coated "M" dispenser cathodes used today.  Consequently, a number of new cathodes have been proposed.  Most promising of these is the reservoir cathode concept.  Studies project an operational life for this cathode in excess of 20 years at high emission levels (>2 A/cm2).  But reservoir cathodes built to date have a variety of deficiencies of their own — lack of compactness, high cost, high power dissipation and mechanical complexity.
  We propose a novel reservoir cathode structure that reduces size, power, and cost to that of the best dispenser cathode designs available to date, without sacrificing life or performance.  The prototype will be 0.078" diameter, consume less than two watts, and lend itself to automated assembly.
  The project will include development plus prototype construction.  At least one test device will be constructed containing two reservoir cathodes and two "M" control cathodes.
  PHASE II will aim at optimization and development of production capability.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Nearly every vacuum electron device using a thermionic cathode would gain commercial advantage from this invention.  Also, it will allow vacuum electron devices to recapture lost market share from solid state devices in some instances, due to dramatic improvement in life.  In addition to commercial satellites, this cathode could to be used in microwave power modules.  Also, high resolution cathode ray tubes and projection tubes could beneficially use it to increase longevity, luminance, and resolution.

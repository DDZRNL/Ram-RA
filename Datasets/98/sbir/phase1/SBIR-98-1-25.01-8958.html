<BLOCKQUOTE>
Boulder Nonlinear Systems proposes to implement a compact, rugged Optical Correlator System (OCS) for use in space, military and industrial applications.  For spaceborne applications, there are two primary goals.  One is to develop space qualifiable packaging techniques for the spatial light modulators (SLMs).  The other is to develop low power, high density integrated modules for the system electronics since system volume is primarily driven by these components.
During Phase I a spaceborne OCS using 512 x 512 multi-level SLMs will be designed to provide navigational data of the platform relative to a mother ship.  Initial design and trade studies for developing compact, low power drivers will be performed.  Environmental data will be gathered on the current SLM and analyzed for necessary package changes.

During Phase II the Phase I system design will be implemented to produce a space qualifiable OCS.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
BNS has designed and constructed compact optical correlation systems (OCSs) for military and industrial customers with excellent results.  BNS has made a business commitment to provide the most technically advanced optics, electronics and software available.  The next logical step in this process is to miniaturize and ruggedize the optics and electronics for spaceborne and industrial applications.  The compact, rugged optical correlator systems resulting from a successful Phase I and II program will have commercial applications in industries such as agriculture, mining, manufacturing and inspection.  High-speed OCSs can relieve humans from repetitive inspection tasks such as sorting fruit and scanning x-rays, as well as replacing them in hazardous environments and space missions.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hyperspectral imaging is typically performed with multiple detector arrays.  The arrays are combined with bandpass filters, allowing  remote sensing of a single band.  We propose to develop a hyperspectral imaging system, based on a single indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) focal plane array (FPA), capable of imaging the entire visible/near-infrared wavelength range from 0.4 µm to 2.5 µm.  The system will feature spectral resolution < 10 nm, 640 pixel spatial resolution, low power dissipation, and modular construction.  The core of the system will be a 640 x 512 element In.82Ga.18As FPA with a long wavelength cutoff of 2.6 µm.  The InP substrate will be removed allowing sensitivity to wavelengths as short as 0.4 µm.  Spectral dispersion will be achieved using a compact imaging spectrograph from SPECIM installed in a C-mount lens housing attached to our camera.  Low power dissipation will be obtained by elevated operating temperature (greater than 250K) and innovative electronics.  During Phase I, we will develop and deliver a prototype system based on lattice-matched InGaAs with a 1.7 µm cutoff wavelength.  By the end of Phase I, we will have designed the full 0.4 µm to 2.5 µm imager to be optimized and delivered during Phase II.

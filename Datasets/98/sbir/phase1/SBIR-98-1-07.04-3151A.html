<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This proposal is written in response to NASA solicitation subtopic 07.04 which specifically seeks “advanced technologies for integrated propulsion systems such as pulse detonation-techniques for the low speed portion of operation of integrated air-breathing propulsion systems for hypersonic vehicles.” The Pulse Detonation Engine (PDE) is geometrically most simply described as a series of valved tubes. With valves open, a detonable fuel/air mixture is brought into each tube and is detonated with the valves shut to force the combustion product gases to escape through the aft end of the tube, providing thrust. The low-cost, lightweight characteristics of this engine led APRI to the development of a PDE for subsonic propulsion applications. However, a principal characteristic of the PDE geometry is that its similarity to the ramjet makes it an ideal candidate as the low speed cycle of a hypersonic airbreathing propulsion system. Thus, APRI proposes to develop a dual-mode PDE/ramjet which uses the same air flow path for both modes of operation. As a first step, the objective of the proposed Phase I effort is to develop viable flow path configurations for a combined-cycle PDE/Ramjet and to assess the engine thermal design and cooling requirements.

The technology described in this proposal will be applied to the development of combined-cycle cruise missiles or unmanned aerial vehicles. Extension to combined-cycle PDE/ramjet/scramjet engines is also anticipated.

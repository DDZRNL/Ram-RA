<BLOCKQUOTE>
ResearchSouth, Inc. proposes to develop computational fluid dynamics computer software  for analysis / design of advanced airbreathing 
hypersonic vehicles.  The problems addressed are: viscous high speed air 
flow over the exterior vehicle,  viscous interactions during stage 
separation, combustion in the propulsion system,  and mixing between the 
exhaust nozzle flow and the freestream.  We will develop a general-purpose 
fluid flow analysis tool which gives the user the choice of inviscid Euler 
flow,  viscous Navier-Stokes flow for laminar conditions, and turbulent 
flow with algebraic and k-e models.  All of this capability will be 
operational for perfect-gases or equilibrium-air on unstructured, adaptive 
tetrahedral meshes with the Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation for 
unsteady moving-body dynamics. The Phase I program will start with the 
SAMcfd code, an already proven technology, and proceed to develop an 
implicit Navier-Stokes solver for unstructured meshes, develop a set of 
preconditioners (initializers) for the GMRES technique to solve the 
non-linear equations, improve our existing Navier-Stokes meshing technique, 
 add an equilibrium-air thermodynamics capability,  perform a set of 
demonstration calculations for viscous flow over hypersonic vehicles,  and 
document the project. This software will provide NASA with a powerful 
software tool to perform very efficient and rapid design assessment of 
evolving  airbreathing hypersonic vehicle concepts.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The following are among the many commercial applications for the reacting Navier-Stokes software: (1) pollution dispersion from stacks of industrial 
processing plants; (2)   modeling of viscous mixing processes for chemical 
manufacturing companies;(3)   computation of exhaust flow from automobile 
and bus exhaust systems; (4) design of more efficient internal combustion 
engines; (5) fuel economy studies for commercial airplanes; (6) analysis of 
waste disposal systems; (7) design of air conditioning systems for large 
buildings; (8) air quality modeling for large-city streets

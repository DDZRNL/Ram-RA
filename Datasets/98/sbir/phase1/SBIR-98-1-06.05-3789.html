<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 A comprehensive program involving water tunnel testing, Navier-Stokes computer code analysis, transonic wind tunnel testing and system integration studies is proposed to reduce the drag levels caused by the first generation design of the forebody/pilots cab drag levels on 727/737 and 707 aircraft now in service.
The Phase I program will demonstrate by testing and analysis the complex flow phenomena causing the problem and will investigate by the water tunnel test some unique add-on type modifications designed to modify the vortex flow and thereby reduce the drag levels. 

Phase II will continue the water tunnel testing, the computer code analysis and will include a large scale model transonic wind tunnel test to demonstrate by accurate force balance measurements cost-effective modifications with the desired drag reductions.  System integration and marketing studies will also be conducted in Phase II. 

The implementation of the drag-reducing modifications to these aircraft will have a substantial fuel-savings benefit and will reduce the noise levels in the pilot’s cab improving the pilot’s comfort.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The successful Phase I and Phase II programs will have a direct application to over 6000 aircraft now flying in  the world. The control and mitigation of the vortex flows will reduce the forebody/pilot's cab drag levels  resulting  in over 100 million dollars saved by reduced fuel costs for the 727/737, and 707 (KC135, E3) aircraft.

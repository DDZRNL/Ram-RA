<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The development and fielding of free flight air traffic management systems and procedures will dramatically change human roles and responsibilities in the airspace system. These systemic changes will create new challenges for the development of effective human/machine interfaces (HMIs) for air traffic control. Innovative HMIs must be developed to allow controllers to visualize air traffic information and rapidly identify airspace areas where controller intervention is needed without creating information overload and excessive workload.  We propose to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a situation-adaptive HMI for advanced ATM operations incorporating two key functions:· A means of generating a high-level computational assessment of the current air traffic situation
· A methodology for generating a situation-adaptive interface, so that what the operator sees and hears can be interpreted accurately and readily in the context of the current air traffic environment
We propose a five-task development effort, consisting of: 1) problem scope specification; 2) development of SA models; 3) development of HMI content management strategies; 4) implementation and demonstration of a limited-scope prototype; and 5) requirements specification for full-scope development.  Concept feasibility will be demonstrated using commercial off-the-shelf components in a simulated air traffic environment.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The proposed technology will directly support the development of effective concepts of operations and human/machine interfaces for free flight. The proposed approach also offers the potential for the development of innovative HMIs for the coordination of unmanned aerial vehicles. Adaptive interfaces and situation assessment technologies offer potential in other high-value operator/system environments, including power system control rooms and process control centers.

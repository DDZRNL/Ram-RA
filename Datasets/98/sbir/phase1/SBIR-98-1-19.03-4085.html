 	Ceramic-matrix composites (CMCs) are being developed for a variety of high-temperature military, aerospace and industrial applications. While possessing high specific strength, stiffness, and fracture toughness at elevated temperatures, the utility of current CMCs are limited by their susceptibility to oxidation embrittlement and strength degradation when stressed at or beyond the matrix cracking strength and exposed to high-temperature oxidation. Thus, for the current state of technology, the linear-elastic region represents the "useful" design stress-strain region due to the effects of environmental degradation of the fiber coating and/or reinforcing fiber at elevated temperatures following the on-set of matrix cracking. The objective of this program is to investigate the feasibility of a novel approach for increasing the matrix cracking strength in fiber-reinforced SiC CMCs. By methods of chemical vapor infiltration (CVI), continuous fiber preforms will be consolidated and densified with a compositionally-modulated nanolaminated composite matrix consisting of periodically terminated epitaxial SiC layers radially outward from the reinforcing fibers. Nanolayered materials have been demonstrated to exhibit extraordinary mechanical, tribological, and/or thermal properties which are uniquely different from those of the individual constituents. In particular, strength can be enhanced over currently available courser grained materials by an order of magnitude or more. Also of importance is that a conceivably wide range of ceramic materials can be engineered into such nanostructural composites for use as matrices in fiber-reinforced materials. Laminated Hi-Nicalon and Sylramic SiC fabric/nanolayered SiC matrix composite plates will be fabricated and experimentally evaluated to determine their mechanical behavior characteristics. Results will be compared to "baseline" conventionally-processed SiC/SiC composites to establish the viability of the proposed approach.

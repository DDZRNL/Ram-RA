<BLOCKQUOTE>
The continued need to reduce cost and improve performance and efficiency of the existing earth and space science instruments requires innovations in laser devices. One such instrument is a Raman lidar. We propose a UV laser transmitter based on a novel, compact and electrically efficient laser capable of generating a 5 - 10 W near diffraction-limited beam at 349 nm The transmitter will be based on a diode-pumped, Q-switched, high-pulse-repetition -rate Nd:YLF laser and includes intracavity-pumped second and third harmonic generators. Diode-pumping and intracavity conversion will substantially increase the electrical efficiency of the proposed source whereas high-pulse rates and short pulses will provide for reducing the data acquisition time and a good depth resolution. The Phase I effort will demonstrate a laboratory breadboard 2.5-5 W UV transmitter and develop a point design for a higher-efficiency 10-W compact UV-source.

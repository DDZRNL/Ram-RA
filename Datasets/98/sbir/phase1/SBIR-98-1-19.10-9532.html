<BLOCKQUOTE>
 ME Harris & Co. proposes to develop thin, electrically rigidizable multilayer membranes for use in inflatable structures in space. These membranes have within them electrically curable composite materials. Upon deployment and during inflation, the uncured composite membrane is flexible. Once the structure is inflated, electricity is applied to the conductive portions of the membrane, which cures the composite structure, causing it to rigidize. Once rigidized, these structures will have significant material strengths. The flexible (uncured) membranes are resistant to significant leakage even if punctured by collision with micrometeorites prior to rigidization. They permit inflatable structures to have tailored architectures. The rigidization of these membranes can be easily monitered in real time. The membranes can be designed to have multiple functions. On deployment they can be used to create a rigidized structure and afterward serve as antenna or solar collector.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
     MEHC sees numerous commercial uses including easily erected temporary shelters for US soldiers deployed in remote locations, emergency shelters for victims of natural disasters, recreational shelters and possibly storage sheds or gazebos in wooded areas. Inflation devices can be used to erect the structures quickly and easily, thereby giving the membranes a desired structural shape. Once inflated, the membrane is rigidized. Thereafter the inflation device is deflated and detached from the structure so that it can again be used to inflate other membranes and make other structures. The small storage footprint of these rigidizable structures will enable many of them to be handled and shipped much more easily than conventional structures.      Other potential applications include breakaway traffic devices which the Departments of Transportation for individual states and counties could use in construction areas. Their low storage footprint, lightweight characteristics and the ease with with they can be erected could significantly reduce the shipping, handling and labor installation costs of breakaway traffic devices.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We propose to construct and test a highly efficient diode-pumped Nd:YLF laser based on the novel design of a conductively cooled prismatic pumping cavity with direct side-pumping of the active rod element.  We believe that the use of this advanced prismatic pumping cavity will allow us to achieve highly efficient operation (as compared with currently used pump cavity designs) in CW as well as in quasi-CW regimes and at the same time provide efficient conductive cooling of the Nd:YLF rod.  This study will provide the means for construction of a compact efficient laser source with output average power scalable up to 150 W in TEMoo mode or up to 250 W in multimode regime.  We estimate the real efficiency of the laser to be on the order of 45-50%.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Commercial applications for high-average-power (cw and pulsed) lasers include materials processing such as welding and soldering, drilling, trimming, etc.  Lidar applications, where high energy per pulse is desirable, are also possible.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Solution quality assessment and diagnosis which reflect the depth of understanding possessed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) experts is required to make efficient use of modern CFD methods.  The goal of this work is to develop an automated system which evaluates CFD solution quality and can be used routinely to increase the reliability of CFD in a design environment.  The system will consist of algorithms which interrogate the solution and a trainable system based on artificial neural networks which can interpret the algorithmic output and reach expert conclusions.  The aerospace industry has enunciated the need for this type of analysis tool, and the proposed work will be performed in collaboration with a large aerospace organization.  It is intended that the proposed system could be used to automate tasks which currently require intensive human effort.  A long term goal is to develop a system which regulates the CFD process and leads to reliable high-quality results.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The proposed research has significant commercial potential.  CFD is becoming widely used in many industries, but solution quality assessment is a labor intensive process that requires significant CFD expertise.  The automated quality assessment system will improve the efficiency and reliability with which CFD methods are used in industry.

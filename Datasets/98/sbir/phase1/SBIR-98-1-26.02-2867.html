 This proposal offers an innovative integration of IBM’s high-speed mixed-mode (analog and digital) Silicon-Germanium (SiGe) process with patented SiCOM technology to yield a key component of a universal high-rate (over 622 Mbps) low-power modulator ASIC chip-set. The "DAX" ASIC integrates multiple high-speed digital-to-analog converters, multiplexing circuitry, and phase-lock clocking into a single SiGe component, which will then be integrated with a low-power CMOS universal encoder/waveform-generator currently under development by SiCOM. The resulting chip-set generates baseband quadrature analog signal components of waveforms for an almost limitless set of error-correction coding and modulation combinations. This flexible chip-set provides the basis for a subsequent universal modulator multi-chip-module (MCM) product which will support NASA data links and mission requirements with a low cost, low complexity readily radiation-hardened modulator capability. 
During Phase I, feasibility of the proposed approach will be assessed through detailed computer simulations and interaction between SiCOM engineers and IBM’s semiconductor foundry.  Preliminary ASIC and circuit card assembly designs will be developed, radiation tolerance will be investigated, and a report prepared.  During Phase II the SiGe ASIC and modulator circuit card assembly will be developed and fabricated, and end-to-end data link tests performed using SiCOM’s BitFLOW II demodulator circuit card assembly.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Increasingly, institutions and individuals are utilizing wireless broadband connections for Internet access, computer networking, aggregation and trunking of voice lines, and telecommuting.  Specific markets for products developed under the proposed program include:  SONET/SDH networks-ring closure, ring interconnect, last-mile appendage interconnect protection via alternate radio path, radio-to-the-curb for traditional and broadband residential access networks, wireless connectivity for corporate/campus networks, service provider connectivity between a point of presence and customer’s equipment, digitized video distribution, including HDTV, outbound and back-haul links for point-multipoint systems, such as LMDS, cellular networks, communication satellite and pseudolite (UAV) systems, satellite and airborne environmental and imaging systems, and satellite cross-links.

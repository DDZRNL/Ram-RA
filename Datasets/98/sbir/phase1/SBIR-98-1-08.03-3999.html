<BLOCKQUOTE>
NASA's Microgravity Materials Science research programs require rapid cooling of samples to enhance microstructural analysis. A sample quench rate of up to 100°C/sec is desired which is shown to be unattainable using traditional quench system and Sample Ampoule Cartridge Assembly (SACA) designs. To specifically address this requirement, our innovation is a "Quench In Cartridge" (QIC) system design for SACAs, in which the quench media is delivered internal to the metallic containment cartridge. This innovative design reduces the furnace design complexity and allows it to be kept independent of SACA design while achieving significantly higher quench rates and possibly enhancing axial gradient in the sample. A novel attribute to this in-situ approach is that the desired quench can be achieved with no or minimal impact to the furnace module design and with only minor added requirements to the subsystem design, resulting in significant cost reductions. Additionally, QIC design will meet all requirements for steady state and quench processing applicable to both low and high temperature SACAs. None of the existing and planned quench system designs/methodologies incorporated in either terrestrial or microgravity furnaces offer the simplicity and overwhelming advantages provided by the innovative QIC technique.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Quenching of materials is a process used extensively in the metals heat treating industry for control of microstructure and resultant mechanical properties. Theoretically, this research could yield results that would contribute to process improvements and resultant cost savings within this industry. 
However, we feel that the primary commercial benefits of this research are in the area of space commercialization. To this end it can result in better science, but at a lower cost than more traditional quench systems. An immediate benefit to NASA is that it has direct application to NASA's planned microgravity research and planned hardware development efforts for the International Space Station, while also providing significant cost savings in terms of both reduction of payload costs and reduction of overall payload interface complexity.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I program addresses the development of a zero gravity compatible Proton Exchange Membrane Unitized Regenerative Fuel Cell (PEM URFC) Energy Storage System.  The PEM URFC provides the advantages of a primary fuel cell but can recharge itself from an electrical power supply providing very high density energy storage.  This system is the functional equivalent of a battery yet has the highly attractive features of a fuel cell such as high specific energy, high energy density, and long cycle life.  For long discharge missions, such as operation during lunar night or for highly elliptical orbits, the PEM URFC is  the most effective overall mission solution.  Key development required relates to improved reliability and zero gravity operational compatibility.   Both of these issues are addressed by development of static water feed (electrolysis operation) and static water removal (fuel cell operation).  Phase I will focus on demonstrating the feasibility of the static water feed/static water removal approach in the URFC without degrading cell performance. We will rapidly transition the results of the successful Phase I into Phase II prototypes of energy storage products suitable for development into flight hardware or into commercial products.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 URFCs can create unique energy storage systems based on the generation and storage of hydrogen/oxygen. Important related applications include any long discharge orbital profiles, lunar/planetary day/night cycles, atmospheric monitoring, surveillance, and communications.  URFCs could also be used in off-grid energy storage applications for remote homes, villages, factories, monitoring stations, and on-grid peak shaving.

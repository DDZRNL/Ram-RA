<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The potential for the use of magnetostrictive materials for a variety of applications from adaptive optics, robotics and automation, actuators, and linear motors is great. Several cryogenic magnetostrictive materials have been discovered recently that demonstrates high saturation strains and excellent mechanical properties. These materials are alloys of terbium and dysprosium with zinc (TbDyZn). Currently these materials are fabricated in small, single crystal, and by an expensive process that often requires frequent reformations do to mismatches in the material melting and boiling temperatures. In order to realize the potential of these materials for their applications their costs must be decreased and they must become widely available. The focus of this research effort proposed herein is to develop compounds of alloying materials that more closely match each other and thereby eliminate a time consuming and costly stage in their formation process.  The result of this will work will provide a low-cost scalable manufacturing process for these alloys allowing their distribution as a usable magnetostrictive material useful for the applications shown above.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 If successful this project will make low-cost cryogenic magnetostrictive materials available to applications developers. These types of actuators can be used for precise positioning systems such as used in optical systems, semi-conductor fabrication, acoustic control, valves, and pump applications.

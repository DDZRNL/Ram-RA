<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Mod Works proposes to construct major airframe components using modern aluminum manufacturing process (MAM).  The objective will be to reduce the cost of manufacturing while maintaining better surface quality.  Major reduction in cost and labor requirements will be obtained with the automated manufacturing opportunity.  Spot welding/bonding will replace conventional riveting techniques.  This technology  is being tested in the automobile industry with a high degree of success.
James Grizwald our lead designer will apply 45 years of industry experience to the development of this technol-ogy.  Success with this program will result in a major cost reduction for GA aircraft manufacturing.  The chal-lenges include labor reduction, surface tolerance improvement and competitive value comparison to composite parts development.

The potential to construct complex , low cost  aluminum parts will expand the conventional uses of aluminum.  Automated manufacturing will allow computer designed to be transitioned to parts accurately.  This will allow designers to use aluminum for a wider verity of components.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Successful development of this technology will be certified by the FAA for use by Mod Works.  Parts such as the cowling will be sold for retrofit or forward fit on new aircraft.  Provided the parts produced are cost effective larger scope programs will be performed by Mod Works.

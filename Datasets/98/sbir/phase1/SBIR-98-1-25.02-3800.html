<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The design and implementation of telerobotic systems (such as spaced-based robots operated from the ground) with improved tactile and force feedback 
requires the development of new control system design concepts.  Two key 
issues are the required stability margins and response characteristics of 
force-reflecting systems with time delay.  Creare has previously shown that 
impedance-based control systems in combination with a passive communication 
link for telerobots guarantees stability in the presence of large, 
unstructured time delays.  The innovation we propose is telerobot control 
system software that combines impedance-based telerobot control (for 
stability) with impedance shaping to achieve high performance telerobot 
control with guaranteed stability.  This innovation will help compensate 
for large time delays without the need for move and wait strategies.  The 
feasibility of the proposed concept will be established during Phase I by 
demonstrating the use of the proposed controls system architecture using 
two haptic displays.  During Phase II, a full-scale, force-reflecting, 
telerobot control system will be designed, implemented, and tested.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The proposed control software will have immediate application for space-based robots controlled from the ground.  In addition, it will enable 
telerobotic systems that can be used in macro- and microscopic 
manipulation.  Examples include:  vascular microsurgery, manipulation of 
individual cells, the interrogation of atomic surfaces, and the inspection 
and repair of micro-mechanical or electrical devices.

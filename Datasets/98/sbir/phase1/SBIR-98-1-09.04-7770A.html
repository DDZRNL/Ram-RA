<BLOCKQUOTE>
 	The inedible portion of plant biomass (i.e., hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin) in closed regenerative life support systems must be 
reprocessed.  Umpqua Research Company’s original NASA SBIR Phase I 
experimental efforts have demonstrated pumpable high solids biomass 
slurries of up to 27 wt%. The proposed Phase I effort significantly differs 
from the previously funded Phase I effort as this is an advanced equipment 
application which will be explored to continuously produce hydrolyzed 
biomass slurries. The primary advantage of an acid hydrolysis process is 
the substantially improved ease of pumping with either progressive cavity 
or piston pumps.  For this advanced applications program, it is proposed to 
develop a continuous combined process for the simultaneous acid hydrolysis 
and pumping of wheat, potato, tomato, and soybean crop residues.  This 
effort will provide the operating demonstration of a continuous combined 
acid hydrolysis pretreatment and pump system (e.g., extruder) where acid 
hydrolysis occurs within the pumping system itself.  The principal 
advantage of the proposed technology is that a high solids slurry can be 
pumped directly into a high or low pressure reactor for further processing. 
 Biomass slurries will be produced in barrel quantities and made available 
for future testing by NASA, academic institutions, or industry.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 	The primary commercial application by the Federal Government will be for the pretreatment of inedible crop biomass in reclamation systems 
supporting long duration space missions such as a Lunar base, or a Mars 
mission.  The proposed research will result in the development of a compact 
and reliable biomass pretreatment/pumping system for biomass reprocessing 
that can be operated in terrestrial, hypogravity, and microgravity 
environments.

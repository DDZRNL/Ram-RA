<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 A low cost high energy density lithium-ion battery system is proposed based on doped Mn-based cathode material and low cost domestic graphite in 1M LiPF6 electrolyte with ternary carbonate-based organic solvents. A series of modified Mn-based lithium intercalation compounds will be synthesized by sol-gel process and characterized using analytical as well as electrochemical techniques. The potential candidate materials will further be evaluated as cathodes for lithium-ion batteries.    
Cathodes and anodes will be prepared by using a well-established electrodes fabrication technique. The reversible capacity of the modified LiMxMn2-xO4 will be evaluated by developing half-cells with metallic lithium as the counter electrode. Several prismatic design lithium-ion pouch cells will be made with the low temperature electrolyte to examine the feasibility of the proposed concept.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The rechargeable battery market is growing rapidly and lithium-ion batteries are taking over the market share from Ni-MH and Ni-Cd even with the higher cost. Because of the several advantageous characteristics (low cost, high energy density and environmentally benign) of our proposed lithium-ion battery system, the developed technology will have wide variety of commercial applications such as cellular phone, laptop computer and even electric vehicle.

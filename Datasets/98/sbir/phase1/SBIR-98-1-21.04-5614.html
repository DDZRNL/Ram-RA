<BLOCKQUOTE>
Arkansas Microelectronics Development Corporation (AMDC) proposes to develop high density multichip module (MCM) substrates with integrated capacitors. This project will target NASA's goals involving decreased payload weight and volume and increased functionality.  In all fields of electronics packaging, especially computer and telecommunications, there is a real incentive to achieve high speed and high volume signal transmission, down sizing, and competitive pricing.  To demonstrate the feasibility of high speed signal transmission in MCM substrates, it is necessary to get high density chip packaging and to improve the transmission characteristics of the MCM substrate itself.  When you combine integrated capacitors with MCM substrates, you gain not only high frequency decoupling capacitors, but also space saving, and significant improvements in performance over conventional discrete chip capacitors. The substrates proposed will consist of tantalum oxide integrated capacitors with four copper metal layers, power, ground, and two signal layers. AMDC's advantage over their competition is their ability to fabricate reliable and low defect density tantalum oxide capacitors through anodization. Matching funds from the Arkansas Science and Technology Authority will also be pursued.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Although initial customers will most likely be high performance users such as aerospace and government agencies, this technology would greatly benefit the wireless industry.  To be competitive in manufacturing pagers, cell phones, etc. product miniturization and weight reduction is essential.  AMDC's products will would satisfy these requirements which would greatly benefit the wireless companies.

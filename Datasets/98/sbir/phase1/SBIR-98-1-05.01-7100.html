<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The Universal Aviation Data Service (UADS) innovation is to make rich, but non-critical information services an FAA-certified (Level D) reality for price-sensitive small airplane travelers.  UADS looks beyond today’s aviation infrastructure and data-link standardization efforts toward imminent ubiquitous satellite and other data communications systems.    UADS will uniquely leverage and integrate emerging robust, nation-wide, high-volume wireless personal communications infrastructure to allow small airplane travelers to remotely and efficiently access airport and other facilities that are not essential for flight, but that enhance their travel experience and safety.  Information will be accessible from home, office, car, airport, or cockpit.  UADS provides a common-mode of access that links small airplanes to commercial air and ground transportation services (train, limo, rental car), while satisfying the communications and human-factors needs of small-airplane users.    To date GA revitalization efforts have aptly focussed upon reducing the cost and complexity of flying itself.  UADS takes another step toward addressing the bottom-line transportation utility of small airplanes; it appeals to the business, personal, safety, and convenience needs of travelers.  It stimulates GA revitalization by providing intuitive communications products that address the fundamental portal-to-portal transportation goals of pilots and passengers.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The UADS Gateway/Server and SmartBrowser developed under Phases I and II of this project will provide the key components of a Universal Aviation Data Service (UADS) that can be offered to small airplane travelers – pilots and passengers - on a subscription basis to encourage the transportation experience and augment safety.

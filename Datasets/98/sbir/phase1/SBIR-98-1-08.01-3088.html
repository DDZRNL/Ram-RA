<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Physical Optics Corporation's (POC) Applied Technology Division proposes a novel approach for studying and understanding the influence of gravity and the space environment on biological materials such as cells and particles.  POC's proposed Fiber Optic-Based Integration System (FOBIS) will be capable of in situ, real-time biological monitoring, and is based on a single fiber optic system.  A compact, multi functional device, the FOBIS incorporates three working units (a Micro-Flow Cytometer, a Micro-Photometer, and a Micro-Sensor) into a compact, spaceworthy package that offers the following features: (1) combined flow cytometer, microphotometer, and biosensor system, with small, low cost, rugged packaging, and field applicability; (2) optical fiber optic profiler, and a laser tweezers technique for noninvasive in situ measurements, in real time, with minimal distortion to particle structure and optical properties; (3) relatively high throughput by both flow cytometric and optical trapping/microphotometric sampling modes, required for sampling rapidly changing physical and biological regimes such as those that will occur under varying gravity conditions; (4) force measurement technique, applicable to high sensitivity biosensing without the need for extra components; (5) new, innovative method extending the row and partial gravity effects to aquatic environmental studies.

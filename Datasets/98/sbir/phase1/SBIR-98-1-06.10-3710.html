 In this program, HyPerComp, Inc., a small company and a leader in the development of high performance computing software for defense and commercial applications, in strategic alliance with Boeing, a world renowned aerospace company, and with Rockwell Science Center, a shared resource R&D center for Rockwell and Boeing, proposes to develop a comprehensive  framework for an operational Intelligent Simulation Environment (ISE)system that would go beyond traditional knowledge bases in that it will make available not only static knowledge (through knowledge capture and mining) but also dynamic knowledge (through on-demand simulations) to the designer/engineer.  Some of the modules of the ISE system will include: 1) Master Designer Expert System, 2) Local Expert Controller for CFD Tools, 3) Local Expert Controller for Analytical Tools, 4) Inter-Expert Intelligent Agents, and 5) System Demonstration.  Such an information technology-based environment combined with advances being made in unstructured grid-based computational solution algorithms and parallel computing architectures will provide a framework to meet NASA's goals in decreasing the current design cycle time and cost by 50%.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Given a strong "technology pull" and a close working relationship with industry, the small business can develop technology with a virtual guarantee that it will be applied.  This relationship exists between HyPerComp, Inc. and Boeing. Boeing needs the technologies proposed under this Phase I (and Phase II) SBIR project. Because Boeing is strongly invested in many major commercial and government projects, the technology can and will be applied. The technology developed during this effort will be applied to the following Boeing programs as needed: Commercial programs such as the design, production, and maintenance of commercial aircraft; Commercial space transportation programs such as Space Shuttle (via the Boeing-Lockheed United Space Alliance), Sea Launch, Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELV), RLV/X-33, and Future X; Government programs including military aircraft such as the F-18, F-22, Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), and the DarkStar;   Government space related programs including the Airborne Laser, National Missile Defense System, Kinetic Energy Weapons, the International Space Station, and numerous satellite systems. The primary commercialization appeal of this technology is in building a design system for companies like Boeing interested in participating in the rapidly growing launch vehicle market for satellites.

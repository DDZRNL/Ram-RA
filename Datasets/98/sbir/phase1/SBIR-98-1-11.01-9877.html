<BLOCKQUOTE>
The proposed innovation is to develop a complete solution for space flight qualification and use of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) microcomputer systems.  Our innovation, the Space Adapter Kit (SAK), would effectively allow the experimenter to fly hardware while isolating the "unqualified" COTS hardware from the critical flight system hardware and interfaces.  This system would target the small, low-budget experimenter in the government, university, and commercial sectors and enable the flight of payloads that would be unaffordable with custom systems. Past efforts to create a standard space flight/payload computer have failed primarily due to lacking the production volume to take advantage of economies of scale or keep pace with the latest technology.  AZ Technology proposes a "Kit" which would adapt COTS systems to the space environment, matched with modular software suitable for the application.  The SAK would consist of qualified power supply and data communications subsystems, thermal control, and a mechanical containment system, coupled with software tools that allow for automatic generation of flight software and telemetry/command databases.  The SAK would lower the cost of developing payloads while isolating spacecraft and crew from COTS hardware failures, and would ease integration with spacecraft and ground systems.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The commercial applications potential is significant.  With the recent and proposed commercialization of space, the SAK fills a gap for low cost users wishing to fly experiments.  The SAK offers a low budget alternative to the high cost special designs which keep many experimenters from being able to afford space flight.  Other applications, other than space, are numerous.  The SAK could provide protection for inexpensive COTS controller usage in harsh environments such as sand or salt spray.  The boating industry and recreational vehicles markets could use a marine-hardened SAK.  Further, the military market could use a SAK for harsh military environments.

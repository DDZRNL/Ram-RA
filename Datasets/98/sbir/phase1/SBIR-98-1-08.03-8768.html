<BLOCKQUOTE>
Interferometry is widely employeed for various nonintrusive/noncontact gross-field measurements. It has excellent potential for diverse applications to space experiments including crystal growth, material processing, heat and mass transfer, and fluid flow. However, the problem of expeditiously extracting accurate phase information from noise-ridden or complex data needs to be resolved. We propose a unique method for resolving this problem for all types of numeric interferometric processing algorithms, including fringe tracking, regression, Fourier transforms, and phase stepping techniques. These algorithms, in principle, provide or need isophase lines, thus allowing the proposed unified approach of effective noise reduction and automation based on the use of various knowledge from interferometry experts or from statistical extraction. This hybrid method requires development of low-level probabilistic noise reduction based on directional information of fringes, and high-level knowledge-based processing that follows expert-like judgement for further error/noise reduction through global structure examination. The proposed innovative hybrid software can be effectively employeed even for data with severe noise levels. The project would thus lead to the development of a robust user-friendly system useful for many applications in space experiments for both fluids and solids (i.e., protein and solution crystal growth, growth interface studies, fluid flow, etc.) as well as in commercial nondestructive testing.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Various organizations can find useful applications of the developed system. These include private companies, universities, and national laboratories. Interferometry is a valuable means for testing; however, lack of an efficient user-friendly system has been a hindrance for its wide application beyond testing in optical industries where acquisition of good quality fringes is possible.

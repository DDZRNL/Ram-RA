<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The proposed innovations are major improvements to existing fine-steering mirror (FSM) actuator and suspension technology for NASA cryogenic applications such as NGST.  Mass of the FSM mechanism is reduced by up to 50%.  Simultaneous improvements in power consumption and lateral load capability are also featured.  The addition of splits in the magnets to allow full radial mirror ribs provides greater mirror rigidity with less material, allowing the power-efficient loop actuator to be used on mirrors of this size. Innovation #2 is the use of a new flexure configuration with more travel and increased load capability that is simpler to fabricate and assemble and attaches to the mirror backplate, not the skin or ribs, for less distortion with a thinner skin.  The result is reduced mass and improved surface figure, acceleration, and power with simpler flexure parts requiring less assembly time and fixturing, thereby also reducing cost.  
Benefits for GSFC’s NGST program are: reduced cost, lower mass, actuator dissipation of only a few uW at 40K, and launch without mechanical caging for increased reliability.  Additional benefits for other space-based applications include: extended travel, chopping can be performed at higher frequencies, at larger amplitudes with lower power for improved images.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Primary applications of the cryogenic FO75-35 include NGST and other space-based infra-red imaging and spectrometry missions.  The attractive cost target of $25,000 to $50,000 for laboratory units and $150k to $200k for space flight units, combined with additional advantages in the form of lower power consumption, less heat induced into the optical bench and the ability to perform additional functions such as scanning and chopping, make it appropriate for image stabilization of ground-based observatories and DoD’s infrared seekers as well.

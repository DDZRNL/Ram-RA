<BLOCKQUOTE>
A newly invented process (patent pending) permits metal surfaces to be treated with additive materials that provide super-alloyed surfaces, hard and high-wear surfaces, thermal barrier coatings, oxidation-resistant coatings, and high-temperature-melting-point surfaces.  This process has demonstrated capability of producing a chosen alloy or refractory of a specified thickness on several substrate materials.  The resulting surface is nonporous and crack-free. The metallurgical bond of the alloy resists all attempts at delamination or peeling and can accommodate a wide range of temperatures and coefficients-of-expansion. Therefore, one can provide a permanent, thin layer of protective material over substrate materials. The innovation is entitled "Laser Induced Surface Improvement", or LISI.  Many materials of interest have been used in two years of research and demonstration.  LISI permits the cryogenic system designer to select base metals for their mechanical properties (strength, weight, etc.), as well as cost, without regard to surface-interface properties. It is no longer necessary for a system component to be constructed from heavy, expensive, or scarce material when only the surface interface with the hostile environment is critical.  Unlike many other "coatings", the LISI process requires little surface preparation, needs no special environment for application, and is environmentally friendly.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The technology offered permits the development of surface alloys that are unique compositions of elements and surface structures. This process offers surface alloys that cannot be generated by any other method.  Robust sealing couplings can have surfaces that are sufficiently hard to prevent scratching, yet be compatible with cryogenic fuels/oxidizers and cryogenic temperatures. The technologies to be developed and demonstrated in this SBIR will first be focused on the U.S. market to provide U.S. industry with a competitive edge.

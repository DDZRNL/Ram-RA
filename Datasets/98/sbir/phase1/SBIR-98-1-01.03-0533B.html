<BLOCKQUOTE>
A thin build-up of ice on a wing or tail can substantially increase drag, disturb aircraft aerodynamic performance, and has caused numerous aircraft accidents.  Current de-icing mechanisms leave some residual ice on the airfoil and most impose substantial weight and power penalties.  A method for artificially inducing hydrophobic behavior on an airfoil surface for anti-icing and de-icing of aircraft is proposed.
It has been demonstrated that a small correctly polarized electrical current passed through the junction of an ice (or water) and metal surface will neutralize the bonding forces that cause the ice to adhere to metal.  The electrical path can be implemented by a thin film electrode pattern that neither intrudes into the interior of the wind nor alters the aerodynamics of the wing.  Innovative dynamics, Inc. proposes to evaluate this concept in an embodiment characteristic of an airfoil moving through air.  By artificially creating a hydrophobic surface, we expect to obtain light weight, low power anti-icing that is free of residual ice.

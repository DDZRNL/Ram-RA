<BLOCKQUOTE>
NASA has determined that Planetary Aerobots are one of the best lightweight vehicles for monitoring the atmosphere (in-situ) and the surfaces 
(proximally) of Mars, Titan, Venus and outer planets for extended periods 
of time.  Traditional materials unfortunately cannot provide the required 
temperature capabilities and specific strength to meet the structural and 
weight goals for planned explorations such as those scheduled for Mars.  To 
solve this problem Foster-Miller is proposing to use an advanced high 
strength, super-barrier, dimensionally stable and cryogenically flexible 
lyotropic liquid crystal polymer to produce Planetary Aerobot envelopes 
that meet all performance requirements.  We will utilize our proprietary 
and patented Rotating Die extrusion technology to produce quasi isotropic 
biaxially oriented film form the highly anisotropic LCP polymer PBO (poly 
p-phenylene polybensoxazole).

In Phase I processing equipment and operating protocols, recommendations 
will be established for improving gauge uniformity of PBO films.  PBO film 
will be extruded and further processed to tailor film properties for a 
selected Planetary Aerobot application. Stitching and seaming technologies 
will also be developed for forming stress concentrator free seams that 
maintain the PBO’s excellent barrier properties.  These technological 
breakthroughs will become the foundation/enabling technology for producing 
full or reduced scale Planetary Aerobots in Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The balloon technology developed in this program using PBO has numerous commercial applications.  Similar balloons can be used for communications, 
earth sensing platforms and long duration scientific platforms. This PBO 
technology can also be used to fabricate extended flight miniature balloons 
that will be used to support terrestrial climate investigations and weather 
predictions.  In addition this same technology, if scale-up to very large 
sizes does not become overly problematic, may be an ideal envelope material 
for the new generation large scale stratospheric balloons.  These Ultra 
Long Duration Balloons (ULDB) will be used for communications and must have 
suitable properties to survive launch, ascent and float operations for 
extended durations.  In addition the film processing enhancements that will 
be generated during this program can become an enabling technology for 
producing lightweight honeycomb core for commercial aerospace vehicles and 
liners for lightweight composite fuel tanks for cryogenic fluids.

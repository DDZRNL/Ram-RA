<BLOCKQUOTE>
 In recent years, dramatic achievements in the area of semiconductor technology have resulted in improved capabilities in such areas as image processing, radar data processing, and voice data processing. However, in order to be useful in many applications, the platforms for these applications must be more compact and consume less power than is currently feasible. IAI's innovative idea involves creating a low power consumption platform that saves unused power when the CPU is running. Our processing module will have an intelligent power "manager" to keep inactive circuits in a sleep mode. In computer systems, most of the power is consumed by the memory IC's, especially high speed memories. The power manager will feed power only to active memory windows at different time slots. Our objective is to study power distribution to implement low power consumption circuits, and then design a low power consumption signal processing platform.  Extensive evaluations will be completed using both simulation and experiment.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Processor boards which consume less power by placing circuits in a low power sleep mode when they are not currently being accessed will have a significant competitive advantage for use in portable equipment where battery life is important.

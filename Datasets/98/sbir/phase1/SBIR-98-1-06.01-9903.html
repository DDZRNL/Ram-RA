<BLOCKQUOTE>
 A need exists for small devices that can measure various aerodynamic pressures associated with airfoils in flight.  The device should be useful in wind tunnel testing as well as flight testing.  In addition, the device should have the following characteristics:  (1) a low profile to minimize interference with the airflow/airfoil relationships being measured; (2) autonomous, meaning a self-powered device with its own transducer that communicates its data wirelessly; (3) non-intrusive, which is defined as a bonded attachment to an airfoil; and (4) subsequent removal without shape or structural changes to the airfoil.  Invocon, Inc. proposes a to develop a Wireless Autonomous Sensor Package (WASP) with these characteristics.  This package is unique due to the integration of low power electronics, power scavenging capabilities, "stick on" installation, low profile, and integrated wireless communications - all within a height profile of 0.1 inches.  Further innovation is involved with the spectral and temporal modulation used to wirelessly transmit data from the device to a remote data recording and transmission location.  The use of such a device would reduce the cost of test equipment setup and installation.  Flight test cost reductions result in lower cost aircraft with a shorter time to market.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The commercial driver for the WASP hardware must come from reduced maintenance costs.  These reductions in maintenance costs would be from reduced number of inspections, faster inspections, replacement of parts when stress service life is reached instead of part replacement on a time schedule, constant analysis of structural trend data that would detect even the smallest of changes in airframe health, and constant verification of design and repair changes to airframes.  All these and numerous other maintenance advantages will combine to drastically alter the maintenance costs on commercial aircraft thereby resulting in higher profits for the air carriers. This increase in the bottom line profits will stimulate investment and thus support the introduction of a variety of on-board sensors and data acquisition systems.  This sensor package could be beneficial to any application involving the measurement of aerodynamic forces.  In addition to the commercial and military aviation markets, automotive manufacturers, the shipping industry and the aerospace industry have a number of remote sensing applications and requirements that could integrate the advantages of remote MEMS sensing.  Maintenance and development costs could be significantly reduced with the reduction in the need for wire interconnect.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This proposal is concerned with the enhancement and commercialization of a finite element based aero-structural-controls-propulsion modeling and simulation software developed by the company by partial funding from NASA DFRC. The Engineering Computations (EC) version of the code, currently widely used at DFRC in support of a number of practical projects, needs to be further developed for wider use of the code by a potentially larger number of users.The goal of this project is to develop seamless interface of the EC-STARS program to solid modeling tools such as IDEAS, PRO-E and CATIA codes among others. Additionally, an optimizer code will also be attached to the STARS program to effect optimization of a structural design pertaining to an aerospace vehicle.
The EC has made considerable investment of its own during the last eighteen months in maintaining, enhancing and commercializing the code. Primarily thruogh this effort, the code is being disseminated to a number of organizations. Much more effort is needed in this connection and this proposal details out a broad agenda to that effect, in line with our past and the current effort.
With such proposed technical enhancements and an effective commercialization program it is expected that the EC-STARS program will emerge as the leader in this important technical discipline.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 An automated advanced computer-aided design and analysis software package will be the end product of this task, capable of effective modeling and simulation of advanced aerospace vehicles. A strong commercialization effort will also be implimented for very wide distribution of the software.

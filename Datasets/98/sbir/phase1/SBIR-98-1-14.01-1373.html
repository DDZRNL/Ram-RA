<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project will establish the feasibility of a radically different approach to construction of high precision large aperture mirrors in space.  The concept is based on a deployable phased array mirror system that will meet or exceed the most demanding requirements for NGST.  The most remarkable aspect of this innovative approach is that the entire array is held captive in a controlled grid of local magnetic fields such that the segmented primary is virtually free floating, and thus free from mechanical and thermal distortions.  In Phase I we propose to develop the necessary actuators, sensors, and control methodologies to demonstrate the ability to phase match an array of magnetically levitated mirror segments in an Earth based laboratory at room temperature environment.  In Phase II this research will continue with the actual fabrication, integration, and testing of an array of up to seven hexagonal mirror segments.  This research is designed to demonstrate the high degree of mechanical and thermal isolation between reaction structure and segmented mirror array, thereby allowing one to consider extremely low mass mirror substrates for a variety of applications.  Follow-on research would entail upgrading the Phase II testbed for cryogenic environments.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Multiple-spacecraft missions, under either centralized or coordinatedcontrol, are rapidly emerging as a principal component of current and
future planned space missions. Using relatively low-cost micro-spacecraft 
architectures, they offer enhanced mission robustness with reduced overall 
mission costs when compared to traditional single-spacecraft missions.
Programs such as NASA's New Millenium DS-3 Separated Spacecraft Interferometer 
and Planet Finder missions, together with commercial multi-satellite 
constellations (IRIDIUM, Teledesic) highlight the immediate need for effective 
multi-spacecraft control and autonomy technologies. Such formation flying
introduces new challenges in control technology in order to meet desired 
specifications for successful mission completion. While fixed-formation 
maneuvering has been at the forefront of multi-spacecraft research, relatively 
little progress has been made for the constellation initialization problem, 
due to its unique difficulties for traditional trajectory optimization and 
control.  This project addresses constellation initialization by proposing a 
novel technique for solving the implicit dynamic programming/global 
optimization problem using Genetics-Based Machine Learning (GBML) techniques.
Such algorithms have already been successfully applied for machine-learning 
of complex maneuvers for advanced fighter combat, which poses similarly complex 
challenges to that of multi-spacecraft constellation initialization.  A GBML 
Toolbox will be developed and commercialized for solving complex, multi-system,
multi-controller optimization problems.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The development of the above core learning technologies in machine learning and dynamic optimization will serve as a foundation for Phase III 
commercialization. Multi-spacecraft trajectory optimization has a direct 
market in the growing communications sector, with the advent of global 
satellite constellations (IRIDIUM, Teledesic, GlobalStar).  Other applications 
of this technology are for multi-system and multi-controller engineering 
systems which present disparate sensing, control, actuation and optimization 
objectives.

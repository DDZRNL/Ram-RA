<BLOCKQUOTE>
k Technology Corporation (kTC) proposes to develop a high conductivity (>1000 W/mK), low density (<2.5 g/cm3) flexible material system for the thermal management of structurally isolated spacecraft systems, deployable radiators and other movable heat transfer devices.  Sensitive spacecraft components which cannot survive the vibration environment during spacecraft launch and pryo-shock in orbit are often mounted on isolators.  Typically a flexible thermal strap, made up of thin sheets of aluminum, is used to conduct energy away from sensitive components.  With the ever-increasing complexity of spacecraft components, coupled with huge demands for power dissipation, critical spacecraft components are in need of significantly larger thermal straps to remove this power.  As these aluminum straps increase in size, they become heavier and less flexible.  With less flexibility, higher loads will be transmitted to the critical component, negating the benefits of the isolators.		kTC proposes to solve this problem using thin aluminum encapsulated thermal pyrolytic graphite (TPG) sheets.  This concept will allow for greater than five times the energy removal rate over a baseline aluminum strap of equal weight.  TPG sheets are highly aligned crystalline graphite having in-plane thermal conductivities > 1700 W/mK (4X Copper).  The program will establish, key design, fabrication and performance characteristics.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The encapsulated TPG foils to be demonstrated under this program would have applications in the commercial satellite market, as well as the obvious military and NASA uses.  Other applications include, thin heat spreaders for high power devices, flexible thermal couplers to move heat away from high power components to a chassis or coldplate, thin high aspect ratio air cooled fins, and thermal interface materials (gaskets).

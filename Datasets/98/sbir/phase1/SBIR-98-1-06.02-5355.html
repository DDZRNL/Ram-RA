<BLOCKQUOTE>
Future flight vehicles are expected to achieve high performance by actively controlling unsteady aerodynamic and nonlinear aeroservoelastic (NL-ASE) phenomena. At present, the fundamental mechanisms that contribute to unsteady flow phenomena and nonlinear effects are not well understood, and there is a great need for developing design methods which address dynamic nonlinearities. In this Phase~I project, we propose to develop a nonlinear stability, system Identification and control software toolbox for investigating nonlinear unsteady aerodynamic and ASE effects. Our approach will make use of Bifurcation and Chaos Theory Methodology (BACTM). BACTM is used to develop bifurcation diagrams which contain all the information needed to detect phenomena such as Hopf bifurcations to limit cycles, and determine changes in stability as functions of system parameters. Proposed work involves: (1) selection of indicial function aerodynamic models and nonlinear Benchmark Active Control Technology (BACT) system model, (2) global nonlinear anlysis of unsteady aerodynamic, NL-ASE models and falling leaf maneuver, (3) development of active control strategies, (4) development of nonlinear analysis software, (5) reporting. The software will allow the user to load differential equations of motion, compute bifurcations and visualize nonlinear behavior. Our primary areas for software demonstration will be unsteady aerodynamics and NL-ASE.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Aircraft dynamics, jet engines and combustion control represent very large markets for commercialization of these technologies. BACTM-related software products have direct applications in fluid mechanics, heat transfer, phase transitions, chemical instabilities, compressor stall, biology and communications. A nonlinear system identification, stability and control design toolbox is expected to have a very wide range of applications.

The design and analysis of modern rotorcraft requires computational tools capable oftreating extremely complex aerodynamic problems. These include strong induced flow
effects, interactions of the rotor and its wake system, transonic flow, flow reversal,
flow separation on retreating rotors, and dynamic stall. Also, the interaction of the
rotor wake and other components, such as the fuselage, tail rotor, and wing (for
tilt-rotors), are significant. A number of techniques currently exist for computing
complete rotorcraft aerodynamic flow fields. These range from comprehensive codes with
fast but simplified aerodynamic modelling to full overset-grid Navier-Stokes methods. All
have significant drawbacks either associated with inaccuracy or inefficiency. 

Flow Analysis, Inc. (FAI) has developed several accurate, efficient, and very unique CFD
methods for treating rotor systems or bodies. The Vorticity Embedding method has been
shown to be the only CFD-based method capable of providing three-dimensional, compressible
flows with diffusion-free wakes. The Vorticity Confinement method has been demonstrated to
significantly reduce the diffusion problem in Euler/Navier-Stokes methods and for
providing efficient rotor body solutions. 

The current proposal involves the refinement of FAI methods for the modelling of dynamic
stall and body flow predictions. The ultimate goal is the coupling of all of these
methods. This approach will result in a computational tool that will enable the most
efficient and accurate prediction of rotor flows that encompasses the entire spectrum of
associated aerodynamic phenomena.

The design/analysis system that will result from the proposed research will enablerotorcraft companies to design more efficient, less costly rotorcraft. Further extensions,
in Phase III, should provide a tool that will allow the U.S. aviation industry to be more
competitive.

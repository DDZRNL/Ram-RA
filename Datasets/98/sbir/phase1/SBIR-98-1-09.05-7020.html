<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The Advanced Flight Visualization Toolkit (AFVT) project will develop a suite of virtual reality immersive telepresence software tools which combine the real-time abilities of a flight simulator with the data density of a Geographic Information System (GIS).  This technology will be used for virtual reality training of crews, analysis of flight test data, and as an on-board immersive situation display.  It will also find application as a virtual cockpit, and in teleoperation of remotely piloted vehicles.  AFVT will enhance the ability of operators to interact with large amounts of multidimensional data using the most natural paradigm available: 3D immersion.  This operator/data interaction technology will be an advancement comparable to the invention of the Heads-Up Display (HUD).  AFVT will move the HUD into the 3rd dimension.  
As a simplified user interface, it will fuse real-time 3D displays of terrain with digital maps, satellite data, vehicles, flight paths, and waypoints.  This unique and innovative approach will build upon recent software technology research and development from Rapid Imaging Software.  It will provide component-wise access to this technology using the Windows COM (ATL) model. Finally, AFVT will permit NASA engineers to construct and deploy their own immersive multidimensional display applications on Windows-based computer platforms.

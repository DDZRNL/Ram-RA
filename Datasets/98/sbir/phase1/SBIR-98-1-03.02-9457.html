<BLOCKQUOTE>
The proposed work involves a new unstructured macro-cell algorithm for computational aeroacoustics (CAA), which may be two to three orders of magnitude more efficient than most current methods.  The unstructured macro-cell algorithm has features of both structured and unstructured grid methods; it retains the efficiency and accuracy of structured grid methods and much of the adaptability of unstructured grid methods.  The governing equations are solved on a macro-cell, a structured grid consisting of roughly 15 grid points in each spatial direction, using high-accuracy, explicit or implicit, finite-volume methods.  A full computational domain is composed of perhaps thousands of macro-cells, arranged in an unstructured manner.  The elements contributing to high efficiency include high-accuracy spatial discretization, good time integration, and spatial and temporal solution adaptivity.  An advanced treatment of the slip-interference between domains in relative motion will be based on macro-cell boundary methods.  These technologies will be validated on suitable CAA test cases and applied to blade/wake interactions representative of fan noise generation.  The accuracy and computational efficiency of the new unstructured macro-cell method will be demonstrated.

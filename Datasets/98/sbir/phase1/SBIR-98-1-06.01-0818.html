<BLOCKQUOTE>
The development of a commercially viable, pressure-sensitive paint (PSP) lifetime imaging system that incorporates model deformation is proposed.  Phase I focuses on performing a feasibility and optimization study and demonstrates a prototype system.  Phase II will further develop this state-of-the-art, lifetime PSP/deformation imaging system and demonstrate its capabilities in a wind tunnel.  The significance of such a commercial system is that it has the potential to replace conventional pressure-tap measurement systems and it also combines two measurement techniques into one.  Thus, the proposed instrument can significantly outperform current PSP image-based intensity measurement systems, both in terms of data quality and wind tunnel productivity.  The approach is innovative in its application of solid-state CCD gating technology and the combination of PSP and photogrammetric model deformation measurements.  The system may be applied to the design of advanced aircraft, rotorcraft, automobiles, and structures.  Its use would provide detailed quantitative aerodynamic-loads distribution information, significantly reducing design cycle time and cost.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given the ability of PSP to provide a continuous surface pressure map, it has the potential to usurp conventional pressure-tap systems and significantly reduce design-cycle time and costs.  The proposed system would provide detailed quantitative aerodynamic-loads and deformation distributions.  The system would be applicable to the design of advanced aircraft, rotorcraft, automobiles, and structures.  Commercial systems are currently limited to intensity measurements using scientific-grade cameras.  However, the accuracy attainable with these systems is often inadequate and their productivity is sub-optimal.  The fact that commercial systems are available, in spite of the relative immaturity of PSP technology, suggests that a sizable commercial market does indeed exist.  Indeed, a preliminary market survey indicates a strong desire for a commercial PSP system, particularly in small-scale laboratories.  Significant interest was also expressed by the automotive (including high-performance race teams) and architectural industries.  Furthermore, historical parallels between the development of PSP systems and other successful commercially available fluid-dynamic measurement systems (namely CTA, LDV, and PIV), combined with the prevalence of surface pressure measurements, suggest a bright future for the proposed system.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Large-scale, 3D simulations of complex configurations using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) are becoming increasingly common in the design of aircraft, aerospace vehicles and propulsion systems. Researchers are faced with the daunting task of interpreting these data sets to understand complex flow phenomena and make design decisions.  Current methods use visualization to present images of the flow results to the human visual system for interpretation.  There are two drawbacks to this approach: (a) the researcher is forced to use low-level tools (like color-mapped planes or streamlines) to attempt to detect subtle features like stagnation regions and (b) visualization is usually an indirect method and does not allow the researcher to simply ask for what he or she wants to know.  A typical query might be: Where, if at all, do any strong shocks impinge upon the airframe?   The offeror proposes herein to create an intelligent, query-based software system that combines feature detection tools with culling, searching and comparison operations to answer questions and automatically create meaningful visualizations of the query results.   Adding such a capability to any visualization environment will greatly increase the speed at which large viscous flow computations can be interpreted, communicated and therefore, understood.

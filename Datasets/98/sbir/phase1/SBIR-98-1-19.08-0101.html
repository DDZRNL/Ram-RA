<BLOCKQUOTE>
 		    One promising technique for nondestructive evaluation is laser-based ultrasound .  This technique can be used for nondestructive evaluation of components and structures with complex contours. The primary component of most laser ultrasonic receivers is an interferometer.  One promising receiver uses an adaptive reference beam interferometer with a detector based on the nonsteady-state photo-electromotive force (photo-emf).  In this receiver, the reference beam and signal beam are combined at a nonzero angle within a photoconductor having edge contacts.  The detector is sensitive to small displacements of the test surface, while rejecting lower frequency signals from mechanical vibrations or turbulence in the propagation path.  It also can process speckled signal beams with no loss in signal-to-noise.  	    Using typical detector materials with edge electrodes, the theoretical responsivity of a photo-emf detector is lower than optumum for certain applications. In this proposal we will investigate new planar detector geometries that provide higher photoconductive gain and greater theoretical responsivity.  We will also evaluate conventional photo-emf detectors using an epitaxially-grown layer for optimum operation at 1064 nm.  We will assemble a laboratory prototype receiver and benchmark it against the commonly used confocal Fabry-Perot interferometer.  In addition, we will use the receiver as part of a full inspection system to evaluate typical composite samples of interest for aerospace applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 	    Laser-based ultrasound has applications in a wide range of government and industrial markets.  It offers the capability to improve the inspection rate of existing scanning systems and it will enable the inspection of many parts that can not be tested with other techniques.  The development of adaptive laser ultrasonic receivers will provide improved responsivity and sensitivity, thereby requiring lower power probe lasers and thus reducing system cost.

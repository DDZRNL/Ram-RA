<BLOCKQUOTE>
 NASA is faced with the challenge of bringing long range space flight into the realm of economic viability. The Marshall Space Flight Center's expertise has been tapped to evaluate and develop advanced, even exotic, propulsion technologies for the visionary missions of the future. In response to NASA SBIR Topic 04.02 for Advanced/Exotic Propulsion System Technologies, SRS proposes in Phase I to evaluate and define testing for Phase II that will use energy pre-stored in nuclear meta-stable isomers and released by induced gamma emission (IGE) as a propulsive energy source. This concept has been termed Hot Isomeric Transitions (HIT). HIT relies on standard models in nuclear physics, but does not involve nuclear reactions. No fission or fusion is involved. In Phase I SRS will determine the energy conversion characteristics of gamma energy emitted by isomer sources and define surrogate testing approaches that can mimic the gamma emission from isomers to allow a fast track to testing of propulsion concepts while separate research continues in parallel outside this SBIR to achieve meaningfully significant amounts of induced gamma emission of energy stored in isomer materials. Also direct conversion of gamma emission by lasing as a photon momentum drive system will be investigated.

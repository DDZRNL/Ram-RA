<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is a critical and growing need to achieve better mission designs and hardware, with fewer resources, in less time.  Tools, such as the Millennia engine, developed by the Network Engineering Section of Information Systems Development, headed by Norman Lamarra, demonstrate how the flow of engineering data between multi-disciplinary groups can be automated, bringing about significant savings of time and labor.  With the Millennia engine and Methogram, a complex process involving exchange of data between multiple legacy and commercial codes may be run, repeated, and optimized.  What needs improvement, however, is the capture of the process itself: creating Methograms is time consuming and burdensome.  What we will provide, in Phase I, is a method for automatically and transparently capturing a Methogram by non-intrusive tracking of engineers during aeroshell design by the Mechanical Systems Engineering and Research Division, as they run analysis codes and iterate parameters.  The process, now saved, is repeatable for similar future missions. Methogram value, consequently, increases dramatically as Methogram creation becomes automatic.  In Phase II we will create a toolbox for transparently capturing processes in other industries.  A commercial example is capturing the iterative design of an automobile cooling system that involves thermal, geometry, and component iteration

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The specific commercial product that will result from Phase II will enable the non-intrusive capture of corporate knowledge, through tracking engineers as they interact with different analysis codes that have been web enabled, and mechanisms to edit that information, and translate it to formats executable by engines such as the Millenia engine.  The corresponding market niche for the product are corporations that have a rich engineering process legacy that is not well documented, and have a need to capture the process and automate it using a variety of possible mechanisms.  Corporations that have this need are found in all industries: aerospace, automotive, heavy industry and others.  Application of the developed tool will result in dramatic time savings through automation of labor intensive engineering analysis operations, and will enable the codification and preservation of engineering analysis and design procedures.

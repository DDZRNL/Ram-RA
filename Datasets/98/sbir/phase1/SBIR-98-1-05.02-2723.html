<BLOCKQUOTE>
The catalytic ignition (CI) system will benefit NASA's General Aviation Propulsion Plan.  With no moving parts, the CI or "SmartPlug" replaces magnetos, high tension leads and plugs and represents revolutionary rather than evolutionary component innovation. The core technology is a pre-heated catalyst on a ceramic rod mounted in a small pre-combustion chamber. Heating of the catalyst is accomplished by an embedded DC heater. The SmartPlug consists of a hollow metallic threaded body with flame nozzles and prechamber which installs in replacement of spark plugs. The replaceable catalytic heating element initiates combustion and controls timing. Compression ignition is induced by timed catalytic reduction of the pre-chamber's activation energy producing almost instantaneous combustion in the pre-chamber. Multiple high velocity torches (flames) propagate toward the center of the cylinder. This combines the best features of Otto and Diesel cycles creating a more complete combustion than possible with spark, hot surface or straight combustion ignition. The CI is the only ignition which can selectively ionize fuel and oxygen prior to gaseous combustion. These reactions not only lead to more complete combustion (allowing ultra-lean burn) but also provide in-cylinder reduction of NOx. Once combustion is initiated, self-sustaining operation is possible without outside energy input.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This Phase I Proposal places significant emphasis on the prospects for rapid commercialization of the SmartPlug. Immediate (following Phase II) commercial entry into the Experimental Aircraft (EAA) market is anticipated. Joint Venture or Licensing Agreements will be sought during Phase II which will assure the financial requirements of FAA Certification. The finalization of ignitor design and manufacturing techniques during Phase II will open other very significant markets. In addition to the cost savings and other benefits listed above, the SmartPlug has demonstrated the ability to allow operation of small utility 2 and 4 stroke engines on JP Fuel. The U.S. Military (DOD) has a major requirement for high altitude UAVs, heavy fuel capable small engines and similar niche markets where the SmartPlug will be of great benefit. Major companies in the marine, utility engine and power generation industries have already expressed interest in the SmartPlug. NASA's SBIR participation with ATI will greatly accelerate the development and commercialization of the product and directly benefit NASA's general aviation initiatives.

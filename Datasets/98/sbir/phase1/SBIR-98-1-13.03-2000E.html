Lidar system efficiency is a critical factor in sensor performance.  Furthermore, high-speed or targets can produce substantial Doppler shifts (6 to 7 GHz at 2 mm for a typical spaceborne global wind monitoring scenario).  These Doppler shifts exceed current state-of-the-art 2 mm detector technology.  A common proposed technique for coping with these large Doppler shifts is to utilize an offset-locked optical local oscillator.  However, this approach is complex and may not be needed if high-efficiency wideband photoreceivers can be developed.  In this Phase I/II effort we propose to develop high-efficiency wideband (~ 7 GHz) 2 mm heterodyne receiver technologies.  To achieve the bandwidth goal, detector quantum efficiency (QE) may be compromised.  We propose to recover much of this and other receiver-train losses using an optical preamplifier.  For high QE detectors the amplifier would not be beneficial.  Instead, efficiency gains will be achieved via the deployment of a dual-port balanced heterodyne receiver.  The Phase I program will carry out a combined analysis and laboratory demonstration program to establish optimal and realizable receiver configurations applicable across a broad range of measurement scenarios.  The Phase I/II program will significantly advance the coherent laser radar state-of-the-art and will result in commercial products with improved performance and lower power consumption.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The high efficiency aspect of this technology development will result in substantial reductions in sensor size, weight and power consumption for virtually all coherent laser radar applications such as ground-based wind sensing, aircraft wake-vortex monitoring, hard target vibration sensing and coherent DIAL.  Wideband coherent laser radar applications such as spaceborne global wind monitoring, high speed civil transport clear-air turbulence sensing, long-range high-speed target identification and tracking will also benefit significantly from this technology.

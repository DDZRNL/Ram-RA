<BLOCKQUOTE>
Morgan Research Corporation proposes to develop a unique non-contact method of mapping the uniformity of carrier concentrations and absorption in binary and tertiary semiconducting compounds of zinc in the temperature range of 300K-77K (Phase I) and 300K-10K (Phase II) that uses the Faraday rotation effect.  This technique will quantify the effects of microgravity on critical electronic properties of important IR detector materials.  The proposed method has significant advantages over conventional contact methods when characterizing electronic uniformity in materials grown in a microgravity environment and on earth.  The proposed method greatly reduces the chance of contaminating the material to be characterized since electrical contacts do not have to be alloyed to the material as is now done with conventional contact methods.  Since variations in carrier concentration within a sample can be determined with this technique, two-dimensional mapping is possible, which is another significant advantage this method has over conventional methods such as the Hall technique.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The proposed technology will significantly lower IR detector/FPA array cost and increase yield from an estimated 2-5% to ~90%, by utilizing its unique capability to screen out unacceptable material at the start of the device manufacturing process instead of at the end as must now be done.  This technology applies to manufacturing devices for such applications as satellite and missile systems.  Specific examples of IR systems include vision enhancement for aircraft takeoffs and landings, air-to-ground wake vortex detection on aircraft, automatic braking devices, and object detection.  Process control applications include temperature measurement, moisture measurement, and nondestructive evaluation.  Orbiting satellites use IR systems for monitoring the earth's environment.

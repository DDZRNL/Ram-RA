<BLOCKQUOTE>
Many missions in x-ray astronomy require thin foil filters with enhanced strength and durability that provide high-throughput across the soft x-ray and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrum.  In particular, there are needs for soft x-ray filters with significantly higher transmission in the wavelength regions from 40 Å to 170 Å and for EUV filters that provide higher throughput and are more environmentally stable for the region 750 Å to 1034 Å.  While filters can be made from materials that show theoretical promise in the soft x-ray region (Zr, Nb, Rh, Pd), they have not been characterized optically. Ytterbium also shows promise as a filter candidate for the longer EUV wavelengths.  Enhancements in strength and durability are required, both to reduce susceptibility to oxidation and aging effects, and to make it possible to produce much larger filters.  The proposed innovation is a new set of material combinations tailored to meet these goals.  During Phase I the feasibility of producing high-throughput filters with improved durability will be demonstrated.  The manufacturing techniques can then be developed during Phase II.  The benefit to NASA will be the improved mission performance for future astronomy experiments at lower cost.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) is the leading candidate for producing integrated circuits with feature sizes approaching 0.1 microns.  Intel Corporation is funding EUVL development through Sandia and other national laboratories. Luxel is currently supplying test filters to Sandia.  One result of the proposed research would be thin foil filter windows optimized for the EUV lithography wavelength of 134 Å. The worldwide demand for production lithography tools could be for 1000 machines per year, of which EUVL filter windows are an essential component.

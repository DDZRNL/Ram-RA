<BLOCKQUOTE>
A multifunction solar array / antenna can be achieved by integrating the radiating elements into the solar array surface.  This study contract will define and evaluate designs which combine advanced solar concentrator technology with traditional antenna array technology.  The COI solar concentrator approach enables the integration concept by providing paths through the solar concentrator elements to the distributed radiating elements.  The end goal is an integrated design that has performance and stowed volume equivalent to traditional solar arrays but incorporating an array of radiating antenna elements.  Currently, antenna array designs are stand-alone sandwich structures made from aluminum or composites that require their own deployment.  This study will develop designs which provide for power generation and telecommunications antenna functions in a single aperture after a single deployment.  Our concept design(s) will address precision installation of the antenna elements and define compatible transmission line technologies with respect to stiffness, CTE and thermal expansion.  The resulting design(s) will yield an antenna array aperture that is lightweight and compatible with available stowed volume, high stiffness, dimensionally stable and low cost.  One design concept may be more suitable for higher frequency apertures while another may be better for lower frequency applications requiring fewer radiating elements.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 A demand for large space-based antenna apertures has existed for many years.  The need for these apertures is expected to increase in the future.  Many of these future apertures will be required to fit within a restricted launch volume.  Current technologies for solar power and antenna arrays will drive the satellite’s launch volume.  The shrinking government budgets, as well as commercial requirements, may not tolerate the costs associated with the technology that is currently being used.  In recent years, considerable progress has been made toward the design and fabrication of solar concentrators from Polymer Matrix Composite (PMC) materials.  One of these concepts may also provide the necessary space for an array of radiating antenna elements.  Development is required to provide lighter multifunction structures which will meet the requirements of future military, science and commercial systems.  COI has identified a solar concentrator design and several approaches that offer a genuine opportunity to move these lightweight multifunction apertures into future space systems.  Our proposed Phase I SBIR program is an important step in the development and implementation of these technologies

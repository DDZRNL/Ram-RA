<BLOCKQUOTE>
A scheme for combining the space vehicle functions of cryogenic storage,cryogenic insulation, structure and thermal protection (TPS) in a thermally
integrated structure, ThIS, will be investigated.  The scheme uses aerogels
for TPS and insulation and an innovative cryogenic tank/structure
manufacturing process.  Aerogels are very light-weight and have extremely
low conductivities making them highly desirable for future space vehicles.
The innovative technique of using thermally sprayed metals on polyurethane
molds to form cryogenic tank/structure; then melting the mold out of the
resultant assembly offers savings in cost and weight.

To optimize the concept, Phase I will address the following: 1) the best
form and curing process for the aerogel, 2) the need for aerogel
reinforcing, and 3) the choice of an outer layer to be applied to the
aerogel to make it impervious to moisture and other environmental
conditions.  During Phase I thermal and structural tests will be performed
on small, sample configurations.  Manufacturing techniques will also be
examined to assure feasibility.  Phase I will determine the feasibility
of the proposed ThIS concept and provide a comprehensive plan for more
elaborate development and testing in Phase II.  Manufactured versions of
the ThIS concept have great potential for Phase III commercialization.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Triton Systems proposes two new synthetic routs to BAX [alpha,alpha' bis(4-aminophenyl)-p-xylene],  a non-mutagenic diamine, to be used with NE and BTDE to develop new lower cost non-mutagenic polyimide resins of the PMR class, called here PMR-BAX. The current synthesis of BAX is a multi-step process, requiring a hydrogenation step and a flammable solvent.  Triton Systems, with experience in polyimide and poly(arylene ether) synthesis, proposes two synthetic routes to BAX that do not require a hydrogenation step or a flammable solvent, with expected high yields and low cost.  In a Phase I Program, Triton will synthesize BAX using both proposed new routes.  In Phase II, Triton will develop BAX made by the best and more cost effective route as determined by the Phase I effort.  In a Phase III program, with an industrial partner, Triton develop the process for scale production of BAX for field testing and product refinement in pre-production to support the effort to increase the readiness level of PMR resins formulated from this monomer.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Triton Systems anticipates that as a result of this Phase I program, a new low cost non-mutagenic BAX diamine monomer will be developed to make superior-polyimide composite materials of the PMR class.  The commercial potential is that of the high volume PMR-15 adhesive resin now used in aerospace fabrication and repair.

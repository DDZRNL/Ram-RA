<BLOCKQUOTE>
Makel Engineering Inc. proposes to develop a compact, rugged, smart sensor module capable of measuring multiple gas species and physical parameters.  The sensor module will provide measurement of hydrogen, oxygen, ambient pressure, and temperature.   This multi-parameter smart sensor (MPSS) will use solid-state, silicon based MEMS sensor technology.  The proposed sensor module will be capable of being connected into a digitally controlled data or distributed control system.  The sensor module will be miniature in size enabling a large number of sensors to be used on launch facilities or vehicles.  These modules will provide real-time data suitable for launch readiness assessments and integrated vehicle health management.  The sensor modules will be designed to withstand harsh launch conditions.  The proposed multi-parameter sensor module system will provide: (1) real-time quantitive gas concentration, pressure, and temperature measurements, (2) lightweight, robust modules suitable for launch environments, (3) digital communications immune to EMI and RFI, and (4) built-in-test and health monitoring capability.  The proposed sensor module will exploit the latest advances in MEMS sensor technology to produce a highly integrated sensor module for NASA and commercial applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The proposed multi-parameter smart sensor is directly applicable to the industrial gas detection industry.  Rapid commercialization of this system is expected because of; (1) the growing use of distributed control systems, (2)the increasing industrial demand for hydrogen detection for applications such as fuel cells, high energy batteries, and integrated circuit manufacturing, (3) the potential of the technology to produce a low cost device, and (4) the flexibility of the system deisgn to use interchangeable sensors for different gases and industrial applications.

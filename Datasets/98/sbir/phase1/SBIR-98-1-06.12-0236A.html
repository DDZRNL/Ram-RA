<BLOCKQUOTE>
The use of catathermal, or catalytically enhanced (surface-catalyzed), combustion allows combustion systems to operate at improved efficiencies outside conventional air/fuel mixture ratios and at lower combustion temperatures. It can speed the combustion process, increasing heat release rates and allowing complete combustion to occur while minimizing detrimental byproducts such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. An Ultramet ceramic foam substrate, serving as the catalyst support for this technology, yields a catalyst device that not only improves combustion efficiency by at least 2-4% but also prevents flameout during fuel/air ratio fluctuations and minimizes the combustor exit temperature profile which maximizes turbine blade life. In this project, Ultramet proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of a catalytic combustion system constructed around a reticulated ceramic foam substrate coated with a low-cost, environmentally benign mixed metal oxide catalyst system. Subscale combustor performance and emissions will be characterized, and a catalyst/support system will be demonstrated that is structurally and thermally compatible with catalytic combustion systems, has sufficient life, thermal shock resistance, and high temperature capability, and is immune to thermal poisoning effects.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Catalytic combustion systems can reduce pollution and increase combustion efficiency in aerospace applications such as the High-Speed Civil Transport, turbojet/turboshaft engines, tactical missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and rotorcraft. Potential commercial uses include domestic heating, natural gas-powered pumps and turboelectric generators, and efficient utilization of low-grade byproduct gases in the petrochemical, metals processing, and waste incineration industries.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The proposed innovation to be addressed in this work is the development of a cost efficient, high-resolution CMOS Active Pixel Sensor (APS) digital camera-on-a-chip with potential opportunities for high bandwidth real time video image processing and image-based object detection (especially in the area of machine algorithms for air-to-air collision and near-miss target detection from on-a-chip image sensors). 
The CMOS APS camera-on-a-chip technology was recently invented and developed by the Photobit's founders during their former employment with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and in the past three years at Photobit.  It is a high performance, low power, very compact and cost efficient CMOS image sensor technology that provides resolution, sensitivity and dynamic range competitive with CCDs yet offers significant system advantages.

In Phase I, optimal architectures to achieve both excellent image quality and a reasonable chip size will be investigated.  The technical feasibility of obtaining ultra-high resolution conforming to HDTV standard (1,920 x 1,080), dynamic range over 60dB (10bit), frame rate up to 60Hz and output data flow around 1Gbit/sec will be studied.  Main circuitry to implement the multi-million pixel camera-on-a-chip will be designed and simulated.  Special considerations for post-camera image processing and signal compression will be performed.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	The continued development of compact, efficient, and reliable lasers for altimetry and ranging is of special concern to NASA. In particular, reducing the power requirements, weight, and volume of these devices to enable their use on a wide variety of platforms is as critical as their optical performance. In the proposed effort, we intend to develop an innovative diode-laser-pumped, passively Q-switched, Nd:YLF laser to generate milli-Joule energy, <5 ns duration pulses at kilo-Hertz rates. The optical design is simple with a low component count, that is extremely compact and rugged. The pumping geometry is a high-brightness end-pumping design. The pump source may be fiber-coupled and remote from the laser head allowing for optimal placement of the pump source for heat removal and package integration. The passive Q-switching technique eliminates the need for either the high voltages or the RF power needed to drive active Q-switches, thereby enhancing system reliability.	The proposed work is expected to demonstrate the feasibility of the diode-laser-pumped, passively Q-switched, Nd:YLF laser described above. This work would form the basis of a Phase II effort, to improve the output power and efficiency, develop engineered saturable absorbers, and build a prototype packaged laser system for evaluation by NASA and for further development for use in commercial applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	The proposed system technology has immediate applications in altimetry and ranging systems. Additionally, the core laser technology has applications that include aerosol lidar, laser marking, materials processing, imaging, and photo-resist/photo-plate exposure for the reprographics industry. The high peak powers allow for nonlinear conversion to other wavelengths and additional market coverage.

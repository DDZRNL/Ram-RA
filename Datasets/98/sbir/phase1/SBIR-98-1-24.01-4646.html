<BLOCKQUOTE>
 We propose to develop and demonstrate an innovative system for multi-ship flight path management of multiple Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles (UCAV) based on a learning neural network guidance algorithm known as an Adaptive Critic. This system will automate such processes as formation flying and coordinated attack so that a substantial workload is removed from an operator. The operator will simply specify the final formation and an automatic guidance system will specify flight paths for each aircraft. A robust outer-loop control system on board each aircraft can then generate controls which will execute the commanded maneuvers.Automating multi-ship flight path management is improtant because several UCAV must be coordinated by a single operator. He cannot pilot more than one aircraft effectively by himself. Therefore, a substantial amount of automation must be performed. Each aircraft must fly itself. The operator must be freed to operate all the aircraft as a single unit. With our system, instead of deciding how each aircraft must be moved to get the group into a desired formation, he will select some variation on a pre-specified maneuver and the flight control systems of the aircraft will execute it.

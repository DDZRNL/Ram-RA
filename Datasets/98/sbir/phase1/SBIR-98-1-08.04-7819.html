<BLOCKQUOTE>
Heat pipes, loop heat pipes, and capillary pumped loops are valued passive thermal transport devices for both terrestrial and space-based applications. Such two-phase systems exploit capillary forces which circulate the working fluid in the cycle. Thus, a balance between capillary driving pressure and viscous resistance serves as the primary limit to thermal performance. To circumvent this limitation, TDA Research, Inc. proposes development of a passive thermal cycle that generates driving pressure gradients 100-fold larger than current state-of-the-art capillary pressure gradients. For space applications, with such large increases in driving force, flow-through radiators with small passages may be employed, significantly decreasing the size and weight of the thermal control/rejection system.
The passive thermal cycle proposed can exploit recent advances in radiator technology. Phase I research will focus on the characterization of the thermal cycle in terms of system geometry, properties, and specific application (ground- or space-based). Phase II development work will produce an optimized design for satellite heat rejection using flow-through radiators.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The passive thermal transport loop generates high driving pressures gradients: it does not suffer from capillary flow limitations, achieves the reliability of parallel-path systems, and can exploit lightweight radiator technology. Commercial applications will be in the thermal control of unmanned satellites (i.e., communication satellites) for the removal of heat from electronic components.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Despite the success of Sony and others with Co-based Li-ion batteries,cathode materials with higher capacities present a major development
challenge in the U.S.  The program objective of this Phase I is the
synthesis of a stabilized LiCo(x)Ni(1-x)O(2) intercalation cathode material
with enhanced capacity and improved cycle life.  Our innovation is 
concerned with doping the lithiated mixed-metal oxide with a third metal
ion which is judiciously selected to stabilize its structure.  The dopant
ion will prevent irreversible site exchanges between Li and transition metal ions within the lattice of the mixed-metal oxides, the root cause
of capacity loss in the undoped materials.  These materials will be 
developed for use in future planetary missions requiring high energy 
density rechargeable batteries capable of operating at low temperatures.
In Phase I we will synthesize, characterize, and demonstrate the enhanced
cycle life of the doped LiCo(x)Ni(1-x)O(2) cathode materials, and test the
viability of these materials for future planetary missions by performance
testing with electrolytes formulated for low temperatures.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These cathode materials will be the key components in high energy density,long cycle life rechargeable Li-ion batteries for military and commercial
uses.  Li-ion batteries with these new high capacity, high voltage 
LiCo(x)Ni(1-x)O(2) cathodes will find use in both the government and private sectors.  Potential consumer products in which they can be used include hand-held communication devices, portable computers, and remote power packs.  Government applications include planetary space missions
for NASA and communication devices for the U.S. military.

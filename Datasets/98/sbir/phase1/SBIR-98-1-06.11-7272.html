<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Silicon carbide integrated circuit devices capable of operating up to 1200&#61616;C are being developed.  However, no packages are available for these devices to be integrated into systems.  This program will develop a hermetically sealed aluminum nitride ceramic package for silicon carbide devices operating at 500&#61616;C and beyond.
In Phase I, commercially available aluminum nitride substrates will be metallized with a suitable high temperature metallization.  Silicon carbide die will be bonded to the metallized substrate via brazing.  Die to package interconnection will be done by wire bonding.  Test vehicles will be fabricated to evaluate high temperature stability of the substrate metallization, die attach, and wire bonding systems.  Electron microscopy and electron spectroscopy will be used to characterize the interfaces between dissimilar components.

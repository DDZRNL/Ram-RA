<BLOCKQUOTE>
 c^2 Biotechnologies, Inc. proposes a new optical method for the analysis of DNA and other nucleic acids which meets NASA's stated goals for understanding the Earth's ecosystems.  Phase I targets a basic proof-of-principle.  The technology is a flow-through system based on nanostructures, optical physics, surface chemistry, semiconductor fabrication, and traditional molecular biology.  The first part of the project will be used to design and build the prototype apparatus and detection system.  The second part of the Phase I project will be used to test the physical principles behind the method.  The long-term objectives of the proposal is to develop a universal solid-state method of genetic analysis capable of sequencing, expression mapping, and diagnostics.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The outputs of high-peak-power laser systems are regularly shifted towards the ultraviolet (UV) using nonlinear optical (NLO) materials.  Beta barium borate (BBO), widely integrated into current laser systems, is the primary NLO material for UV generation.  Unfortunately, full utilization of BBO (and other crystals) in the UV is restricted by intensity dependent absorption (IDA), laser damage thresholds (limited by surface finishing/AR coating technology), and failure to optimize the 3-wave mixing process.  Typical 266nm IDA losses and damage thresholds are 0.25cm-1 (at 50MW/cm2) and 100-200MW/cm2, respectively.  These severely restrict the conversion efficiency which can be reliably obtained.  For a given performance target, reduced conversion efficiency significantly increases the size, weight and/or power requirements of the laser system.  Measurements of the IDA of conventional and growth modified BBO, have been conducted along with EPR, photoluminescence, and mass spectrometry tests identifing possible extrinsic factors.  The performance of bare and enhanced AR-coated BBO was measured.  This information provides the basis for a Phase I program to minimize the causes of IDA and to improve the damage threshold and conversion efficiency of BBO and related crystals for optimized UV generation.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
BBO is the NLO material of choice for generating UV radiation from a wide range of high-peak-power laser systems.  These systems use harmonic conversion and/or parametric generation to produce UV suitable for many applications of lasers in the fields of remote laser induced emission spectroscopy, lidar, medicine, photochemistry, materials processing, and nonlinear optics.  BBO optimized for UV applications would find a wide range of uses in both government and commercial laser systems.  The Government would benefit from the broader development base and economies of scale.

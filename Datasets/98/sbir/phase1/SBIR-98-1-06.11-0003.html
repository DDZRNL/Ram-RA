<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) proposes to develop and demonstrate a Raman imaging system for high-pressure aeropropulsion applications.  The primary motivation for this work is to provide instantaneous two-dimensional measurements of species concentrations in practical combustion environments.  Raman scattering techniques do not require the introduction of any flow markers and may provide simpler interpretation than other scattering techniques.  The proposed Raman imaging system will provide critical information for the design and development of advanced aeropropulsion systems.  In the Phase I experiments, PSI will demonstrate Raman imaging in an existing high-pressure gas turbine combustor simulator at PSI.  This facility can be easily adapted to accept a range of fuel types and is representative of a general class of problems in high-pressure combustion.  An existing flash-lamp-pumped dye laser will be modified to demonstrate both intracavity and extracavity measurement techniques.  An existing intensified CCD array camera with a unique multi-wavelength viewer attachment will simultaneously image both fuel and oxygen concentrations.  The Phase I experiments will be used to design a deliverable Raman imaging system for a targeted NASA combustion application during the Phase II portion of the program.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The proposed measurement technique and system has application to the development and testing of a wide range of practical combustion systems operating at elevated pressure.  These include gas turbines for stationary power generation, advanced low-emissions aeroengines, and advanced propulsion systems such as SCRAMJETs or pulsed detonation engines.  Physical Sciences Inc.'s Aerodynamic Measurement Technology Business area was established in 1992 to address this commercial market and has generated several million dollars in sales to date, including custom instrumentation suites, testing services, and consulting.

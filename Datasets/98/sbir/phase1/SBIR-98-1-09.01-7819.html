<BLOCKQUOTE>
TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes to develop a catalytic process for the in-situ generation of liquid hydrocarbon propellants from carbon dioxide and hydrogen on the surface of Mars.  The Martian atmosphere is mostly composed of CO2 which can be converted into CO and reacted with hydrogen carried from Earth to produce liquid propellants for the return flight.  Using liquid propellant significantly reduces the mass of the spacecraft and cargo which must be brought from Earth.  Because the hydrogen to carbon ratio of liquid hydrocarbons is approximately 2, less hydrogen is required to make liquid propellants rather than methane.  Additionally, liquid hydrocarbon propellants do not require cryogenic storage which also saves weight.  These advantages make the in-situ generation of liquid hydrocarbon propellants an attractive alternative to replace or augment in-situ generated propellants such as methane and methanol.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A significant portion of the worlds natural gas resources (equivalent to 800 billion barrels of oil) is either in off-shore or remote locations that are presently uneconomical to develop.  The catalyst technology for the synthesis of middle distillate hydrocarbon propellants from synthesis gas (CO and H2) on Mars is directly applicable to the conversion of off-shore and remote natural gas.  In the industrial application, natural gas is converted into synthesis gas which is then fed to the Fischer-Tropsch reactor which produces liquid hydrocarbons.  This process makes it possible to develop natural gas resources where pipeline construction or liquefied natural gas are prohibitively expensive.

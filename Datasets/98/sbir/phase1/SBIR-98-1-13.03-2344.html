<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This initiative designs and fabricates robust, solid state, ultra-high spectral resolution filters, for use at 1064 nm and 355 nm as a lidar receiver with doppler capability.  The two systems are similar, except for pre-filtering and dispersive element coatings, and provide spectral resolutions of better than 100 MHz at 1064 nm and better than 1 GHz at 355 nm. The methodology utilizes Fabry-Perot etalons with refreactive index variability provided by nematic liquid crystal control.  The fully developed, twin etalon systems to be supplied in Phase II are based upon the design and fabrication of a single, high spectral resolution etalon with 3 cm gap spacing in Phase I (for the 1064 nm system), and upon fabrication of a 335 nm - 400 nm relflective dielectric coating (for the 355 nm system).  Scientific Solutions Inc. (SSI) has pioneered and demonstrated liquid crystal Fabry-Perot (LC-FP) etalons with smaller gaps and lower spectral resolution than this application.  As such, this project innovates a demonstrated technology for ultra-high resolutions specifically appropriate for daytime doppler lidar applications. These LC-FP filters feature electronic tunability, vibration and radiation insensitivity, high throughput, and light weight design that are unmatched by any other current technology in a single unit.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 An LC etalon is a single, lightweight unit, nearly impervious to vibration or shock.  As such it is an ideal component for chemical imaging or spectroscopy systems for use in space or other hostile environments  In addition, electronic spectral tunability of four etalons simultaneously is accomplished with very little power ( less than 200 mA at 12 V) and no moving parts. The capabilities and of the filter systems we provide are thus well adapted to NASA requirements for smaller, lighter systems for on-orbit, airborne, or sub-orbital  platforms. The proposed tunable filters are ideally suited to narrow band isolation required in LIDAR and general laser applications. Beyond that, numerous commercial concerns express interest in tunable filtering.  Environmental and related applications can benefit from the ability to remotely identify chemical cloud composition and to precisely determine location and abundance of toxic chemicals. Both the textile and paper industries have communicated interest in robust, easily tunable filters for the purpose of monitoring product uniformity.

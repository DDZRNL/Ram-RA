<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Boston MicroSystems Inc. will apply its  innovative bulk SiC micromachining processes to fab-ricate, for the first time, under-etched membranes of precise and reproducible thickness leading to the  fabrication of  pressure sensors with high sensitivity, stability and interchangeability.  This project simultaneously satisfies a number of NASA's objectives and requirements under subtopic 06.11 including (a) MEMS based pressure sensors capable of operating under extreme conditions of temperature and gaseous/chemical environments (b) innovations in silicon carbide sensor fab-rication and  (c ) compatibility and ready integration with high-temperature SiC based electronics and/or structural ceramics. During Phase I, we will (a) fabricate and evaluate freestanding single crystal SiC pressure sensor membranes, (b) optimize process parameters for fabricating the key elements of the device, (c ) investigate new metallization schemes, and (d) design a prototype SiC pressure sensor suitable for insertion into aeropropulsion systems.  The SiC pressure sensor will satisfy the growing need for sensors capable of functioning while mounted in hot engine and air frame surfaces of air and space vehicles, leading to savings in weight, aircraft safety, im-provements in engine performance and control, and provide new test instrumentation capabilities for developing next generation aircraft systems.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 SiC MEMS based devices will satisfy the  pressing needs of the aerospace, automotive and proc-ess industries for pressure sensors capable of operating under extreme conditions of temperature and gaseous/chemical environment for use in (a)  advanced aeropropulsion control systems (b) combustion monitoring and exhaust pressure measurements and  (c ) chemical processing facili-ties. Compatibility and ready integration with high-temperature SiC based electronics provides for substantial savings in cost and weight coupled with improved functionality, of special interest to the aerospace industry.

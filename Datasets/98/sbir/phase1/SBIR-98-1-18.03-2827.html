<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 A new device technology is proposed which exploits an etching technology capable of creating through wafer channels in silicon using a controllable etch process.  The deep channel etching can be used to build trench capacitors, transformers, power diodes and power transistors that use far less real estate than similar planar devices and enable higher energy and power density devices.  The phase I program proposes to demonstrate the viability of the technology by building simple capacitor, inductor and diode structures on the walls of high aspect ratio channels in silicon.  The capacitor will demonstrate that energy capacities in excess of 1 J/cm3 can be achieved with the appropriate dielectric material.  The inductor will demonstrate the viability of building on chip transformers that do not consume large amounts of real estate.  The diode device will demonstrate the viability of producing active components in the channels.  The Phase II program will be used to build devices which test the potential limits of the technology.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 There are several large commercial opportunities for electronic power devices. Large junction devices will find applications in systems using large currents at low voltages.  Such systems include electric automotive power systems, ac and dc industrial motor control and large electromagnetic actuators.   Major market opportunities for both the active and passive devices also exists in the integrated power supply industry.  The continuing trend to reduce the size of power supplies while increasing their output naturally lends itself to the use of the proposed device structures.  Additional opportunities for high energy density capacitors exists in medical devices, most notably heart defibrilators where a pace maker like device is implanted directly in the chest cavity.

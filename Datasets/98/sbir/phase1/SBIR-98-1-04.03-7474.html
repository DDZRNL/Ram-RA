<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is a need to update the Space Shuttle’s Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), which provides hydraulic pressure to the vehicle’s flight control surfaces.  A new high-power-density motor technology, developed by Visual Computing Systems Corporation (VCS) and commercialized by Lynx Motion Technology Corporation (Lynx), will be able to provide the power of the present hydrazine powered APU efficiently and with less weight and cost than with conventional motor technologies.  In addition, the new electric APU (EAPU) system will be more reusable, more reliable, and will reduce turn-around time and cost between flights.  In the proposed Phase I SBIR effort, the VCS development team, working with Lynx and with support from Boeing North American, will design, construct and test a proof-of-concept, high-speed motor based on commercial Lynx motor products. This will be used to demonstrate the viability of the motor technology.  Additional modeling and analyses will be employed to develop a plan for a Phase II motor design, optimized for the EAPU application.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The proposed research could be used to significantly improve the performance of numerous military and commercial systems, including: starting motors and alternators for turbine engines, flywheel motor/alternators, vehicle traction motors for electric cars, buses, trains and earth-moving equipment, surface and underwater propulsion motors, and general-purpose industrial high-power motors.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop the growth, fabrication, and testing procedures necessary to produce mid-infrared avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays.  There is a requirement for detector arrays sensitive in the 1500 to 2200 nm wavelength range.  Current mid-infrared detectors are typically PIN devices or photoconductors, depending on the wavelength region.  Substantial improvements in sensitivity can be expected through the use of APDs, which can provide significant gain and, with cooled operation, can be used for photon counting.  Avalanche photodiode arrays can be used for improved imaging or for fast acquisition of low-level spectroscopic data.  With an APD array, not only the incidence of a single photon, but also its position can be measured.  AstroPower has previously developed mid-infrared APDs using liquid-phase heteroepitaxy of lattice-matched InGaAsSb and AlGaAsSb on GaSb substrates.  In the 1500 to 2200 nm wavelength range, these devices have shown substantial avalanche multiplication at room temperature.  This Phase I project will optimize these mid-infrared APDs and integrate them into linear arrays.  The Phase II program will develop two-dimensional arrays of these mid-infrared APDs.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 These mid-infrared APD arrays will be useful in airborne and space-based laser altimeter sensors as well as ground-based satellite laser ranging systems.  Photodetectors operating in the mid-IR range also have large potential use in gas sensors since there are strong absorption bands due to water and many industrial gases in this range.  These APDs will have a variety of commercial applications in air pollution monitoring, industrial process control, automobile emission monitoring, air traffic control, infrared spectroscopy and fiber optic communication.

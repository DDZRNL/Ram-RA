<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Thorleaf Research, Inc. proposes to develop new, very low power MEMS-based gas chromatography (GC) instrumentation for coupling with with miniaturized mass spectrometers (MS) such as the miniature quadrupole MS arrays, miniature rotating field MS instruments, and micromachined Bessel Box energy analyzers, currently under development at NASA/JPL.  The combination of fast MEMS-based GC separations technology with miniature MS detectors offers the potential of highly robust GC/MS micro-instruments for important spaceflight applications.  These include instrumentation for unmanned planetary missions, safety monitoring of human exposure to airborne contaminants in space stations or future Mars habitats, and process monitoring for the extraction of planetary resources.  The goal of the proposed SBIR Phase I effort is to analyze GC requirements for coupling to miniature MS technology for specific chemical measurement applications of interest to NASA, and to develop a detailed MEMS-based design for fabricating prototype instrumentation in Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Analysis of commercial instrumentation markets shows that two of the three major growth areas for analytical instrumentation are real-time analysis and environmental monitoring, with projected annual growth rates of more than 15%.   There is a significant technology gap for low power sensors that can be miniaturized for field use while retaining the analytical capability of larger laboratory instruments.  The proposed SBIR effort to develop new MEMS-based GC instrumentation suitable for coupling withminiature mass spectrometer technology addresses this need in an innovative way, and thus technical developments in the proposed program could have a significant market impact.

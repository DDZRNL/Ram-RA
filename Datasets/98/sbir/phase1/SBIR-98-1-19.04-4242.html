<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is an urgent need to develop improved damping performance for ceramic matrix composite turbine blades (CMC) on the VentureStar reusable launch vehicle.  The inherently low damping of standard CMC blades may require auxiliary damping treatments that will lower the engine efficiency by limiting RPM or adding weight.  Foster-Miller is currently a subcontractor to Boeing Rocketdyne in development of CMC turbine blisks for their Ceramic Turbine Technology Demonstrator.  This work constitutes a Phase III SBIR success from the original blisk development on a previous Air Force Phase II contract.  Foster-Miller proposes to continue this successful SBIR commercialization with development of a high self-damping CMC blade.  The unique blade and blisk architecture in the Foster-Miller blisk creates the opportunities for unique internal damping that is anticipated to approach 2% critical damping at operating temperatures, without the need for external damping techniques.  The blade architecture will apply to both a blisk approach or to insertable blade designs.  Foster-Miller will work closely with Boeing Rocketdyne throughout this program.  This relationship with Rocketdyne will ensure a rapid transition to the prototype RLV engine demonstrator in 2000.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The proposed program will directly benefit the ongoing NASA efforts to successfully develop the VentureStar RLV.  The highly damped blade techniques proposed will be utilized on the Rocketdyne prototype engine if proven to be successful.  This will lead to incorporation into the flight article VentureStar.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Current aluminum heat pipe systems offer excellent heat rejection capability for modern spacecraft, but carry a high mass penalty.  A graphite-aluminum heat pipe system being developed by COI/R3 and Dynatherm potentially offers comparable thermal performance as all-aluminum systems, but at greater stiffness and lighter weight.   This hybrid heat pipe system would also be designed for mass production to reduce costs.
The focus of this study will be to optimize the working design of a graphite-aluminum heat pipe system that uses ammonia as the working fluid.  Critical design parameters include thermal performance, weight, cost, and material compatibility.  Preliminary material level testing has yielded favorable results, but there are numerous technical issues that arise from integrating the subsystems into a full panel.   Methods to improve performance through material selection and design will be evaluated, as will efforts  to reduce costs through reducing labor requirements or improving the extrusion processes.

Currently, this technology is optimized for the Teledesic spacecraft program, but would be applicable to any system that rejects heat in the 40 - 70 C range.  Evaluation of other working fluids will also be conducted that would expand the applicability of this technology to even more programs.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This technology has been developed for the low cost, high production requirements of low Earth orbit communication satellite systems.   The panels are being designed to be mass produced in assembly line format, which will significantly lower unit costs.  Low Earth communication satellite systems will eliminate the signal delays associated with traditional communication satellites, but will require numerous units in a constellation.  The cost benefits of mass production and reduced weight are therefore significantly increased over single-unit applications.

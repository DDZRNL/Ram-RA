<BLOCKQUOTE>
This Project describes the concept and associated R&D required to develop an on-board satellite crossconnect system capable of simultaneously switching 16 uplink ports to 16 downlink ports, at 18 Gb/s per port, for next generation Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) or Gigabit Satellite Network (GSN) types of systems. The proposed crossconnect system is based on high data rate optical code division multiple access (optical CDMA) techniques. Because of the simultaneous communication supported by the CDMA scheme, the on-board satellite bisection bandwidth is 16x18 Gb/s (or 288-times, i.e., >100-fold, the current ACTS switching or routing capacity). The optical CDMA implementation is based on integrating (1) a mode-locked (18 GHz), 1550 nm laser diode array developed by the NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory for wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) applications with (2) WDM/CDMA optical CDMA techniques developed by Mendez R&D Associates. While the proposed concept is primarily intended for on-board satellite signal processing, the optical CDMA transceivers and encoders/decoders can also be used for satellite optical cross-links by incorporating suitable optical amplifiers and pointing/tracking subsystems. For radiation-hard environments, the concept can be translated to 1300 nm fiber optic and laser transceiver technologies.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The optical CDMA product developed on this Project is applicable to    (1) LEO, MEO, and GEO communication satellite cross-connects as well as LEO cross-links; 
   (2) cross-connecting and cross-linking advanced space missions based on clusters of microsatellites such as the AF TechSat21; and 
   (3) commercial enterprise networking for distributed computing and cluster computing applications.

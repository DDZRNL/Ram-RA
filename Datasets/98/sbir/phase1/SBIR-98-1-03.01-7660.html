<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Noise is an important source of passenger and crew discomfort in commercial jetliners and military aircraft. Frequent travelers will attest to the fatigue generated by several hours of exposure to this continuous, although not ear-piercing, rumble. Broadband cabin noise is generated by turbulence propagating along the airframe and by adjacent jet exhaust, depicted in Figure 1. The airframe vibration causes the trim panels to vibrate via structural and acoustic paths through the trim panel cavity. This creates 85 to 90 dB(A) of noise in the cabin. Typically, the noise energy is concentrated at the lower end of the spectrum from 100-600 Hz. The proposed work addresses solutions to the problem of low-frequency broadband turbulent boundary layer and exhaust noise in aircraft. Prior art, including low-Q elastomeric frame vibration absorbers, soft-mounting of trim panels, and passive Helmholtz resonators, is compared with Hood Technology's innovative concept of an array of independent active acoustic cells in the trim-panel cavity. These cells, consisting of an acoustic actuator, a microphone, and feedback electronics, null the sound pressure at their microphones, effectively reducing the acoustic impedance of the trim panel cavity. These methods of cabin noise attenuation will be compared on the bases of performance, weight penalty, complexity, and cost.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a scheme to reduce broadband noise on aircraft. If the research yields an effective solution which is low-cost and adds little weight, the commercial potential is vast. The airline crew would benefit from the more pleasant work environment. Travelers would have a much more enjoyable ride. And every commercial airline would need to retrofit their aircraft to keep pace with their competitors.

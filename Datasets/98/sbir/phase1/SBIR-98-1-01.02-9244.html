<BLOCKQUOTE>
This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project supports thepreliminary research of an integrated state-of-the-art wireless communication and control system that will provide air traffic control (ATC) to airport surface-vehicle communication, complete airport surface-vehicle surveillance by ATC, and automated airport surface-fleet management. 
Currently, inefficient surface movement causes significant delays for both air-cargo and passenger flights that result in adverse economic ramifications. Additionally, inadequate surface control has led to collisions between surface vehicles and aircraft. 
The proposed system will significantly enhance the efficiency of airport surface-vehicle movement and ensure safe control of this movement. This SBIR supports research to establish:
1. the frequency spectrum of the channel most suitable for the proposed wireless system; 
2. a statistical model of the channel; and
3. the optimal selection of the many parameters of the system.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Air-cargo operators and passenger carriers incur significant operatingcosts due to aircraft delays. This creates a strong commercial market for technology that increases the efficiency of airport surface operations. A goal of the proposed research is to develop bandwidth-efficient wireless systems for communications and tracking. This will enable airlines to improve the coordination between their surface operations and their business model.
    
Additionally, the United States government has set very aggressive goals 
for the reduction of runway incursion incidents, thus increasing demand for 
a comprehensive surface-management solution to be used by air-traffic 
controllers.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The specific proposed innovation is a compact, reliable, high volume liquid pump driven by piezoelectric crystals.  NASA needs this pump to circulate coolant in life support systems used in space suites for extravehicular operations.  Reliability is high because (1) there are no sliding or dynamic seals, and (2) the pump is so compact that a backup pump could be installed in the suit’s backpack if desired.  High flow capacity leads to improved cooling for increased human comfort in the space environment.  The overall objective is to fabricate, test, and deliver a prototype coolant pump to NASA for integration into a functional EVA system.  The objectives of Phase I are to prove feasibility by fabricating and testing a model piezoelectric drive system.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are commercial applications for the compact, high capacity, efficient cooling pump in medicine, occupational safety and health, and electronics. The piezoelectric pump can reduce the weight and increase the reliability of portable, actively cooled garments used for therapy and to relieve heat stress at the workplace.  Therapeutic applications include treatment of the symptoms of a range of disorders that include multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, spinal cord injuries, and diseases that prevent perspiration.  Compact, actively cooled garments can be used in chemical plants, utility and power plants, and HAZMAT operations.  The piezoelectric pump can be used in compact cooling systems for high power electronics in both commercial and defense applications.

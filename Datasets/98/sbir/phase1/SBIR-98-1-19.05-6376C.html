<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This innovative concept will develop a model for determining the fraction of neutral outgassed or vented molecules that leave a spacecraft, are then ionized by solar photons, and then return and deposit on spacecraft charged surfaces. Electrostatic Return (ESR) of ionized contaminants is a controversial issue and has been proposed as the only way degradation of surfaces at geosynchronous orbit can degrade. Modeling of this effect has not been done successfully to date. The approach is to use the Integrated Spacecraft Environments Model (ISEM) as  a starting point to incorporate all the aspects of ion generation and motion and subsequent return to a spacecraft, and develop a model capable of predicting ESR. ISEM was developed to incorporate interactions of molecules and the ambient atmosphere in discrete volumes around a spacecraft.  It is ideally suited to incorporate a model of ESR. Any space system geometry will be able to be analyzed without simplifying assumptions of spherical geometry. Flight data exists that the model will be applied to. During Phase I a candidate on-orbit space system will be selected for eventual model verification.  The results of this study will benefit NASA, DoD and industry.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The results of a successful model will benefit NASA, DoD and industry. The capabilities of the model will be marketed to all related NASA centers/personnel, DoD, industry, universities, and professional organizations.  This model in conjunction with the offeror's existing capability in contamination modeling will lead to enhanced marketing potential.

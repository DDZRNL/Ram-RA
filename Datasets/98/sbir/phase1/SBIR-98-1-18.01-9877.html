<BLOCKQUOTE>
NASA has identified the need to reduce spacecraft electrostatic discharges (ESD) while concurrently reducing spacecraft solar thermal load. Thus there is a need for improved low alpha electrically conductive coatings.  AZ Technology proposes to design, test and demonstrate a prototype innovative space stable white (solar absorptance less than 0.1) electrically conductive (surface resistivity less than 5 x 1007 ohm/sq.) coating that will be effective in reducing spacecraft ESD and solar thermal loading.  This novel coating will be resistant to space environment degradation effects and be easily applied to complex surfaces via high-volume, low-pressure spray technology.  AZ Technology’s new low alpha electrically conductive (LAEC) coating will improve upon existing state-of-the-art technology and allow greater latitude in design to spacecraft engineers.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Successful completion will result in a product which will be used by industries developing commercial electronic products and defense related space flight vehicles.  Commercial use of the product will be of interest to industries such as communications satellites, remote sensors, radar and any applications requiring conduction or dissipation of an electrical charge where bare metal would not be appropriate or cost effective, such as shipboard (including naval aircraft applications) electronic systems that are very susceptible to corrosion problems. Application to petroleum storage tanks is a potential market where solar thermal loading needs to be minimized to reduce hazardous vapors that an ESD could ignite.

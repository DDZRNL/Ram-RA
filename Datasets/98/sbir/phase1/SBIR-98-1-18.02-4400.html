<BLOCKQUOTE>
New polymer electrolytes are needed for lithium batteries to improve their performance, safety and reliability.  Accomplishing this task would improve 
the power options for present and future space exploratory missions.  The 
proposed effort seeks to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new type of 
composite polymer electrolyte for lithium batteries.

The work proposed here includes synthesis and characterization of an 
innovative, new polymer/composite electrolyte.  The synthesis will include 
new methods for preparing these electrolytes using an innovative chemical 
approach.  This feasibility demonstration will involve the electrochemical 
characterization of the proposed electrolyte and limited battery testing of 
the better candidate electrolytes to demonstrate their effectiveness.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When successful, the proposed technological innovation would benefit NASA because the proposed electrolytes would result in safer, more reliable 
secondary batteries with greater energy and power density.

The private sector would also benefit from this technological development 
since the market for portable power to run the latest electronic gadget 
seems insatiable.  Development of improved, safe high power batteries must 
continue since the demand for new electronics continues unabated.

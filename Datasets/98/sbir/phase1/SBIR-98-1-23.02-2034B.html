<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project investigates a structural materials concept with which the weight of ion thruster bodies and grids can be reduced over 75% compared with current hardware. The concept is based on novel fibrous core materials for use in insulating sandwich construction.  The methods and materials may be scaled equally to 10-mm microthrusters as well as 1000-mm cargo vehicle thrusters.  
Phase 1 effort will fabricate and test ion thruster component, including body, grid stack, propellant line, magnet rings and cathode assembly. Coatings for sputter resistance and radiation cooling will be investigated. Electrical breakdown characteristics of the core materials will be measured and high field-strength configurations will be identified.  Phase 2 would futher develop the materials and design to fabricate and test an ion thruster suited for microsatellite attitude control.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Lightweight ion thrusters should find immediate application in New Millenium missions as well as in commercial satellite applications.  Low-cost composite grid assemblies have application in commercial ion sources widely used in materials processing.  Generic aerospace applications exist for lightweight structural materials, such as electronics enclosures, antennas, and panels for radiators, radar and photovoltaic arrays.

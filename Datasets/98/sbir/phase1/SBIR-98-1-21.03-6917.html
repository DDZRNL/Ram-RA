<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This effort is directed at rapidly (e.g., 100 samples/sec) measuring the attitude (yaw, roll, pitch), the angular rates, and the displacements of a cylindrical bar, Requirements/constraints the implementation must satisfy are: (1) attitude standard deviation (s) of less than 0.006", (2) positional s of less than 3 mils (0.003 inches), (3) no thermal emission sources (e.g., incandescent lighting) are allowed below the cylinder, (4) no measurement sensors are allowed on the cylinder front loading side or back wall, (5) sensors have to track (initial) "instantaneous" yaw and pitch of 0.1 deg/sec and roll of 1deg/sec and displacements of 100 mils/sec over short measurement intervals (1 sample period).
The specific innovations are to utilize:  (1) passive markings (e.g., not active LEDs) on the cylindrical object being measured, (2) an array (e.g., 16) of precisely positioned fast (e.g., 220 frames/sec) stereo cameras (e.g., 256x256), (3) that are (at least) 3 ft. away, (4) an array of fast processors that are tightly coupled to the camera, resulting in a measurement system with an update rate to a controller of better than 100 samples/sec, including all pipeline delays (e.g., data acquisition, processing, data transfer), due to the proposed measurement system.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Magnetic suspension systems are applicable in a variety of low energy consumption bearing related spaceborne (e.g., satellite propulsion), airborne (e.g., pointing/tracking) and ground based (e.g., wind tunnel model) applications. There is a specialized but substantial commercial aerospace industry market for this large gap magnetic suspension system technology.

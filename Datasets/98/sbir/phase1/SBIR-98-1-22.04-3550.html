<BLOCKQUOTE>
Mainstream has developed an innovative cryocooler design that can provide compact, low-vibration cryocooling down to temperatures as low as 40 K. Phase I includes an optimization of this innovative design and an experimental demonstration. Phase I will provide experimental verification of the approach and experimentally-derived "Hard Numbers" to support the cooling capacity per unit mass claims of this proposal. The completion of the Phase II contract would result in the adaption of this demonstrated cryocooler method specifically for a NASA application. 
The Phase I effort is significant, in that a field demonstration of this low-temperature compact low-life-cycle-cost cryocooler will be achieved before proceeding to Phase II. It is also important to point out that 120-150 K has traditionally been the lowest temperature achieveable with vapor compression technology. However, Mainstream has already demonstrated that the combination of several innovative advances to the conventional vapor compressor system make 40 K an achievable low temperature limit (with this hybrid technology) and temperatures as low as 10 K may be attainable.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This proposal describes an innovative, compact, and relatively inexpensive cryocooling system that has tremendous commercial medical and industrial applications. Due to tremendous commercialization potential, Mainstream has already committed its own resources into performing the initial prototype experiments and has received a $500,000 Phase III commercialization committment.

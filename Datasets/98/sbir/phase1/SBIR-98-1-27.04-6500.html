<BLOCKQUOTE>
Optical Research Associates (ORA) intends to refine, extend, and automate Design-to-Cost Algorithms; this will facilitate early selection of design forms and constructional parameters for lower system cost without sacrificing quality. ORA's work in cost-modeling has evolved over thirty years, resulting in high performance, mainly defense related hardware, with known margins that really can save money (over 75% in both cost and weight in some deployable optics cases). We would utilize this information as a base, and modify and extend it in such a way as to develop deliverable, anchored, higher-level algorithms that will allow relatively painless/closely-coupled costs trades to be performed. Special attention would be paid to cost risks, wavelength implications, cryogenic active/adaptive optical systems, materials technology, testing, sensing and control, and new paradigms. Much of the raw data would remain ORA Proprietary, but the results/algorithms and selected anchor points would be provided for Government use. In future Phases we would further automate this process, extend it to deeper levels of system decomposition, and convert these algorithms to tools/module(s) which would eventually become available/leasable through ORA's de facto industry standard Code V® and/or LightTools® Optical/Optomechanical Engineering Software.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is a strong need to quantify cost implications early in nearly all optical systems. ORA is heavily involved in commercial work where the market is literally in the billion-dollar range. Here "market" size is meant in an OEM sense, and is dominantly optics based. Values can double when optomechanical hardware is included. Assuming 10% of these systems can benefit to the tune of 10%, the implication is that many millions of dollars could be saved if the methods proposed were readily available.

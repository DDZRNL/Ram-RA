<BLOCKQUOTE>
This research will result in an expert system that can be used by KSC engineers to facilitate insight responsibilities associated with current and future NASA-KSC projects.  System performance data will be analyzed and interpreted using appropriate statistical techniques.  When data indicate that the system is not stable and/or capable, advice will be offered by the expert system.  When additional data is required, the expert system will provide guidance, using engineer-specified criteria to determine the "best" experimental design.  Once data are collected and entered into the expert system, the appropriate statistical analysis will be completed and the results will be interpreted for the engineer.  The expert system will incorporate decision-maker preferences along with statistical methodologies to yield the most useful experimental results possible.  Aerospace vehicle designers could also use the expert system to implement experimental design, statistical analysis, and optimization requirements.  As part of the system, multivariate optimization could be performed, incorporating new mathematical algorithms that enable the engineer to simultaneously optimize several characteristics of the system.  The multivariate optimization methodologies include the use of decision-maker preferences to achieve the most preferred Pareto-optimal solution.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The proposed expert system will be customized for future civilian and government clients affiliated with aviation and aerospace.  Companies involved with depot maintenance, manufacturing, and aerospace/aviation vehicle design would be potential clients.  The functionality developed through this SBIR program will provide the framework for future modifications of the expert system.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
NASA SBIR Solicitation 98-1 emphasizes that “Advanced extravehicular activity (EVA) systems are necessary for the successful support of future human space missions.”  Topic 09.05 recognizes that development of advanced EVA systems depends on “methods for... analysis of human performance.” Thus, development of advanced Space suits requires methods for functional evaluation of the Space suit as an EVA system (i.e., including crewmember, tools and equipment, worksites and tasks).  Mobility and stability are key criteria that influence the functional efficacy of this system.  The result of Phase I will be a feasible plan for development of an innovative methodology that can be used to evaluate Space-suit mobility and stability in operationally-relevant EVA tasks using existing and planned NASA facilities.  The innovation that will be delivered at the end of Phase II will be comprised of (a) new methods that address human-in-the-loop detectability and stabilizability of Space-suit motion; (b) integration of new and existing methods in a cost-effective methodology for evaluating Space-suit mobility and stability; and (c) recommendations about use of the innovation by NASA personnel for ground-based evaluation and rapid prototyping of Space suits to support future EVA operations.

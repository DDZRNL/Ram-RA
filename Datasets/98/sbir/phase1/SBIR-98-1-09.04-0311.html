<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The recovery and reuse of wastewater produced by humans offers the greatest potential for reducing re-supply of water in the space life-support system. A number of physical/chemical/bio-regenerative processes have been considered to process humidity condensate, urine and wash water for reuse as potable water. Ozonation has been identified as an attractive method for waste water processing which can remove total organic carbon (TOC) and inorganic salts. However, ozonation has not been applied in space applications due to the high power consumption, volume, weight and maintenance associated with the present ozone generating equipment. This proposal presents a focused program to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel and highly innovative technique for generating ozone for space applications. The proposed approach uses a recently discovered phenomenon exhibited by ferroelectric oxide materials, namely the ability to emit large currents of electrons at low voltages. We propose to generate ozone using ferroelectric cathodes. The advantages of this method include low power consumption, compact configuration and low maintenance. The phase I research will involve a laboratory scale feasibility demonstration of ozone generation using ferroelectric-based electron emitters. The projected outcome is a compact, rugged and low power ozone generator for space applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Potential commercial applications of this innovative, highly efficient waste water recovery technology are wide spread in the areas of city and municipal water treatment plants, small home water treatment units and wastewater teatment systems. The ozone generator proposed in this proposal will also find applications in semiconductor etching systems, paint removal and various oxidation based chemical reactions. Furthermore, the ferroelectric cathodes are useful in high power devices, flat panel displays, lighting sources, and high energy accelerators.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Concern regarding debris is expressed in subtopic 19.05 regarding processes, mitigation, and survival of spacecraft in the orbital environment.  An important tool in understanding the debris hazard is modeling of the environment to characterize risk.  There are potential pitfalls to modeling: (1) separation, by choice of approach, of the model from reality, and (2) the obscuration of physical processes.  These problems have been addressed and published by Talent (1992) utilizing a phenomenological model of the debris environment in low-Earth-orbit (LEO).  The model, called the particle-in-a-box (PIB), examined the entire LEO environment as a whole and it confirmed the major results of several complex stochastic models.  In his paper, Talent described the mathematical procedure to extend PIB to the case of a multi-tier, multi-particle environment that will increase its predictive capability, yet retain the simplicity of the approach.  This proposal is intended to further investigate the debris environment and to deliver a useful tool to space-fairing interests.  The results will be directly applicable to mitigating on-orbit debris hazards to individual high-value assets or constellations of satellites, and is innovative in its simplicity and departure from the more traditional stochastic debris models.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>

The primary commercial applications from the PIB model results are in the areas of: (1) government planning and policy, and (2) the mitigation of debris risks to space assets - government or commercial.  Successful proposal funding will result in the production of a model having powerful predictive capability regarding the threat of orbital debris.  This model could be packaged in a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) operating under the PC/Windows environment.  Regarding government use, this will manifest itself as an aid in planning long duration space activities at any altitude -- improving knowledge of risk and translating directly into increased likelihood of mission success.  Private companies, deploying satellites, individually or as a constellation, for profit-making activities, especially need to be aware of the risk associated with investor capital.  Further, they need to be able to understand the liability dimension of their activities - risk to other LEO users.  Thus, the PIB modeling tool can support commercial success through environment awareness.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Planning is one of the most important activities in any domain, whether NASA mission planning, defense force deployment, logistics, mission-critical applications, or business enterprises.  New and innovative planning techniques have significantly improved state-of-the-art planning.  However, planners in complex, real world application domains are still required to perform a significant portion of the activities involved in validating plans, monitoring plan execution, detecting deviations and re-planning.  Significantly missing is an integrated framework to assist planners throughout the complete planning life cycle.  That is, an integrated framework would assist guiding users in deriving quality, workable plans taking into account all known constraints and knowledge of the environment.  This project proposes to develop an agent-based, mixed-initiative planning system supporting the complete life cycle of planning -- from conceptual design, to detailed design, execution, monitoring, deviation assessment, re-planning and re-execution.  The proposed planning system will assist the user by detecting problems and suggesting solutions regarding validity of plans developed, status of execution, and re-planning.  This effort will result in order of magnitude improvements in plan generation, execution, deviation assessment, and re-planning technologies.  The resulting planning system will be customizable and hence applicable across multiple application domains resulting in faster, less costly, and more reliable enterprise-wide planning and execution.

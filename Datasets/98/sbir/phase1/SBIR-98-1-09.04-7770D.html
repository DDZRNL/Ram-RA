<BLOCKQUOTE>
 	Ultrasonic separation of micro bubbles suspended in Life Support water streams is proposed.  This technology will allow the efficient separation of suspended gas bubbles in micro gravity without the need for large pressure drops required by membrane filters or the large amounts of electrical power required by centripetal separators.  An efficient, compact bubble separator that can be conveniently placed at any point in a liquid process is the desired aim of this work.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 	A significant commercial application for this technology is as flight hardware for use in a NASA Life Support system, such as aboard the planned Space Station or a Moon base.	Separation of gas bubbles from aqueous process streams is a requirement in many industrial, medical, and scientific applications.  Industrial applications include micro bubble separation from ultra pure water used for semiconductor rinse, and CO2 removal from biological process streams used in the biopharmaceutical industry.  Medical applications include the gas free generation of sterile water for injection.  Scientific applications include the removal of air bubbles from analytical streams prior to on-line spectrophotometric analysis.  These are only a few specific commercial applications.  In general, simple, efficient, non intrusive, cost effective separation of a gas from an aqueous stream represents a significant technological improvement over existing technologies.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This Phase I proposal is to develop a low cost, optical frequency shifter using micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology.  The proposed device will be tunable over a wide frequency range, consume minimal electrical power, and be packaged in a commercial integrated circuit package. By replacing conventional frequency modulators, the proposed device will reduce the size, weight and power consumption of the space-based interferometers that NASA is planning to launch in the future. In addition to frequency modulation, the device can be used modulate phase of a beam and as a fast optical shutter. The Phase I work will include analytical and modeling work to predict signal performance, in particular diffraction efficiency and switching time scales. The Phase I work will also include design and fabrication of a low speed prototype system and experimental work aimed at characterizing system performance in the laboratory.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The proposed device has commercial applications in many areas where optical frequency and phase shifting devices are currently used, including interferometers, laser vibrometers, laser velocimeters, and laser particle sizing instruments.  As an optical shutter, the device can be employed in optical communication networks and in laboratory optical systems.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project investigates a lightweight heat switch concept suitable for thermal control of microspacecraft and rovers. Novel materials and design are used for order-of-magnitude miniaturization compared with conventional thermomechanical and gas-gap heat switches.  The concept switch can operate passively at a preset temperature, or it can be actively operated using only milliwatts of power.  Higher power versions offer lightweight low-cost options for applications where louvers and variable-conductance heat pipes are used.
Phase 1 will fabricate and test heat switch elements and demonstrate the function of a complete heat switch suited for application to a Mars rover instrument or battery.  Performance data will be obtained for the heat load transmitted in the on and off states.  Preliminary cycling tests will be performed to assess stability.  The scaling of the design to higher and to lower thermal power will be drafted.  Phase 2 would further develop the switch for use in microsatellites and other spacecraft.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
      The proposed switch would have important applications in the thermal control of batteries and instruments for planetary orbiters, landers, and rovers. Applications also exist for communication and reconnaissance satellites where transient loads are encountered.  A possible spin-off of this technology is compact, low-power thermomechanical actuators that could have broad industrial applications.

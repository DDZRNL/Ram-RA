<BLOCKQUOTE>
 A lightweight, low power micro-cone penetrometer (MCPT) system is proposed to meet NASA’s need for better subsurface exploration devices.  The low cost MCPT will consist of characterization and sampling probes driven into the ground by low reaction force means.  Characterization probes will be instrumented with microsensors that provide a real-time, in situ view of the subsurface environment during delivery.  These probes will determine soil type, stratigraphy, water/ice content, and temperature.  They will also help identify the most interesting locations for sample collection where innovative MCPT sampling probes will extract minimally disturbed core samples from a meter or more below surface.  The Phase I program will establish feasibility and develop a prototype system design that minimizes power and weight while maximizing the use of available resources.  In Phase II, the prototype will be built, installed on a rover or lander, and tested.  Once developed, the MCPT will provide NASA with a highly integrated, versatile subsurface analysis and sampling system that can be deployed from mobile or stationary platforms in future missions to Mars, Europa and other celestial bodies.  In these missions, the multi-purpose MCPT will supply valuable data and samples to NASA scientists seeking to understand the origin and evolution of the universe.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The development of a MCPT system will open many new commercial markets to cone penetrometer technology.  In particular, the new technology will enable CPT to be used in applications that are cost-sensitive, hazardous to human health, remote, or physically restrictive.  Potential applications include: (1) rapid, cost-effective characterization of near-surface leaks from gasoline station tanks, pipelines, etc. (2)  safe, in situ characterization of hazardous waste stored in tanks and drums , (3) safe identification of landmines and other unexploded ordnance, (4) confirmation of mineral deposits in remote locations targeted by aerial sensors, (5) environmental sample collection in urban or other congested areas.

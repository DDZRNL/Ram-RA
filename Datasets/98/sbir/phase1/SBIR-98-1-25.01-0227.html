<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The objective of this project is to develop a new class of mm-wave collision avoidance and imaging sensors for robotic systems. The basis of these sensors is an integrated phased array antenna with ferrite control. The traveling-wave integrated phased array antenna has a low profile design and a simple beam control by changing the ferrite magnetization and frequency. For collision avoidance and imaging purposes, a sensor with a linear phased array antenna is proposed with beam scanning in one plane, and a sensor with a two plane beam scanning antenna to give additional angle resolution in the vertical plane. The working frequency will be ~80 GHz, the angle resolution 2.5°, and the distance resolution ~15 cm. The electrically scanning angle will be ~ 30° with a time period of 100 mks which will drastically decrease the time of 360° scanning. The proposed design of the mm-wave robotic sensors is very simple, inexpensive and will improve the safety and reliability of robotic systems.

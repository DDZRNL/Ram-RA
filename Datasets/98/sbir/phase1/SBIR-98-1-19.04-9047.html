<BLOCKQUOTE>
The proposed effort is the development of an overall material design simulation algorithm. The concept of the effort give the structural and material engineers a computer based simulation model indicating which processing variable must be controlled and what tolerances must be maintained to produce a material for optimal fatigue tolerance. The research will combine two major modeling elements. The first element is a material process numerical simulation algorithm that relates the processing variables to the to produced microstructure. The second element is a mesomechanical fatigue model that will relate the microstructural variables to the fatigue response. The proposed software is innovative for two reasons. First, the models will allow the structural engineer to systematically and quantitatively assess the influence of the material uncertainties on the overall reliability of the structure as oppose to current methods that assume simple empirical material characterization models. Second, the component fatigue models can be developed concurrently with material process design to identify the sources of uncertainty and assess the influence of material process variation on the reliability of the structure. Design-to-production time can be reduced because testing can be tailored to measure the most important source of uncertainty.  The structural and material engineers can concurrently design the component to minimize the scatter thus increasing the allowable life while reducing the life-cycle cost.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The commercial potential of the probabilistic material modeling tool for structural design and evaluation stems from the fact that it is an integrated package that links process models and failure models with a fatigue reliability technique and relevant variable statistical distribution databases. This allows a holistic design that combines material engineering with structural engineering which allows the design decision making process to be more rational, with minimal expense of time and effort. The ability of the proposed software package has an identifiable customer market base in those engineering firms currently employed in the structural design of mechanical components such as aerospace, automotive and consumer goods. Furthermore, the proposed effort can serve as the prototype of linking risk assessment techniques with other damage mechanism of interest such as environmental effects.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
CEO proposes to develop a low cost, high repetition rate, small, reliable and simple pulsed SLM laser oscillator of approximately 1 - 10 mJ/pulse of 1064 nm output at 100 - 1500 Hz.  Such units are not readily available today and this unit is the key to developing a high energy per pulse 1064, 532, 355 and/or 266 nm (and other Nd:YAG wavelengths) SLM laser. This unit would be a standard building block to be used when greater pulse energies are desired.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The laser described in this document will be of considerable interest to many military/government and industrial consumers.  On the military/government front, there are numerous tools, such as the Airborne Laser and various weather and non weather based lidar programs, that require a laser such as this that has high peak energy, high brightness, is very efficient and small/light-weight and low cost.  
In the industrial sector, a pulsed SLM laser would be quite useful for weather based applications, as an example.  It promises to be low in cost, thus enabling many consumers to afford it.  In the medical arena, there are applications for such system, and in this instance, compactness and high brightness are key features.   In addition, the proposed laser would have applications for photographic and holographic systems.

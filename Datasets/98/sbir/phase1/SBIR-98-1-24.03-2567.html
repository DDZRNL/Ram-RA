<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This proposal suggests development of an architecture for building content addressable distributed image databases (containing test, graphics, images, and digitized video). This architecture would create a means of describing and accessing entries from NASA’s databases which is more flexible and effective than currently available.  Our proposed system is innovative in the flexibility and extensibility allowed for image queries - including three dimensional shape, color, and texture.  Since substantial computation must be done to match image contents, much of the responsibility for the process must be delegated to the image archival engine (or actually engines, because balancing data stored with computational elements is very important in this application).  In Cybernet’s Phase I effort we will prototype a single node of the search engine and associated browser.  For the Phase II effort we will develop the full prototype product for NASA.

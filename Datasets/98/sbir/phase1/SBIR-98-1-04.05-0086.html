<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 NASA has unique data collection requirements to support ground-based testing of rocket engines. Not only is the rapid collection of data important, but the transmission of this information to processing facilities is critical. By combining new electrical interface standards with high speed fiber optic technology, generic transmission systems can be designed which would be capable of transferring data collection samples and video images at speeds approaching 1Gbps using existing fiber optic infrastructures. This system will allow NASA to better utilize digital sampling and encoding techniques, reducing their dependency on antiquated analog processing and transmission methodologies. This should improve their determination of rocket engine status in a more efficient manner.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The outcome of this project will result in transferable technology to the private sector regarding high speed (1 Gbps and beyond) systems for both data acquisition and high definition video channels transmitted over fiber optic cables. Units can be produced for interface into existing hardware through a common electrical standard.

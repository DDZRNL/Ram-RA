<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Electrodynamic conductive tethers combined with electrical power sources have the potential to provide propellant-less reboost or deorbit forces to spacecraft in low Earth orbit.  Tether performance is limited by heating, which decreases strength and increases resistivity, lowering electrodynamic efficiency.  Electrodynamic tethers in space are heated both ohmically and by absorption of radiation from the Sun and Earth, while radiation is the only cooling mechanism.  To minimize tether temperature it is desirable to minimize the absorptivity/emissivity ratio, i.e. to reflect insolation and earthshine while radiating efficiently at low temperature.  Ion Optics proposes to accomplish this with ion-beam texturing, a blackening process which increases emissivity by carving micron-sized features into the wire surface.  Size and spacing of the features can be controlled to provide a relatively sharp transition from shiny at short wavelengths to black at long wavelengths.  Tailoring their surfaces to increase long wavelength emissivity from less than 0.1 to greater than 0.9 would allow aluminum tethers to handle three times the power at the same operating temperature and mass.  The resulting lighter, more efficient tethers mean dramatic cost savings for NASA’s International Space Station reboost and space debris reduction programs.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Textured surfaces already have commercial applications; they play a key role in Ion Optics' line of  pulsIR infrared sources, extensively used in gas sensing instruments.  Texturing has also been suggested as a means to a new class of infrared detectors, to improved electrolytic battery electrodes and better pacemaker tips, prosthetic devices treated for more rapid ingrowth, passive thermal control materials for commercial spacecraft, and perhaps ultimately to miniature gas detection systems built entirely on a silicon chip.  The major potential commercial space application is textured tethers for the Terminator Tether spacecraft deorbit systems of Tethers Unlimited, Inc., a Phase I partner on this proposal.

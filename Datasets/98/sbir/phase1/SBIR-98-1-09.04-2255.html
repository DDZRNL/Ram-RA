<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We propose the application of sublimation purification technology (SPT) to the recovery of water from concentrated brines which are developed from reverse osmosis and ion exchange eluents.  SPT is a 
physical process and does not involve the consumption of any resources except energy.  SPT recovers
the maximum possible water because it reduces the concentrate to dry material while producing 
water of very high purity. Since the concentrates are separated from the solid (frozen) phase, many 
of the complications associated with liquid phase separation processes are eliminated. SPT may have 
other space flight applications.  Nearly 100% of the water present in the concentrated brine will be recovered and the residual salts delivered as a dry solid. In the proposed work SPT performance data 
will obtained from simulated brine solutions, the feasibility of applying SPT to the space flight 
environment (including a system and specification) will be evaluated and space flight specific 
subsystem components will be tested.  We propose the construction and testing of a prototype 
SPT system, based on the tested design developed in Phase I, capable of processing 24 lb (~11 kg) 
of brine solution per day in Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
SPT has been developed for extreme terrestrial applications including the purification of watersfrom evaporator bottoms bearing plutonium and uranium salts.  Vortec has recently applied SPT
to the production of pico-pure water and solvents for use in proprietary industrial applications. 
Applications to the space environment presents certain problems which are fundamental in nature 
to those encountered during the production of pico-pure liquids.  Resolution of those problems 
will allow water recovery recycle and reuse systems for long duration space to operate more 
efficiently with greater potable water yield, and will allow SPT to be more cost effectively applied
to terrestrial purification problems.  Progress made under the proposed work will further develop 
SPT so to efficiently and inexpensively produce water having <1 part per trillion total 
dissolved and suspended solids.  Successful completion of the Tasks disclosed in the present 
SBIR proposal will enable this technology to compete for a share in a market currently valued at 
nearly 500 M / yr.  It will also allow for the production of the next generation of high purity
liquids currently sought in proprietary manufacturing processes.

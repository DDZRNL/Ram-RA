<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Creare proposes an innovative small cryogenic cooler for future space missions, emphasizing high reliability, low cost, and very light weight.  The cooler employs a pulse tube cold head and a thermo-compressor, eliminating the weight, expense, and reliability burden of the compressor drive motor and the power electronics.  In Phase I, we will experimentally demonstrate auto-resonant operation of a thermo-compressor displacer and design an engineering model cryocooler system.  The key outcome of this effort will be confirmation that the Phase II cooler can operate successfully with minimal electronics. In Phase II, we will fabricate a complete cryocooler system, perform laboratory testing, and document performance characteristics.

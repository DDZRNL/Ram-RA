<BLOCKQUOTE>
Teleradiographic imaging applications pose a significant engineering challenge in terms of portability, resolution, and minimal operating power. A novel approach to high spatial resolution X-ray imaging is proposed here that will allow portability while maintaining low power consumption as compared with similar imaging devices. An optically coupled CMOS image sensor mosaic combined with a phosphor conversion screen will be used to effectively capture large field digital X-ray images. This innovative technique will achieve considerably lower power consumption than conventional CCD mosaic hardware along with a more compact, integrated design. Innovations in mosaic image reconstruction and parallel modular mosaic imaging hardware have been described by Sensor Plus in several publications for a digital mammography imager that uses CCD devices. To make a mosaic imager feasible, two image processing algorithms are required: distortion correction and stitching. An approach employing a custom-designed calibration screen will be applied for distortion correction and stitching. By employing a custom-designed calibration pattern, it will guarantee robust, accurate correction and stitching. Further application of these innovations for the development of a portable teleoperable medical x-ray imager is the primary objective of this proposal. Additional design issues will include hardware solutions for network connectivity and remote acquisition.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Portable teleradiology once developed for production may be marketable both nationally and internationally. Primary markets include onsite radiography for long and short term space missions, domestic mobile medical facilities, military missions, and low cost radiography for economically developing areas or nations.Low cost construction is realized through the use of CMOS image detectors. The approximate cost of the 1000x800 pixel detector selected for this proposal is in the range of 75-100 dollars. The cost of the lenses are comparable to the image sensors so that the total cost of the detector array portion of the imager is approximately 8,000-11,000 dollars. Therefore, it becomes feasible to build a teleoperated, full size, X-ray imager below 20,000 dollars. This is very promising where low cost is a key factor in the potential markets described above.

6.Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
Accurate Automation and Old Dominion University propose to develop a weakly 
ionized gas shock wave modification system for an advanced rocket or reusable 
launch vehicle. We will develop a theoretical model for the WIG shock wave 
modification technology, initiate an experimental program to support the ongoing 
theoretical work, evaluate the engineering feasibility of employing the 
technology on an operational rocket or reusable launch vehicle, and perform a 
conceptual design for a wind tunnel test article.

This Phase I program will lay the foundations for a Phase II program in which 
the WIG shock wave modification technology will be demonstrated in a wind tunnel 
and a detailed engineering feasibility study for an operational vehicle will be 
performed.

7.Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
In the near term we anticipate that the Phase III customers for the proposed 
program will be NASA, DoD, and/or their prime contractors, while 
commercialization of the technology in the civil aviation industry may result 
from the success of the NASA and DoD Phase III programs. Specific programs that 
we have targeted include:
* NASA's advanced rocket and reusable launch vehicle programs
* Navy's hypersonic weapons programs
* NASA's hypersonic research aircraft programs
* The JSF and other DoD subsonic and supersonic aircraft programs
* The Air Force's Fixed Wing Vehicle Program
* Advanced civil aircraft programs

7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
It is recognized that nuclear fusion is the only known source that can provide 
the prodigious amounts of power required for deep space missions. This is due to 
both the large and available quantities of fuel. Of all fusion reactor 
embodiments, only the magnetically confined plasma in the Field Reversed 
Configuration (FRC) has the ideal linear geometry, the low confining field and 
high plasma pressure required for the direct conversion of fusion energy into 
high specific impulse and thrust. The FRC has demonstrated in experiments the 
scaling with size and density required for fusion ignition. Due to the high 
plasma pressure and compactness of the magnetic configuration, there has been no 
easy way to extrapolate the FRC into the reactor regime. Based on experiment, a 
simple way has been determined by which the FRC can be readily brought to 
ignition conditions. This state is achieved by employing an Inductive, 
Magnetized Plasma Accelerator (IMPAC). It is the intention of MSNW to design 
(Phase I), and construct (Phase II) the prototype IMPAC source. The source 
alone, when externally powered, could produce the thrust and Isp necessary for a 
fast Mars mission in a device smaller than a desk.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
A successful outcome of the IMPAC based fusion rocket would of course, at the 
very least, allow man to explore and colonize the planets, and possibly extend 
man's reach to other worlds beyond our solar system. Certainly NASA would be a 
customer, as no doubt any other organization, governmental or not, that value 
this same vision for mankind. In the short term, the IMPAC source would provide 
a small, extremely efficient, propulsion device at very low cost, and 
development time. The IMPAC source would provide more than enough Isp and thrust 
to accomplish rapid space travel to nearby planets, and would make possible the 
commercial use of space beyond the earth. Perhaps though, the major spin-off of 
this power source, a terrestrially based fusion reactor, would have the most 
significant commercial application. The customer in this case would essentially 
be the entire world, as fusion represents the only long term, non-polluting, 
energy source that could supply the earth's energy needs.

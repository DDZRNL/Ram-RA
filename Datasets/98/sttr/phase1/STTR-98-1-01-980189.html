7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
We propose to produce a compact stabilized tunable diode laser system emitting 
630.5 nm light with frequency drift reduced to less than one part per billion 
over periods longer than 10 hours. A novel atomic-reference-free stabilization 
scheme developed by Dr. John Hall adapted for external cavity diode lasers 
engineered at Focused Research will provide absolute frequency calibration. 
Uniquely, this system will stabilize any wavelength selected within the laser's 
tuning range, enabling new scientific and industrial applications. The method is 
applicable to existing visible and infrared wavelengths and we can satisfy 
NASA's needs for ultrastable lasers at shorter wavelengths as new laser diodes 
become available.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
Commercial opportunities for economical, robust, and tunable wavelength-
stabilized lasers include industry applications such as telecommunications test 
equipment, high-resolution interferometry, and micropositioning, surface defect 
inspection, and low-power LIDAR (laser radar). The proposed system would be 
especially well suited to a variety of spectroscopic applications in the 
scientific and engineering communities as well. Dr. Hall is renowned for 
pioneering high-performance laser frequency locking techniques. Focused Research 
and its parent company, New Focus, is a technology leader in tunable external 
cavity diode lasers ideally suited to frequency locking. Combining our expertise 
in laser design and stabilization methods, we will achieve the low cost and high 
performance necessary for the industrial stabilized laser market.

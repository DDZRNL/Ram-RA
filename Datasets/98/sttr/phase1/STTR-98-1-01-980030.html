7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
Design and construct a space capable laser transmitter with 100 mJ/pulse, 3-30 
ns pulse width, 40 to 100 Hz repetition rate, with 3 pm resolution and >5% 
overall efficiency.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
The laser will be of considerable interest to many military and industrial 
consumers. On the military front, there are numerous tools, such as the Airborne 
Laser and various lidar programs, that require a laser such as this that has 
high energy, high brightness, very efficient and small/light-weight. In the 
industrial sector, a 100 Hz laser is not in as much demand. However, the lessons 
learned in this effort are directly applicable to the classical industrial laser 
system. In the medical arena, there are applications for a 100 Hz system, and in 
this instance, compactness, high brightness are key features. In addition, the 
lessons learned in this effort should be, at least in part, transferable to very 
common medical and industrial laser systems which are usually CW pumped.

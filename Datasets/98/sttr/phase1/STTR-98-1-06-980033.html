7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
Development of affordable, high performance nuclear engines enable a quantum 
leap in the capability to carry out exploration and commercialization of the 
solar system, particularly with regard to the more distant planets and moons. 
Utilization of nuclear engines will result in much shorter trip times and much 
smaller and cheaper launch vehicles that contribute to dramatic reductions in 
mission costs. A new ultra-compact nuclear engine concept, MITEE (MIniature 
reacTor EnginE), is described, and its performance evaluated for various solar 
system exploration missions. The MITEE concept will serve as a temporary bridge 
to the development of very advanced and much higher Isp rockets based on nuclear 
fusion/antimatter which will be required for the exploration and colonization of 
the solar system. The company plans to apply and extend the knowledge gained 
from the MITEE project to the systems research and development of 
fusion/antimatter engines. Representative design parameters for the baseline 
MITEE reactor are: 75 MW(th) power level, 1000 seconds Isp, 100 kg mass, 10 
MW/Liter fuel element power density, 39 cm core diameter/height. Total engine 
mass, including turbopump, nozzles, controls, and contingency is estimated to be 
200 kg. Using the MITEE engine, ultra-fast, lightweight solar system exploration 
missions are enabled.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
Satellite and telecommunications manufacturers would have a vested interest in 
derivative applications of the MITEE engine. Compact heat engines based on this 
technology would provide electric power in the kilo and megawatt range for 
satellite operations. Major aerospace companies can benefit from space satellite 
retrieval/orbit changes from orbital transfer/maneuvering vehicles based on 
bimodal engine configurations which entail both propulsion and power producing 
capabilities. In addition, small powerplants can be constructed to provide 
energy for usage in remote and isolated outposts both on Earth and other 
celestial bodies. Energy conversion techniques can include static applications 
as a replacement for radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG), or dynamic 
applications as seen in heat engines utilizing the Brayton or Rankine cycles. In 
a novel concept, low cost, robust outposts can be established with indigenous 
resources processed to manufacture breathable air, food and stockpile 
propellants, fuel, and construction materials. Space mining can be made cost-
effective with other MITEE technology derivatives even with the use
of today's existing launchers. Another application of this technology centers on 
designing nuclear engines that enable low-cost distant intercept missions 
against Near Earth Object impactors that the Earth with catastrophic collisions.

7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
Our program is based on these premises: (1) Candidate processes for production 
of individual products on Mars and the Moon, e.g., oxygen for life support and 
propulsion, silane for manufacture of silicon chips for solar-electric power 
generation and propulsion, and ceramics/metals for structures, helium 3 for 
electric power generation (fusion), hydrogen for propulsion, and water for life 
support, share common processes; (2) silicon and silicon carbide based 
microchannel and MEMS (Micro-Electro Mechanical Systems) technology can produce 
highly efficient components to conduct critical ISRU processes such as 
electrolysis of water to form hydrogen and oxygen and the reduction of carbon 
oxides to form useful products, such as propellants, structural materials, and 
foodstuffs; and (3) near term ISRU demonstration experiments will greatly 
benefit from ultra-lightweight, compact, integrated chemical processing systems 
which can be produced using microchannel technology. Specific Phase I program 
objectives are to design and fabricate silicon microchannel components and to 
perform bench scale demonstration of ISRU processes important for use on Mars 
and the Moon.  Phase II will develop an engineering prototype system integrating 
components for quotend-to-end" production of valuable products, such as 
propellant, for sample return and manned Mars missions.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
MEMS and microchannel technology is an emerging field with applications in most 
industrial processes due to excellent mixing, controlled reaction environment, 
and energy efficiency. This technology offers improvements in existing processes 
and will enable new processes to become cost effective.  Of particular interest 
is the petrochemical industry for which products from conversion of carbon 
oxides to stable, useful compounds such as methane and ethylene is of major 
importance.

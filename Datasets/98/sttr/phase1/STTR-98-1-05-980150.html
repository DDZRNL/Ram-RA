7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
The objective of this work is to design new signal processing algorithms for a 
&quotsmart" eddy current array sensor system that will enable gas turbine blade 
diagnostics and high cycle fatigue prognosis. The approach uses fast, adaptive 
wavelet transforms for spatio-temporal mechanical signature analysis to extract 
diagnostic information from measured signal patterns in real time. The 
methodology combines computational modeling of the sensor waveform based on 
physical principles of the sensor operation and data-driven analysis of blade 
model vibration and stress mode shapes.

Preliminary experimental tests show that the sensor and wavelet analysis can 
detect variations in blade configuration, and can indicate the on-set of engine 
stall. The work will contribute to the implementation of new on-line high 
performance health monitoring for turbine engines. It will leverage ongoing 
development of eddy current sensors with high performance, efficient 
computational algorithms that support the deployment of sensor arrays. The 
formulation is general and can be adapted to other types of sensors and other 
diagnostic and prognostic health monitoring applications.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
The application potential for an on-board blade health monitoring is tremendous. 
This work will lead to new sensor technologies and signal processing algorithms 
for diagnostics and prognostics for high-performance turbine engine systems. It 
will contribute to new methods of health monitoring for these critical 
components. The director of Prognostics and Health Management for the Joint 
Strike Fighter at Pratt & Whitney has already indicated his interest in our 
preliminary findings. The signal processing technology will be marketed jointly 
with GD/ATS to prime contractors and engine manufacturers.

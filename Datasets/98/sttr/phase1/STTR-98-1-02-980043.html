7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI), in collaboration with the Y-Division (Laser 
Division) of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), proposes to develop 
space-qualified optical components that are building blocks of the Optical 
Waveguide (OW) solar plant lighting system. In the OW system, solar radiation is 
collected by the concentrator which transfers the concentrated solar radiation 
to the OW transmission line consisting of low-loss optical fibers. The OW line 
transmits the plant lighting spectra (< 700 nm) to the plant growth chamber 
where the solar radiation from the optical fibers is de-focused for optimum 
intensity for plant growing. The non-plant growing spectra (> 700 nm) is 
utilized for generating electric power which will provide plant lighting when 
solar radiation is not available. PSI has been developing the OW technology in 
the past few years. Technologies resident at LLNL that are pertinent to the 
proposed research program include: optics and material technologies for laser 
power transmission; large diameter optical fiber technologies for continuous 
wave (CW) power transmission; thermal effects on materials and structure; vacuum 
technology; and space environment effects. The two technologies resident
at LLNL and PSI can be effectively combined for development of the space-
qualified optical components for solar plant lighting system.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
The Optical Waveguide (OW) solar plant lighting technology is well adapted for 
growing plants in a remote location or in an enclosed chamber using solar 
irradiance. The proposed program aims at developing space-qualified optical 
components for utilization of solar energy in space. In any commercial 
application areas, whether energy, telecommunication, transportation, or 
agriculture, innovative concept must be substantiated by enabling component 
technologies. The space-qualified optical components for solar plant lighting, 
when developed to technical maturity, will find applications beyond the plant 
lighting. They will enable more complete utilization of solar energy not only in 
space but also in many terrestrial applications. Commercial applications of the 
solar plant lighting system include the use of the system for energy-efficient 
crop growing in the polar region, with the state of Alaska as a case in point. 
The government of Alaska is very interested in employing technologies that are 
designed to harness natural sunlight for growing plants in closed environments. 
Another important application of the technology is for indoor lighting in highly 
crowded cities wherein numerous buildings do not receive any solar irradiance.

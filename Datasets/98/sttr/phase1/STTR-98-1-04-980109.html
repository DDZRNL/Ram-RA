7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
ETREMA Products, Inc. and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) will 
develop and commercialize new smart material and device products for use in 
advanced spacecraft and aircraft in order to reduce production and operating 
costs. Work done at UCLA in the development of magnetostrictive composite 
materials using epoxies will be extended and transferred to industry. The 
production of these new smart materials will enable low cost devices that 
surpass the limitations of current composite material technologies based on 
epoxies or typical polyimides, including limited service temperature, low 
fracture toughness, material instability and hydrolysis. The advanced 
magnetostrictive composite materials and devices are enabled by combining two 
novel material classes: advanced resin systems and magnetostrictive smart 
materials. These advanced composite materials will provide a high performance 
smart material with structural capabilities, excellent durability and high 
temperature capability, while overcoming the electrical connectivity problems 
associated with piezoceramic composites. With the commercialization of TERFENOL-
D alloys, and devices and systems based thereon, ETREMA has proven it is 
successful in materials technology transfer. It can be equally successful in the 
development of low-cost production methods and products based on improved smart 
materials and transducers (actuators, sensors, etc.).

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
The list of potential products (including those requiring cryogenic 
performance), which will be made possible by this material development, can be 
broken down into several categories which include: actuators of all types, 
pumps, valves, active flow control systems, vibration dampers, structural health 
monitoring systems, scanner motors, MEMS, thin films, sensors, etc. By taking 
advantage of the broad thermal capabilities of the novel constituent materials, 
these products can be designed for use in temperatures ranging from cryogenics 
(such as NASA's NGST satellite) to over 200øC. Actuators will find use in mirror 
and other optics positioning, deployment of structures, powering remote vehicle 
manipulators, locking and latching mechanisms for docking, and other very low 
frequency applications, or applications which require a position and hold 
capability with high stiffness. Medium frequency applications will include 
pumps, valves, and both active and passive structural vibration dampers. High 
frequency applications could include such things as instrument scanner motors 
and even the possibility of generating ultrasonic acoustic streaming for moving 
liquids without pressure buildup and heating.

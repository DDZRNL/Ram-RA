7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
Magnetic bearings represent an important candidate technology for aerospace 
applications. They offer improved efficiency (through complete elimination of 
friction) and reliability (from reduced wear) over conventional bearings. 
Commercial development, however, has been impeded largely by cost 
considerations, chiefly those accruing to rotor displacement sensors. Self-
sensing technology, wherein rotor displacement is inferred through the 
information content of the amplifier current signals, is now a widely accepted 
paradigm that allows rotor position sensors to be eliminated. In past SBIR work 
for NASA, Barron Associates, Inc. developed a polynomial neural network self-
sensing solution that covers the magnetic non- saturation and saturation 
regimes, the latter where the relationship between rotor displacement and 
bearing currents is highly nonlinear. The proposed Phase I STTR research will 
focus on extending this neural network approach to dynamic scenarios, in which 
rotor position and actuation currents are time-varying. Dynamic scenarios are 
important for practical usage of the technique. The Phase II sequel will bring 
this technology to fruition in the form of a laboratory spinning rig 
demonstration of the self-sensing technology operating in the saturation regime.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
Commercial applications of magnetic bearings include a host of aeronautic and 
niche industrial applications, such as aircraft engine and power systems, 
rotating machinery, flywheels, kinetic compressors, and heart pumps. Self-
sensing will play a decisive role in making magnetic bearing technology cost 
effective and sufficiently reliable. Embedded polynomial neural network 
algorithms for self-sensing in integrated power units (IPUs) for aircraft power 
systems and in high-speed pumps for the petrochemical industry are the two 
commercial applications on which the STTR work will focus in collaboration with 
Sundstrand Aerospace, the Barron Associates, Inc. commercialization sponsor.

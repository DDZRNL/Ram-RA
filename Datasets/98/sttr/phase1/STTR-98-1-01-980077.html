7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
Avyd Devices, Inc. and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute propose an approach 
which combines the advantages of the capability to grow high crystalline quality 
epitaxial layers of GaN and GaAlN via the metalorganic chemical vapor deposition 
(MOCVD) technique with a p type doping approach which could result in much 
higher conductivity p type GaN and GaAlN layers and hence much improved p type 
contact resistance and quantum efficiency along with a much sharper UV spectral 
response facilitating efficient rejection of the longer wavelength radiation.

Phase I emphasis will be focused on demonstrating the feasibility to develop a 
nitride based p-i-n UV detector technology capable of providing detectors with 
high responsivity, low noise and high speed. In phase I we plan to demonstrate 
and deliver to NASA single element and linear arrays of p-i-n photodetectors of 
GaN . In phase II, we plan to demonstrate and deliver 256x256 imaging arrays of 
these devices.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
environmental monitoring, automobile engine combustion sensing, remote sensing 
of earth resources, solar astronomy, burner monitoring in gas turbines etc.

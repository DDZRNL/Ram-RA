7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
Advanced catalysts with high efficiency and improved physical properties are 
projected as valuable tools for both spacecraft life support systems and 
industrial processes. It is well documented that reductions in expendable 
resources are required for cost-effective presence of man in space. Catalytic 
oxidation to remove contaminants in air and water is a key unit operation 
available to achieve this. These processes use fixed bed reactors consisting of 
supported noble metal catalysts. The two most widely used supports are alumina 
and activated carbon. According to extensive research by both NASA and industry, 
an order of magnitude more efficiency is obtained by using carbon versus 
alumina. Carbon-supported catalysts are susceptible to long-term physical 
degradation (due to shear forces and metal leaching) and chemical degradation 
(by oxidation of solid carbon to CO2) under reactor conditions. Materials with 
markedly improved physical stability, increased temperature range, and high 
catalytic activity are proposed. Phase I will investigate treatments to improve 
the operating temperature range and adherence of the catalytic metal to the 
carbon surface. Screening tests will be performed to assess suitability of new 
materials for both space and industrial process conditions. Phase II will 
consist of full development and long-term testing resulting in materials for 
dual-use.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
This technology, if successfully developed, has been identified by a major 
industrial catalyst company as having potential for immediate product sales of 
6,000-20,000 lbs catalyst/month (with product sales over 1.5 million 
dollars/month) for &quotclean" chemical processing and environmental technology. 
An additional five industrial processes, each with product sales over 100 
million dollars/year have been documented that would also be likely markets for 
the proposed product. All of these projections are documented.

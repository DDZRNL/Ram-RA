7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
A thermal method for directly applying LaRC-IA polyimide as a high-quality 
spray-foam as an insulation onto a substrate, such as fuel or cryogenic liquid 
tanks, will be developed and demonstrated. The proposed technology will lower 
the costs of using polyimide foams by providing a method of applying specialty, 
advanced lightweight, polyimide foams to directly onto complex shapes and 
structures. The project shall include the spraying of NASA's newly invented 
LaRC-IA polyimide shapes to form an adherent, mechanically-sound, insulating 
foam. The resulting advanced polyimide foams will be lighter and can be used for 
higher temperature applications than existing polymer sprayable foams.

The novel thermal spray method will convey, heat and deposit the advanced LaRC-
IA polyimide materials onto substrates. A key aspect of the Phase I work 
includes the development of polyimide bonding methods that are compatible with 
the novel thermal spray technology. Phase I will establish feasibility of the 
process and be used to evaluate three different polyimide material bonding 
methods. Phase II work will demonstrate the operation and control of a prototype 
process suitable for spraying polyimide foams onto a functioning substrate, such 
as a fuel or cryogenic liquid tank.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
The proposed project will promote the use of newly developed polyimide materials 
as high-temperature insulation on NASA, military and commerical spacecraft, such 
as the space shuttle, the X-33 and future Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLV). 
Applications for quothigh-performance" foams, such as the polyimide foams 
proposed herein, particularly sprayable foams, currently exist in aerospace, 
marine, aircraft, automotive, recreational and electronics markets.

7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
The proposed project will address two important issues in power quality and 
power density in non-linear AC/DC power systems. A new power switching technique 
known as soft-switching will be used to design high-power density systems with 
improved efficiency while achieving near unity power factor.  Unlike the 
traditional passive approach, the newly developed technology by the University 
of Central Florida will result in total elimination of line current distortion, 
resulting in near unity power factor (PF) and low Total Harmonic Distortion 
(THD). This new soft-switching technique will result in more than 30% reduction 
in the size of the switching power supplies currently installed at KSC 
facilities. Different AC/DC power factor topologies will be compared with 
respect to their efficiency, and power density (size and weight). Also, the 
application of the new PFC topologies in the design of Distributed Power Systems 
(DPS) along with their cost and control complexity will be investigated.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
Users of computer systems and other control systems that use AC/DC power 
supplies stand to gain the most due to energy cost and system performance. Other 
potential applications include vehicle technology, space communication systems, 
phased-radar arrays and satellites. Furthermore, the proposed DPS control scheme 
is an essential system for the design of high performance, high power density 
systems used extensively in commercial and military applications.

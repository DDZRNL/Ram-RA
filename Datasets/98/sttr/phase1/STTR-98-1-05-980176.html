7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
Makel Engineering, Inc. (MEI) and Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) propose 
to develop a compact, rugged, low cost, quantitative sensor for measurement of 
multiple species in the exhaust of turbine driven aircraft. The multi-species 
exhaust sensor (MSES) will provide quantitative measurement of NOx, O2, CO and 
hydrocarbons in air breathing propulsion exhaust. The system is based on the use 
of high temperature, thin film sensors, using silicon and silicon carbide 
manufacturing processes developed at CWRU. These sensors are combined with 
compact, micro-electronic control circuits. This system will provide real-time
data suitable for engine emissions control. The sensor system will be suitable 
for harsh flight conditions. The gas specific sensor elements will be integrated 
into a miniature sensor head which will be suitable for integration into a 
vehicle control system. The proposed sensor system will provide: (1) real-time 
quantitative measurement of key exhaust species, (2) lightweight, robust module, 
(3) digital communications immune to EMI and RFI, and (4) built-in-test (BIT) 
and health monitoring capability. Phase I will focus on the integration of NOx 
and O2 sensors and Phase II will expand the capability for CO and hydrocarbon 
detection.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
The proposed MEEMS is directly applicable to commercial aircraft, diesel engine, 
and gas turbine industries. Significant rapid commercialization of this system 
is expected because of (1) the growing importance of NOx measurements and 
control on mobile and stationary power sources, (2) the potential of the 
technology to produce a low cost device, and (3) flexibility of the system 
design to use interchangeable sensors for different gases.

7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
Foster-Miller and Cornell University propose to develop very small, low cost 
sensors for use in aircraft gas turbine engines at temperatures up to 600 oC 
using microfabrication of silicon nitride based mechanical devices. The results 
of Phase I will show the feasibility of a high temperature vibration sensor, 
including building and testing prototype sensors at temperatures from room 
temperature to 600oC. The data should verify that the new sensors will be useful 
for sensing and control systems on gas turbine test cells and in service 
applications for engine health monitoring and autonomous control. Phase II will 
involve placement of sensors in operating gas turbines, and will show 
feasibility sensors based on optical fiber interconnection.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
There is an urgent need for the sensors and control systems in commercial 
aircraft gas turbines, and in other turbine applications for shipboard power and 
electric power generation. The annual worldwide market for such sensors and 
control systems is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The 
high temperature microfabricated sensors will also find uses in automotive and 
truck engines, and for heavy industries including steel, chemicals, and other 
raw material processing.

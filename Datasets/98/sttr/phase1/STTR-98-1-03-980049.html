7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
In the present computer market, premium is placed upon computational performance 
measures, not on the quality of input current waveform, leading to power factor 
and power quality problems at computing facilities with no off-the-shelf 
remedies currently available. Montana State University - Bozeman has developed 
power conversion technology employing Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) for 
instanteous control of ac power flow. In the proposed project, PWM ac-ac power 
conversion technology will be applied to solve power quality problems posed by 
loads such as data processing and computing equipment. A Unity Power Factor 
(UPF) interface device, which shapes the supply line current to be sinusoidal, 
will be developed. The UPF will have an input that connects to the utility 
outlet and an ouput that supplies power to the computing equipment. The user can 
plug the UPF interface into a standard wall outlet and plug nonlinear loads such 
as computers into its outlet. The objective for Phase I of the proposed project 
is to study the feasibility of the proposed UPF approach for computing 
equipment. A computer simulation of the proposed UPF interface will be developed 
and a laboratory breadboard prototype of the interface will be developed to 
verify the results of the simulations.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
The proposed research can have a definite commercial impact with respect to 
several potential commercial markets such as: (1) a replacement for all switch 
mode power supplies, (2) as an input power accessory where substantial numbers 
of PC computer devices are operated, and (3) as an accessory to the ballast 
component where large numbers of flouresent lighting fixtures are used. A 
particular advantage that successful UPF development can offer over present 
practices is in buildings and facilities where large numbers of switching mode 
power supplies are utilized. This is due to the fact that the original wiring 
and electrical equipment ratings were often established assuming power factors 
based upon the phase angle and not the actual power factor determined by the 
switching function. The actual power factor results in electrical currents in 
excess of the angle based determination.

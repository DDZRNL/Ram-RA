7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
Small &quotLightcraft" thrusters have recently been propelled from ground level 
to 30-m altitude on laser power beamed from a terrestrial source. Such 
technology represents a clean and potentially low-cost access to space for small 
payloads. This STTR project further develops the materials technology in a 
collaboration between Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), the Research 
Organization that originated the Lightcraft propulsion concept, and Energy 
Science Laboratories, Inc. (ESLI) a Small Business developing lightweight 
refractory rocket materials and structures. Phase 1 will design, fabricate and 
test small-scale air-breathing thrusters made with novel high-temperature 
lightweight materials. The design is based on experimental aluminum lightcraft 
developed at RPI. Lightweight refractory components will be fabricated using 
novel carbon and silicon carbide materials under development at ESLI. A series 
of small-scale thrusters will be fabricated for use at 10-kW beam power. Flight 
testing will be used to investigate the effectiveness of materials and design 
innovations. Phase 2 would further develop materials and structures for laser-
assisted propulsion thruster prototypes to achieve higher altitude flight. 
Preliminary materials design for a 100-kg payload Lightcraft will be drafted for 
use with higher power lasers.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
Successful Lightcraft may be used to deliver small payloads to space. The novel 
materials and structures have potential application where light weight, 
stiffness, and high temperature capability is required, including rockets, laser 
mirrors, turbine housings and cooled composite structures.

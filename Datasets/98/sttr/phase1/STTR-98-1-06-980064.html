7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
Antiprotons offer the largest specific energy of any material known to mankind, 
making them extremely attractive as a space propulsion fuel. Several concepts 
have been proposed over the past decade. An attractive option uses the 
antiprotons to create a dense hot plasma which, when exhausted from the 
confining vessel, provides direct thrust. Another option uses the plasma to 
trigger nuclear microfusion reactions providing the requisite specific impulse 
and thrust for interplanetary, and even interstellar, missions. Recent progress 
by G.A. Smith at Penn State University toward the creation of a portable 
antiproton trap and a recently funded project at MSFC to develop the next 
generation trap with substantially greater capacity (10^12 antiprotons), now 
make it possible to design an Antimatter Plasma Gun (APG) derived around the 
Penning Trap principles. We foresee designing and eventually building a device 
which can provide a bright, small-emittance ion beam with several eV to KeV 
energy. This device would enable the aforementioned space propulsion 
applications to be investigated in a laboratory setting as well as revolutionize 
many other applications of plasmas which currently depend on large, expensive, 
and hazardous sources.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
The potential for commercial applications of the Antimatter Plasma Gun (APG) is 
great because the APG would provide a compact and inexpensive alternative to the 
large and expensive sources of dense, hot plasma that exist today. The potential 
applications include: advanced space propulsion, fusion energy research, plasma 
surface coating technology, high-power plasma switches, gas discharge lasers, 
isotope separation, research into magnetohydrodyamic principles for electric 
power plants and portable power supplies, pollution control and reduction, and 
materials processing.

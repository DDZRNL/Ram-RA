7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
A magnetic bearing test fixture is an ideal candidate for NASA's current and 
future requirements for thrust measurement. Magnetic bearings (MB) are a proven 
technology in large commercial applications such as centrifugal compressors and 
turbo-expanders and they are being utilized as load cells in laboratory 
environments. The major drawback to using MB as thrust measurements devices is 
the complex calibration procedure. This project will result in more accurate 
actuators and a greatly simplified calibration procedure. Technology currently 
being developed at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT) will 
allow the utilization of active magnetic bearings (MB) as highly accurate force 
measurement systems with on-line calibration characteristics. In the proposed 
project, Imlach Consulting Engineering (ICE) will work with VT to develop, 
design, and analyze a thrust measurement system utilizing a modular system of 
highly efficient and accurate magnetic bearing actuators and the on-line 
calibration technology. The resulting thrust measurement system for rocket 
engine testing will to offer greater flexibility and adaptability to changing 
test requirements, while reducing changeover time and operating costs. The 
project will also develop and experimentally verify improved MB design tools 
which will be incorporated into advanced computational design tools for magnetic 
bearing (MB) actuators.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
Three commercial applications will be developed from this project. First, the 
design of the test rig will be of interest to companies requiring measurement of 
large axial loads generated by fluid forces (engines, compressors, turbines, 
etc.). Secondly, the on-line calibration procedure will be developed into a 
stand alone code that can be used with the digital controller of any MB system 
to measure in-situ bearing loads. This technology will be marketed to MB users 
and vendors for use in machinery and process controls and diagnostics. Finally, 
the improved MB design tools developed in this project will be marketed to MB 
users and vendors to improve the accuracy and usabiltiy of MB systems.

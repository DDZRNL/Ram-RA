7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
An important aspect of rocket engine testing is engine wear. One method that has 
been used to monitor for rocket engine wear is atomic emission in the UV-visible 
region from metal species in the plume. An alternative method that offers the 
promise of increased sensitivity and spatial resolution is laser-induced 
breakdown spectroscopy. This method uses atomic emission from a micro-plasma 
formed at the focus of a high peak power laser. It uses gated-detection with a 
fixed delay after the laser pulse. This has the advantage of discriminating 
against background emission in the plume. Also the laser micro-plasma has a 
higher temperature than the plume, which increases atomic emission strength.

During Phase I a LIBS system will be developed and demonstrated on several 
hydrocarbon-fuel flames and test stands. It will be optimized for sensitivity. 
Its capabilities, including detection limits and spatial resolution, will be 
characterized and reported. At the end of Phase II a working prototype will be 
completed and fully tested.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
In addition to being a monitor for rocket engine wear, the LIBS system can be 
used to monitor automobile engines for metal species in the exhaust. This would 
be useful for monitoring engine health as well as monitoring for toxic metals 
released in the atmosphere as pollutants. A similar application for jet engines 
is apparent.

7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
Synergistic materials and multifunctional structures fabrication technologies 
will be developed, evaluated, and intergrated to enhance and enable the design 
and operation of next generation ultralightweight space telescopes: (1) membrane 
reflectors comprised of preformed piezoelectric film laminated with preformed 
seamless polyimide films; (2) preformed piezoelectric polyimide reflector films; 
(3) active non-contact reflector membrane shape control using an electron gun; 
and (4) deployable preformed thin polyimide film reflector support structure 
elements and assemblies that have sufficient inherent stiffness or can be 
permanently rigidized with lightweight structural foam. All four technologies 
are scaleable and can provide significant increase in reflector surface accuracy 
and reduction in cost and weight of large telescope systems.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
This work can lead to demonstrated practical breakthroughs in large-scale 
ultralightweight highly accurate thin film reflectors for solar thermal rocket 
concentrators, large antennas, microwave concentrators, next generation 
telescopes, and solar conccentrators for electrical power generation and high 
temperature materials processing in space. The technology is also applicable to 
smart switches, sensors, and transducers that respond to stimuli such as heat, 
light or electric and magnetic fields.

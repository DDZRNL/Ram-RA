7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
Vanasil, a metal matrix composite, has: 3 times the microyield to weight ratio 
of beryllium; 10 times the thermal conductivity of silicon carbide; homogeneous 
optical surfaces, no moisture sensitivity, nor thermal cycling problems, unlike 
graphite epoxy; thermal expansion which matches optical platings and coatings; 
non-hazardous, non-toxic, unlike beryllium; and fabrication technology which 
allows optimum lightweight structures. Vanasil can be formed into complex shapes 
by casting, and is low cost. Our Phase I STTR program will explore Vanasil 
optics by fabricating hardware test items; an optical substrate with a ribbing 
structure will be cast, and a brazing process will be developed using vanasil 
coupons.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
A new option for ultra lightweight optics with a unique set of properties will 
provide NASA will a wider range of choices. This option is potentially the 
lightest weight of any known approaches.

The low cost, easily manufactured structures have commercial potential for 
simple and complex optical metering structures.

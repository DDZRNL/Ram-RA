7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
Significant research and development is underway for NGST and SIM regarding 
steady state wavefront error correction. However, little appears to have been 
developed in regard to dynamic wavefront error correction. Yet, the issue of 
minimizing dynamic error correction requirements by eliminating on-axis 
accelerations and off-axis accelerations is of crucial importance to NGST, SIM 
and other astrophysics missions. Introducing controlled isolation will minimize 
on-axis accelerations and off-axis accelerations (via electronic differential 
control) by integrating smart materials and advanced electronics design. This 
new concept is multifunctional since it serves to effectively isolate the space 
bus and the scientifc instrumentation module and simultaneously acts to 
implement pointing axis correction for the entire OTA assembly as to reduce the 
fine error correction requirements burden on the active optics.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
The results of this research are important for 'real world' military and 
commercial applications. EMF is exploring with TRW Civil & International 
Division, Harris Corporation Mililtary and Space Division and Boeing ISDS, the 
introduction of a practical compact, lightweight isolation system to a wide 
range of launch system and astrophysics platform applications. The technology 
has direct migration to automotive systems, machinery mounts and isolation 
tables.

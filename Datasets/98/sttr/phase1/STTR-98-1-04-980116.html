7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
Foster-Miller has developed an advanced processing technique for organic matrix 
composites called Ultrasonic Tape Lamination (UTL). This technique employs 
commercially available ultrasonic welding horns to insonify composite tape 
(either thermoplastic or B-staged thermoset) to induce controlled and virtually 
instantaneous viscoelastic and frictional heating in the composites. In this 
Phase I STTR Foster-Miller will team with Georgia Tech, to extend the technology 
of Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM) rapid prototyping with the 
adaptation/development of UTL. The combination of these two technologies will 
produce a rapid, controllable and precise composite manufacturing process that 
will push rapid prototyping into the realm of rapid manufacturing.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
Once successful UTLOM has been demonstrated with the Phase I program, a Phase II 
program will design, develop and build a prototype UTLOM machine that will be 
delivered to NASA. A successful UTLOM machine will be of great interest to the 
rapid prototyping community, and can be used to fulfill NASA mission 
requirements with the rapid and inexpensive manufacture of tooling for composite 
structures. Another application of UTLOM technology will be in tow-placement. 
UTLOM processing can be readily adapted to automated tow placement equipment 
allowing out-of-autoclave processing of large composite structures.

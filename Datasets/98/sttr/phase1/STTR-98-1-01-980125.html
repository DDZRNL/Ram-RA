7. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)
HYPRES proposes the development of a versatile design and manufacturing process 
for long-wavelength optical filters. The technology will produce bandpass 
filters with any desired center wavelength between 20 microns and 10 mm, using 
silicon substrates and one standard set of materials and thicknesses. With the 
aid of a computer program, it will be possible to design filters with specified 
optical characteristics, and know that the first ones produced will accurately 
match the specifications. This is a significant advance over existing filter 
production methods which require different materials for different parts of the 
spectrum, and cannot, in many cases, achieve desired optical specifications 
without at least one trial run. The proposed manufacturing process will be 
capable of producing bandpass filters, notch filters, beamsplitters and 
polarizers. These components will find application in astronomy from balloons, 
satellites and SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Airborne Astronomy). In 
Phase I HYPRES will manufacture bandpass filters with center wavelengths in the 
range of 0.3 mm to 10 mm, measure their characteristics, and compare them to a 
computer model. By the end of Phase I, it will be possible to produce low-cost 
bandpass filters with any specified center frequency in that range.

8. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)
The proposed bandpass filters will find application in a number of astro- 
nomical instruments and missions. They will also be used for air pollution 
measurement and climate monitoring, where the filters will improve the signal-
to-noise ratio of submillimeter mixer measurements of trace gases.

Interferometers for far-infrared spectroscopy of crystals and plastics are an 
application for beam splitters, which can also be produced by the proposed 
fabrication technology.

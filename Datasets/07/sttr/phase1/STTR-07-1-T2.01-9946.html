		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		An integrated computational environment for multidisciplinary, physics-based simulation and analyses of airbreathing hypersonic flight vehicles will be developed. These vehicles are among the most promising alternatives for the next generation of Highly Reliable Reusable Launch Systems (HRRLS). The proposed work will enable development of models with varying fidelity, incorporating the coupled dynamic elements resulting from the tightly integrated airframe-engine configuration. These will include aero-propulsion and aero-elastic interactions as well as thermal loading. The effect of unsteady aerodynamics and nonlinear phenomena such as shock-shock interaction on vehicle performance will be evaluated. Simple and intuitive models for control design as well as high fidelity models for validation and simulation will be developed. The investigators' extensive experience with multidisciplinary software such as STARS and FLUENT will be an asset in this regard. Rather than creating completely new suit of software the approach proposed here is to develop new software when necessary but also produce codes which will enhance the present capabilities of existing software to handle coupled aero-propulsion as well as aeroelastic effects. The methods and products developed in this effort will significantly enhance the present capabilities for modeling, simulation, and control design, for airbreathing hypersonic flight vehicles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA Aeronautics is focused on research aimed at enabling advanced future flight capabilities. One thrust of this research is hypersonics, including airbreathing vehicles to one day make possible safe, affordable, routine travel to low earth orbit in support of space science, exploration and commerce; and planetary entry bodies to enable manned and unmanned explorations. The next generation of reusable launch vehicles for access to space, the Highly Reliable Reusable Launch Systems, must be conceived, designed, and developed to fulfill the nation's space exploration aspirations, NASA's mission, and maintain the country's aerospace superiority in the 21st Century. Airbreathing hypersonic flight vehicles present one of the most promising alternatives for affordable and highly reliable access to space. Therefore, research into developing predictive capabilities, uncovering, understanding, and addressing challenges involved in control of this class of vehicles is highly relevant to the immediate and future interests of NASA.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The age of airbreathing hypersonic flight is upon us. In addition to their potential for low safe, affordable, routine travel to low earth orbit in support of space science, exploration and planetary entry bodies to enable manned and unmanned explorations they offer an exotic, but promising future high speed mode of civilian transportation. After NASP - which was a full scale transport hypersonic concept vehicle - in the US, Europe, Asia, and Australia there is an accelerated pace of research and development toward building test vehicles and experimental facilities with an eye on their potential commercial value. In the last AIAA Space Planes and Hypersonic Systems and Technologies Conference in Canberra, Australia keynote speeches were focused on conceptual commercial high speed transport vehicles. All of these attest to the feasibility of commercial application of this class of vehicles in the future.

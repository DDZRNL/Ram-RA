		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Impact Technologies, in collaboration with Georgia Institute of Technology, proposes to develop and demonstrate innovative technologies to integrate prognostics into Automated Contingency Management (ACM) for advanced aircraft controls. Without consideration of prognostic information, the traditional reactive fault tolerant control approaches may fail to provide optimal fault mitigation/accommodation strategies over a longer period of time. The project team will create a platform level simulation environment that demonstrates the fault propagation from the component level, using electromechanical flight actuators (EMAs) as a testbench problem, to the high level flight envelope and mission objectives. The proposed ACM system accepts input from discrete diagnostics, grayscale diagnostics and prognostic modules and will be split into a real-time reactive component and a "planning" component that considers temporal parameters and the potential impact of being proactive with mitigating action. Specifically, innovative prognostics enhanced stochastic programming and receding horizon control techniques are proposed for high and low level ACM controllers respectively. A subset of core algorithms will be implemented on embedded systems and used in hardware-in-the-loop demonstrations to justify a Technology Readiness Level of 4.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The real-time Automated Contingency Management technologies will be directly applicable to Propulsion IVHM, Crew Exploration Vehicle, Reusable Launch Vehicles, Unmanned Air Vehicles and future generation general aviation platforms. It will lead to benefits in the form of improved reliability, maintainability, and survivability of safety-critical aerospace systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The potential commercial use of the developed technologies is broad. Examples of key customers that could benefit through use of the developed technologies include: unmanned combat air vehicles, JSF, future combat systems, commercial airlines, land and marine propulsion systems, industrial actuation systems, and robotic applications. The aero propulsion domain alone has thousands of potential systems to address with this technology.

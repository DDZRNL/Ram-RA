		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The minimization of vibration-induced damage has become a critical issue for rocket launch ground support electronics (GSE). GSE located near a major rocket launch can be exposed to damaging environments including heat, rocket plume impingement, vibration, and acoustics. This extreme vibratory environment results in the need for extensive check out and frequent repairs of GSE systems after each launch. Another consequence is the need for extensive design and qualification testing to ensure equipment survivability.<BR><BR>Passive GSE vibration isolation systems often have natural resonances within the broad excitation spectrum, resulting in poor equipment protection. Additionally, passive isolation systems can only be tuned for one excitation type (amplitude / frequency) and one GSE rack arrangement. If the expected vibration spectrum changes, the passive isolation system is no longer optimized and requires redesign. Furthermore, if the inertial properties of the GSE rack itself changes (rack or drawer is replaced or rearranged), the passive isolation system will no longer function properly which may lead to catastrophic failure.<BR><BR>To overcome these deficiencies, Techno-Sciences Inc, in collaboration with the University of Maryland, proposes to develop an innovative Adaptive Magnetorheological Isolator (AMI) system that will automatically adjust its energy absorbing capabilities to real-time environmental measurements as well as GSE rack properties. Such a system will utilize internal motion sensors coupled with an on-board microcontroller to provide automatic adaptation to the excitation as well as the inertial properties of the supported rack. In doing so, the system will eliminate damaging natural resonances and provide optimal vibration isolation at all times. Because of its adaptability and optimal vibration isolation capabilities, the AMI system will significantly reduce design and life-cycle costs and enhance equipment reliability.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Besides the protection of GSE during launch, the low-cost, retrofit capable AMI system is particularly attractive for a number of other NASA applications.  These include vibration isolation of avionics, airborne laser systems, spacecraft, adaptive optics.  Additional NASA applications include the protection of NASA equipment during transportations and under seismic loading.  The adaptability and scalability of this system allows for enhanced protection over a broad range of supported equipment/payloads and excitations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Outside of NASA, there are a myriad of applications to which the AMI system would be highly beneficial.  These include shipboard electronics, transportation environments for shipping of delicate items, earthquake protection, precision manufacturing, and other applications where precision, high authority vibration and shock control are required in an energy efficient and compact package.

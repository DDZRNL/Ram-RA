		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address the need for non-intrusive sensors for rocket plume properties, we propose a laser-based velocity diagnostic that does not require seeding, works in high or low temperature flows, and can be used over a broad range of velocities. Hydroxyl tagging velocimetry (HTV) "writes" a line of OH molecules into the flow and interrogates them after a short delay to determine the velocity. Since the markers are molecules, the method measures the gas velocity directly, avoiding errors due to particle drag associated with seeded techniques. The only requirement is that H2O molecules must be present in the flow, which is easily met by most rocket plume applications. Because OH molecules survive at high temperatures for appreciable lifetimes, it is anticipated that the HTV technique will work in even the highest temperature rocket plumes. The proposed diagnostic will provide measurements not obtainable by current methods, and will enable experimental data that can be used for validating computer models for rocket engine performance predictions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's goals of returning humans to the Moon and sending humans to Mars and beyond present a formidable challenge that will require significant improvements in the efficiency of hardware development programs to stay within the available budget. Current methods for developing hydrogen- and hydrocarbon-fueled engines rely largely on expensive trial-and-error testing. Accurate computer models can significantly reduce the cost of hardware development. However, current models are limited by a lack of experimental data needed for validation. The proposed velocity diagnostic would provide crucial data that is needed for the development, qualification, and acceptance process of present and future computer models.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A successful velocity diagnostic for high-temperature, high-velocity exhaust flows would have broad application across the worldwide aerospace propulsion industry. Military applications include rockets, missiles, scramjets, and turbine engines, as well as new concepts in propulsion such as pulse detonation engines. Commercial applications include the development of new turbofan designs that will require improved diagnostics for achieving increased efficiency. MetroLaser will pursue these military and commercial markets with a commercial version of the Phase II prototype.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		ZONA Technology, Inc (ZONA) and Arizona State University (ASU) propose a R&D effort to develop a ground flutter testing system without wind tunnel, called the Dry Wind Tunnel (DWT) system. The DWT system consists of a ground vibration test (GVT) hardware system and a real-time unsteady aerodynamic force generation software developed from an aerodynamic reduced order model (ROM). The ground flutter test using the DWT system operates on the real structural model, thereby no scale-down structural model is involved.  Furthermore, the impact of the structural nonlinearities on the aeroelastic stability can be automatically included.  Moreover, the aeroservoelastic characteristics of the aircraft can be easily measured by simply including the flight control system in the loop.  In addition, the unsteady aerodynamics generated computationally is interference-free from the wind tunnel walls.  Finally, the DWT can be conveniently and inexpensively carried out as a post GVT test with the same hardware. In Phase I, we will validate this DWT concept on a rectangular flat plate with a reference flutter solution. Through this validation process, the most significant hardware issues will be resolved to pave the way for a successful Phase II validation on a complex structure, such as a real aircraft.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Dry Wind Tunnel testing concept would be particularly useful as a pre-flight testing effort to identify any aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic instability that are not predicted by the analysis. For example, inherent structural nonlinearities such as friction and freeplay are notoriously difficult to model properly in linearized analyses but would be naturally present in the DWT testing as it is carried out on the actual structure. DWT testing would also be useful as a post-flight testing procedure to resolve discrepancies between the analysis and flight test results. The DWT test concept is applicable to a broad range of test structures, from components to wing to full aircraft, that are currently being tested by NASA.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The DWT system can be applicable to flutter envelope expansion and flying quality  programs of military and civil transport as well as general aviation aircraft. The potential customers for the DWT system include Air Force, Navy, DARPA, and the aerospace industry.  It can be readily adapted to the following programs:(a)  Flying quality and store clearance for the F-22 and F-35 aircraft, (b) flutter envelope expansion for USAF's UVA/UCAV, Hilda and joined-wing sensorcraft, (c) flutter envelope expansion for USAF's next generation stealth and morphing UAVs designed to deliver directed-energy weapons, and (d) flutter envelope expansion for DARPA's new Switchblade Oblique Flying Wing program.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		There are several objectives of this Phase I proposal.  One major objective is to investigate SAW sensor embodiments for pressure and acceleration.  Two approaches will be studied, one using the SAW substrate as both the sensor and the communication link, and a second approach using the SAW device as a communication link for an external sensor.  The approach will use wireless, passive SAW coded devices, building on previous orthogonal frequency coding, and also investigating different approaches, such as phononic structure coding and combinations of coding techniques.  A second major objective is to investigate and propose a complete device-transceiver sensor system, such that a complete sensor system will be realized.  This is crucial to the success of the fielding and commercializing the SAW sensor technology, since it enables the interrogation of the tags and will ultimately lead to a commercial, manufacturable sensor product.  A third major objective is to study important ancillary technology issues: the antenna, the packaging, and the coding used for the sensor identification.  The results of this Phase I proposal will yield a vision towards the building of a complete SAW sensor system for pressure and acceleration measurements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A wireless, passive, coded sensor that is rugged, cheap and can be remotely interrogated has multiple aplications at NASA. Pressure and accelaration sensors can be installed on the leading edges of wings to monitor pressure loss and also provide a profile of the forces on the structure. Further the ability of the SAW device to act as a transportation mechanism to move data from existing sensors means these sensors can be wirelessly networked inexpensively.<BR>   Additional NASA applications include acceleration sensing for monitoring vehicular acceleration and vehicular vibration, vehicular docking, rotation and directional sensing, tilt control, and fall detection. Pressure sensing include monitoring the pressure distributions around and inside space suits.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA commercial applications of acceleration sensors would be in the areas of Crash sensors, Air-bag deployment, and Weapons systems arming, and earthquake detection. Other applications for pressure sensing are in the areas of weather instrumentation, cars, trucks, boats, aircraft, and any other machinery that has pressure functionality requirements.  Another application of SAW based pressure sensors is in the area of altitude sensing since one can benefit from the use of the relationship between changes in pressure relative to the altitude, as is seen in the governing equation of the altimeter.  This application is very important rockets, aircraft, rockets, weather balloons, and space satellites.

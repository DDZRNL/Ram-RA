		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This STTR project aims to develop a process-hardened, simple and low cost multi-analyte sensor for detecting components of rocket engine plumes. The sensor will be constructed with materials for operating continuously at 550 OK. It will also withstand temperatures as high as 2100 OK for at least five seconds.  NASA roadmaps point towards new hydrocarbon fueled engines. A non-intrusive instrument suitable for monitoring plume signature with high degree of reliability will facilitate this future development. Tasks are designed to establish the device feasibility by detecting carbon dioxide and kerosene in air over 0-1% (v/v) range in the presence of 100% moisture. The sensor array chip is capable of holding indicators for tens of analytes. A major aerospace company has expressed strong interest in the proposed technology for integrating in their test facilities.  InnoSense LLC (ISL) will develop, characterize and field-test the prototype in Phase II. For assuring success of this project, ISL has assembled a technical team with a cumulative 90 person-years of experience in developing commercially viable sensor systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology will help NASA programs with advanced test platforms with enhanced ability to provide supporting information for real time decision making. This sensor system will be capable of determining gas species, temperature, and plume velocity for rocket engines using hydrogen, oxygen, RP1, and hybrid fuels. The proposed system can also be configured to detect, locate, and quantify leakage of rocket fuels for applications in ground testing of rocket engines, space shuttle, and next generation space vehicles.  Since, there is a significant safety need to monitor the concentration of rocket fuels near launch vehicle main engines and propellant tanks, this system could be applied to various areas of concern including the engines and other subsystems during checkout and ground operations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The miniaturization and multi-analyte capabilities of the device makes it very attractive for applications ranging from environmental monitoring to process control.  The study by Frost & Sullivan on World Gas Sensors, Detectors and Analyzers Market reveals that these markets earned revenues of over $1 billion in 2005 and estimates this to exceed $1.4 billion in 2012 (Source: Frost and Sullivan Report MC1377591, August 31, 2006). This multi-analyte device will find immediate use in industries including: (a) petroleum refining, (b) paper and pulp industries, (c) optimization of metal processing, (d) production of bulk acids, (e) chemical waste treatment process, and (f) recycling of acids. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, fermentation monitoring, cell culturing, and tissue culturing are other important applications.

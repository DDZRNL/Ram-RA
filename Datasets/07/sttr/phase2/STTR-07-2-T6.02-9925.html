		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The minimization of vibration-induced damage has become a critical issue for rocket launch ground support electronics (GSE).  In particular, the effect of high acoustic and exhaust blast loading during launch results in large amplitude motions of the support structures, which can transmit damaging loads to the GSE.  This results in the need for extensive check out and frequent repairs of GSE systems after each launch, as well as extensive design and qualification testing to ensure the survivability of this equipment.  To this end, Techno-Sciences Inc. (TSi), in collaboration with the University of Maryland (UMD) and LORD Corporation, has developed an innovative Adaptive Magnetorheological Isolator (AMI) system for GSE.  The AMI system utilizes the continuously adjustable energy absorption capabilities of magnetorheological (MR) fluid dampers to automatically adjust to real-time environmental measurements as well as GSE rack properties.  Because of its adaptability and optimal vibration isolation capabilities, the AMI system significantly reduces design and life-cycle costs as well as enhances equipment reliability.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Besides the protection of GSE during launch, the low-cost, retrofit capable AMI system is particularly attractive for a number of other NASA applications.  These include vibration isolation of avionics, airborne laser systems, spacecraft, and adaptive optics.  Additional NASA applications include the protection of NASA equipment during transportation and under seismic loading.  The adaptability and scalability of this system allows for enhanced protection over a broad range of supported equipment/payloads and excitations.  
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Outside of NASA, there are a myriad of applications to which the AMI system would be highly beneficial.  These include shipboard electronics, transportation environments for shipping of delicate items, earthquake protection, precision manufacturing, and other applications where precision, high authority vibration and shock control are required in an energy efficient and compact package.

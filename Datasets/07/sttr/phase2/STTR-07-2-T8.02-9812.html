		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The challenges of designing, developing, and fielding man-rated propulsion systems continue to increase as NASA's Vision for Space Exploration Program moves beyond the Space Shuttle and RSRM.  The number and type of different propulsion elements required are significant, and predicting internal solid motor behavior and characteristics and assessing external environments (e.g., plume impingement on vehicle structures and launch acoustic loading) is a priority.  Our proposed innovation will enhance existing engineering software by combining new physical modeling capabilities with appropriate boundary conditions to create a novel toolset for complex multi-phase solid rocket analyses.  The innovation will be based on the Loci/Chem multi-physics analysis package and will utilize new Loci features, new multi-phase flow models, theoretical and phenomenological boundary conditions, and modified real gas equations of state to create a unique software tool for particle breakup, surface heat transfer with particle deposition, launch environment characterization, and nozzle erosion for next generation solid motors.  Our research products will provide NASA with the important capability to simultaneously analyze solid propellant combustion, heat transfer, launch acoustics, and nozzle erosion within a single unified numerical framework.  We will validate the approach using appropriate two phase flow problems to achieve a TRL range of 3-4.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology will provide NASA with an advanced analysis capability for the prediction of multi-phase flow environments in solid motors that will include models for particle breakup, surface heat transfer, launch acoustic loads, and surface erosion.  Potential enhancements to the these prediction tools include burning particles with smoke in a mixed Eulerian/Lagrangian framework, improved droplet/gas interface modeling for better statistical representations of particle laden flows, and extended model validation.  The proposed methodology for multi-phase solid motor flows is also well suited for extensions to additional multi-physics capabilities of commercial interest to NASA, including conjugate heat transfer within the solid propellant.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The growing trend toward complex multi-phase analyses is opening significant new markets as more difficult problems can be addressed using advanced computational techniques.  The ability to easily set up and analyze solid motor problems in a timely manner will allow industry to speed development of new products and streamline testing.  Further enhancements to the Chem solid modeling system, will find application in the aerospace, automotive, environmental, and nuclear industries.  The basic architecture of the software will remain the same while new plug-in physical models will be developed to address niche markets.

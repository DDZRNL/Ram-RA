		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The objective of the Phase II STTR project is to develop a prototype multi-analyte sensor system to detect gaseous analytes present in the test stands during propulsion test activities. Data on the concentrations of propellant-derived species are important to assure proper integration of safety protocols with testing activities to comply with environmental regulations.  InnoSense LLC (ISL) has utilized its Chemical Fingerprint(TM) sensor array fabrication technology in Phase I to establish the feasibility of the multi-analyte approach.  In particular, we have detected carbon dioxide, isopropanol, carbon monoxide, kerosene and ethylene as potential target analytes in the test stands. We have employed pin printing-based fabrication strategies, which would allow us to customize the sensor suite specific to engine types using different propellants. Concerning the placement of the sensors at the test stands, NASA users will use their discretion in deciding the location based on CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) reports. The sensors developed under this project can be used to validate these CFD models. ISL has received endorsement letters on the technology from two NASA prime contractors. ISL has also secured Phase III funding commitment from two commercialization partners. For assuring success of this project, ISL has assembled a technical team with a cumulative 90 person-years of experience in developing commercially viable sensor systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology will help NASA programs with advanced test platforms with enhanced ability to provide supporting information for real time decision making. This sensor system will be capable of determining gas species associated with the testing of rocket engines using hydrogen, oxygen, RP1, and hybrid fuels. The proposed system can also be configured to detect, locate, and quantify leakage of rocket fuels for applications in ground testing of rocket engines, space shuttle, and next generation space vehicles.  Since, there is a significant safety need to monitor the concentration of rocket fuels near launch vehicle main engines and propellant tanks, this system could be applied to various areas of concern including the engines and other subsystems during checkout and ground operations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The miniaturization and multi-analyte capabilities of the device makes it very attractive for applications ranging from environmental monitoring to process control.  The study by Frost & Sullivan on World Gas Sensors, Detectors and Analyzers Market reveals that these markets earned revenues of over $1 billion in 2005 and estimates this to exceed $1.4 billion in 2012 (Source: Frost and Sullivan Report MC1377591, August 31, 2006). This multi-analyte device will find immediate use in industries including: (a) petroleum refining, (b) paper and pulp industries, (c) optimization of metal processing, (d) production of bulk acids, (e) chemical waste treatment process, and (f) recycling of acids. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, fermentation monitoring, cell culturing, and tissue culturing are other important users. Upon repackaging, the device will have applications in a variety of civilian emergency response and occupational environment monitoring or in related research facilities.

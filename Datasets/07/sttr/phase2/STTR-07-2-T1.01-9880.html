		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Limited downlink data rate constrains the amount of data that can be sent to earth from a spacecraft. Data from the onboard health monitoring sensors needs to be accommodated within a small fraction of this downlink bandwidth. The problem is more acute for interplanetary missions, where the downlink data rate is significantly lower than the low earth orbit missions. Such constraint prohibits transmission of the complete set of health monitoring data. <BR><BR>This proposed Phase-II effort is geared towards providing enhanced remote diagnostics using limited telemetry bandwidth. Diagnostic accuracy of health management system depends more on the information content of the monitored data, than on its sheer volume. We propose accommodating more information within the allocated downlink bandwidth for health monitoring by performing intelligent data reduction. The onboard data reduction process employs sensor fusion, dimensionality reduction and temporal fusion techniques. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		An on-board health monitoring program that can diagnose system health and can automatically reconfigure to respond to failures has tremendous use and importance in space aviation. The proposed work is in line with NASA's goals in Project Constellation, as well as mission and contingency planning. The proposed work is very well aligned with ISS or Constellation mission controllers goal of monitoring systems in real time, and being able request additional PUIs on-demand via telemetry (satisfying bandwidth constraints)  to enable drill down diagnosis.  The ability to dynamically request/receive different PUIs as needed will be very important in cases where isolation of root cause requires additional data, and the data has to be transferred over a slow telemetry stream ? obviously the ability to request the right data, and not having to transmit all the data all the time, would reduce the communication time, which will improvement of mean time to diagnose.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The industries interested in the developed technology are expected to include the manufacturers (OEMs) and end users of complex systems and equipment that are used in environments where failure has serious consequences and where high availability and operational reliability are required. The aviation industry, primarily aircraft manufacturers and their customers as well as capital intensive equipment with minimal down-time requirements, such as semiconductor fab equipment manufacturers are industry segments that are of interest and will be targeted as part of the commercialization effort. Among the DoD, several large military systems of systems such as other Space Command ground segments, the Navy shipboard platforms, the Joint Strike Fighter fleet, and ballistic missile defense systems, as well as commercial industries such as transportation, power generation and distribution, are potential target segments.

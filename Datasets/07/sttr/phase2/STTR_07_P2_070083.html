		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This project will demonstrate the benefits of a partial emission pump coupled with a zero net positive suction pressure inducer design to achieve robust, deep throttling capability.  This pump application is well suited for 5k to 15k lbf thrust range rocket engines.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Advancement in space exploration necessitates deep throttling of liquid cryogenic rocket engines.  An engine that is capable of deep-throttling at low thrust levels and versatile enough to accommodate multiple applications would advance the "state-of-the-art" and enable NASA to meet its space exploration objectives. An advanced turbopump inducer/impeller design is an enabling technology for developing the required low thrust deep throttling engine needed to support future NASA missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications include pumps that can handle boiling fluids, both cryogenic and light hydrocarbons used in chemical process industries. These applications involve circulating pumps in multiple distillation columns where the NPSH can be one foot or less. The impeller and inducer design combination can be applied to commercial cryogenic pump applications for liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen, and other systems and can be used in liquid rocket engine turbopump design can be used with cryogenic liquid rocket engines developed for space tourism vehicles. The turbopump design can be used for high speed, low suction head, light-weight SCRAMJET fuel pumping.

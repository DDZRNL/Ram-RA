		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Automated Contingency Management (ACM) is an emerging and game-changing area of engineering and scientific research that integrates prognostics and health management concept and intelligent control. As leaders in this field, Impact Technologies and Georgia Institute of Technology, propose to build off a strong foundation of ACM research performed with NASA and DARPA in the past few years to both mature the applicability of ACM technology for real aerospace components and push the envelop on the capability and breadth of the technology itself. A prognostics-enhanced, three-tiered ACM architecture for critical aerospace systems has been conceptualized and demonstrated in Phase I. The proposed Phase II effort is focusing on utilizing prognostics at the higher levels of the control hierarchy and is introducing novel concepts to address the fault-tolerant control design at the middle level from the areas of model predictive control, system dynamic inversion, intelligent search techniques, and optimization / system identification algorithms for mission adaptation at the high level. Game theoretic notions are exploited to distribute optimally the available control authority between the components. An electromechanical flight actuator and a UAV platform will be utilized as testbeds for performance evaluation. Significant benefits are anticipated to NASA, DoD, and industry.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The development of the proposed proactive Automated Contingency Management system will directly contribute to NASA's IVHM and IRAC efforts. The proposed technologies are generic in nature and are also applicable to Crew Exploration Vehicle, Reusable Launch Vehicles, Unmanned Air Vehicles and future generation general aviation platforms, leading to benefits in the form of improved reliability, maintainability, and survivability of safety-critical aerospace systems. The long-term implications of a successful completion of this program are significant: We will provide a bridge between PHM/IVHM technologies and advanced controls for aircraft systems. A lot of NASA's NextGen and current activities can take immediate advantage of these technologies. In short term, the Electro-mechanical Actuator (EMA) modeling and adaptive control algorithms to be developed in this program can be directly transitioned to some ongoing research work at the Prognostics Center of Excellence of NASA Ames. The adaptable nature of the ACM modules will allow it to act as a design and development tool for a wide variety of NASA applications including complementing Stennis Space Center's ISHM system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The potential benefits from the successful completion of this program are enormous and will significantly impact the way critical aerospace and other systems are designed and operated. The potential commercial use of the developed automated contingency management technologies is broad. Examples of key customers that could benefit through use of the developed technologies include: unmanned air vehicles, JSF, future combat systems, commercial airlines, land and marine propulsion systems, industrial actuation systems, and robotic applications. Particularly, the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Rolls-Royce have specific requirements on health management performance for which the ACM technologies can provide value. The OEMs of Unmanned Air Vehicles including Northrop Grumman and Boeing are highly motivated to develop advanced Automated Contingency Management for these vehicles to improve survivability. The prognostics-enhanced EMA control will be of great interest to EMA manufactures. Impact has existing contracts with all these potential customers and has an excellent commercialization record.

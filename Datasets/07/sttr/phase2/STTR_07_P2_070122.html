		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Phase I demonstrated the technical feasibility of creating surface acoustic wave (SAW) based humidity sensors that respond rapidly (under 0.5 second) and reversibly to a wide range of humidity levels using nanoparticle and thin polymer films.  This proposal describes a Phase II effort that will result in the development of multiple uniquely identifiable, wirelessly interrogable, passive humidity sensors, and a wireless interrogation system to obtain and interpret the sensor responses.  The interrogation system used will be a slightly modified version of the system designed by ASR&D for use in the wireless SAW concrete maturity monitoring system currently being developed by ASR&D under funding from the Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO) and under the NASA Phase II STTR contract NNK07EA38C.  ASR&D thinks that this interrogation system, which incorporates coded sensor time diversity with self-synchronization, has significant advantages over the OFC-sensor-based systems previously developed by the ASR&D and the University of Central Florida in terms of increased range and the larger number of sensors that can simultaneously operate without sensor to sensor interference.  The proposed Phase II effort has technical objectives that aim (i) to further the development and implementation of the passive wireless SAW humidity sensor technology for which preliminary technical feasibility was demonstrated in Phase I, (ii) to modify existing breadboard wireless interrogator electronics to operate with these sensors, and (iii) to produce prototype sensor devices capable of operation with the modified breadboard wireless interrogator system to produce a multiple sensor system usable for field demonstration of the technology.  Wireless system demonstrations will be conducted using laboratory samples of the composites used in wind turbines or other NASA relevant applications.  At the completion of the Phase II effort, the sensors and system will be at TRL 4-5.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary NASA application for the proposed wireless multisensor humidity measurement system would be for detection of water infiltration in composite structures and insulating foam, a significant problem for a variety of NASA programs.  The spray on foam insulation (SOFI) used on the shuttle external fuel tank can absorb water.  Upon launch, water trapped in the foam can undergo aerodynamic heating, causing rapid expansion of foam sections as the water turns to steam.  This can lead to delaminations and sections of the foam breaking off causing other hazards.  Similar problems exist for composite aerostructures.  Both honeycomb foam core carbon composites can experience explosive expansion of water vapor due to aerodynamic heating during launch, if excessive water infiltration has occurred.  This major problem dictates that aerodynamic heating be taken into account when launch windows are determined.  Installation of arrays of individually coded passive wireless humidity sensors inside such structures would allow for non-destructive determination of water levels internal to the structure, providing launch personnel with valuable information to optimize the flight path.  Application to SOFI and nonconductive composite materials would be straightforward, while for electrically conductive carbon composites innovative techniques to transmit the activating signal through the composite layers would be necessary, such as the acoustic-electrical transmission demonstrated by JPL.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Measurement of humidity is one of the most commonly used metrics in industrial process control, and along with temperature, is critical to a wide range of industrial and manufacturing processes.  Numerous commercially available humidity sensors are used in the manufacture of household appliances, automobiles, HVAC equipment, printing equipment, telecommunication equipment, computation equipment, and a wide range of industrial machinery. None of these commercial sensors, however, are passive, able to operate wirelessly, and capable of operation at extreme temperatures.  Small, rugged, inexpensive, reliable sensors that can rapidly sense a range of humidity levels under extreme environments would prove beneficial to a range of applications.  Additionally, the rapid response of the sensors demonstrated in Phase I could make these devices advantageous for certain applications where wireless operation is not required. The two most promising short term applications are detection of water intrusion in composite structures for wind turbines and the aerospace industry, and monitoring of joint sleeves in oil and gas pipelines for corrosion-inducing humidity levels and/or condensing water.  Additional applications for which ASR&D has received inquiries from potential end users and industrial collaborators include monitoring for water intrusion in commercial built up roofing, humidity detection surrounding high-value consumer windows and doors, and water intrusion in concrete structures.

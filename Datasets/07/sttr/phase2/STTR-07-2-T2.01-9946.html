		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In Phase I the team completed all scheduled initial efforts, 1) evaluation of relevant current simulation capabilities, 2) development of aero-thermo-elastic-propulsion simulation of air-breathing hypersonic flight vehicles (AHFVs) and other flight vehicles, and 3) generation of a set of recommendations for multidisciplinary simulation capability, as planned. Numerical examples of this capability are also presented herein.  In Phase II we propose to complete our ongoing effort in the developmental area and further extend the tasks that will include acoustics. This team will complete development of an independent, Multidisciplinary Design and Analysis (MDA) tool, primarily employing their respective numerical, finite element based, computer codes in disciplines as Aerodynamics, Thermal, Structures, Propulsion, Acoustics, and Controls, among others. The resulting MDA code, designed in modular form, could be effortlessly interfaced with existing commercial or user-provided codes, if desired. Once completed, the code is expected to have extensive applications in the design and analysis of flight vehicles with a TRL level of 6 or so.<BR>The NASA SBIR/STTR solicitation emphasizes the area of MDA as a current topic of primary importance for ARMD Fundamental Aeronautics Program, and this proposal is highly relevant to such a solicitation.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA Aeronautics is focused on research aimed at enabling advanced future flight vehicle design and analysis capabilities. One thrust of this research is hypersonics, including airbreathing vehicles that will make possible safe, affordable, routine travel to low earth orbit in support of space science, exploration and commerce; and planetary entry bodies to enable manned and unmanned explorations. The Highly Reliable Reusable Launch Systems, must be conceived, designed, and developed to fulfill the nation's space exploration aspirations, NASA's mission, and maintain the country's aerospace superiority. Airbreathing hypersonic flight vehicles present one of the most promising alternatives for affordable and highly reliable access to space. Therefore, research into developing predictive capabilities and simulation tools for design of future advanced class of flight vehicles is highly relevant to the interest of NASA. Also additional capabilities in the area of aero-acoustics will have imminent applications in some ongoing NASA projects in this area.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Outside of NASA, the Phase II product will enable industrial companies and academia to use the AES/MDA code for analysis in individual disciplines and more importantly in the design of complete aerospace vehicles as well as other class of vehicles in a coupled mode. Thus, aeroelastic, aero-thermo-elastic, aero-propulsion, and aero-acoustic analyses can be performed routinely for accurate and reliable design of complex, advanced flight vehicles, among others, using standard personal computers. The optimization capability will help in achieving an economical configuration. Other applications are expected in fields of mechanical, marine, and civil engineering, among others.

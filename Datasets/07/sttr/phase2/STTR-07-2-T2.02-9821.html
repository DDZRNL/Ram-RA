		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		ZONA Technology, Inc (ZONA) and Arizona State University (ASU) propose a R&D effort to further develop the ground flutter testing system in place of a wind tunnel (WT), called the Dry Wind Tunnel (DWT) system. The DWT system consists of a ground vibration test (GVT) hardware system and a real-time unsteady aerodynamic force generation software system developed from an aerodynamic reduced order model (ROM). <BR><BR>The DWT system can serve as a replacement or complimentary means for flutter/ASE instability testing to a WT.  Our Phase I effort has successfully demonstrated the validity of the DWT concept. That is, DWT testing can truly simulate in real time the unsteady aerodynamics through a GVT hardware system, namely the shakers and sensors.  Merits of a DWT are many: It can use real full-size aircraft/wing structure including inherent structural nonlinearity and flight controller in-the loop, instead of a flutter model for WT, hence a cost/time effective test system.  It can be carried out with a GVT setup, and because of the simulated aerodynamics the DWT measured data is wall-interference free. The DWT system can be applicable to flutter envelope expansion and flying quality programs of military and civil transport as well as general aviation aircraft.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Dry Wind Tunnel testing concept would be particularly useful as a pre-flight testing effort to identify any aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic instability that are not predicted by the analysis. For example, inherent structural nonlinearities such as friction and freeplay are notoriously difficult to model properly in linearized analyses but would be naturally present in the DWT testing as it is carried out on the actual structure. DWT testing would also be useful as a post-flight testing procedure to resolve discrepancies between the analysis and flight test results. The DWT test concept is applicable to a broad range of test structures, from components to wing to full aircraft, that are currently being tested by NASA.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The DWT system can be applicable to flutter envelope expansion and flying quality programs of military and civil transport as well as general aviation aircraft. The potential customers for the DWT system include Air Force, Navy, DARPA, and the aerospace industry.  It can be readily adapted to the following programs:(a) Flying quality and store clearance for the F-22 and F-35 aircraft, (b) flutter envelope expansion for USAF's UVA/UCAV, Hilda and joined-wing sensorcraft, (c) flutter envelope expansion for USAF's next generation stealth and morphing UAVs designed to deliver directed-energy weapons, and (d) flutter envelope expansion for DARPA's new innovative design concepts.

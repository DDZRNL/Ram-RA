		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The runway safety issue has been on the Most Wanted list of the National Transportation Safety Board since the list's inception in 1990. The FAA has responded by implementing two ground surveillance technologies at major U.S. airports to reduce the risk of runway incursions. However, both technologies route information through air traffic control (rather than directly to pilots), which significantly delays safe responses. Several flight deck technologies that communicate information directly to pilots are currently in development. However, there is a need for tools to rapidly test the technologies early in the design process and measure their impact on pilot performance prior to implementation. The Aptima/George Mason University team proposes to develop two technologies that can be used together or independently to evaluate performance of flight deck technologies aimed at improving runway safety. We will deliver a computational cognitive model (Adaptive Control of Thought-Runway Safety; ACT-RS) that realistically emulates pilot performance, thus reducing the need for human pilots early in the design process. In addition, we will deliver a measurement tool (Performance Measurement Engine) that can measure the impact of the flight deck technology on the performance of ACT-RS and human pilots, making it useful across the technology lifecycle.

		<BR>
		ACT-RS and the PM Engine will be useful to NASA researchers within the Aviation Safety Program as tools that will allow them to: (1) assess the impact of flight deck technologies aimed at improving runway safety throughout the design lifecycle, (2) identify the underlying factors driving experience-based effects of technology implementation on pilot performance, and (3) assess performance in different conditions and scenarios by providing flexible modeling and software frameworks.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		ACT-RS and the PM Engine will appeal to customers who are developing flight deck technologies aimed at improving runway safety and those who develop and conduct training for pilots on new flight deck technologies. Avionics developers can benefit by using the proposed tools to collect and provide objective data that is evaluative in terms of FAA regulations, policies, and standards. Airline Training Directors can also benefit by using ACT-RS and the PM Engine to understand the effects of new runway safety technologies and to develop training curriculum that prepares pilots for these changes.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

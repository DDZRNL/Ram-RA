		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Major concerns for implementing a practical built-in structural health monitoring system are prediction accuracy and data reliability. It is proposed to develop robust state-of-the-art structural health management (SHM) technologies to overcome these concerns.  The proposed solution will be capable of detecting and quantifying damage with a high probability of detection (POD), accurately predicting the residual strength and remaining life of the structures with confidence, and providing information which will allow appropriate preventative actions on the monitored structure. To achieve the objectives the proposed technology will first optimize the sensor network configuration for the SHM system to achieve the highest probability of detection.  Next, robust diagnostic techniques will be developed to achieve quantifiable damage location and size estimation that account for the uncertainties induced by the environments or the system itself continuously during flight or at scheduled maintenance intervals. Finally, efficient probabilistic prognostic methods will be integrated with diagnostic outputs to provide real time estimation of residual strength and remaining life of the damaged structure. Both metallic and composite stiffened aircraft panels will be instrumented and tested under simulated flight conditions to validate the proposed technology. The work will be performed collaboratively between Acellent and Stanford University.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The SHM system can be used in all types of NASA aircraft, reusable space transportation vehicles such as boosters, shuttles, and CEVs, space habitation facilities such as space stations and outposts on the moon and Mars, and for the inspection and maintenance of any other mission critical space structures.  The system developed can be used in the near-term for reusable space transportation systems and will be scalable for future missions to the moon, Mars, and beyond.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Since nearly all in-service spacecraft and aircraft structures require some form of inspection and maintenance procedures to monitor their integrity and health condition to prolong life span or to prevent catastrophic failures, the potential applications of the proposed system are very broad and extend well beyond space structures.  The system can potentially be used to monitor damage in all military and commercial aging aircraft and rotorcraft structures, and civil structures such as bridges, buildings, oil platforms, etc.

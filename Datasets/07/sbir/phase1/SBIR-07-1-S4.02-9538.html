		<BR>
		NASA mission planning in the next decade includes small spacecraft and secondary flight opportunities on Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles (EELVs), specifically Atlas V and Delta IV.  NASA's use of EELVs is accelerated because of the impending termination of the Delta II launcher.  Nearly all EELVs slated for launch have significant excess payload capacity.  The EELV Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) Ring was developed by CSA Engineering under an Air Force SBIR to utilize excess lift capability by providing a secondary mission capability.  <BR><BR>ESPA, as built, can provide access to space for NASA lunar and science missions.  However, to ensure that diverse NASA mission objectives can be achieved with the best possible mission configurations, structural tailoring of the ESPA will be required.  The proposed effort will develop modular features of ESPA that are required for optimal NASA mission configurations targeting, but not necessarily limited to, the following:<BR>(1) Separable ESPA: Separation capability built into the ESPA Ring.<BR>(2) Hierarchical ESPA: Scaling of the ESPA design for larger EELV payloads and for small launch vehicles.<BR>(3) ESPA Mounts: Interior and exterior mounting for spacecraft and auxiliary structures.<BR><BR>Phase 1 will establish feasibility for the modular ESPA designs.  Plans will be presented for flight qualification of all designs.  Phase 2 will produce flight qualified hardware to at least TRL 6 for a design determined to be the most desirable for near-term NASA implementation.<BR>

		<BR>
		Development of the proposed ESPA modularity will enable future NASA Missions targeting lunar exploration as well as science programs.  A Separating ESPA Ring will enable free-flyer spacecraft and propulsion stages built on ESPA, for NASA objectives such as populating lunar orbit with communication satellites.  Increased delta-V for propulsive ESPA Orbital Maneuvering Systems will be achievable with reduced weight Rings.  The Hierarchical ESPA will extend secondary mission capability to spacecraft up to 500 kg, and will develop ESPA derived adapters for small launch vehicles such as Minotaur and Falcon.  Alternate structure mounting, for spacecraft or auxiliary components or appendages, will expand the design space available to NASA mission planners.  Modular features built into the ESPA Ring will be applicable for developments of secondary payload capability for the Ares and other future launch vehicles.

		<BR>
		ESPA is expected to have a tremendous impact on future spacecraft programs by increasing the number of secondary payload launch opportunities available at a reasonable cost.  Developments under this SBIR program will greatly enhance the capabilities of ESPA configured missions.  It is anticipated that this effort will significantly contribute to a change in the launch paradigm by providing small satellite launch opportunities at a reasonable cost and on a regular schedule, thus allowing for the full utilization of small satellite technology within the US.

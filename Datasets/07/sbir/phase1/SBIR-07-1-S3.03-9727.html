		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Solar cell is the key device in generating electrical power for spacecrafts. It is an on-going challenge in maximizing electrical power available to spacecraft while reducing overall stowage volume and mass of solar array. While the "record" solar cells approach the theoretical limit after several decades of extensive R&D effort, it becomes ever-increasingly difficult and cost prohibitive to further increasing their efficiency, by continuingly playing with existing solar cell fabrication protocols.<BR><BR>Sun Innovations proposes a highly innovative alternative approach in significantly increasing the solar cell efficiency (~10%), specific power density, the radiation resistance and lifetime, without adding much cost and weight to the existing solar cells. It is also a generic approach that shall enhance the efficiency and lifetime of most commercial solar cells for broad based commercial benefits. The key nano-crystalline materials will be developed in Phase I, to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach in record cells. The technology will be further developed in Phase II to be ready for commercialization in Phase III. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The objective of this project, if successful, would further push the limit on state-of-the-art solar cell efficiency and specific power density, in addition to enhancing the radiation tolerance. An advanced solar cell with efficiency over 30% and specific power density over 600 W/Kg would result in low launch and operation cost of spacecraft and greatly benefit various NASA spacecraft programs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology can also be applied to most types of commercial solar cells. By significantly enhancing the efficiency and lifetime of commercial solar cells (e.g. Silicon cells), without incurring much cost, it would reduce the "cost per watt" of solar cell in competing with other sources of energy, helping promote the market adoption of solar energy, which benefit the Nation's environment as well as energy independence from imported oil.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Non-incremental improvements are necessary in lithium-ion batteries order to meet future space applications demands such as NASA's call for lithium-ion battery cathodes with specific capacity values exceeding 240mAh/g at C/2 discharge rate and 25ºC. Novel concepts for lithium-ion battery chemistry and/or design are therefore desired. Yardney Technical Products, Inc. proposes a development of an advanced nano-composite cathode, based on two crucial components, each performing a different vital function:<BR>&#61607;	The first component, a layered non-transition oxide material will provide the matrix of the composite and ensure that the cathode voltage falls above ~4.0V.<BR>&#61607;	The metallic nano-particulate domains, dispersed uniformly within the layered oxide matrix will provide the composite cathode with a potentially high specific capacity. Metallic nanoparticles are expected to form an in-situ oxide phase upon cycling in a lithium ion battery.<BR>The composite electrode material may be coated with a thin layer of carbon in order to enhance the electronic conductivity of the as-synthesized composite electrode.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Development of power capabilities is critical in enabling the human exploration beyond Earth orbit pursued by NASA. Lithium ion batteries are required to be human-rated and required to operate over a greater range of temperatures for the lunar environment. Human-rated energy storage devices are required to enable future robotic and human exploration missions.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The development of human-rated and inexpensive lithium-ion battery with high energy density is crucial the commercial consumer market and in military applications. Among commercial applications electric vehicle (EV) market and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) applications would benefit from the safe, reliable and high-performance lithium-ion batteries. YTP will also conduct market studies to identify other niche space, aircraft, military, and commercial markets where the proposed technology would enjoy a unique advantage relative to available battery technologies. Applying a novel power systems solution on these kinds of applications will allow Yardney to establish a growing presence in these markets. Other commercial applications include hybrid electric vehicles, portable instruments (testing and medical), power tools and commercial satellites may soon follow. The developed technology will enhance the desirability of Li-ion technologies for some of these applications.

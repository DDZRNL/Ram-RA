		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed innovation is a self-contained, self-powered, robust flight test sensor array for the determination of separation.  The proposed system uses off the shelf, currently available technology to create a reusable distributed sensor array, which requires no external wiring or power source.  The system is based on a novel instrumented tuft technology.  A distributed array of tuft sensors are embedded in a flexible, self-adhesive backed sheet of polymide substrate.  The proposed separation sensor array will provide real-time, accurate determination of separation across a wide range of flight conditions.  The self-contained blanket array can be quickly and easily applied to aircraft surfaces in question.  No wiring, external power, or remote viewing is required for acquisition.  After testing is complete, the system can be quickly removed and reused.  Additionally, the system could be miniaturized for use in ground test facilities or applied to other types of vehicles.  The proposed separation sensor array promises to provide a realizable, accurate, efficient, and cost effective measurement system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced sensing technology in the form of a robust separation detection system for both flight and ground test facilities has significant potential application at several NASA centers and across a wide range of NASA facilities.  With the current high costs of flight and ground testing, coupled with reduced design and test schedules, the proposed technology will be highly desirable.  The technology developed by RHRC under this program will allow the accurate, efficient, and cost effective detection of separation on aerodynamic/hydrodynamic surfaces across a wide range of conditions.  NASA centers and facilities will be eager to exploit the proposed technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed separation detection technology will be highly desirable in military, government, and civilian testing markets.  The technology developed by RHRC under this program will allow the efficient and cost effective detection of separation on vehicles across a wide range of applications other than aircraft.  These include automobiles, hydrodynamic, and civil engineering applications.  Any external surface where aerodynamic separation is a concern is a potential application of the technology.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Los Gatos Research proposes to develop a powerful new technology - next generation Micro-Capillary Electrochromatography   a high performance and low power consumption microfluidic sample separation device suited for separating organic molecules as signatures of past and present life on Mars.  In particular, these micro-devices will be engineered for integration with NASA's Mars Organic Detector.  For the Phase I effort, we will design, construct, and test the micro-CEC chips.  The Phase I research will address issues related to performance as well as production methods that can be used for the technology, as well as designing and determining the integrated micro-device and the Phase II prototype.  In the Phase II effort, we will integrate the micro-CEC prototypes with the existing micro-CE analyzers as a dual micro-CE/micro-CEC system capable of separating all neutral and charged organic molecules as targeted by Urey, thus provide new capabilities for NASA sample separation instrumentation development.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed micro-CEC technology can be readily adapted to NASA's miniature "Micro Laboratories" scientific instrumentations to find signature of life on Mars such as Urey's Mars Organic Detector for detection of organic molecules and chiral analysis of amino acids.  The proposed technology has broad applications including on-chip biosensors, electrochemical sensors, wet-chemistry systems, as well as high pressure micropumps for fluid positioning, mixing, metering, storage, and filtering systems.  In addition, our novel technology is naturally suited to such applications as planetary and small body surface chemistry studies, clinical diagnostics, spacecraft and biosphere environmental monitoring, and toxicology studies.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The next generation micro-CEC technology described in this proposal possesses significant commercial potential for a wide range of technologies and applications in markets ranging from specialty medical and aerospace industries to consumer electronics. Commercial devices based on such CEC technology envisioned include components for DNA, protein and drug separation and analysis, chemical analysis systems, drug delivery systems, and embedded health monitoring systems.  Our proprietary technology vastly improves robustness and reliability, thus clearing one of the last hurdles of a wider acceptance of CEC in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries

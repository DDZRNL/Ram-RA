		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Satellite design encompasses a multitude of steps from concept to flight.  Mission specification to flight can take several years, depending on the scope, requirements and budget of the mission. The process also requires a wide range of design and management tools, with limited consistency data interchange capability, and a lack of coherency.  Detailing the relationships between the satellite configuration, inventory control systems, life cycle management, design, analysis and test data is difficult at best. No tool exists that meets these needs for the general satellite design, system engineering and integration process. Sci_Zone is proposing our innovative Satellite Design Automation architecture SatBuilder Designer, in conjunction with the OpenSAT open database architecture to meet this need. OpenSAT seamlessly integrates existing detail design tools with SatBuilder Designer, as well as databases tracking requirements, components and inventory, with the final configuration of the satellite. SatBuilder Designer, an AI based toolset, provides for rapid design via design wizards and integration to existing design tools; it provides coherency between a range of applications and data sets. OpenSAT stores and distributes supporting satellite design, configuration, mission and test data from a centralized database server and can distribute the data across multiple platforms and via the internet.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		OpenSAT and SATBuilder Designer allows for the rapid development, configuration management, and deployment of systems and satellites. NASA commercial applications include any Satellite or Subsystem development program, manned or unmanned mission - and any project requiring seamless integration between costing, performance, program and project life cycle support, and design processes. Once developed the product should be widely adopted within NASA due in part to SATBuilder Designer, the open APIs, and OpenSAT's open architecture and platform independence, plus free cost.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		OpenSAT, SATBuilder Designer and the Mission to Spacecraft Design Tool (MSDT) allows for the rapid development, configuration management, and deployment of satellites while considering performance, risk and managing the process through out the program life cycle. Non-NASA applications include any aerospace related applications requiring seamless integration between costing, performance and design. Non-NASA commercial customers include our own customer, AFRL, interested in implementing the SATBuilder Designer, MSDT and supporting OpenSAT Environments and will provide us the opportunity to expand our offering and market to new customers due in part to the architecture's open environment and platform independence. It is planned this project will set a standard for data exchange and design management. A market will then exist of OpenSAT certified applications, guaranteeing increased software sales and support services.  This process has begun with the acceptance by AFRL of OpenSAT as the standard data architecture for the Operationally Responsive Space Program.

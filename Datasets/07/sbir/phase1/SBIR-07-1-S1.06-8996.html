		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase I SBIR project will investigate a method to accurately measure total magnetic fields in the range 0 to 1.6 mT in support of missions to Jupiter.  The measurement approach is based on fundamental physical quantities.  High sensitivity will be demonstrated, and an upper bound on systematic errors will be determined.  The intrinsic heading error will be directly measured.  Successful completion of Phase I and Phase II will lead to a compact, fiber-coupled instrument for measuring magnetic fields with high accuracy and precision.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Accurate and stable calibration of the magnetometers on the Juno mission is essential for comparing fields over the duration of the mission and from mission to mission.  The Phase II instrument can serve as a pre-launch tool to calibrate the fields generated to test the science instruments and to check for drift of the science instruments.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Precise magnetic field measurements are used in geophysical research, mineral exploration, and magnetic anomaly detection.  Broader opportunities based on this technology include low field magnetic resonance imaging.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

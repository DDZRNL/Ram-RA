		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Many scientists have the common need of visualizing data in a collaborative and interactive manner.  In a modern environment, these data are often stored across a widely distributed network and the researchers themselves are just as often separated by large geographical distances.  Traditional visualization and collaboration approaches require the local installation of software specific to each end user as well as the downloading of data to each local machine.  The proposed innovation would provide researchers with an environment that allows them to visualize remote data using the standard and familiar web browser as the application platform.  No proprietary software need be installed and no data has to be downloaded to local machines.  Furthermore, multiple researchers can interactively explore data via visualization in a joint session where changes by one researcher are seamlessly seen by the others.  The architecture is based on technologies underlying state of the art web applications such as Google Maps.  Employing a modular design using web services as means to connect the modules, the environment is easy to modify and improve as new data access, rendering, and client-side display technologies mature and become available.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The environment proposed here would be of use to NASA personnel interested in visualizing remote data stored in a distributed environment.  It would allow for researchers to collaboratively interact when both the data and the researchers are widely geographically distributed.  Specific potential users of the application include researchers involved with Sun-Earth Connection program, scientists and engineers analyzing accumulated data from actual missions, engineers using CFD codes to simulate flight conditions or propulsion devices, or anyone interested in visualizing data available from one of the many NASA data centers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A remote, online visualization environment has numerous applications outside of the scope of NASA.  Doctors and other medical professionals often collaborate using imagery; in many cases, these consultations occur across large geographical distances making an online environment an ideal choice.  Defense contractors such as Lockheed-Martin typically run complex aerospace codes on remote supercomputers, separating researchers from their data.  Again, a collaborative, online environment proposed here would allow these researchers to quickly and easily visualize results from remote locations.  Any industry where the work paradigm has widely distributed data and/or consumers of that data is a prime candidate for a potential application to the proposed innovation.  An example of such an industry would be climate modeling.

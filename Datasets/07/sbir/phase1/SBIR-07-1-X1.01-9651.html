		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA captures and distributes operational knowledge in the form of procedures. These procedures are created and accessed by a range of people performing many different jobs.  These people have different needs for procedure data and different ways of interacting with procedures. We propose an Procedure Integrated Development Environment which will present different editing modes and different views depending on the users and tasks, but will use a consistent data representation for all users. We propose to explore alternate editing paradigms and discover which are the most valuable for NASA operations.  We propose to build this environment on the basis of an existing prototype, PRIDE, which was developed for the Engineering Directorate of Johnson Space Center.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		An integrated development environment for procedures would improve the efficiency of the procedure authors by allowing them to concentrate on the fields in which they are expert, without worrying about details of editing and formatting.  It would present each user with a procedure view that is most useful for the job at hand.  It would connect up to the needed data sources and other related tools, such as workflow tools.  It would provide a direct interface to simulation tools, which allow users to work out problems with procedures at the desktop, instead of requiring expensive high-fidelity simulations to be run to find minor problems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A procedure development environment would be potentially useful to a wide range of commercial and industrial interests that use a large number of procedures in their business.  The electronic procedures that are proposed here would be of considerable interest to those industries that rely on procedures that could be automated, due to the availability of data sources. These industries include oil and chemical processing, power plants, and robotic assembly plants.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Impact Technologies LLC, with support of the University of California Santa Cruz, proposes to develop and demonstrate a set of enhancements to NASA's Hybrid Diagnostic Engine (HyDE) that represent valuable and, in some cases, critical features for IVHM system developers in NASA and non-NASA application domains. Specifically, the Impact team believes that in order for HyDE to transition to a broad customer base, HyDE must meet commercial-grade software standards as well as provide 1) an innovative and powerful software-based model validation and verification environment must be integrate with Matlab/Simulink, 2) sophisticated third party plug-ins to translate from a Bayesian Network modeling paradigm and integrate generic signal validation tools and 3) the capability to generate and deploy models for common embedded targets in an efficient and user friendly package. The project team intends to define, develop and demonstrate the feasibility of these innovative and significant enhancements to HyDE with NASA's Advanced Diagnostic and Prognostics Testbed (ADAPT) as a realistic and sufficiently complex case study.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has already utilized HyDE for some of its IVHM applications as well as its predecessor, Livingstone 2. However, the proposed HyDE enhancements will make major strides towards a comprehensive and commercial-grade IVHM design tool that will provide greater overall benefit to NASA IVHM application developers and most likely greater exposure of the software product.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The need for improved IVHM design tools and reasoning capability within the DoD is very significant given aggressive diagnostic and prognostic requirements for major new acquisition programs like JSF and FCS.  Impact Technologies is directly involved in these and other DoD programs and views HyDE, with the proposed enhancements, as a powerful tool that can address this need.

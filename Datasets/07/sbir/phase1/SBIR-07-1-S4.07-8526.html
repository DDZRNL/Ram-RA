		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Nitrous Oxide is proposed as an energetic liquid injection thrust vector control fluid for vehicle attitude control during dynamic vehicle maneuvers. Pulled from the main propulsion system oxidizer tank, it features system simplicity, no toxicity, room temperature storability, high system mass fraction and superior performance due to its exothermic decomposition characteristics, answering the need for innovative attitude control technologies.  A series of 1,000 lb thrust hybrid rocket motor tests are proposed to characterize Nitrous Oxide's Side Specific Impulse as a function of thrust vectoring angle. At the conclusion of Phase 1, the technology will be ready for development for a small upper stage, and will be at a TRL of 5. At the end of Phase 2, its performance characteristics will be completely known, and its development for an integrated Main Propulsion/Thrust Vector Control /Attitude Control System for a small launch vehicle would be appropriate.

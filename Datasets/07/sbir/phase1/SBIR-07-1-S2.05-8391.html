		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Reactive Atom Plasma (RAP<SUP>TM</SUP>) process will be evaluated as a rapid and practical method for fabricating precision wedges in glass sheets.  The glass sheets are to be slumped using the same process as developed by NASA for the next generation of X-ray telescopes.  The wedged sheets are to serve as alignment spacers for the multi-segmented grazing-incidence mirror design.  RAP is possibly the only method capable of fabricating the wedge glass sheets within a viable process period and at a reasonable cost to validate the current alignment and assembly concept for the Constellation-X SXT telescopes.  Conventional abrasive-based processes for fabricating the thousands of glass wedges required would consume enormous processing time which virtually invalidates the entire "Fabricate and Assemble" concept for the final telescope integration and assembly.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Constellation-X Spectroscopy X-ray Telescope (SXT) is a large, segmented, modified Wolter-1 style mirror assembly, using thin slumped glass mirror segments as the reflecting elements.  X-ray telescopes designed and built with mirror segments will provide much higher angular resolutions and much larger effective areas compared to typical X-ray telescopes using complete shells.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-invasive imaging plays a crucial role in medical appliactions. Grazing incidence optics can play an important role in improving spatial resolution for many medical imaging systems. RAPT intends to maintain a time and cost advantage over conventional technologies through the integrated use of Reactive Atom Plasma processing throughout the optics manufacturing process  as a shaping tool, a damage mitigation tool, and as a figuring tool. <BR>

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		An all-composite driveshaft incorporating integral flexible diaphragms is described and proposed for further refinement.  An approach is explored which obsoletes the split lines and associated fasteners required to attach metallic flex elements and either metallic or composite spacing tubes in current solutions.  Sub-critical driveshaft weights half that of incumbent technology are projected for typical rotary wing shaft lengths.  Spacing tubes are described, which comprise an integral part of the initial tooling but which remain part of the finished shaft and control natural frequencies and torsional stability. A concurrently engineered manufacturing process and design for performance is proposed which competes with incumbent solutions at  significantly lower weight and with the probability of improved damage tolerance and fatigue life.  This phase I proposal seeks to further remove manufacturing cost and to produce test articles suitable for concept verification and, subsequently, flight qualification during phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The rotary wing subtopic 2.10 includes both materials & structures and propulsion components requiring lower weight and higher performance in power transmission components.  These include tail rotor drives, tilt-rotor cross-over drives, and tandem rotor connection shafts.  Current technology has not changed in decades as it concerns motion accomodating, high torque density driveshafts.  Enhanced mission availability and cost reduction can be obtained via the reduced part count and improved fatigue performance already established by this fully integral, all-composite driveshaft technology.  Further refinement and preparation of flight qualification test articles is proposed and, once fielded, NASA and NASA partners will also benefit from increased payload.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA commercial benefits are similar to NASA benefits in improving rotary wing performance across government agencies and the commercial helicopter market.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

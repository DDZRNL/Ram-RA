		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A novel quiet engine air-brake is proposed in response to NASA's solicitation for concepts for active and passive control of noise sources for conventional and advanced aircraft.  The air-brake concept is applicable to 1) next-generation, conventional tube and wing aircraft (current generation +1) and 2) advanced integrated airframe/propulsion system configurations (current generation +2), and could enable system level noise reductions of several decibels at the ground observer during approach by quietly generating drag equivalent to up to three turbofan-sized bluff bodies per powerplant.  Such drag generation could enable slower, steeper approach trajectories with reduced need for drag generators such as flaps, slats and undercarriage.  Proposed research tasks build upon a rigorous understanding developed by the investigating team on the aero-acoustics of drag generating, swirling exhaust flows.  <BR>The objectives are to 1) create an engine air-brake design specification to constrain the design and identify and address issues and challenges associated with implementation, 2) perform trade studies on two aircraft/powerplant combinations in current generation +1 and +2 configurations to identify the attributes of suitable devices installed on such aircraft and 3) develop a candidate design for model scale aerodynamic and aeroacoustic validation in an experimental facility.  The deliverable will be a written report presenting a conceptual design of a model-scale engine air-brake and proposed test plan for Phase II validation.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The most immediate opportunity for this system is to assist NASA in the development of next generation quiet aircraft, including tube and wing (current generation +1) and integrated airframe propulsion system configuration (current generation +2). These aircraft are likely to have noise sources from the engine and airframe that have comparable levels at approach. A quiet air-brake device will allow noise reduction by creating drag without the associated unsteady flow structures of devices such as flaps, slats, and undercarriage. In addition these devices will enable steep approaches, thereby locating the noise source further from the affected communities. An additional application for swirling exhaust flows is in the area of wake vortex avoidance and induced drag management. For example, swirling outflow devices placed on wing tips could be used to swirl in the opposite or same direction to the bound vortex that is shed by a finite wing, resulting in potential induced drag reduction or increase (possibly of value in a quiet drag sense).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The commercial potential for this system extends beyond NASA's development programs related to next-generation quiet aircraft. The larger, shorter term market potential relates to engines which are currently being developed for commercial deployment in the next five to ten years by large-engine manufacturers where there is potentially still an opportunity to incorporate features of this concept into the final design. Another significant commercial opportunity is the development of a version or versions of the concept proposed here which can be retrofitted to existing or legacy engines to allow them to continue to operate under the more stringent future noise requirements.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Space flight cryocoolers will be able to handle limited heat loads at their expected operating temperatures and the current leads may be the dominant contributor to the heat load. In the present SBIR, we propose an innovative approach that could significantly reduce heat loads introduced by current carrying leads in a variety of space flight cryocoolers. Our approach uses high-temperature superconducting (HTS) current leads with zero dissipation for DC currents, developed on flexible low-thermal conductivity substrates (ceramic yttria stabilized zirconia). The unique film/substrate combination when implemented for developing low-thermal budget DC current leads is expected to allow thermal loads less than 1 mW when operated between 80K and 10K.  Successful accomplishment of program objectives will lead to a unique, low thermal load, superconducting current lead platform, significantly enhancing the  over all performance of the cryogenic subsystems.

		<BR>
		High-temperature superconducting current leads capable of carrying several amps of DC current in the temperature regime of 80-10K with minimum thermal loads (< 1 mW) can greatly  minimize the thermal budget on the cryocoolers, leading to significant thermal savings to the overall cryogenic systems. In space related detector programs, these thermal savings translate to life extension of the mission itself, besides enhancing the efficiency of the cooled subsystem. Several of NASA's detector programs can therefore be benefited from  success in the present effort.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Sensors and detectors are ubiquitous in a variety of civilian commercial applications ranging from those used in UV to Gamma rays. In cooled detectors and sensors used for imaging, surveillance, security and process monitoring, significant  enhancements in system performance can be expected by using HTS current leads. The cooled CMOS technology implemented in several highend computers can be benefited from the use of HTS current leads.

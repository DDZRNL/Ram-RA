		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA, the Department of Defense (DoD), and Commercial spacecraft programs have the desire to minimize program costs while continuing to ensure mission robustness and flexibility.  The spacecraft system that is a cost driver throughout the program life cycle is the Command and Data Handling System (C&DH), along with the associated algorithms and software.  Advanced Solutions Inc (ASI) plans to develop C&DH software which can be targeted and adapted to a wide variety of C&DH hardware architectures and mission requirements.  We also recognize the need to streamline the entire spacecraft development lifecycle and provide a product that not only provides highly autonomous core flight software that is adaptable to any mission, but also has the ability to replace traditional development, integration and test elements.  This will be accomplished by expanding upon our revolutionary On-board Dynamic Simulation System (ODySSy) to allow the C&DH system to support all phases of the spacecraft lifecycle.  Additionally, the traditional test control room is now unnecessary and is replaced by the mission control architecture to provide a true test-like-you-fly environment.  The test team, mission control team, and data analyst's can be in remote locations through use of the Web-Based Data Distribution Network (WebDDN).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed Modular Autonomous C&DH Software with Built-In Simulation/Test has application to a broad range of NASA spacecraft programs because: (1) the system is designed for re-use through modularity; (2) significant cost savings and risk reduction are realized through standardization of this critical spacecraft system; (3) increased levels of autonomy lead to more fault tolerant spacecraft and lower mission operations costs; and (4) reduced time to orbit is achieved via a streamlined Assembly, Integration and Test approach.  Therefore the technology has the potential to become a standard for certain types of NASA missions including communication satellites, remote sensing platforms, planetary science spacecraft and GIS imagers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed Modular Autonomous C&DH Software with Built-In Simulation/Test has significant application to the Department of Defense (DoD) spacecraft due to the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) initiative.  The ORS goals are to make space assets available to DoD users on-demand within very short time frames.  The technology proposed in this SBIR supports those goals by providing a standardized approach to flight software that is also highly adaptable through modularity.  In addition, the built-in simulation/test capabilities significantly reduce the Assembly, Integration and Test timeline.  The commercial spacecraft market will likewise become a potential customer via the desire to reduce cost, risk and time to orbit.  This is especially critical for telecommunication constellations (broadband commercial and personal communications) where savings are multiplied due to the number of satellites involved.

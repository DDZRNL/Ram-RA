		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		ZIN Technologies, Inc will breadboard an integrated electronic system for space suit application to acquire images, biomedical sensor signals and suit health & status data. The system will then process, display, store, transmit and manage the results under control of embedded firmware. A commercial off-the-shelf heads-up display which is applicable to space suit helmets will be the primary display device. The system will include a breadboard version of a lightweight, low power, general purpose computing platform based on commercial-grade components with available, upgraded versions that can tolerate the EVA thermal/vacuum/radiation environment. Initial development of a camera interface will be included. A breadboard of the proposed system will be built, programmed and demonstrated. ZIN will leverage our past experience in NASA spaceflight hardware/software development and existing biomedical monitoring technology to deliver a mature concept demonstration at minimal cost and risk. The system will be compatible with medical industry standard sensors to measure CO2, core temperature and other biomedical parameters. The proposed Phase 1 effort will be geared toward future development of a Phase 2 version that could be integrated into a functional EVA system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed system is an innovative, reliable candidate for the CAI (Communications, Avionics and Informatics) element of the Constellation Space Suit System (CSSS) for use in Lunar Sortie and Outpost missions (Block II) as described in CxP 72002 (Constellation EVA System Requirements Document). The proposed Space Suit Sensing, Display and Data Management System will be based on the existing vMetrics biomedical monitoring device which was developed by the ZIN Medical division. The vMetrics-based system will meet NASA requirement EVA1084 for monitoring heart rhythm data as well as other medical parameters for the non-tethered (Block II) EVA Space Suit.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed system could be applied to a wide range of civilian and military applications. It meets the needs of workers in numerous occupations who have task- or mission-critical data requirements and who currently have to access that data using their hands or by moving their eyes away from their primary task. The embedded firmware could be easily reprogrammed to allow the device to serve the needs of aviators, heavy equipment operators, maintenance and healthcare workers, emergency response personnel and others who need a hands-free data acquisition and display device. The same ruggedization needed for the space environment would also serve well in undersea and harsh-environment industrial applications such as steel mills, refineries and nuclear power plants.

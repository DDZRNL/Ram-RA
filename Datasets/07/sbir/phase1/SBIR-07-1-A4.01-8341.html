		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
			Development of an Aircraft Nodal Data Acquisition System (ANDAS) is proposed.  The proposed methodology employs the development of a very thin (135&#61549;m) hybrid microminiature sensor assembly (MSA) incorporating a micro-electro-mechanical-sensor (MEMS) array, a short-haul radio transceiver, a data mux, memory, power management module, a replaceable battery cartridge, and an antenna.  Various MSA packaging concepts will be evaluated using modified MEMS and commercially available ICs (in die form). A final packaging design for batch fabrication in Phase II will be developed. The MSA would be designed as a cement-and-forget-device (except for the battery). A cpomactPCI modular host would manage the MSA nodes as a part of a scatternet/piconet arrangement.  The host will be almost entirely made up of COTS hardware and software.  Cost estimates for MSA and the host system will be provided.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		By adding real time aircraft dynamic modal assessment, real-time correlation and control algorithms, the MSA could be utilized in controlling light weight, flexible and even unstable flight subsystems. It can also be used in hard to access or remotely located nodes.  
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The MSA can be employed for monitoring of power plants, vehicle engines, or any other hard to access structural components. The monitoring concept can be employed for monitoring medically implanted devices in human body.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

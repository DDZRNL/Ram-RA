		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In recent work, this firm developed a highly promising, patented variable emittance technology based on electrochromic Conducting Polymers, with: (1) Thin (< 0.2 mm), flexible, lightweight (0.176 kg/m2), variable area (0.5  cm2 -  0.5 m2.  (2) Impervious to flexing, micrometeoroids.(3) High Delta Emittance (0.5, range 0.13 - 0.89).(4) > 105 cycles, < 5 s switching, indefinite optical memory. (5) Low power, 0.30 W/m2 (6) Space durability: (10-6 Torr)  100,000 electrochromic cycles, 90 thermal cycles;. no UV degradation > 500 h. Durability against atomic-O. (7) Operating temperature (-) 45  oC  to (+) 100 oC, durability (-) 196  oC to (+) 100  oC. (8) Easily applicable with space-qualified adhesive to any surface. (9) Cost ca. < $5K/m2. A key technical barrier of the earlier generation of this technology was the need for a hermetic seal for space durability. This was resolved through use of unique ionic electrolytes. An additional drawback remained: High solar absorptance of the dark-state. In very recent, unrelated work, this firm has developed coatings that are IR transparent from 2 to 25 microns while having very low solar absorptance (data herein). In the proposed work, these will be used to arrive at unique, variable emissivity materials with very low solar absorptance. Proposed work includes extensive space durability testing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Once full space durability testing is completed, this technology may take over niche markets such as microsatellites and lunar bases. It also has the potential to displace mechanical louvers and heat pipes in larger spacecraft. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		 Military space uses include space-based radars.  Other military uses which this firm is already pursuing at an advanced stage include battlefield IR camouflage countermeasures. Commercial uses include sunglasses for older patients and displays/billboards. Availability of such a technology will also allow much greater freedom in design of future spacecraft and satellites.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

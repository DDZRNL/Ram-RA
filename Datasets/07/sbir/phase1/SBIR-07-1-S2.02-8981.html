		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		TRS Technologies proposes micromachined single crystal piezoelectric actuator arrays to enable ultra-large stroke, high precision shape control for large aperture, lightweight and cryogenic adaptive optics structures for future NASA Science and communications applications. The proposed concept will advance the state-of-art actuators for deformable mirrors considering the excellent cryogenic properties (with d33 and d31 at 30K similar or higher than that of PZT at room temperature) of single crystal piezoelectrics, large stroke and high actuator density. In this Phase I project, TRS will investigate the feasibility of using micromachined single crystal piezo actuator array for deformable mirrors. Single crystal piezoelectric microactuator arrays will be fabricated and characterized at temperature from 20 K to 300 K. Driving electronics for piezo actuator array, and DM modeling incorporating piezo microactuators will be investigated in Phase I as well. In Phase II, optimized single crystal piezoelectric actuators will be designed, fabricated, characterized and integrated into a deformable mirror structure for full evaluations. <BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Cryogenic actuator arrays with low profile, large stroke and high precision are desired for NASA adaptive optics applications. In particular, the proposed actuator arrays could be used for mirror shape and position control in airborne and space-based interferometers such as geoscience satellites, SIM PlanetQuest, and TPF.  Deformable mirror figure control for large space telescopes such as JWST and SAFIR (CALISTO).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Large stroke, high precision actuator arrays based deformable mirrors are also attractive to DOD adaptive optics programs such as directed energy applications and medical adaptive optics such as retina imaging applications. Apart from adaptive optics applications, large stroke, high precision piezo actuators are also good candidates for active vibration control and structure morphing, RF communication tuning, bio-medical manipulators, photonic tooling, cryogenic microscopy tools, micro/nanofabrication and nanoassembly.

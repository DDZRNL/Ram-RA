		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In situ wind and turbulence measurements play a key role in the support and validation of Earth science missions using spaced-based technology.  NASA has been using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in support of these Earth science missions, but the current UAVs do not have sensor packages to make science quality measurements of parameters including three-dimensional wind, turbulence, temperature, humidity, and pressure.  AeroTech will develop 3-Dimensional Wind and Turbulence Measurement System for UAVs that is based on thermal anemometer technology and that will measure and resolve science quality wind vector and turbulence information throughout the flight envelope.  The System will provide high quality data that will improve NASA's ability to validate, verify, and supplement spaced-based measurements taken during missions.  Phase I will assess the capability of the thermal anemometer sensor portion of the system and finalize the system design.  By the end of Phase II, the prototype system will have been developed, integrated into a UAV, and flight-tested.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		When the goals of the proposed R/R&D are met, the proposed 3-Dimensional Wind and Turbulence Measurement System will provide accurate wind and turbulence measurement capabilities to U.S. Government Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (NASA and its Earth Science partners).  These systems can be used to support a myriad of atmospheric and meteorological studies both related to Earth science and operational applications for aviation usage.  The Suborbital Science Program portion of the Earth Science Directorate is the primary program for the system due to their mission to conduct in-situ atmospheric measurements in support of other Earth Science missions.  The application can also be adapted for planetary study applications for Mars or other planetary vehicles.  Additionally, the system could be useful to research aircraft as an additional instrument or a replacement for the Pitot-Static tube system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The 3D Wind and Turbulence Measurement system will enhance the data collection capabilities of all UAVs and could be particularly useful as research platforms for NOAA (meteorological studies and forecast verification), the US Forest Service for fire fighting applications, and the FAA for airfield wind measurements.  The system could also be adapted for use as an airspeed and angle of attack/side slip sensor with exceptional low speed capability.  This modification could be extremely useful to commercial UAV, general aviation aircraft, business jets, commercial aircraft, helicopters, and military aircraft manufacturers as a replacement for the Pitot-Static tube airspeed sensor, which does not perform well at slow speeds, has measurement limitations in terms of airstream angle relative to the tube, does not provide information on flow angles, and is susceptible to tube blockages resulting in no airspeed measurement.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

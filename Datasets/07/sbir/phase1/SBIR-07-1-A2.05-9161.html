		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The overall objective of the proposed research is to design, develop and demonstrate fluidic actuator arrays for aerodynamic separation control and drag reduction.  These actuators are based on a compact design of low mass-flow fluidic oscillators that produce high frequency (1-5 kHz) oscillating or pulsing jets. Our preliminary experiments on separation control over trailing edge flaps, cavity tones and jet thrust vectoring show great promise for these actuators, the main advantage being that these have no moving parts and hence mechanically robust with a high degree of reliability.  The control authority of these actuators is also high as measured from the velocity amplitude of the exiting jets.  In Phase I of the proposal, we will determine the geometric and dynamic scaling parameters of the fluidic actuators and explore the system integration issues for embedding them into airfoil shapes.  Based on the results from this phase, in Phase II, we will design and develop integrated fluidic actuator systems for 1/10 scale to full-scale testing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed work on flow control can be implemented in the next generation of the Crew Exploration Vehicle designs being developed by NASA.  Such arrays can also be used for de-icing systems using either hot air or de-icing liquids since the fluidic jets work with both liquids and gases.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Aerodynamic flow control has a large number of applications in the commercial and military aerospace industry.  We foresee applications of our technology to separation control over leading and trailing edge of airfoils for high lift and minimum drag configurations for aircraft wings, control of jet exhaust noise in aircraft engines, intake flow control, and internal flows in gas turbines.   <BR><BR>One other area of application we are exploring is the flow control and de-icing over wind turbine blades.<BR>

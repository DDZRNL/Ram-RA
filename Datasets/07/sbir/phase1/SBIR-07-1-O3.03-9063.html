		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The total annual corrosion related costs in the US has been estimated at greater than $300 billion.  Much of these costs are associated with scraping and repainting of metals such as steel structures in the NASA launch platform and related support equipment.  Because of the staggering costs stemming from corrosion of steel infrastructure, there is a tremendous need to develop intelligent coatings that can perform numerous functions above those historically demanded of coatings.  Luna is addressing the need to enhance the service life of NASA vehicles and equipment through a multifunctional coating system.  This research program will develop robust, inexpensive coatings that are i) ultrahydrophobic as a first line of defense to repel water absorption and ii) self healing to replenish coating integrity after damage to yield long term corrosion resistance.  The technology developed on this program will decrease life cycle costs, reduce maintenance, and increase readiness by limiting equipment down-time.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology developed on this program is relevant to any painted metal structures within the NASA program including buildings, vehicles, launch platform, etc.  This novel paint system will reduce corrosion related costs, and increase the lifetime of NASA vehicles and support equipment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This proposed research is part of an overall larger effort and fits well into the strategic focus of Luna.  The ability to form self healing ultrahydrophobic coatings on selected surfaces will have a huge effect on military and commercial applications such as anti-corrosion, chemical and biological warfare defense, marine vessels, and automotive applications.

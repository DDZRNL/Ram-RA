		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Aniuk Consulting, LLC, proposes to create a GIS software toolkit for monitoring areal snow cover extent and producing streamflow forecasts.  This toolkit will be packaged as multiple extensions for ArcGIS 9.2 and provides users with a means for easily ingesting NASA EOS satellite images (for snow cover analysis), preparing hydrologic model inputs, and visualizing streamflow forecasts.  Primary products include: a technique for predicting the presence of snow under clouds in satellite images; a software tool for producing gridded temperature and precipitation forecasts; and a suite of tools for visualizing hydrologic model inputs and results.  The toolkit will be an expert system designed for operational users that need to generate numerous streamflow forecasts accurately and in a timely-fashion without having to hassle with the science and physics behind the hydrologic model. This proposal targets the "Data Analyzing and Processing" research initiative announced by the Goddard Space Flight Center by exploiting spatial tools in order to increase the utility of scientific research data, models, and visualizations.  The beauty of the proposed toolkit is the ability to incorporate hydrologically relevant spatial datasets at the applied, operational level to produce high quality functional products.

		The presence of cloud cover in satellite images can greatly hinder the number of useable, "good" images, especially when a near-daily time-series of images is needed.  We are proposing to develop a methodology and suite of tools for ingesting NASA EOS imagery and predicting, with known accuracy, the presence of snow cover under clouds.  This will increase the number of usable images and, because the tools will essentially be an expert-based system requiring little more than yes, no decisions to be made, even novice users will be able to prepare satellite images for input into hydrologic and environmental models.  NASA benefits because images collected by their satellites will be used in real-world applications to complement water resources decisions, in particular water supply monitoring, streamflow forecasting, and flood warning.  These are high profile natural resources fields that will become increasingly more important as conflicts over water usage continue to build throughout the Northwest, United States.

		<BR>
		We will provide various entities from the national scale to the local scale with a set of tools to perform critical tasks for streamflow forecasting.  Some of these entities include: Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Army Corp of Engineers, state water resources offices, etc.  We will provide operational forecasters and other users, both in the business and academia sectors, with information and training on incorporating satellite images into hydrologic modeling.  Our proposed innovations will assist water resource managers with the estimation of streamflow for reservoir operation, water rights dissemination, fisheries, agricultural needs, and recreation.  The proposed visualization tools will make it easier for the general public to interpret streamflow forecasts and thus improve communication between agencies monitoring water usage and those people using the water.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The primary objective of this SBIR is to develop epitaxial GaN films with threading dislocation density less than 10^6 cm^-2. We propose an innovative approach combining two Pulsed Energy technologies: plasma-energy-controlled Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) to deposit high quality epitaxial GaN films, and in situ Pulsed Energy Annealing to decrease the dislocation density ( to < 10^6 cm-2). Unlike low energetic techniques (such as MBE or CVD), PLD's energetic range of pulsed plasma can be controlled with process parameters, resulting in a wide range of plasma energetic for film deposition. Recently, Neocera fabricated high quality epitaxial GaN films using the plasma-energy-controlled PLD process, resulting in strong photoluminescent emission at room temperature. This approach is further extended in this Phase I, with an in-situ "Pulsed" Energy Annealing, to greatly improve the film crystallinity. The pulsed laser or pulsed electron beam, with 20-50 ns pulse width and high power density (~10^8W/cm^2), induces melting and a rapid epitaxial formation in ~100 nanoseconds, anneling out dislocations. This unique combination of two pulsed energy technologies is expected to provide the most advanced deposition process for epitaxial GaN films with low dislocation density.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High quality GaN films have been deposited on Al2O3 or Si substrates via chemical vapor deposition process.  However, large lattice mismatch between GaN and these substrates causes significant structural imperfections in GaN layers, resulting in the dislocation density of about 10^10 cm-2 that limits the current GaN film technology from applications in RF communications. The proposed approach is expected to result in GaN films with low threading dislocation density, and with an appropriate choice of low microwave-loss substrate, several applications for RF communications are expected to become feasible.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High quality GaN  films  have significant  application potential in optoelectronics, RF communications both in civilian and military markets. The deposition technology developed under this Phase I is generic and is expected to lead to significant market potential for Neocera developed GaN films.

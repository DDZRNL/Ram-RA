		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Analysis of NASA science data is analyzed to understand dynamic systems such as the sun, oceans, and Earth's climate as well as to look back in time to explore the origins of the universe. Complex algorithms and intensive data processing are needed to interpret data over time, at various energy ranges, and at different points in space. Of most interest are innovative interpolation, clustering and registration algorithms which radically increase algorithm efficiency and in turn drastically reduce computational time. Infoscitex (IST) proposes a novel, innovative spatial tool (Octet), which uses an octal tree structure (octree) for data representation, search, processing, and display, and shows dramatic improvements over traditional data analysis, processing and fusion software. Octet is designed specifically for feature isolation, volume and density calculation, collision detection, and data fusion and synthesis. At the end of Phase II, Octet will be a robust, fully-documented software package, using XML to promote interoperability and therefore collaborative research between NASA and other research centers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Some key NASA commercial applications include processing, analysis, registration and fusion of atmospheric, oceanographic, geological, biogeochemical, and population data, as well as analysis of planetary and solar data. Octet's time analysis capabilities allow accurate predictions of events such as weather patterns, human population density shifts, and glacier movement. Interoperability features such as fusion of news events with geographic features may also be possible.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		One principal military application in high demand is data registration and fusion for geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) and surveillance applications. GEOINT involves synthesizing geospatial imagery from a satellite or high-altitude aircraft with information such as battle objectives and descriptions of features of interest (e.g., buildings). An example GEOINT application would be analyzing the construction, size, materials and chemical signatures of a building to determine whether the building is a munitions plant or a hospital. Example surveillance applications include tracking personnel and vehicles near international border regions using visual imagery from surveillance aircraft.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Spacecraft ground systems are on the cusp of achieving "plug-and-play" capability, i.e., they are approaching the state in which the various components can be quickly integrated with near-automatic interoperability.  When properly architected, such systems offer advantages over their traditional counterparts, such as improved upgradeability and extensibility.   They can also be more easily automated and can provide better fault tolerance.  These characteristics are important for all NASA spacecraft, from Exploration to Science.  However, plug-and-play systems also pose some interesting challenges that can undermine their effectiveness.  For example, they can be more complex in terms of information management and system administration.  This is especially true when automation is used to reduce the workload of the operators.  In fact, as the number of components increases, as much "situational awareness" of the ground system is needed the spacecraft.  A software framework that supports plug-and-play integration, while also providing information management and system coordination, is required.  Emergent Space Technologies Inc. therefore proposes to research and develop an Enterprise Management System for spacecraft ground systems.  Called GEMS, it will provide spacecraft controllers and crew members with "situational awareness" of the current state of the ground system as well as understanding of how events and automated actions are affecting the system in real-time.  The innovation lies in the development of algorithms and software adapters that gather data from the various components of the ground system to construct a data model that captures the system state and displays it to the controllers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		GEMS could support any NASA plug-and-play ground system.  Some of these projects could include earth-orbiting satellites, lunar, deep-space, or interplanetary missions.  The key technologies to supporting the ground systems for these different classes of missions are inherently the same.  Some of the particular projects that Emergent already has some involvement with include the SSMO Multi-Mission Operations Center at GSFC, GMSEC, and TRMM.  Some Emergent employees have also worked with the Earth Observing System (EOS) missions in the past.  Current and future missions that could be targeted include lunar missions such as LRO and all of Project Constellation, beginning with Orion.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Emergent is supporting some commercial clients like Intelsat and Lockheed Martin.  Support for Intelsat currently includes the integration of the Panamsat fleet flight dynamics system, overall system improvements, and automation support.  Results of the SBIR Phase 1 task could be applied directly to the work being done at Intelsat.  Emergent is also providing navigation system support to Lockheed Martin for the NOAA GOES-R satellite mission.  We have identified that there is a significant need for ground system development support for GOES-R.  Other potential commercial customers and projects to target could include Boeing Iridium, GeoEye, and others.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

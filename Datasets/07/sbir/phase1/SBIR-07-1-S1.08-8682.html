		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Remote chemical analysis via spectroscopy is an important tool in the arsenal or Earth and Planetary Science. Grating technology, which is the centerpiece of most modern spectroscopy systems, has not change significantly in the last 60 years since introduction of holographic gratings. Recently LightSmyth introduced new technology for design and fabrication of diffraction grating elements based on projection photolithography using state-of-the-art semiconductor industry tools. This opened a pathway for very powerful grating elements enabling new class of spectroscopy instruments. <BR><BR>LightSmyth Technologies proposes to utilize its recently introduced innovative Diffraction Grating Array to demonstrate robust ultra-compact multi-channel spectrometer with athermal stress-proof self-calibration suitable for deployment at the orbit as well as UAV, USV and UUV platforms. The main advantages of the instrument is up to 100 times improvement in diffraction efficiency, low mass, small footprint, absence of moving parts, robustness, wide spectral range coverage with high resolution and athermal self-calibration for accurate determination of absolute spectrum wavelengths. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Measurements of chemical composition of atmosphere, planetary surface and oceans using solar irradiance measurements, Earthshine measurements, Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy, absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. Improvement in remote sensors involved with TC4, ARCTAS, OCO-2008, GOME, SCIAMACHY, OMI, Mars  Science Laboratory, Phoenix Mars Polar Lander, Moon Mineralogy Mappers and others.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Wide range of high efficiency imaging and non-imaging spectrometers requiring high resolution in multiple, possibly non-consecutive spectral bands may be introduced based on the proposed prototype. Many medical, industrial and military applications using spectroscopy may benefit from increase in sensitivity, spectral range and resolution offered by the proposed spectrometer platform. Fluorescent spectrometers used in food industry and medical research, atomic emission spectrometers used in industrial metal alloy analysis, hand-held absorption spectrometer units used to measure air pollution are few examples. Other areas are detection of explosives, biohazardous materials, toxic matters in soils and waters and lead in paint.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed project will investigate the feasibility of utilizing ThinKom's low cost electronically scanned array (ESA) antenna concepts to enable affordable airborne hazard detection and avoidance radar systems with greatly enhanced performance relative to those currently deployed. This technology is comprised of a unique integrated feed/phase shifter/radiator topology that can be realized using very low cost manufacturing techniques and COTS electronics. Although it utilizes a densely spaced array of discrete radiators that allows the "grating lobe free" operation of traditional high cost phased arrays, the architecture is amenable to "quasi-monolithic" construction from a small number of inexpensive parts. It also enables the use of a highly reliable, low cost, low power consumption beam steering controller. The estimated total loss through the feed, phase shifter, and radiator is less than 1 dB at X-Band. The Phase I program will focus on creating a design for a small proof-of-concept (POC) ESA, and on doing a hardware demonstration of the phase shifter architecture. When fabricated under a Phase II program the POC unit will demonstrate the revolutionary cost reduction potential of this technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology is useful for a broad variety of radar and communication applications that are of interest to NASA. In addition to aviation hazard detection, other relevant radar applications include ground mapping, atmospheric studies, and launch range surveillance. Regarding RF communication, it is potentially useful whenever a highly directional steerable beam is required. This includes many distinct "on-the-move" communication systems.

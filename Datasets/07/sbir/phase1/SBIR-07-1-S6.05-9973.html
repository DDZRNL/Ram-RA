		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<BR>The physical world around us is three-dimensional (3D), yet most existing display systems with flat screens can handle only two-dimensional (2D) flat images that lack the third dimension (depth) information.  This fundamental restriction greatly limits the capability of human being in perceiving and visualizing the complexity of real world objects. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this Phase 1 SBIR is to develop a novel high-resolution volumetric 3D display system that has a static solid crystal screen. In contrast to conventional 3D visualization based on 2D flat screen, the "volumetric 3D display" we proposed herein possesses a true 3D display volume, has a 360 degree look-around group viewing capability, and allows a group of viewers to simultaneously view and analyze 3D data without wearing any special viewing goggle.  It provides both physiological and psychological depth cues to human visual system to perceive 3D objects and is considered as the Holy Grail solution to 3D visualization of many NASA datasets that inherently are extremely large, complicated, and multi-dimensional.  <BR><BR>Although we successfully developed various volumetric 3D display systems in the past, most these previously developed systems generate their 3D display volume by a large size moving screen that rotates constantly at a speed of 600~1800 RPM. The structure of a moving screen dramatically complicates the design, production, use, and maintenance of the display system, making it very delicate and fragile for daily uses for NASA visualization work on earth.  Due to the existence of a large moving parts, such volumetric 3D display technology is certainly not suitable for on-board uses in space missions.  <BR><BR>This SBIR program will investigate the feasibility of a technology breakthrough recently made by Xigen LLC and developed a revolutionary new concept of volumetric 3D display, which totally eliminates any moving screen. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		<BR>A true 3D volumetric display device would literally add a new dimension to the advanced human/computer interface, and provides visualizations of many NASA datasets that are extremely large, complicated, and multi-dimensional.  Examples include multi-spectrum image dataset acquired by satellites, simulation results of man-rated space flight vehicle entry, visualizations of distant planet topography, and 3D visualizations of coupled ocean and weather systems.   <BR><BR>The proposed volumetric 3D display technique would provide 3D virtual reality environments for scientific data visualization that eliminate the need for special user devices like goggles or helmets.  <BR><BR>Due to the complexity of NASA data analysis and visualization requirements, the ability to provide sharable three-dimensional visualization and measurement would significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of decision making, validation, and collaborative development environment. The proposed volumetric 3D display system provide a novel tool for data viewing, real-time data browse, and general purpose rendering of multivariate geospatial scientific data sets that use geo-rectification, data overlays, data reduction, and data encoding across widely differing data types and formats.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		<BR>The volumetric 3D display is a fundamental technological breakthrough that could change the way human being viewing complex information, thus has profound impact on the society advancement. The unique advantages of the proposed static screen volumetric 3D display technology include:<BR> * No moving screen;<BR> * Inherent parallel mechanism for 3D voxel addressing; <BR> * High spatial resolution;<BR> * Full color display is easy to implement <BR> * Fine voxel size (at a sub-millimeter level); <BR> * No blind spot on the display volume and the display volume can be of arbitrary shape. <BR> * Simple and elegant system structure design;<BR> * No special viewing glasses or any special eyewear is needed to view the 3D images;<BR> * No image jitter affect that is associated with moving screen;<BR> * Low-cost and low-maintenance. <BR><BR>The market for volumetric 3D display systems is sizable, and applications are enormous, including both military (e.g. air traffic control, battle management, space vehicle and submarine navigation, telemedicine in battle field) and commercial (e.g., 3D TV, virtual reality, computer aided design, visualization of multidimensional data, medical imaging, surgery assistance, education, scientific computing, video games, stadium displays, etc.)  The 3D display systems will provide a new level of realism and literally add a new dimension to the dynamic interaction between human and the world around us.<BR>

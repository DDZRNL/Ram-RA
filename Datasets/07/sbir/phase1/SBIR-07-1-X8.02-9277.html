		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		TIAX proposes to develop as a novel negative electrode active material for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. This material will fill the gap between the state-of-the-art high energy density (e.g. graphitic carbon or amorphous tin-carbon composite) and high charging rate capability (e.g. nano-Li4Ti5O12) anode materials. The novel anode material will have specific capacity of 625 mAh/g and electrochemical potential of ~0.9 V vs. Li, making it capable of meeting NASA battery energy target of 180 Wh/kg.  The mechanism of its electrochemical cycling will be by zero-strain topotactic lithiation/delithiation, making it capable of meeting NASA's requirements for cycle life and for rapid recharge capability.  This novel anode material will provide for lithium-ion batteries having enhanced safety by virtue of its being non-toxic and having low thermal reactivity.  Furthermore, the use of this novel anode chemistry will enable the implementation of other lithium-ion battery system enhancements, such as improved electrolytes.  The Phase I program will demonstrate synthesis of the targeted material composition in the desired structure, and will demonstrate electrochemical performance of that material.  Correlations between physical, structural and electrochemical properties of this novel anode material will be investigated through the course the program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries incorporating the proposed novel anode are expected to become the primary regenerative electrical energy storage technology for a broad spectrum of NASA space exploration platforms including spacecraft, landers, rovers and other vehicles, astronaut equipment and stationary units.  Lithium-ion batteries already possess the outstanding high specific energy required for NASA applications, and further improving their charge rate capability and their life charging rate capability will make them even more competitive in NASA applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There will be significant market opportunities for the TIAX rapid recharge, high energy, long life Li-ion battery anode technology beyond those presented by the NASA's needs for advanced batteries in space exploration platforms.  The emerging commercial sector HEV and future PHEV applications will place the same demands for rapid recharge, long life and safety on Li-ion technology as do the NASA's space exploration applications, and if the TIAX technology is successful it will be highly valued in HEVs.  Enhanced charging rate capability will also make the novel TIAX anode attractive for use in lithium-ion batteries for power tools.  Thus the technology's potential for use in the broader commercial sector that will help to drive its development and to facilitate its availability and drive down its cost for use in space applications.

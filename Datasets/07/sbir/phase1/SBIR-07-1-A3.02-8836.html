		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal addresses the concept of Collaborative Outbound Taxi Metering (COTM), which provides environmental benefits without sacrificing throughput.  In current operations, departure flights must block out of their parking gates to claim their first-come, first-served departure slot.  When departure demand exceeds capacity, flights experience delay in departure queues near the runway.  The need for flights to make incremental steps in the queue significantly increases the engine emissions produced because of the number of times aircraft must apply 'break-away' power, only to stop again after moving just a short distance.  Under the COTM concept, metering techniques assign and maintain departure slots for all departure flights even if aircraft remain at their parking gates.  Mosaic ATM has conducted initial analysis using historical operational data demonstrating the potential environmental benefits even in the presence of arrival flights requiring parking gates.  This concept has already been applied and shown significant benefits during over-night operations of air cargo carriers.  Implementing the concept across the entire NAS has not been possible due to the requirement to coordinate departure metering amongst multiple airport users.  We propose to further demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the COTM concept at large hub airports.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential applications for the research results beyond Phase 2 include uses by NASA for continued research and by the FAA and airports/air carriers.  Moreover, research results may guide other airportal management projects by providing valuable understanding of environmental issues and how surface management decisions effects them.  The proposed SBIR is focused primarily towards answering a research question of interest to NASA.  The problem being studied is an example of the basic research needed into the interaction of airportal management and environmental metrics.  The project will leave NASA with a new capability to study airportal environmental issues within the SODAA tool which NASA already uses for other airportal research.  With environmental considerations becoming increasingly important to the FAA, airports, air carriers, and internationally, this capability will allow NASA to remain at the forefront of airportal research and provide relevant and valuable research results to guide NextGen development.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		FAA, university, and airport authorities may be equally interested in the developed airportal environmental analysis capability.  Other potential Non-NASA applications are centered on the evolution of the research into a NAS-wide (or NextGen) system.  The FAA is the most likely customer to continue this work beyond Phase 2.  Commercialization and Phase 3 activities involve further development of the COTM implementation begun in Phases 1 and 2 and the conduct of field trials at one or more airports where the operational concept and procedures may be refined and actual benefits may be measured.  Mosaic ATM has conducted field trials of this type previously with other automation tools and concepts.  Airport authorities are expected to be interested in this technology, both domestically and internationally.

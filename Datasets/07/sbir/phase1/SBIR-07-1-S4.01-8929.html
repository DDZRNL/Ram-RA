		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The innovation proposed here addresses the testing and evaluation of wireless networking technologies for small launch vehicles by leveraging existing nanosat launch vehicle (NLV) development to create a dedicated wireless technologies testbed that can enter flight during Phase I.  <BR><BR>The Phase I research goal is to establish a technical readiness level (TRL) of 6 for internal vehicle wireless networking using ZIGBEE and/or its equivalent, particularly for sensor networks, stage-to-stage and vehicle-payload interfaces, as well as demonstrate vehicle-to-ground network communications using WIMAX.  Subsequent Phase II research would focus on increasing the TRL to 7 by improving the performance of the test vehicle to expand the flight envelope while working with partners and suppliers to tailor their hardware to space applications.<BR><BR>Such an aggressive Phase I work plan is possible due to our team's ongoing NLV R/R&D that is presently funded by the Air Force along with several civilian and commercial launch service customers.   The long term goal of this initiative, which is characterized by extensive flight testing, is to provide a dedicated, domestic launch capability of 10 kg to low Earth orbit.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Successful validation of a TRL of 7 or greater for wireless networking technologies can be expected to lead to their immediate utilization in our next round of NLV test vehicles along with a variety of small satellite applications, which in turn will prepare for the next step to a TRL of 8 and 9.  <BR><BR>At that point, advanced wireless networking will then become a strong candidate for stage-to-stage interfaces in future multi-element launch systems, enhanced accommodations for manifesting multiple payloads and  intelligent on-board communciations as well as satellite-to-satellite communication using machine-to-machine (M2M) solutions for free-flying constellations and Space Station proximity operations.  In the longer term, they should be see extensive application in surface exploration operations on the Moon and Mars.

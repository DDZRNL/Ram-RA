		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		IAI  proposes to develop a reconfigurable L-band radar transceiver module. The emphasis will be to implement most of critical radar functionalities like:<BR><BR>	Baseband modulation signals<BR>	Orthogonal high frequency pseudo random codes for pulse compression<BR>	Direct Digital synthesis (DDS) or numerically controlled oscillators (NCO) for generating RF carrier reference signal <BR>	DDS driven Frequency sweep for FMCW (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) radar functionality<BR>	Sigma-Delta technique to direct carrier synthesis<BR>	Received signal processing to generate I/ Q components <BR><BR>on a single embedded platform. Such a platform will be a combination of high speed DSP and FPGA on one board. This will considerably reduce the component count and form factor for a radar transceiver design. By simply programming an FPGA with a different "bitstream" file, we can control the radar functionality as pulse modulated or frequency modulated. This work will be synergistic with ongoing efforts at IAI, which involves L-band radar design. Advantages of such a system are:<BR><BR>&#9679; Reconfigurable radar transceiver, not just in operational bandwidth/ carrier, but   also in modulation (pulsed/ frequency swept)<BR>&#9679; Low form factor<BR>&#9679; Low power consumption<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology is built upon the radar design and communications expertise of IAI, developed over several SBIR and non-SBIR contracts. Our innovation is the digital synthesis of critical radar blocks and reconfigurable design to support most commonly used radar modes.<BR>Our proposed technique can be used for a wide range of remote sensing applications for NASA including:<BR><BR>	High bandwidth channel sounders<BR>	Weather surveillance radar for aircrafts<BR>	Earth science measurements like surface deformation, topography and soil moisture measurements<BR>	Non-cooperative target tracking radar in air space<BR><BR>IAI has a long history of successfully designing custom radars for DoD and NASA, and most NASA applications could be supported by our reconfigurable radar design. <BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The most promising Non- NASA commercial applications are:<BR><BR>	Reconfigurable radar for commercial applications<BR>	Digital waveform generation <BR>	High speed digital waveform reader<BR>	UAV based applications (due to the small form factor and plow power). This would include UAV based weather surveillance, target tracking and other commonly sought after UAV radar applications<BR><BR>IAI has tremendous experience of designing customized radar assembly and packaging them as field-ready units. Again, if technically the project is successful, we will approach large, established companies in this market segment with the goal of licensing our technology and possible collaboration for Phase II efforts.<BR>

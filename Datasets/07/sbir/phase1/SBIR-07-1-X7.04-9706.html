		<BR>
		The severity of the lunar dust problems encountered during the Apollo missions were consistently underestimated by ground tests, illustrating the need to develop significantly better lunar dust simulants and simulation facilities. ORBITEC proposes to develop a family of High-Fidelity Lunar Dust Simulants that will better match the unique properties of lunar dust than existing simulants (such as JSC-1AF). Current lunar dust simulants do not have enough of the very fine particles, and they lack the agglutinitic glass and complex surface textures that dominate lunar dust. The proposed family of High-Fidelity Lunar Dust Simulants will approximate the size, morphology, composition, and other important properties of lunar dust. High-Fidelity Lunar Dust Simulants are required to physically evaluate the effects of lunar dust on the operation of all Exploration Surface Systems and to verify the effectiveness of dust mitigation strategies and technologies. The proposed Phase 1 effort will define requirements, develop, characterize, and deliver a sample of a prototype lunar dust simulant to NASA (TRL 4). The Phase 2 effort will refine the production process to create a large quantity of lunar dust simulant that will be characterized and delivered to NASA (TRL 6).

		High-fidelity lunar dust simulants are required to physically evaluate the effects of lunar dust on the operation of all Exploration Surface Systems.  Accurate lunar dust simulants will be needed to verify the effectiveness of dust mitigation strategies and technologies for extravehicular mobility suit material composition and cleaning operations, lunar habitat construction design, mechanical performance (radiators, seals, valves), electrical performance (tools and equipment), landing operations (vision systems), and all manners of surface operations.  Since this simulant will also contain the critical metallic iron component (including "nanophase" iron) along with the morphology of true lunar dust, it will also be applicable to human health and toxicity studies.

		<BR>
		The development of High-fidelity Lunar Dust Simulants is clearly focused on supporting the needs of the NASA lunar exploration program.  However, industry and research institutions that are developing any EVA equipment for use on the lunar surface will require the High-Fidelity Lunar Dust Simulant.  Much of this work in the near future will be under NASA contracts.  Longer term, private industry plans to develop a variety of EVA equipment for use on the lunar surface.  High-Fidelity Lunar Dust Simulants are required to physically evaluate the effects of lunar dust on the operation of all Exploration Surface Systems and to verify the effectiveness of dust mitigation strategies and technologies.

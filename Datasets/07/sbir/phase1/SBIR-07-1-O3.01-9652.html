		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose an alternative to using Microsoft Word for representing medical procedures that will make the procedures easier to construct and maintain, particularly when there are changes to the hardware or changes to the resulting format of the procedure. We call this alternative an "electronic procedure". Rather than a text-based document, this content-based document separates the text from the formatting standards and tags items contained in the procedure so that they can be recognized by other electronic systems. <BR>If a standard format changes, a reference to that format is updated. The electronic procedures can be re-converted in a single batch process, and the entire body of procedures will have the new format. Changes to hardware can be made in a similar manner, where changing a piece of hardware in a procedure will change all references to it in that procedure. <BR>Switching to this new representation offers many short and long-term benefits, which we describe herein. We have already demonstrated the use of electronic procedures for modeling ISS operational procedures (and in modeling one ISS medical procedure). We hope to extend this work into the medical operations field so we can demonstrate how medical procedures can benefit from this technology.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Electronic Procedure for Medical Operations will provide significant benefits to the Life Sciences division and space vehicle crews. The proposed technologies will provide significant new functionality to the medical operations at a reasonable cost in time and manpower.  Electronic procedures will enable the programs to improve the comprehension and delivery of medical procedures to the flight medical officers and the crew, and will enable a greater degree of coordination with the flight surgeons and biomedical engineers on the ground. Finally, electronic procedures will open the door to potentially groundbreaking applications in the future, leading eventually to a complete automated medical decision support system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Electronic Procedures for Medical Operations provide a long-term potential that is enormous. Currently health care accounts for a significant fraction of the gross domestic product of the USA. In the short term, it is extremely difficult and costly to overcome the regulatory hurdles necessary to introduce a new product into the health care market. Furthermore, some of the technology that is being proposed here is very advanced and requires significant innovation and development before it will be ready for market. On the other hand, in the long term, it is very difficult to see the current US health care situation continuing without change for many more decades, and technology is proceeding. S&K Aerospace can clearly see that Electronic Procedures for Medical Operations has a potential to make an impact in a multi-billion dollar market.<BR>

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

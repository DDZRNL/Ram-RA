		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We design and develope a Decision Support Tool (DST) that supports On-Demand Special Use Airspace (SUA) scheduling and flight plan optimization around SUA between Airline Operations Control (AOC), Military, Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC), and Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) personnel.  The tool allows AOC and ARTCC Traffic Management Unit (TMU) personnel to coordinate strategic and tactical plans, with a strategic look ahead time from days to less than 2 hours, and tactical plans up to the minute centered locally around an ARTCC airspace.  The tool coordinates aircraft movement though vs around SUA.  The tool allows for asynchronous communication of priorities associated with flight plans and flight plan amendments (contingency plans) between the AOC and ARTCC TMU specialist, allowing the ATCSCC and Military to view these priorities and TMU responses to them at any time.  This technology will be developed to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 by the end of Phase I, and TRL 4 prototype system by the end of Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed tool has application in Air Traffic Management Research to study Dynamic Airspace Configuration (DAC) changes due to SUA usage, and automated Traffic Flow Management (TFM) solutions.  The tool may be included into NASA's FACET or ACES simulation environment for benefits studies, or in real-time simulations to study how the Military and Air Traffic Control may collaborate in the future.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed tool has application to military operations for wartime and non-wartime activity.  In wartime, the competition for airspace resources can be controlled in a collaborative solution by our tool.  In non-wartime civilian airspace, the proposed tool has an application in the management of SUA activity in the NAS, allowing the military to coordinate the activation and de-activation of SUA in collaboration with the FAA.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

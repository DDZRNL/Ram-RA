		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		M4 Engineering proposes the development of an adaptive structural mode control system.  The adaptive control system will begin from a "baseline" dynamic model of the system, which will be updated as the system is operated.  This allows the control inputs to be tailored to the observed behavior of the system across a range of flight conditions, weight conditions, and failure conditions, while accounting for uncertainty in structural dynamics and aerodynamics.  The development of the adaptive control system involves a selection of a set of adaptive control algorithms, which will then be implemented and tested on a set of example problems.  The performance of the algorithms will be evaluated and additional development and enhancements will be subsequently recommended.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are numerous potential NASA applications.  The first is the ASM wind tunnel test being funded under the supersonics task of the ARMD program.  This provides a unique opportunity to validate the SBIR technology on a realistic configuration, and also provides a much-needed control law design to the ASM test program.  Applications of this technology to future flight test programs and future vehicle development efforts are also anticipated.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Development of ASE control laws for flight vehicles using conventional methods is frightfully expensive.  If adaptive methods can be shown to be robust, reliable, and to offer good performance without the extensive aerodynamic/ASE database development and the complex gain scheduling required of conventional flight control systems, this offers a dramatic reduction in development costs.  As such, if successful, this technology will result in extensive application to commercial vehicles ranging from small UAV's to commercial airliners to military weapon systems.  M4 Engineering has active relationships with several prime contractors who are likely users of this technology.  These include Boeing Phantom Works, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon.  These provide excellent commercialization opportunities for the technology.  Active marketing to prime contractors and other specialty airframers (e.g., Aerovironment, General Atomics, etc.) will follow these applications.

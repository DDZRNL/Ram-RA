		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes are excellent tools in optimizing telemetry data integrity within the limited space to ground RF spectrum available for today's and tomorrow's satellite systems. <BR><BR>All ten of the LDPC codes called out in the CCSDS Orange Book CCSDS 131.1-O-1 are potentially powerful tools for space to ground communications link optimization for future near-Earth and deep-space science and exploration missions.<BR><BR>With this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), RT Logic will endeavor to inventory and understand the 10 LDPC codes defined in CCSDS 131.1-O-1, to prototype a single Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based LDPC decoder that can potentially be the core of the 10 LDPC decoders, verify the FPGA prototype of the general purpose LDPC core using a comprehensive Very High-Speed Intgrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) test suite and characterize the design for implementation into a Commerical-off-the-shelf (COTS) high data rate receiver.<BR><BR>In Phase II, all of the 10 LDPC codes would be implemented into RT Logic's COTS high rate receiver in order to make the LDPC FEC schemes readily available to NASA, other Civil, the Department of Defense and commerical customers for use on their future space programs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Many NASA satellite and launch vehicle programs that support remote sensing, data relay, lunar exploration and deep-space communications are slated for the coming years and all have needs for high-rate space to ground communications. COTS high data-rate receivers are projected to be required to support these missions and having the 10 CCSDS defined LDPC codes as part of a COTS high data rate receiver product could save NASA significant expense.  <BR><BR>Cost savings would be recognized as NASA avoids costly custom implementations that potentially have little chance of reuse or re-configurability.  Also, these LDPC capable receivers will allow for the optimum use of downlink/uplink communications bandwidth for NASA programs with minimal cost impact.  This optimization can result in reduced power requirements on the satellite or launch vehicle, reduced weight in the satellite or launch vehicle and smaller aperture antennas on both the space platforms and ground stations.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are many commercial programs supporting remote sensing and data relay applications and high data-rate receivers with the CCSDS defined LDPC Codes could also be used by their users to improve satellite and launch vehicle space to ground communications links.  The commercial customer would also avoid the cost of custom implementations and enjoy the advantages of higher data rates for telemetry with lower bit-error rates over all.  <BR>

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

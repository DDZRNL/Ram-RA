		<BR>
		As manned-space exploration missions are pursued further beyond low-Earth orbit, such as to the Moon or Mars, crewmembers must be supplied with good quality food to provide a complete diet over a period of three years or more. Current food-packaging materials result in major solid-waste management issues. Novel food packaging materials that will eliminate or reduce solid waste while preserving the quality of the food are required for long-term space travel and stay.  Materials Modification, Inc. (MMI) proposes to develop a biodegradable packaging material that can be used to transport and store foodstuff during extended space travel and stay.  A nanocomposite will be developed that will be mechanically strong, resistant to microbes and possess good barrier properties during period of use, biodegradable beyond the useful period, and microwave-safe.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

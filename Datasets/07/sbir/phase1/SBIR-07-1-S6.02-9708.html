		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Scientists need to be able to quickly develop and run parallel simulations without paying the high price of writing low-level message passing codes using compiled languages such as C/C++/Fortran.  <BR>This is especially true of students and researchers who are expert scientists in their field but don't have the time or resources to become experts in parallel computing.<BR><BR>This proposal will enable scientists to rapidly create parallel simulations by providing parallel building blocks in the high-level programming language Python.  The building blocks themselves, such as distributed arrays, parallel linear algebra, parallel Fourier transforms and parallel statistical algorithms, will be implemented by leveraging existing high-performance libraries and creating high-level Python objects that completely hide the details of the underlying libraries and parallelism from users. The building blocks will be developed as part of the open source IPython project, which will enable users to develop, debug and run parallel simulations in a completely interactive manner, similar to Matlab or IDL.<BR><BR>The anticipated Phase I result will be the demonstration of an interactive parallel simulation utilizing prototype building blocks on a commodity Linux cluster. Phase II will result in a production quality demonstration on a NASA supercomputer.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The open source tools created in this project will be useful for any NASA scientist or engineer needing to harness the power of parallel hardware for simulation and data analysis.  The tools will enable such users to quickly create parallel simulations and run them interactively on any parallel hardware including multi-core laptops, Linux clusters and supercomputers.  NASA's parallel computing resources will be accessible to a larger number of users, who be able to develop parallel applications without becoming experts in the low-level details of parallel computing.<BR><BR>Users of NASA's PyRAF astronomical data analysis package will benefit in a direct way as the tools will bring high-level parallel capabilities to PyRAF. Because the tools will be completely general, other Python based software within NASA will also be able to take advantage of the technologies with little effort.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Many areas of research in academia, non-NASA government labs and industry require parallel computing to perform large scale simulations and analyze data sets.  Often, the need to utilize parallel hardware in these sectors outpaces users' abilities to develop parallel codes.  This project will enable a much wider range of users to develop and perform parallel computations.   Users of existing tools such as Matlab, IDL and Mathematica, will find the development environment and interfaces developed in this project familiar and easy to use.<BR><BR>Particular industries that will benefit from these tools include quantitative finance, data-mining and oil and gas.  Likewise computationally focused academic researchers in physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics and engineering will also immediately be able to take advantage of the innovations.<BR>

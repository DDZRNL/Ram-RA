		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Every day, turbulence has an adverse effect on aircraft operations and capacity of the NAS, costing the airline industry at least $100 million annually in delays, operational inefficiencies, and injuries.  There is a need to research and develop traffic flow and ATM methods that mitigate the turbulence impact to NAS operations, but turbulence is poorly represented in current airspace simulation and planning tools.  AeroTech proposes to improve these tools and therefore airspace operations by developing and integrating an ATM Turbulence Impact Module (ATM-TIM) into FACET and/or ACES.  The module will enable researchers and planners to identify and assess the impact of actual turbulence in the NAS and examine performance capability of new ATM methods with turbulence present.  A key enhancement will be the incorporation of a turbulence dimension into the ATM Weather Impact Model that enables the modeling of the impact of convective and clear air turbulence.  Phase I will develop the enhanced ATM weather impact model, investigate the integration of ATM-TIM components into the simulation tools, and perform a proof of concept study.  By Phase III, the integrated ATM-TIM will improve planners understanding of turbulence's impact on ATM and assist in evaluating new TFM ideas in a turbulent NAS.

		<BR>
		When the goals of the proposed R/R&D are met, the ATM Turbulence Impact Module will be supportive of NASA's NGATS Airspace program's goal to "develop methodologies and techniques to minimize or solve the demand/capacity imbalance problem in the NGATS future."  The ATM-TIM will support level 1 and 2 research areas in Traffic Flow Management, Separation Assurance, Performance Based Services, and System-Level Simulation Tools by improving traffic flow simulation tools through integration of turbulence information and ability to assess the impact of convective turbulence and CAT, enabling the assessment of new NGATS technologies and trajectory based operations principles against an ATM Weather Impact Model that incorporates turbulence, enabling the exploration of performance based operations based on aircraft equipped with improved turbulence detection and awareness systems, and enabling the development and testing of new TFM techniques within a NAS that includes turbulence constraints.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		AeroTech's ATM Turbulence Impact Module for FACET and/or ACES will provide the FAA and Joint Planning and Development Office a capability to examine NextGen capacity and throughput issues due to turbulence within the NAS, and assess the requirements for future turbulence detection and forecasting capabilities.  Additionally they will be able to investigate and assess performance-based operations in NextGen based on new turbulence detection and awareness systems.  The addition of the turbulence dimension to the ATM Weather Impact Model will provide higher educational institutions and research organizations the opportunity to revise and develop new TFM techniques and research convective and clear air turbulence impacts on NAS operations.  Real-time application of the ATM-TIM in FACET could assist ATCSCC and airline operations centers in optimal flight planning and routing through improved turbulence awareness.  The improved routing could result in reductions in delays and fuel savings, improved safety, and overall smoother NAS operations.

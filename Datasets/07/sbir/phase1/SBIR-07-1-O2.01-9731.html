		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address the NASA need for innovative optical technique for visualization and tracking of space vehicles during launch and landing operations, Light Prescriptions Innovators, LLC proposes to develop a Hyperspectral Imager - Tracker. The Hyperspectral Imager - Tracker architecture is based on an innovative and only recently developed concept in imaging optics. This innovative architecture will give the LPI Hyperspectral Imager - Tracker the possibility of simultaneously collecting the spectral band images (hyperspectral cube) to operate with high light-gathering power and high magnification. The innovative Adaptive Spectral Filtering algorithms will efficiently increase the contrast of low contrast scenes. In phase I LPI will analyze the device design for its spectral filtering and imaging efficiency and assemble and test a proof-of-concept prototype to demonstrate feasibility. In Phase II a full scale engineering prototype will be developed and tested.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA applications include an innovative optical imager - tracker for space vehicle tracking and in flight inspection during the launch and landing operations, as well as an innovative hyperspectral imager for earth observation from space in a number of civilian and academic programs
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA applications include advanced hyperspectral imagers for detection and visualization of camouflaged targets for Department of Defense applications. Such hyperscopes can be used by the Coast Guard, Border Patrol, Law Enforcement and other departments.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The concept development and test of a water-based, advanced Phase Change Material (PCM) heat sink is proposed.  Utilizing a novel material choice for both an expansion diaphragm and the PCM case itself, the PCM can accommodate both the expansion of the freezing water-based material and very low temperature of approximately -250F.  The water-based PCM itself would be non-toxic and non-flammable, but additives will be included to preclude deterioration of wither the PCM container or the diaphragm material.  The use of a water-based PCM gives the highest heat capacity for the mass.  This is highly limited due to the needs for portability as required for an Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA). The total heat capacity of an operational unit would be for full duration EVA use.   Through a logical progression of tasks including concept of operation formulation, requirements formulation, concept design reviews and detail design reviews that include design and thermal analysis using Thermal Desktop<SUP>TM</SUP> models, this effort can progress from TRL 2 to TRL 3. The team will confirm the robust choice of diaphragm materials, the choice of casing material and the choice of the additives to the water used for the PCM. The PCM will be tested to confirm heat input/temperature performance and cycling capability.  The test bed will allow for accurate heat input knowledge, temperature monitoring and cycling capability.  The results will be compared to the thermal model to ensure accurate prediction capability for the next phase full-scale unit. The design description and test results would form the basis of the final report.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The purpose of this SBIR is to address the need as identified within the NASA SBIR solicitation under X4.02 "Space Suite Life Support Systems" and, to wit, "..a non-toxic, non-flammable, super cooled below 32<SUP>o</SUP>F phase change material that can absorb metabolic heat for an 8 hour duration.  Hence, the primary application will be for the purpose of providing this heat rejecton capability in a compact, reliable form for the utlizaton within a PLSS.  However, the application of this technology may go well beyond this to:<BR><BR>1)  	PCM utilization within the emerging Orion vehicle design.  <BR>2)  	PCM utilization within the future Lunar Surface Access Module design<BR>3) 	PCM ulitization within any lunar surface habitat<BR><BR>Each of these potential NASA applications could be augmented, and perhaps greatly enhanced via the use of the high heat capacity and heat of fusion of water.  In the case of the lunar vehicles or habitats, the access to a thermal environment that is very low (Shakelton crater region on the moon) will allow for quick regeneration.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are multiple industries within the commercial sector that could use a cooling system that is portable and robust.  In Paragon's experience, our Navy work has exposed us to the critical needs of Navy Seals for underwater cooling during vigorous littoral operations.  Other commercial sectors that may be interested in this technology would be the mining industry, the firefighting equipment industry, the commercial warm-water diving industry, and the chemical/biological hazard suit industry.  Each of these have a similar theme of an enclosed person generating substantial metabolic load as well as experiencing environments where the rejection of heat through passive convection and radiation is not possible.

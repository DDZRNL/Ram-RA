		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR Phase I proposal describes development of a conceptual design for a High-range Scalar Helium Magnetometer (HSHM) for the field range +/-16 Gauss. The HSHM conceptual design will establish the feasibility of a model brass-board HSHM in Phase II. The HSHM instrument is capable of making scalar measurements of Earth and planetary magnetic fields over a range of +/-16 G using a digital resonance loop design already demonstrated in the Juno SHM instrument. The major HSHM design innovation is use of a new fiber-coupled laser pump-source and resonance drive. The laser pump-source permits miniaturization of the sensor unit by eliminating three helium lamps and a helium cell, as well as the resonance RF drive cables and RF resonance coils at the sensor. This innovation permits reduction of the sensor volume by a factor of 10 while decreasing sensor power and mass. The HSHM can achieve a scalar accuracy of 1 nT, and sensitivity of 5 pT/©Hz. The Phase I conceptual design will guide the design and fabrication of a brass-board HSHM model using advanced laser and digital components in Phase II. A test and calibration protocol will be developed for the HSHM calibration in Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		- The HSHM will have a variety of commercial and military applications including measurement of the magnetic fields around the Earth in support of monitoring the solar magnetic field activities for telecommunication applications and climate change predictions. The HSHM will be used at the Earth's surface for geophysical airborne and surface magnetic prospecting as well as the new standard for geomagnetic observatories. The laser-pumped scalar helium magnetometer technology is currently being developed for high sensitivity magnetometers to be used by the US Navy for submarine detection and mine counter-measures applications. The HSHM characteristics of outstanding scalar accuracy, omni-directionality (no dead zones), and high-frequency signal response will open up a variety of applications in commercial security and surveillance applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Laser magnetometers can become the new state-of-the-art instrument for magnetic observatories and scientific instrumentation for geomagnetic investigations. A combination of absolute accuracy, greatly improved sensitivity, omni-directionality, and high frequency detection could also open up new applications for portable magnetometers.

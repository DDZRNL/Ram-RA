		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced microcontrollers having digital signal processing features have enabled the capability to distribute on-board computation for remotely operated vehicles (ROVs).  Distributed processing can result in a lighter weight avionics suite with improved performance, by locating data conversion units adjacent to the sensors and control actuators, and reducing EMI through minimization of the amount of interconnection wiring.  The proposed work will leverage CDI's and AMDI's substantial prior experience in the development and operation of flight control avionics for ROVs in the design of a new system for supporting advanced research using these systems.  The avionics suite to be developed consists of serially interconnected distributed nodes that may be programmed through a Matlab graphical interface to perform control and sensing functions in support of custom requirements from the research community.  The flexibility of custom-configured distributed computing nodes for use in a research context ensures that "just enough" instrumentation and control is provided for the specific test requirements at hand.  Phase I will provide risk reduction by demonstrating the operation of the subcomponent technologies, culminating in a simplified flight test of the avionics system.  Phase II continuation will develop the complete system to support testing activities at a NASA research center of interest.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's use of small remotely operated vehicles, particularly unmanned aircraft, in research applications would benefit from the use of a lightweight, low-power avionics system for vehicle control and data collection.  Use of the proposed distributed sensing and control network would reduce overall avionics system weight, permitting the use of additional sensors, alternate control features, or better performance of the vehicle from reduced weight operation.  Having a convenient, user-friendly interface for system configuration control would expedite the planning and execution of experiments using the avionics suite installed in these vehicles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed system to be developed here could support a variety of instrumentation and control needs for both commercial industry and defense applications.  The ability to custom tailor the required control and instrumentation components would allow the system to optimize weight and power requirements to permit its use on a host of lightweight robotic systems and devices.

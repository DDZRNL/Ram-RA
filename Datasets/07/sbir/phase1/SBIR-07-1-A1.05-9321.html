		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed effort will combine a low cost physical modeling approach with inductive, data-centered modeling in an aerosopace relevant context to demonstrate effective, low cost data mining.  In particular Phase I will evaluate various hybrid architecture concepts on the basis of false positive and fasle negative rates.    The approach will use domain decompostiition to partition the physical platform under consideration into regimes appropriate for either model based or inductive based apoproaches.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Scientific Monitoring, Inc already offers a physical model driven, proprietary product called i-Trend.  The i-Trend product provides sophisticated diagnostic and trending analysis to high value physical systems.  Specific application areas include aerospace vehicles of all types, gas turbine and rocket engines, and aerospace subsystems.  Combining an Inductive Monitoring System with i-Trend will provide enhanced features that will enable the hybrid system to address high value physical systems that are not easily modeled using conventional, physics based models. Such systems will include advanced aerospace structures and systems with substantial human interaction, as well as human physical performance and health monitoring of astronauts and pilots.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Scientific Monitoring, Inc already offers a physical model driven, proprietary product called i-Trend.  The i-Trend product provides sophisticated diagnostic and trending analysis to high value physical systems.  The i-Trend product, originally developed under a USAF SBIR, has already found commercial application as it is used by a leading aerospace firm to provide diagnostic and maintenance support to major airframe subsystems.  Specific Non-NASA application areas include various land based transportation vehicles of all types, power generating systems and industrial manufacturing systems.  Combining an Inductive Monitoring System with i-Trend will provide enhanced features that will enable the hybrid system to address high value physical systems that are not easily modeled using conventional, physics based models. Such systems will include advanced manufacturing systems or new structures and systems with substantial human interaction, as well as human physical performance and health monitoring.

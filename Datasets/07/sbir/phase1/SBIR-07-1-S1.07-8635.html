		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Peregrine's innovation will reduce the required input power, increase a coolers systems margin for a giving cooling load and reduce vibration accordingly for Reverse-Brayton Cycle Cryocoolers.  Our innovation will enhance the thermal conductivities of structures associated with the cryocooler, enable much more efficient heat removal and thereby produce a much more efficient system.  Effectively we will be increasing the thermal conductivities of the structures associated with the cryocoolers by embedding Thermal Pyrolytic Graphite within a matrix of material to produce a thermal conductivity 3 times higher than current available materials.  <BR><BR>At the end of Phase I Peregrine will have demonstrated the feasibility of our innovation and laid out a detailed design and test plan for Phase II.  At the end of Phase II Peregrine will have produced a flight like product tested for future satellite applications.  Phase II will also incorporate characterization of the material and engineering guidelines.<BR><BR>As cryocooler technologies attempt to cool components down around the 4<SUP>o</SUP>K level waste heat and the management thereof becomes critical to the performance of the cryocooler.  Thermal conductivity structures that can eliminate thermal loads more effectively will lead to a more efficient and better performing cryocooler. <BR>

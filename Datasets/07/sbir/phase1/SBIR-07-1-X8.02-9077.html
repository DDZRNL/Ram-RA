		<BR>
		Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) proposes to develop a hybrid composite structure of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with a class of polysulfide for lithium-sulfur rechargeable batteries on a Phase I program.  This cathode provides safety, improved cycle-life, and high capacity at a competitive cost.  Crystalline MoS2 is low cost and has a theoretical capacity of 335 mAh/g but it has a low conductivity.  The nanocomposite design provides a synergistic improvement in conductivity and electrochemical cycling as a result of the layered MoS2 structure, provided by the intercalation of polysulfide.  In the Phase I program, PSI will demonstrate a technology readiness level of 3 with a cathode energy density of greater than 350 mAh/g (800 Wh/kg) using 2 mAh cells.  These performance goals will result in an overall battery energy density of 350 Wh/kg.  In the Phase II program, PSI will increase cell size to 250 mAh and optimize cell design to further improve cycle life.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Energy storage with improved weight and volume performance are required for various NASA applications which are both orbital and planetary surface.  Flight elements of the Exploration Vision initially include the Orion and ARES crew and launch vehicles, respectively. For lunar capability, additional elements include the Lunar Lander or Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM), robotic missions, and surface systems. Surface systems include human habitats, Extravehicular Activities (EVA), science measurements, and the utilization of in situ resources. This lithium-sulfur battery system has the capability to be scaled to the size requirement of 10 kWh in addition to having high-energy density, long-life energy storage systems, and a greater temperature range than lithium ion batteries.  The battery system has intrinsic safety and lends itself to being human rated for Exploration missions.  These mission applications include portable power for landers, rovers, and astronaut equipment; storage systems for crew exploration vehicles and spacecraft; and stationary energy storage applications such as base power or peaking power applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The portable electronic industry needs improved energy density power sources for longer runtime.  The consumer electronics industry is continually driving in the direction of smaller devices that require high specific energy and high specific power batteries. The PSI technology represents a substantial increase in performance over current state of the art and it is anticipated that a battery based on this technology will be lower in lifetime cost to current offerings.  Therefore, this low-cost battery is appropriate for many applications, including: mobile telephones, lap-top computers, power tools, personal data assistants, portable entertainment devices.<BR><BR>

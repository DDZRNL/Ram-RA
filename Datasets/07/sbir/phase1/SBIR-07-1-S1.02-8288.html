		<BR>
		This proposed Phase I effort will investigate and develop the necessary innovations to realize the Hybrid Ocean Wind Sensor system that will provide critical measurements to support the XOVWM  planned for 2014 and serve as a true testbed for this mission by providing active and passive, C and Ku-band measurements of the ocean surface from high altitude platforms. The Phase I effort will focus on developing the HOWS system design and determining the design and feasibility to realize a  low loss electronic steering, dual beam antenna and a low power, compact transceiver module that supports active and passive remote sensing of the ocean vector wind. <BR><BR>The proposed HOWS system will acquire measurements critical to assessing the design of the next generation scatterometer missions planned for 2014 (XOVWM). The HOWS system also fulfill a critical need of TPC/NHC for continuous, accurate, wide area coverage of the oceans surface vector wind field and provide hurricane researchers at HRD and other institution with critical measurements to improving the understanding of tropical cyclone intensification. The NASA Global Hawk UAV and the NOAA G-IV aircraft are just two potential platforms for this instrument. With its lower power, stealthy active and passive design, it is perfectly suited for military theatre operations and search and rescue operations over the ocean.  <BR>

		The proposed HOWS system will acquire measurements critical to assessing the design of the next generation scatterometer missions planned for 2014 (XOVWM). Currently there are systems that acquire a subset of the measurements that XOVWM will collect, but none that collect the full suite. HOWS measurements will help verify the XOVWM concept  from its ability to collect active and passive C and Ku-band measurements to SAR processing. Further, the measurements obtained with this system can be used to advance the retrieval algorithms for XOVWM prior to its launch. This will aid in calibration / validation efforts and in providing high quality products to the science and engineering communities at an earlier stage. <BR><BR>

		The HOWS also could fulfill a critical need of TPC/NHC for continuous, accurate, wide area coverage of the oceans surface vector wind field and provide hurricane researchers at HRD and other institution with critical measurements to improving the understanding of tropical cyclone intensification. The NASA Global Hawk UAV and the NOAA G-IV aircraft are just two potential platforms for this instrument. RSS will aggressively seek follow-on funding from the DOD for deployment of a HOWS-like sensor for their Global Hawks. Its lower power, stealthy active and passive design suites their theatre requirements and its ability to map the precipitation and ocean surface vector wind field at high resolution and over wide areas can provide critical information to near coastal operations. Civilian and military marine search and rescue operations are also prime applications for HOWS. RSS will seek partnership with larger companies already involved with DOD.

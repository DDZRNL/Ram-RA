		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The overall objective of this research effort (Phase I and Phase II)<BR>by Scientific Systems Company, Inc. and BBN Technologies is to develop<BR>the SELENE network -- SELf-forming Extensible luNar EVA network -- for<BR>specific usage in the Human Lunar Outpost. Phase I will investigate a<BR>hybrid scheme combining Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) and Disruption<BR>Tolerant Networks (DTNs) for networking EVA radios in the Human Lunar<BR>Outpost, study the performance of SELENE under various levels of<BR>disruption and load, and develop a prototype convergence layer adapter<BR>plug-in for an EVA radio. The SELENE effort will leverage DARPA's<BR>Survivable Policy-Influenced Networking: Disruption Tolerance through<BR>Learning and Evolution (SPINDLE) program led by BBN Technologies<BR>(BBN), which addressed DTNs from the DoD viewpoint.  As a part of our<BR>research team, BBN will provide expertise in DTNs and MANETs and<BR>support the usage of their software for performance evaluation of<BR>DTNs.  The SELENE effort will investigate problems which are specific<BR>to the lunar environment, such as the existence of scheduled,<BR>on-demand and predictive adjacencies among nodes, and the need for<BR>hybrid schemes which work well under all levels of disruption,<BR>combining MANET and DTN technologies in a seamless fashion.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		SELENE represents a solution for the problem of providing continuous<BR>interoperable communications for the Human Lunar Outpost achieving the<BR>highest levels of reliability and robustness in extremely sparse<BR>network topologies and harsh environments of rough terrains, extreme<BR>temperatures (-155 to 100 degrees Celsius), radiation exposure, dust<BR>storms, and other interferences. Generally, DTN technology is also<BR>applicable to other NASA programs as well, such as those supporting<BR>robotic networked vehicles for planetary exploration, and deep space<BR>communications.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		DTN technology is applicable in several other areas: (1) Defense:<BR>There are several networking operations within the sphere of DoD<BR>(challenged networks) which require DTN technologies. (2) Public<BR>safety (Fire, Police, Search and Rescue, Hazardous environments):<BR>Personnel can move into/out of range of network while still collecting<BR>data/reporting back, all of which will be transmitted to destination<BR>as they come into range. (3) Condition-based maintenance: Data can be<BR>collected and commands sent continuously and in automated fashion from<BR>sensors in remote/hazardous areas. (4) Wildlife tracking: Wildlife can<BR>be outfitted with sensors that report whenever they are in range. (5)<BR>Traffic congestion management: Fleet vehicles on fixed routes can<BR>report traffic congestion to other vehicles.<BR>

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

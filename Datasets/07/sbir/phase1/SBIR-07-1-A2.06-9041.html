		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		AeroSoft proposes to develop a full featured CFD toolkit<BR>for analysis of the aerothermal environment and its effect<BR>on space vehicles.  In Phase I, AeroSoft proposes to implement<BR>multi-component ablation along with material response into<BR>AeroSoft's structured and unstructured CFD solver GASP.  In<BR>Phase I, GASP's internal thermal solver will be augmented to<BR>include the effects of ablation.    In Phase II, AeroSoft proposes<BR>to implement radiation heat flux and radiation transport into GASP.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The direct benefits to NASA are the ability to analyze the interaction<BR>of ablating materials with the gases in the shock layer, and the ability<BR>to analyze radiation heat transfer and radiation transport that occurs<BR>in shock layers for reentry applications.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The work performed under Phase I and Phase II will have<BR>significant application to directed energy research.   AeroSoft's GASP<BR>is currently being used to perform laser-target interaction.  Much<BR>of the physics that occur during reentry also occur during laser-target<BR>interaction.  Potential customers include NASA, Lawrence Livermore<BR>National Labs, Sandia National Labs, and their subcontractors performing<BR>reentry design and analysis or COIL related research.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Venus retains many secrets pertaining to its formation and evolution.  NASA is interested in expanding its ability to explore the deep atmosphere and surface of Venus through the use of long-lived balloons and landers.  Survivability in extreme high temperatures and high pressures is also required for deep atmospheric probes to giant planets.  This Phase I proposal discloses technology that will permit operation and survivability in high-temperature/high-pressure planetary environments such as Venus.<BR>The goal of this Phase I effort is to demonstrate the feasibility of a very high temperature thermal control system and to experimentally demonstrate a 1251 kJ/Kg thermal storage medium.<BR>The successful completion of such an effort requires dramatic advances in technology, areas in which Mainstream has tremendous experience and has excelled in the past.  However, although no extremely high temperature heat rejection system has ever been fabricated anywhere in the world, this critical requirement is necessary to achieve long-life operation on Venus and other planets.  This effort represents a major leap over the current state of the art, and Mainstream is uniquely suited to perform this task.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's own documents state that NASA is seeking technologies that enable long-lived (days or weeks) exploration of planets with very harsh high temperature.  Future thermal control systems for long-lived exploration of Venus and for deep atmospheric probes to giant planets require the development of this technology.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Detailed commercialization information appears inside the proposal.  This technology has terrestrial applications for the exploration of the deep earth crust including volcano research, deep fissure research, and deep oil exploration.  However, the much larger market is in the industrial sector, where this technology allows for cooling of sensors in harsh environments, such as combustion stacks and blast furnaces, but also for efficient emissions-free industrial high-temperature heating.  While this high-temperature heat pump technology can be used to raise the temperature of  energy to be rejected for cooling (like the proposed Venus electronics cooling application), this technology can also be used to supply 500<SUP>o</SUP>C energy for more efficient electrical process heating without the exhaust and related environmental issues associated with combustion heaters and with energy efficiency advantages over straight electrical resistance heating.  This commercial market is the most significant and represents a more than a one billion dollar potential market.

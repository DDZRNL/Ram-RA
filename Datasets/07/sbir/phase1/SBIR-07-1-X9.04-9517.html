		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Pratt and Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) J-2X engine will power the upper stage of the Ares I and the earth departure stage (EDS) of the Ares V, which will enable manned travels to the Moon and eventually Mars.  Building on Apollo heritage, the J-2X is a derivative of the J 2 engine.  One unique feature of the J-2X is its planned carbon/carbon (C/C) composite nozzle extension, which will replace the heavy metallic extension and increase engine performance.  Currently, NASA and PWR plan to employ a Noveltex or Naxeco C/C nozzle extension from a foreign supplier on the J-2X.  <BR>Plasma Processes Inc., with the support from ATK Launch Systems, proposes a program with the primary goal of demonstrating a domestically produced C/C composite nozzle extension for use on the J-2X.  The specific objectives include evaluation of higher strength C/C materials and manufacturing methods, investigation of oxygen protective coatings and design of nozzle extension subcomponent.  The team of Plasma Processes, Inc. and ATK Launch Systems offers a state of the art skill set that is uniquely suited to the Phase I program.<BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Coherent Logix, Incorporated proposes the Software Defined Common Processing System (SDCPS) program to facilitate the development of a Software Defined Radio development kit based on HyperX Technology with an accompanying software development flow to support rapid development and fielding of this technology to NASA and high reliability system integrators.  NASA's exploration, science, and space operations systems are critically dependent on the hardware technologies used in their implementation.  Specifically, the performance and deployment of autonomous and computationally-intensive capabilities for space based observatories, orbiters, autonomous landing and hazard avoidance, autonomous rendezvous and capture, robotic, relative navigation, command, control and communications systems are directly dependent on the availability of radiation-tolerant, high-performance, reconfigurable and adaptable, modern communications and underlying energy-efficient processor technology.  The HyperX Technology will simultaneously enable order of magnitude improvement in power savings while reducing chipset count, thus size and weight of the radio.  The HyperX processor technology is fully programmable and reconfigurable on the fly and is supported by industry standards based [hardware agnostic software development flow and] programming model using ANSI-C and MPI (message passing interface) API.  This provides reduced life-cycle costs and future proofing of hardware through fully portable software code.

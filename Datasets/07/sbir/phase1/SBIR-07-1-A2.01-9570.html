		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The primary material and manufacturing limitations of gamma TiAl alloys include processing difficulties, requiring costly non-conventional processing requirements, and large lamellar grains, which reduces damage tolerance.  We have developed a new class of TiAl-based alloys, called beta gamma, which would remove such barriers.   Unlike existing gamma alloys, beta gamma alloys are designed such that the ductile â phase is adequate at elevated temperatures (for processing) but negligible at the anticipated use temperatures (for performance).  The alloys also feature significant grain refinement and compositional homogeneity.  This program is aimed to utilize such beneficial beta-phase distribution and microstructure features observed in small (0.7kg) samples into forged disks from medium size (25kg) ingots.  The process-ability will be validated by employing a conventional forging process, and refined lamellar microstructures will be generated through usual alpha treatments.  The significance of this innovation is that beta gamma alloy disks can not only be produced by conventional forging, but also show improvements in RT strength and ductility and may retain other attributes (density, creep and oxidation) of conventional gamma alloys.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Due to their low density (only 50% of those of superalloys), high temperature capability (up to 800<SUP>o</SUP>C for long-term use), and expected damage tolerance improvements, once the premised process-ability and engineering microstructures achieved, beta gamma alloys will eventually find their potential applications for rotational components, such as compressor rotors and disks, and other hot structures in future NASA advanced engines.  With some adjustments of processing parameters and conditions, these alloys can be rolled into thin sheets relatively readily, which then can be used for thin-section hot structures such TPS and nozzle components.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		For the same reasons described above, there exist near future application opportunities for beta gamma in LPT components (blades and others) in future commercial aero engines and for high-pressure compressor (HPC) blades and vanes in advanced engines.  These blades made of conventional gamma alloys are on the verge of being implemented in spite of their inferiority in processing and microstructure to those of beta gamma alloys.  The rotors in future missile engines are a viable application area for beta gamma alloys.  Some commercial automotive engines have used turbochargers made of conventional gamma alloys and a cost reduction is the only issue for exhaust valve applications.  These are the ideal application areas for beta gamma alloys.

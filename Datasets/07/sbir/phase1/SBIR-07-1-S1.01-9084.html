		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed work is to develop a high-efficiency aircraft-qualified Fabry-Perot-based interferometer for the High Spectral Resolution LIDAR (HSRL). Through this Phase I effort, Michigan Aerospace Corporation (MAC) will perform instrument simulations to optimize a photon-recycled fringe imaging receiver to meet the HSRL measurement requirements. Photon-recycled fringe imaging technology incorporates the use of high-efficiency<BR>Charge Couple Devices (CCDs) to enable range-gated measurements with high spectral resolution of the atmospheric backscatter from molecules and aerosols. During this Phase I effort, MAC will also perform a thorough investigation of the current state of commercial and customizable CCD technology in order to ensure the highest level of efficiency and range resolution available is achieved. The optimized 355nm receiver will be capable of spectrally separating the aerosol and molecular backscatter components in order to deduce the aerosol to total scattering ratio and aerosol extinction. End-to-end simulations will enable a thorough characterization of the measurement biases introduced from instrument instabilities and enable driving requirements to be formed for a Phase II build. Also during Phase I, solid model receiver concepts and trade studies will be performed to enable a smooth transition to Phase II so that the HSRL receiver can be ready for flight in 2008.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The principal application are future NASA LIDAR satellite missions seeking to measure global aerosols. A complimentary application of this technology is for remote sensing of global tropospheric winds, however the receiver requires a different optimization for this measurement. The HSRL instrument technology is intended to transfer to Unmanned Aeronautical Vehicles (UAVs) in the future so the technology developed here could be used for these applications as well. Beyond the HSRL development and NASA satellite missions, the receiver technology could be used in small ground stations for aerosol and cloud observations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology has significant implications in the military arena. The ability to detect the presence of aerosol pathogens in the atmosphere is critical to protect military personnel and civilian population. The HSRL instrument will be capable of identifying areas containing unusually high<BR>concentrations of aerosols, recognizable by higher backscatter signal associated with micrometer-size particulates. Mounted on a UAV, the<BR>instrument will provide a quick assessment of the atmospheric conditions. The aerosols include biological material, chemical clouds and radionuclide releases.

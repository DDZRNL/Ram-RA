		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I proposal seeks to develop an ultrasensitive, laser-based formaldehyde gas sensor system for airborne and ground-based atmospheric monitoring. The proposed instrument will be capable of accurately determining sub-parts-per-billion formaldehyde concentrations in seconds.  This compact, lightweight instrument will be capable of long-term autonomous operation, and require minimal power. The Phase I research will demonstrate the feasibility of the technology by performing measurements on formaldehyde samples using a bench-scale laboratory instrument that employs a novel, frequency agile laser source.  The results of these tests will be used to quantify detection limits for a Phase II instrument. Commercial systems based on the Phase II prototype will be developed and marketed during Phase III.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications for the technology include monitoring air quality during manned space missions, characterizing extraterrestrial atmospheres, and monitoring atmospherically relevant species in the Earth's atmosphere.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications based on the sensor technology described in this proposal include industrial monitoring, environmental monitoring, and general chemical analysis. The ability to determine absolute concentrations of gaseous species can also be used for semiconductor gas purity analysis, medical diagnostics, and potentially homeland security applications.

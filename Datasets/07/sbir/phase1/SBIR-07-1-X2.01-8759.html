		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		3D Flash Ladar is a breakthrough technology for many emerging and existing 3D vision areas, and sensor improvements will have an impact on nearly all these fields. In addition ASC is partnering with many strategic large companies who have the experience and the history of commercialization.  The compact, low power 3D Flash Ladar sensor developed on this project will have application in areas such as:<BR>1.	Collision avoidance<BR>2.	Pedestrian Safety<BR>3.	Surveillance<BR>4.	Terrain Mapping<BR>5.	Autonomous Navigation<BR>6.	Smart intersection<BR>7.	Radar brakes<BR>8.	Robotics<BR>9.	Machine Vision<BR>10.	Hazard Material Detection and Handling<BR>11.	Underwater 3D Imaging<BR>12.	Sub Nanosecond Dynamic Imaging.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The 3D Flash Ladar (3DFL) technology improvements developed on this project can support future Rendezvous, Proximity Operations, and Docking as well as EDL missions for lunar or planetary exploration. Not only will the sensor be able to generate 6 Degree-Of-Freedom data but it can also support hazard mapping and navigation as well as other terrain mapping requirements. The camera includes a fog, dust and liquid penetration mode, which will allow landing and navigation in hazardous conditions. This sensor will increase the success of NASA operations such as:<BR>1.	Rendezvous and Docking<BR>2.	Situational awareness<BR>3.	Mars Landed Exploration<BR>4.	Exploration of  Moons (ALHAT, Jupiter Icy Moons)<BR>5.	Asteroid and comet rendezvous and sample return<BR>6.	Rock abundance and distribution maps<BR>7.	Topographical mapping<BR>8.	Rover mobility and navigation<BR>

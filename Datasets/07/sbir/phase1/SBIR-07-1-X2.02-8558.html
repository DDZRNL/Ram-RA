		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced Scientific Concepts, Inc. (ASC) has developed a 128 x 128 frame, 3D Flash LADAR video camera which produces 3-D point clouds at 30 Hz. Flash Ladar Video Cameras are 3D vision systems that return range and intensity information for each pixel in real time.  The ASC camera is the equivalent of 16000 range finders on a single chip.  This allows the sensor to act as a 3D video camera with functionality well beyond just range finding.  A previous Phase I EDL project used an ASC camera at the JPL mars yard to gather test data. Hazard Identification, and Entry Decent and Landing applications were investigated and the data demonstrated that a Flash LADAR system can resolve landing hazards and is suitable as an EDL sensor.<BR>	In response to this solicitation ASC will study unit cell designs that will increase sensitivity and dynamic range and allow for more compact unit cells that will yield higher density arrays.  The Phase two effort will yield a ROIC design and fabrication of a unit cell.  The end result will be a ROIC design ready for Phase 3 production of a large area array.  These improvements will increase the TRL level of this sensor.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The 3D Flash Ladar (3DFL) technology improvements developed on this project can support future Rendezvous, Proximity Operations, and Docking as well as EDL missions for lunar or planetary exploration. Not only will the sensor be able to generate 6 Degree-Of-Freedom data but it can also support hazard mapping and navigation as well as other terrain mapping requirements. The camera includes a fog, dust and liquid penetration mode, which will allow landing and navigation in hazardous conditions. This sensor will increase the success of NASA operations such as:<BR>1.	Rendezvous and Docking<BR>2.	Situational awareness<BR>3.	Mars Landed Exploration<BR>4.	Exploration of  Moons (ALHAT, Jupiter Icy Moons)<BR>5.	Asteroid and comet rendezvous and sample return<BR>6.	Rock abundance and distribution maps<BR>7.	Topographical mapping<BR>8.	Rover mobility and navigation<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		3D Flash Ladar is a breakthrough technology for many emerging and existing 3D vision areas, and sensor improvements will have an impact on nearly all these fields. In addition ASC is partnering with many strategic large companies who have the experience and the history of commercialization.  The compact, low power 3D Flash Ladar sensor developed on this project will have application in areas such as:<BR>1.	Collision avoidance<BR>2.	Pedestrian Safety<BR>3.	Surveillance<BR>4.	Terrain Mapping<BR>5.	Autonomous Navigation<BR>6.	Smart intersection<BR>7.	Radar brakes<BR>8.	Robotics<BR>9.	Machine Vision<BR>10.	Hazard Material Detection and Handling<BR>11.	Underwater 3D Imaging<BR>12.	Sub Nanosecond Dynamic Imaging.<BR><BR>

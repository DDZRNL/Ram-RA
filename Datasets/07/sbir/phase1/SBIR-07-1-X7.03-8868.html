		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Laser rangefinders have numerous NASA and non-NASA applications, including navigation, landing hazard avoidance, automated rendezvous and docking, air and missile defense, infantry and artillery target designating, tank and infantry fighting vehicle fire controlling, surveillance through foliage, cloud-height measurement, and production monitoring in industries as well as commercial and law enforcement, etc. Existing laser rangefinders cannot meet some of the advanced performance requirements including wide field of view (FOV) for situation awareness, high angular resolution for detailed target shape discrimination, and fast response for transit event or moving objects tracking, as well as low weight, volume and power requirements, etc. For NASA's lunar exploration missions, lunar roving vehicle with features of automated path planning, automated driving, and obstacle avoidance are of interest for making planetary surface missions more reliable, safer, and affordable. New Span Opto-Technology Inc. proposes herein a novel laser rangefinder architecture with non-mechanical scanning foveal aperture providing wide FOV 3-D scene profile for situation awareness and high resolution 3-D profile of region of interest for object tracking. System packaging is rugged, compact and light-weight. Phase I research will establish the model, demonstrate the feasibility, and recognize challenging issues of the proposed concept through model analysis and bench top experiments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications of the proposed foveated 3-D imaging rangefinder include LRV or MER vehicles navigation, landing hazard avoidance, automated rendezvous and docking such as International Space Station re-supply or repair missions. It will also enhance the safety of other proximity operations in space by providing high-speed inputs for collision avoidance and close approach inspection maneuvers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The successful development of foveated 3-D imaging rangefinder will find extensive applications in military. The man-portable applications include hand-held devices for infantry and artillery observers and dual-mode rangefinder-designators for forward observers and forward air controllers. Land vehicle applications include tank and infantry fighting vehicle fire control and air defense gun-missile fire control, as well as vehicular variants of ground rangefinder-designators. Airborne applications include missile command guidance for attack helicopters and electro-optical targeting for fixed-wing close air support and interdiction aircraft. Laser rangefinders are also used on board naval vessels for conventional fire control and air defense applications. Space-based laser rangefinders for a variety of applications are also being developed. Applications in commercial filed include navigational guidance, surveillance through foliage, cloud-height measurement, and production monitoring in industries as well as commercial and law enforcement applications.

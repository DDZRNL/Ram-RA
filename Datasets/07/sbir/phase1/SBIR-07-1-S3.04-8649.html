		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		High current hollow cathodes are the baseline electron source for next generation high power Hall thrusters.  Currently for electron sources providing current levels >50 A and cathodes utilizing LaB6 emitters, the only viable, long life heater technology is a low reliability, low producibility, multi-element heater constructed from MgO insulated coaxial heater cable.  In the Phase I project we will develop novel insulator materials to replace MgO that can provide high temperature capability, with good thermal conductivity and electrical isolation.  We will design, fabricate, and test prototype swaged coaxial heaters incorporating the novel insulators, in collaboration with a heater manufacturer and an end user aerospace company.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Swaged coaxial heaters for hollow cathodes have applications in space as components of ion propulsion systems and spacecraft charging/charge-control systems, including ATS-6, SERT-II, SCATHA, and SCSR-1 flight experiments.  Hollow cathodes have also been used on spacecraft, including an Agena vehicle, on communication satellites, on the space shuttle,  the electrodynamic tether, and space station structure and other space environments that include those of low-earth orbits, sun-synchronous high inclination orbits, and geosynchronous orbits.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The United States Air Force has many missions in the design stage that would benefit from small, low-cost satellites operating either autonomously or as an element in a cluster of such vehicles flying in formation with carefully controlled distances and orientations to each other.  The ion and Hall thrusters provide an enabling technology for microsatellites, which are proposed for many military and commercial applications.  The commercial applications include communications and imaging satellites, companions to large satellites to provide surveillance and close-up inspection capabilities, such as to monitor and assure proper deployment of solar panels, antennae and other appendages.

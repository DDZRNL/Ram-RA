		<BR>
		ZONA Technology proposes to develop an innovative nonlinear structural reduced order model (ROM) - nonlinear aerodynamic ROM methodology for the inflatable aeroelasticity of a clamped modeled ballute system. The proposed ROM-ROM methodology tightly couples a nonlinear-FEM based structural ROM with CFD based neural-net aerodynamic ROM to achieve a high computational efficiency.  Indeed, the computing time for a typical wing flutter/LCO analysis is reduced from hours (direct) to minutes (ROM-ROM).  The structural ROM enables a seamless time-integration of the ROM-ROM and could be coupled with other aerodynamic ROM methods like Volterra or POD.  A time-accurate GasKinetic BGK method (BGKX) is adopted to generate the aerodynamic ROM for rarefied hypersonic unsteady aerodynamics/aeroelasticity applications to a ballute in atmospheric entry.  With a natural boundary condition, BGKX is superior to continuum methods for unsteady flow simulations, and unified in transition to continuum flow regimes covering the peak dynamic pressure range in Earth/Martian entries.  It can provide flow pressures and heat flux in one step.  In Phase I, we will consider both a 2D membrane-on-wedge system and a modeled ballute system and investigate their static aeroelasticity as well as the feasibility/efficiency of the ROM-ROM approach for their dynamic aeroelastic responses (flutter/LCO).  These capabilities are necessary for the development of inflatable aeroelasticity in NASA space program.

		ZAERO is the flagship software of ZONA supporting aeroelasticity/aeroservoelasticity technology of the aerospace industry worldwide. The developed nonlinear NANSI module will be merged into ZAERO, and it should share ZAERO existing market. Potential applications of NANSI falls into the following:<BR>- Rapid flutter/LCO analysis by ROM-ROM can support many ongoing ZONA projects with industry including HALE (Boeing), Sensorcraft /OFW (Northrop Grumman), and the Streamline Store Configurations program (LM Aero/ AFRL/ Eglin AFB).<BR>- Support many current new designs in civil transports, inflatable airships, sensorcraft, morphing aircraft, micro aerial vehicles (MAV), etc. The unique feature of the structural ROM and ROM-ROM methodology can render NANSI a popular software for its preferred expediency in nonlinear aeroelasticity analysis.<BR>- Aerodynamic ROM is a computationally efficient tool for CFD-based (e.g., FUN3D, BGKX) aerodynamic/aerothermodynamic simulation.<BR>- Potential customers/users of ROM-ROM/NANSI should include engineering, design/analysis and R&D arms of AF/DoD, defense/civilian aerospace industries.

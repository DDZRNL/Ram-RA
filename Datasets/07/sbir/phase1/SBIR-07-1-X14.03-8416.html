		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		MSI Photogenics has combined two new technologies for neutron detection into a system that has the potential to offer enhanced neutron spectroscopy for several NASA programs. The detector utilizes lithium gadolinium borate, a new scintillator offering a number of performance improvements over existing materials, and capture-gated signal analysis a technique that identifies neutrons by a unique dual signal produced in the detector. Only neutrons produce this signal, giving the detector excellent discrimination against background and the ability to measure the energy of the neutrons.  The program will determine the detection efficiency of this system for 12 neutron energies; thermal, epithermal and energies from 1-10 MeV.  The detection efficiency for neutron energies between 10-150 MeV will also be investigated.   An estimate of neutron dose will be developed using the ICRP factors for neutron energies and the accuracy of the dose estimate provided by the Photogenics system will be evaluated.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is seeking improved neutron spectroscopy to enhance its characterization of the space environment and has also identified a need for improved accuracy in the estimate of neutron dose experienced by astronauts on long space missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This spectrometer/dosimeter will have numerous commercial applications, including as a survey instrument, area monitoring device, and for personal radiation protection.  The existing technology for neutron dosimetry is cumbersome, difficult to use, and does not provide accurate spectroscopic or dose data.<BR>

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed effort will perform a detailed examination of dust mitigation and tolerance strategies for connections and mechanisms to be employed on the lunar surface.  These strategies will be examined by characterizing the effects of lunar dust simulants on the function of basic mechanical and electrical components, and the effectiveness of tolerance or mitigation strategies in lessening those effects.  The project will be led by Honeybee Robotics, with consultation and support from Dr. Masami Nakagawa of the Colorado School of Mines as well as consultation with Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems International, Inc.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Dust mitigation strategies will be key components to future exploration missions and would find extensive applications in systems designed to operate in the lunar and other dusty environments. Future mission scenarios involving erectable structures, diverse EVA-compliant tools, EVA-to-rover or EVA-to-robot interfaces, and other in-situ assembly or interconnection activities, will all call for such measures.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There is a need for dust insensitive electrical and mechanical connectors by several industries as well as the United States military.  Dust mitigation strategies developed in this effort will have construction and device interconnection applications in terrestrial harsh environments, such as desserts and dry climates, down-hole geothermal and oil machines, and mining operations.

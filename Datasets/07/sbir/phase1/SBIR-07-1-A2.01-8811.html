		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The fatigue life of CMCs must be well characterized for the safe and reliable use of these materials as integrated TPS components. Existing fatigue life prediction models for composite materials may be classified into three different categories: a) fatigue life model (SN curves), b) residual strength or residual stiffness model, and c) progressive damage model.  Recently, a damage index and accumulation model has been developed by Liu and Mahadevan based on Tsai-Hill static strength failure criterion.  Using this approach as a framework, MR&D is proposing to develop and verify a relatively simple and computationally manageable approach to the fatigue life prediction of fabric reinforced C/SiC composites for hypersonic vehicle load bearing thermal protection system designs.  A combined experimental and analytical program is proposed to achieve the objective of the proposed Phase I effort. At the conclusion of Phase I, a TRL of 2 will have been achieved and progress towards achieving a TRL of 3 will have been made.<BR>

		The technology developed here will directly support the design of existing and future NASA space exploration vehicles.  A working model which successfully predicts the thermal and mechanical fatigue life of coated C/SiC components will enable confident predictions of the structural life of CMC TPS components.  Such a tool would also enable inspection and maintenance schedules to be generated for C/SiC materials, using actual data from flown mission environments collected from integral health monitoring sensor systems.  Thermal protection system (TPS) elements, ranging from thick leading edges to doubly-curved acreage TPS panels, to hot structure control surfaces, will all benefit from the proposed program, if successful.  Additionally, the fatigue life prediction tools developed in the Phase I program, if successful, may support the development of any hot structure materials used on the Crew Exploration Vehicle and subsequent airframes required for the Mission to Mars.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed Phase I program will result in enhanced design expertise that ultimately can be used by Government agencies and other companies to design and manufacture high temperature composite thermal protection system (TPS) components. Additionally the high temperature composite TPS design knowledge gained by MR&D from the Phase I program will open new opportunities to provide design and analysis services.  An example of this growth path is provided by a Naval Air Warfare Center CMC Repair Phase I SBIR that grew into a Phase III SBIR, which was responsible for $1,288,521 of MR&D sales for CMC design and development services as of January 2006.

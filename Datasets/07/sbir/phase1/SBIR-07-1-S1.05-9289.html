		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Instruments employing X-ray detection are countless, in different sectors from medicine to industry and from basic to applied science. Given this importance, and despite existing technologies, there is still need for X-ray detection with increased system performance. The solid-state detector array is the primary technology to implement the current generation of space borne high-energy astronomy missions that are managed by NASA in partnership with the international community. Readout integrated circuitry (ROIC) specifically designed for photon resolving X-ray detection with solid-state detectors will create a new generation of high-performance X-ray imaging sensors. AC coupled detector input circuitry, similar to that used by Black Forest Engineering (BFE) for laser detection and ranging (LADAR), is ideally suited to NASA X-ray astronomy imaging system requirements. BFE proposes on Phase I to design, process and test detector input circuitry to meet a wide range of NASA X-ray imaging applications. The input circuit, when implemented into an ASIC X-ray imaging ROIC, manufactured and integrated with a solid-state detector array on Phase II, will provide single photon sensitivity, accurate X-ray energy determination, X-ray event time stamping, low power dissipation and ambient temperature operation.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The X-ray imaging technology developed on this SBIR will meet NASA's soft-to-hard energy requirements. One specific application is the Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST); however, the design approach is applicable to a wide range of X-ray imaging systems and future systems such as Constellation-X. The readout approach is compatible with a wide variety of X-ray detectors for maximum utility. Power requirements are low to support space-based applications. The X-ray imager design and packaging approach is compact to allow 4-side abuttable imager assemblies to create large focal plane arrays.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This imaging technology, with single photon sensitivity, reduces dose requirements for medical and commercial X-ray imaging applications. Elimination of many other background and noise sources provides the ability to resolve X-ray energy. There is a great potential to be explored with more elaborate methods of processing single photon signals. The image sensor can use two thresholds to select an energy band out of a continuous spectrum or perform image subtraction with one X-ray illumination. While single photon imaging with X-ray sensors will not displace conventional film and continuous integration imager approaches (such as charge coupled devices), the ability to work over a wide X-ray energy range and to process those images using signal energy level discrimination methods, will improve image quality of many existing X-ray systems and create new imaging applications.<BR>

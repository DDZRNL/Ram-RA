		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Simulations of reacting flow in applications such as scramjet engines are currently limited in their utility or accuracy by the chemistry sub-models employed.  Accurate chemistry models for hydrocarbon fuels are particularly problematic since the detailed kinetic mechanisms can be highly complex, essentially prohibiting obtaining a timely solution.  Simpler global chemistry models, while tractable, are notoriously inaccurate except over narrow ranges of conditions.  Reactions Systems therefore proposes to explore a new approach to capturing the detailed chemistry in a reduced multi-dimensional format that could combine the advantages of ISAT with recent RSLLC proprietary innovations in species reduction.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Increased accuracy and productivity of reacting flow CFD codes using realistic RP-1 type fuels would materially enhance the efficiency of the design process and ultimate performance of new hydrocarbon-fueled airbreathing engines and rocket engines for space access.  If successful, the proposed innovation could also be applicable to modeling many other reacting flow situations such as rocket plumes or chemically-reacting endothermic fuels used for cooling of hypersonic vehicles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Detailed chemical kinetic models are applicable to a wide range of gas phase chemical processes such as fuel autoignition, formation of toxics and air pollutants in combustion processes, modeling of catalytic processes, tailoring of industrial chemical processes, and in jet and rocket propulsion systems.  Furthermore, these chemistry models are often run as subsets of models that describe flow and/or time dependent processes.  While a number of problems in chemical kinetic modeling can be solved using global kinetics and simple thermodynamics, many require the use of detailed chemical kinetic models involving a large network of elementary reaction steps.  These large networks of simultaneous elementary reactions are computationally expensive, and follow-on codes such as CFD codes are even more burdened by having large numbers of species to consider.  Dramatically reducing the time and cost required to obtain accurate reacting flow simulations could allow much better optimization of the design and operation of many types of commercial equipment.

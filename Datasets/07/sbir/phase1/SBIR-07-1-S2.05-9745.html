		<BR>
		Advanced Materials Technology, Inc (AMTI) responds to the NASA solicitation S2 "Advanced Telescope Systems" under subtopic S2.05, "Optics Manufacturing and Metrology for Telescope Optical Surfaces".  The proposed program is aimed at developing large, ultra-lightweight mirror substrate, including membrane optics for very large aperture space telescopes.  The novel materials offer considerable weight and cost savings.  In order to prevent significant figure error, mirror substrate materials should have very low (ideally zero) coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), low coefficient of moisture expansion (CME), low cure shrinkage, low internal stresses, low outgassing, and high thermal and environmental stability.  The ultimate goal of the proposed Phase I program is to develop thin mirror substrate materials that will meet the desired requirements.  Once the feasibility of the proposed technology is demonstrated in Phase I, we shall scale-up the thin mirror substrate technology in a Phase II program to meet the NASA requirements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology developed under this program will benefit NASA to develop large, ultra-light weight deployable space based optical telescopes.  This project will enable the significant advantages of large monolithic membrane primaries. The implementation of innovative materials, developed under this program, into NASA platforms will enable novel optical technologies that extend the state-of-the-art across wavelength bands from far-IR to Gamma-ray.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology developed under this program can benefit aerospace, marine, aircraft, electronic, and automotive industries, as it offers unique combination of thermal, mechanical and optical properties. Private-sector application of polymer based mirrors includes space applications such as commercial imaging and high data rate laser telecommunication as well as terrestrial uses in laser manufacturing, image projection, and precision polymer structures and optics. The proposed technology can also be used in electronics packaging applications as a low CTE material.

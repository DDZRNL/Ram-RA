		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Phase I effort will result in a low noise MMIC G-Band amplifier the covers the entire 165 to 193GHz frequency range. The amplifier will be designed using a 50nm MHEMT that has already been developed by BAE Systems that enables the state-of-the-art performance to be achieved. The innovative amplifier design will have a gain of 20dB, a noise figure of less than 6dB(~4dB, an input output VSWR of less than 2:1. In addition, the MHEMT has the added advantage of having lower noise power stability and 1/f noise than InP devices. A balanced amplifier is the primary approach while a single ended unit will be investigated for missions that require reduced bandwidths. The MMIC amplifier will be designed to be inserted into a waveguide housing for additional and environmental testing in a Phase II program. At completion of the Phase II program, the amplifier will be capable of being space qualified for NASA missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The low noise G-Band amplfier that uses the 50nm MHEMT has numerous applications.It can provide the key element to enhance system sensitivity for remote satellite applications in the millimeter wave region. Due to its capability, the amplifier design can be extended to 340GHz for remote sensing. The design can be extended into the microwave region that has the potential to enhance the sensitivity and allow more flexibility in the designs of existing and new systems being developed by NASA.The enhanced noise power stability and 1/f noise improvement will enable radiometers with greater stability to be desgined. Overall, the amplifier design with the 50nm MHEMT has the potential to enhance most of NASA's remote sensing and communication systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The enhanced sensitivity that will be provided by this amplifier design with the 50nm MHEMT has numerous applications in non-NASA commercial applications. One of the main areas is the development of imaging systems up to and including the terahertz region. The 50nm device has the potential to provide low noise amplification up to 340GHz, The Department of Homeland Security as well as other commercial companies has shown great interest in these imaging system for security as well as preventing terroist activities.Another area of interest is the development of all weather landing systems for the commercial avaition industry. The potential use of this technology in the commercial applications are many.

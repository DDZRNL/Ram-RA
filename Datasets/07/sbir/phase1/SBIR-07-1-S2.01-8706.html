		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to develop and test key technologies needed for an integrated, high thrust colloid thruster system with no moving parts, for spacecraft attitude control and tip-off rotation cancellation.  Busek has already successfully demonstrated the use of porous substrates as planar emitters for colloid thrusters.  In this proposal we will pursue enabling technologies for such a thruster, such as a passive feedsystem and an isolation membrane for separating the propellant in the reservoir from the thruster head prior to launch.  Advancements to date suggest viable approaches for the development of a cost-effective, reliable, and flexible thruster configuration.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The greatest potential use for ionic liquid-based colloid propulsion and is directly tied to the expected proliferation of clusters and constellations of micro/nano-satellites for communications, surveillance, and aggressive science missions.  One application of the device proposed here is as auxiliary thrusters for tasks such as tip-off rotation cancellation or for low deltaV missions.  The tip-off thruster has the benefit of eliminating the need for primary satellite thrusters to be designed to encompass mission and tip-off requirements.   Also, this type of thruster would not be likely to disturb the satellite once shut down.  There is no pressurized feedsystem to leak, as is a concern with cold gas thruster.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary use outside of NASA for such a thruster system would likely be for nanosats built by universities.  Typically these satellites are secondary payloads and do not have propulsion at all.  A miniature, low power thruster system would lengthen the operational times of such experimental missions, as well as give them some orbit shaping/raising capabilities.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

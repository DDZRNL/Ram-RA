		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address the NASA Earth Observation Mission need for innovative optical tracking systems, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Spectral Imaging Visualization And Tracking (SPIVAT) system, based on hyperspectral/multispectral imaging with enhanced image contrast for optimized target visualization and tracking in day and night under all weather conditions.  This approach incorporates the first-time use of spectral image fusion for enhanced real-time target detection and a unique video tracking using a simple common-aperture imaging optics design to avoid the image registration problem of separate aperture systems.  This innovative combination enables us to meet NASA requirements for reliability, safety, and affordability by using COTS components with real-time tracking algorithms.  The system offers high-contrast visualization and real-time target tracking using ground UAV or balloon platforms for NASA vehicle launch and landing operations.  In Phase I POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the SPIVAT system device by computer simulation and preliminary laboratory experiments, which will demonstrate TRL-level 4 by the end of Phase I.  In Phase II POC plans to develop a fully functional prototype and demonstrate hyperspectral/multispectral imaging visualization and tracking capability for NASA vehicle launch and landing operations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		SPIVAT technology will provide new capabilities for NASA such as improved visualization and tracking of vehicles during launch and landing in day/night under all weather conditions, with greatly extended capability provided by digital image fusion and video tracking.  It will set a new high standard of safety, reliability, and affordability for NASA space transportation in Space Operations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The SPIVAT technology can be directly applied to air traffic control, law enforcement, security, search and rescue, fire fighting, hunting, and the automotive industry due to its superior visualization and tracking capability.

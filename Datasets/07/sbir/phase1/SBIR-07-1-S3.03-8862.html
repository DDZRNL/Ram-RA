		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Both manned and unmanned off-Earth missions of the future will require very lightweight, high efficiency, flexible and durable photovoltaic (PV) arrays to generate electric power.  Current PV technology horizons do not meet the requirements for expanded mission capability.  Although inorganic PVs hold the record for solar power conversion efficiency, they are inflexible, heavy, and expensive to produce.  There is increasing interest in a new type of PV technology that is based on organic semiconducting materials.  Much of this research has been limited by the availability of stable n-type organic semiconductors.  TDA Research, Inc. proposes to use a new class of n-type conjugated polymers to produce more efficient organic PV devices.  Two of our new n-type materials are available through Sigma-Aldrich, and the current technology readiness level (TRL) stands at 3 with proof-of-concept results and commercial sales.  At the end of this Phase I project we will have produced prototype organic PVs in the laboratory (TRL 4) and a successful Phase II project would lead to several commercial n-type organic semiconductor products being used in the full scale production of lightweight flexible PVs (TRL 6).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A successful project will produce a new class of n-type conjugated polymers for high efficiency, thin film organic solar cells.  This technology will revolutionize PV power generation where weight, flexibility, and form-factor are major concerns.  Spaced-based platforms such as manned and unmanned vehicles, probes, and rovers all require lightweight, high efficiency power generation and will benefit greatly from the realization of this new technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		New semiconducting polymers with good electron accepting and transport properties are needed for the fabrication of highly efficient organic solar cells.  Potential immediate applications of organic PV devices include disposable flexible power sources, foldable and deployable arrays, charging systems for smart magnetic cards and for smart packaging materials, photovoltaics on fabric and textiles, and various military applications.  Other future applications may include solar panels for private homes and foldable charging pads for cellular phones, GPS units, laptop computers and other portable devices.

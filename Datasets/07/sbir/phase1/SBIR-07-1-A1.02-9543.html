		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		With aircraft automation increasingly able to control flight autonomously, situational awareness and engagement of the crew can suffer.  To improve aviation safety further we need new paradigms to balance between exploiting increasingly powerful technologies and retaining and promoting aeronautical decision making (ADM) by the crew.<BR>This proposal explores integrating H-mode, a flight control system developed by researchers at the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) that shares workload with pilots to leverage the unique capabilities of human pilots and automated control systems, with OZ, a primary flight display system under development at eSky. OZ provides a single-screen display for IMC flight, mapping external objects such as airports, waypoints, air traffic, weather etc. onto the primary flight display.  The hybrid system (H/OZ) will allow the pilot both to retain situational awareness and to monitor the flight and select alternative actions at critical points.  H/OZ will marry the superior situational awareness capability of OZ with the superior cooperative flight control of H-mode.  <BR>In phase 1, eSky will develop a design for H/OZ and explore the feasibility of key new design elements.  eSky will map the user interface of H-mode into the OZ display and add functionality to both.  In collaboration with LaRC, the Florida Institute for Human & Machine Cognition and the University of Maryland, eSky will identify specific areas critical to the performance of H/OZ and use rapid prototyping to evaluate the usability of the new design elements.  New OZ functionality will be evaluated using an eSky OZ laptop simulator.  H-mode prototyping will be done in the NASA LaRC H-mode simulator. Feasibility will be tested by demonstrating that the OZ display metaphor supports full H-mode functionality without compromising the usability of the H-mode user interface.   Phase 2 will focus on creating an H/OZ simulator and on usability and performance testing.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		H/OZ will be suitable as an integrated avionics suite for any aircraft or winged spacecraft.  All aircraft operated by NASA will find the innovative OZ display and the cooperative flight control of H-mode useful in flight in both Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) and Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		H/OZ is being developed as an integrated avionics suite primarily general aviation.  OZ has already been demonstrated to be superior to conventional instrumentation and the new "glass cockpit" technology such as the Garmin G1000 currently being supplied with general aviation aircraft.  The hybrid H/OZ system will add cooperative flight control to maintain superior situational awareness on the part of pilots.  This will be of primary importance during single pilot IFR flight when high workload and stress induced by external factors can compromise situational awareness and thus flight safety.<BR>H/OZ can also be successfully applied to air transport and military aircraft.  In these aircraft types electronic displays are well-established but continue to rely on images of 1920's aircraft instruments and high levels of conventional flight control automation.<BR>

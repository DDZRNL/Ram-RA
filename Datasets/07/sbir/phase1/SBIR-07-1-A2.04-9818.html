		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		CFDRC proposes to develop, validate and demonstrate a comprehensive aeroservoelastic analysis framework for aerospace vehicles by enabling coupled interactions between multi-physics simulation modules with variable fidelity for flexible structures, aerodynamics, flight dynamics, and embedded smart materials. In Phase I, a nonlinear electrodynamics finite-element model for smart materials, capable of handling different materials and FEM mesh elements, will be developed. An interface model capable of handling different mesh densities and types for the smart materials FEM model and the structural dynamics (CSD) model will also be developed. A novel grid deformation technology, developed by CFDRC, using Solid Brick Analogy will be enhanced by nonlinear strain theory for large deformations and generalized for mixed elements computational grid systems. The feasibility of the proposed technology will be demonstrated for a fighter aircraft model in buffet mode. In Phase II, the modeling technologies identified in Phase I will be developed and implemented into the framework, with emphasis on developing an advanced data management procedures to increase the efficiency of the simulation framework. Additionally, an interface model between the aeroservoelastic framework and a general control design toolbox will be implemented to facilitate designs of complex control systems to command the smart materials. The developed technologies will then be extensively validated and demonstrated for typical aeroservoelastic simulations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology will provide accurate and comprehensive analysis tool for truly coupled aeroservoelastic simulations of aerospace vehicles. Aerospace engineers will be able to utilize the proposed predictive analysis framework to predict aeroelastic instabilities, aerodynamic characteristics, performance of controlled flying vehicles, and analyze early designs of aerospace systems. Direct NASA applications of the technology are in prediction and control of aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic phenomena, such as buffet, flutter, buzz, limit cycle oscillations, gust response, and control reversal. Programs like active aeroelastic wing, active twist rotors, and controlled micro air vehicles will also benefit from the technology. Ultimately, the framework will significantly reduce the dependence on flight tests and wind tunnels, and hereby reduce the time required to certify new military and commercial aircraft, and improved safety of aerospace vehicles.

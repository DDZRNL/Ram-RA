		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The purpose of this Phase I NASA SBIR program is to develop high performance multifunctional nanostructured materials that can be used to fabricate icephobic multifunctional appliqués with enhanced erosion resistance for rotorcraft leading edges.  The proposed technology offers integrated multifunctionality that results in reduction of weight, system complexity, maintenance, and cost over current systems.  Prevention of ice buildup will facilitate mission critical operations in icing conditions, as well as mitigate concerns of vibration transmission and shudder that are associated with ice buildup.  Integration of additional erosion resistant composites may also result in reduced maintenance costs.  <BR><BR>Electrothermal systems are currently used for anti-icing systems in rotorcraft, but are prone to failure due to system complexity.  To mitigate the problems associated with current anti-icing systems, NanoSonic proposes to develop multifunctional adhesive backed appliqués with integrated hydrophobicity and enhanced erosion resistance.  High performance tapes are currently applied to rotorcraft leading edges to help improve erosion resistance.  Integrating multiple functionalities into a high performance nanocomposite appliqué would result in reduction of weight and system complexity, facilitate operation in icing conditions, and reduce maintenance on the rotorblades.  For minimal maintenance and application cost, a new appliqué can be readily placed on the rotorblade leading edge when the existing appliqué has exhausted its functionality.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA applications include any application where water repellency, minimization of water ingress, or reduced frictional drag is desired.  Water repellency provides anti-icing functionality useful in nearly any vehicle or structure for missions where icing or the risk of ice formation inhibits progress.  Water repellency also suggests minimized water ingress.  The proposed hydrophobic materials may be transitioned to coating application suitable for corrosion resistance.  Minimization of corrosion on metallic surfaces would minimize maintenance and reduce concerns of potential structural integrity damage resulting from corrosion.  Hydrophobic materials can also significantly reduce frictional drag, which may be particularly useful for operation of small exploratory vehicles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed nanocomposites will significantly benefit both military and civilian applications.  For the military, commercial applications include any application where water repellency, minimization of water ingress, or reduced frictional drag is desired.  Examples include corrosion protection on military vehicles, frictional drag reduction on underwater vehicles, and water repellant materials for nearly any military platform metallic surface.  Commercial applications are also nearly limitless, including corrosion protection and frictional drag reduction for higher performance, cost and energy saving commercial aircraft and automobiles.

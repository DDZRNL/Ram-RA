		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has identified the need for the development of lightweight structures technologies to support Lunar Lander and Lunar Habitats programs and for the transfer of relevant technology to Crew Exploration Vehicle and Crew Launch Vehicle programs.  NASA further calls for revolutionary advances in radiation shielding materials and structures technologies to protect humans from the hazards of space radiation during NASA missions.  To address this need and in response to NASA Subtopic X6.03, International Scientific Technologies, Inc. in conjunction with the College of William and Mary, proposes the development of hydrogen-rich monomers for high performance polymers, such as polyimides, and the incorporation of metallic nanoparticles to form nanocomposite materials having multifunctional properties.  The Phase I Technical Objectives include preparation of hydrogen-rich monomers, fabrication of polymeric nanocomposite films, and acquisition of test data to determine key parameters for optimal radiation-shielding materials.  The anticipated result of the Phase I and Phase II programs is the development of polymeric nanocomposite materials consisting of hydrogen-rich monomers and metallic nanoparticles.  The nanocomposite materials have multifunctional properties of radiation shielding against galactic cosmic radiation, neutrons and electromagnetic radiation, structural integrity to permit use in flexible and rigid structures and habitats, and electrical conductivity for electrostatic control to be used in dust mitigation during lunar missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed multifunctional nanocomposites will find application in the Exploration Systems mission in protecting astronauts and sensitive optical, electronic, thermal and acoustic components from environmental hazards including radiation, dust and thermal transients, while, at the same time, providing lightweight structural functions.  It is expected that nanocomposite systems will provide a high-performance-to-weight radiation shield that can be used within human habitats, spacecraft and protective apparel.  Other missions supported by NASA could also make use of the nanocomposite materials in low earth orbit or in other orbital paths traversing high radiation regions of space.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Lightweight multifunctional radiation shielding will find application in the commercial (e.g., hospitals and nuclear power plants) and defense (e.g., nuclear-powered ships and surveillance satellites) sectors.  The shields will provide protection for homeland security first responders employed by law enforcement agencies, fire departments and hospitals.  It is also expected that the shielding can be fabricated into temporary shelters used by defense personnel and considered for use in the protection of individuals in case of a nuclear or radiological event.  The radiation-shielding material will be suitable for fabrication into protective clothing for healthcare professionals involved in X-ray and nuclear medicine.

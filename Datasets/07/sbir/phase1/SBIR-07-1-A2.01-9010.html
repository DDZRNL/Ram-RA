		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Recent advances have strengthened interest in supersonic cruise aircraft, though achieving economic viability for these vehicles will require dramatic improvements in cruise efficiency without excessively penalizing off-design performance.  Optimization of inlet design offers a potent method for achieving these goals, and a range of flow control concepts are available that can provide an adaptive ability to minimize blockage, reduce boundary layer bleed, and mitigate adverse effects of flow distortion on inlet/engine stability.  By exploiting high temperature smart materials technology, these concepts can be mechanized in robust, compact, and lightweight devices, enabling actuators suitable for the environment of supersonic powerplants.   This effort will demonstrate the feasibility of applying High Temperature Shape Memory Alloy (HTSMA) technology to this problem, focusing initially on design and demonstration of variable geometry flow control devices for use in supersonic mixed compression inlets.  The project will build on prior successful development of smart materials actuators, and will extend earlier work by incorporating new HTSMA materials as well as by exploiting recent insights into microramp and vortex generation devices.  The project will include refinement and characterization of actuator-ready HTSMAs, development of design tools for aero/thermo/structural analysis of flow control concepts, and experiments on demonstrator-level implementations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		By providing foundational research on innovative concepts for propulsion system components for supersonic transport aircraft, the proposed effort will directly support a wide range of fundamental NASA goals in aeronautics.  One key result of the effort will be extended development and characterization of highly promising HTSMA materials, a resource of great potential for high speed and/or high temperature applications in subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic aircraft.  In addition, the Phase I effort will lay the groundwork for enabling technology to provide integrated inlet/engine control to ensure safe, stable, and efficient operation for continuous flight above Mach 2. Also, the projected integrated aero/thermo/elastic models of actuator performance to be assembled and validated will assist the development of concurrent engineering tools for analysis and design of smart-materials-based propulsion flow control systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A successful Phase I/Phase II effort will open the door to prototype testing and eventual implementation of a HTSMA-driven adaptive flow control system.   The most direct beneficiary would be next generation supersonic aircraft that could incorporate these robust, low-profile, low-power flow control devices to permit an optimal balance of improved engine/inlet performance and enhanced engine safety.  Successful implementation in this application would also lead to spinoff developments in a number of actuation tasks, including follow-on control concepts for compressor and turbine stages in subsonic or supersonic engines that would directly benefit both civil and military systems.  Supersonic cruise technology is also of interest to the U.S. Department of Defense agencies and the developments projected here would directly benefit numerous missile designs as well as both manned and unmanned aircraft systems.

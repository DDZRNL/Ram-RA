		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Variable speed rotors will give helicopters several advantages: higher top speed, greater fuel efficiency, momentary emergency over-power, resonance detuning capability and a reduction in noise.  The applicant proposes to develop such a system using a doubly-fed planetary gear box with advanced SiC-based power electronics and motors.  The new components enabling variable speed will be rated at a fraction of the total helicopter power rating, thus reducing weight dramatically. The resulting hybrid mechanical/electrical power system also gives, in addition to greater fuel efficiency, smooth continuous speed variations with electronics, inherent starting capability (e.g., elimination of the existing starter motor), simplification of the tail rotor system, and the ability to enhance power to the main rotor with batteries and the APU.  Feasibility will be determined in Phase I by the applicant with the assistance of a major helicopter manufacturer.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The specific variable speed rotor system proposed would improve helicopters, which are not directly supplied by NASA.  Although some helicopters are used by NASA, far and away the majority are used by others.  However, the improvement of helicopters is part of the NASA mission to improve flight craft which operate within the atmosphere.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The specific variable speed rotor system proposed is unique to helicopters, but it can be scaled for use in all civilian and military helicopters from small unmanned versions to the largest heavy lift versions.  Variations of the approach and technologies can also be used in many other types of hybrid electric vehicles, such as ships, autos, trucks, tanks and other armored vehicles.

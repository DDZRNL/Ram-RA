		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed effort seeks to develop a digitally steered polarimetric phased array L-Band radar utilizing a novel, high performance architecture leveraging recent advances in radio frequency and digital signal processing components.  The driving methodologies will be the minimization of costly and inflexible analog circuitry, adoption of standardized manufacturing processes, and inclusion of reconfigurable software/firmware architectures to facilitate fulfillment of varied sensing requirements.

		<BR>
		The conical scanning beamforming scatterometer leverages recently developed processing technology in order to enable collocated measurements of emission and backscatter in a compact aircraft instrument with no moving parts. These measurements are not currently available in NASA's L-Band radar systems. The measurements support Earth science applications and are an important step in the path to space for L-band scatterometer/radiometer systems. This short term goal of this work would be to enable collocated measurements with the 2-D Electronically Steerable Thinned Array Radiometer (ESTAR) instrument. In addition this work serves as validation for the Soil Moisture Active/Passive Mission (SMAP) mission which will carry a mechanically conical scanning radiometer/radar system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There is a generalized interest in transitioning from current mechanically scanned radar systems.  In many applications, current systems have been designed to serve a narrowly defined purpose.  Lower cost, agile phased array systems capable of supporting multiple operating modes targeted at different problems will be well-poised to fit emerging sensing needs. This transition process has already started in the fields of atmospheric remote sensing and aviation.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to develop a tool for NASA researchers based on IDL and DAP for user-friendly remote data access.  A popular data analysis tool in the NASA research community is IDL (Interactive Data Language).  A main limitation presently on performing data analysis with IDL for NASA researchers is that often the data to analyze is located remotely from the scientist, and also, often the data is too  <BR>large to transfer for local analysis.    Researchers have developed a  <BR>protocol for accessing remote data, the Data Access Protocol (DAP), and one can use DAP from within IDL, but presently using the DAP-IDL interface is both limited and cumbersome.  We propose to develop a more powerful, user-friendly interface to DAP for IDL.  At the completion of this work, users will be able to browse remote data sets from an IDL GUI, have an interactive IDL command line session simultaneous with the remote visualization and write custom IDL functions that will act on the remote data with results displayed locally.  We will make all of these IDL-DAP tools usable seamlessly for any IDL user.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The problem of remote data that must be analyzed and visualized locally exists in all branches of NASA. Increasing the data access capabilities of the data analysis software is therefore of interest to all NASA branches. The widespread use of IDL throughout NASA makes the tools developed in this project applicable within the entire agency. In addition, the continued development of GDL, a low-cost alternative to the commercial IDL software, is a cost reduction factor beneficial to all NASA branches. Currently, DAP is used to serve remote data for GSFC, PODAAC, and OceanESIP.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		IDL is widely used at National Laboratories, universities and private industry. Research branches processing observational data, including medical imaging, chemistry, and earth science, face the same problem of accessing large amounts of remote data. The cost savings resulting from this project could make it even more attractive, especially to private industry.<BR>

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

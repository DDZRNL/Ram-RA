		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Advatech Pacific proposes to develop a Virtual Satellite Integration Environment (VSIE) for the NASA Ames Mission Design Center.  The VSIE introduces into NASA Mission Design Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) tools and processes, which haven proven themselves in the industrial manufacturing world.  In addition to COTS PLM tools, the VSIE hinges on two key concepts: An enhanced Digital Mock-Up (termed DMU++) and the so-called Common Geometry Strategy.<BR> <BR>DMU typically addresses mechanical form, fit and function of a component or sub-assembly in the assembly context. We propose to go one step further and address electrical power, data, and other similar interfaces in the DMU to automatically detect compatibility issues beyond mere mechanical fit. This will be an enabling functionality for rapid mission design and integration of components from a database of existing off-the-shelf hardware such as the database currently under development at the NASA Ames Mission Design Center. <BR><BR>The Common Geometry Strategy was introduced in the late 1990s in both the commercial aircraft engine and automotive industries, however, it has so far not found its way into satellite design or satellite mission design. The fundamental idea is that the same Master Model geometric information is readily available to all disciplines and individuals that need geometric information to perform their job. Since a particular disciplinary specialist may require only an abstraction of the detailed 3D-geometry, the idea of a "Context Model" is introduced. The Context Model is a simplified representation of the detailed 3D CAD model, which is simplified precisely to the level of detail required by the specialist, while maintaining full associativity to the Master Model geometry, so that it either automatically updates when the Master Model geometry changes, or at least notifies the specialist that it is out of date.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The results of this research directly benefit the NASA Ames Mission Design Center in their activity of assembling Small Satellite missions. Currently, the Missions Design Center does not employ an integrated, PLM-based approach in their design activities. The Mission Design Center receives geometric information from component suppliers in a variety of formats. The current in-house CAD package is Solidworks. Analysis tools such as STK and disciplines such as structural and thermal analysis need subsets of the detailed CAD geometry in particular formats that they can process. Currently, much time is spent converting geometry from one format to another, and critical information can be lost in the process. The proposed work will directly address these issues.<BR><BR>In addition, there are a number of additional potential applications of this technology. For example, JPL could use our tools in the design of exploratory space probes. The tools could also play a role in the development of micro and nano satellites all the way to manned space missions.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed VSIE is directly applicable to the Plug&Play space vehicle design approach currently being investigated by the US Air Force at AFRL Kirtland AFB. The goal of the plug and play space vehicle design approach is to apply the proven capability of computer peripherals to integrate themselves with computers to space vehicle components. This will enable space vehicles to be assembled quickly enough to meet rapidly developing operational needs where time is the critical factor.  Advatech Pacific is currently working with AFRL Kirtland AFB to develop the ISET tool which enables pre-conceptual/conceptual level design of space vehicles by both traditional approaches and utilizing standardized plug and play space vehicle components.  The DMU++ concept suggested in the present proposal will be directly applicable to support this Plug&Play scenario. This type of technology will be a key enabler for the Responsive Space Launch program by the US Air Force. On the commercial side, any of the primes or first tier suppliers could benefit from the tools being developed, specifically on small satellite projects.

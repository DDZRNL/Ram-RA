		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The key innovation in this effort is the development of a simulation testbed for identifying dynamic air corridors that can increase aircraft throughput in and around the terminal airspace.  In this proposal, an air corridor is a three-dimensional region of space that is intended to safely isolate a stream of aircraft from other aircraft outside the corridor.  Air corridors/routes effectively exist today in two forms: static and dynamic.  Static air corridors exist in the form of published standard arrival routes (STAR) and standard instrument departures (SID).  Dynamic air corridors are effectively created when air traffic control (ATC) issues vector and speed instructions to aircraft.  The proposed testbed would identify dynamic air corridors that provide ATC with more options that are optimized to provide greater throughput than is currently available with today's static air corridors.  The testbed would continuously identify dynamic air corridors in order to adapt to changing hazards, changing queues of arriving and departing aircraft, and changing runway configurations.  We further propose integrating the simulation testbed with NASA's Airspace Concept Evaluation Software (ACES) in order to assess the impact of dynamic air corridors on the entire U.S. national airspace.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Our initial target for the product developed in this effort is the modeling and simulation community within NASA that is focusing on the Joint Planning and Development Office's Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  IAI is currently involved in developing and extending both ACES and CybelePro, which is currently used as the core modeling and simulation infrastructure for ACES.  Given our intimate knowledge of our customer requirements, our partnership with the industry leaders such as ACSS Raytheon and SAIC, and fact that the need for a simulation environment for NGATS concepts have been identified by the JPDO, we are extremely confident of transitioning this technology into these markets.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Another target for the product developed in this effort is the modeling and simulation community within FAA that is focusing on NextGen concepts and operations.  Another target is the modeling and simulation community within the Department of Defense that is focusing on crisis operations/First Responders. IAI is currently actively involved in each of these markets, and CybelePro is currently being used as the core modeling and simulation infrastructure in several of these efforts. Given our intimate knowledge of our customer requirements, our partnership with the industry leaders such as ACSS Raytheon and SAIC, and fact that the need for a simulation environment for NGATS concepts have been identified by the JPDO, we are extremely confident of transitioning this technology into these markets.

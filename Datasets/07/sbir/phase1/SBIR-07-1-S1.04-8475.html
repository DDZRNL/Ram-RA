		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Luna Innovations Incorporated proposes to develop a high performance Ge quantum dots-based infrared (IR) imaging camera on Si substrate. The high sensitivity, large format imaging camera with a spectral response in the 1-4um region is extremely important for many NASA space and Earth programs. Luna's approach will allow significant reduction in price of the infrared imaging camera, increase pixel count and radiation hardness, reduction of dark current, increase of operation temperature while keeping all other performance metrics competitive with current state of the art technologies. Furthermore, Si substrates is very attractive in IR FPA technology, not only because it is less expensive and available in large area wafers but also because the coupling of the Si substrates with Si readout circuitry in an FPA structure allows fabrication of very large arrays exhibiting long-term thermal cycle reliability.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Development of large format, high sensitivity IR sensors for ground-based astronomy is the goal of many observatories around the world (large arrays dramatically multiply the data output of a telescope system). Surface measurements in the spectral range from approximately 1 to 4um can do to help resolve remaining ambiguities of surface mineralogy in Planetary Explorations. Another example is celestial observations in the 1-4um band. Several components contribute to this band: stars, galaxies and zodiacal light. Currently observations are controversial to the theoretical predictions and large format, high detectivity imager operating in the 1-4um window is needed.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Over the past 25 years, the availability of high performance infrared detectors has spurred commercial applications in spectrometry, protein analysis, fire detection systems, preventative maintenance, process control, and astrophysical studies. Much of the recent growth is centered on environmental applications, such as pollution detection and medical applications, such as blood analysis. Also, portable low power infrared imaging cameras will be an integral part of the future soldier's equipment in near future. The development of the low cost infrared detector will allow immediate increase of the fighting capacity for the US DOD ground forces.

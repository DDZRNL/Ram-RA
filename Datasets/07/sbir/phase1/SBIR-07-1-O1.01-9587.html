		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose an initial architectural and preliminary hardware design study for a high-rate receiver capable of decoding modulation suites specified by CCSDS 413.0-G-1 April 2003 (www.ccsds.org) and new advanced modulation suites.  We propose to detail a design which can provide a throughput of greater than 300 Mbits/sec and 7 bits/sample output.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed receiver design would be applicable to both near-Earth and deep-space science and exploration applications both now and in the future.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The demodulation design is applicable to a variety of space applications including commercial and military satellites.  Terrestrial applications include terminals for satellites and wireless telecommunications equipment.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Software testing is a complex and expensive phase of the software development cycle.  Effective software testing is especially important in mission-critical software, where erroneous behavior poses a risk to safety or mission success.  Automated test case generation can make testing more efficient and effective, saving resources and reducing risk.  Safeware Engineering Corporation proposes to develop the algorithms necessary to streamline software testing by automatically generating test cases directly from SpecTRM-RL models.  SpecTRM-RL (Specification Tools and Requirements Methodology - Requirements Language) is a requirements language that was designed to be highly readable, allowing even non-specialists to understand them, but also completely formal.  A SpecTRM-RL model specifies the black-box behavior of the system; test cases based on these requirements will focus on the intended behavior of the system.  A smaller set of test cases will allow for more rapid error identification, while a larger set will provide more comprehensive coverage.  The algorithms will have varying levels of completeness, allowing for a trade-off between test coverage and testing resources.  Safeware provides a tool, SpecTRM, which assists analysts with editing, analyzing, and executing formal requirements models.  A phase II effort would implement these algorithms, adding test-case generation to SpecTRM.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)

		NASA is involved in the development of complex systems that are highly reliant on software, such as human-rated space vehicles.  These systems must be reliable and safe, but also affordable to develop and maintain.  NASA has recognized the need for innovative requirements analysis methods and automated tools; the basic SpecTRM toolset was developed under a NASA SBIR.  The addition of automated test case generation to the SpecTRM toolset will provide testers with valuable assistance, streamlining software testing.  The algorithms developed by the proposed research, as well as the tool to be developed in Phase II could potentially apply to any NASA  project with a need for reliable, safe and cost-effective mission-critical software.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The need for innovative requirements analysis methods and automated tools has been recognized across industries as varied as aerospace, automotive, defense, and medical device, providing an ample market for such a tool.  In fact, the basic SpecTRM toolset, which was developed under a NASA SBIR, is now used in the aerospace industry, for example, the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA and JAMSS) have used it extensively on their space projects and in the defense industry.  JPL completed a successful Technology Infusion project to evaluate the use of SpecTRM for TeamX. Lockheed Martin Space Systems has expressed interest in using SpecTRM on the Orion space vehicle.  The addition of automatic test-case generation to the SpecTRM toolset will be applicable to these projects and others throughout the industry.<BR><BR><BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose conducting further development for a Nitrous Oxide Fuel Blend (NOFB) propulsion system.  Phase I activities will concentrate on a revising a previous 5 lbf thruster to facilitate continuous operation with repeated restart.  The thruster will utilize a novel new NOFB monopropellant.  NOFB series monopropellant formulations have the following characteristics: 1) Non-toxic and readily manufacturable; 2) Vacuum specific impulse of 310+s (compared to monopropellant hydrazine's 235s); 3) Space-storable with wide temperature storage limits from <-77 C to >100 C; 4) High storage density at equivalent to twice as dense as monopropellant hydrazine depending on temperature; 5) Potentially highly throttleable due to very fast reaction kinetics; and 6) Self-pressurizing thereby simplifying the overall feed system architecture and reliability.  Due to these desirable characteristics of NOFB monopropellants, Phase I funding is requested from the NASA SBIR program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Increasingly demanding in-space propulsion requirements will benefit from NOFB monopropellants.  Lunar launders require high Isp rocket propulsion.  By utilizing NOFB monopropellants, the mass associated with bipropellant system hardware can be eliminated without a significant decrease in Isp performance. Additionally, the limiting factor on many satellite's life is their propellant reserves.  By increasing the Isp from hydrazine's ~230 s to NOFB3's ~310 s, greater total impulse can be achieved with the same mass as legacy propulsion systems.  This will serve to either lengthen the life of a satellite, facilitate greater non-propulsion system payload, or a combination of both.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial spacecraft will also benefit from the increased performance of NOFB monopropellants.  Launching satellites is an expensive endeavor.  To maximize the cost/benefit ratio, extended satellite life is very attractive.  Because our monopropellants have >30% improvements in specific impulse performance, a satellite's life can be extended without requiring larger and more expensive launch vehicles.  The private sector can achieve longer satellite life without increased expenditures or decreased payload capabilities.

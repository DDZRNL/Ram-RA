		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed project is aimed at developing a model based resource and mode management system for space robotics systems that will allow real time assessment of resources status and provide required situational awareness to execute efficiently the mission. <BR>Traditionally, resource management is being done remotely by the robotics operations team. This approach has numerous disadvantages. For instance, it does not support a more autonomous operation, it takes a longer time to complete than potentially available when the decision has to be made in real time, it has the high costs associated with a large operating team, continuously working for mission support.  Ideally, such a function should be part of a full Integrated System Health Management (ISHM), but while a lot of research is being done on the development of ISHM systems, very little effort is made to provide the robot with the capability to use system information to assess the possible strategies with respect to the remaining resources of the vehicle. A model based system can use its understanding of the system state, of its operational modes and of its resource usage to deduce the potential optimum strategies in order to achieve the mission goals.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Applications of the resource and mode management toolset are numerous at NASA. In the short term, the tool can be used for existing space robotics system such as the Robonaut, Centaur and Surface Rover. In the longer term, our concept can apply to the different types of advanced robotics systems to be developed to support the Human/Robotic missions to the surface of the Moon and Mars . For instance the initial missions will need the development of telerobotic rovers and aerial vehicles for science, site reconnaissance, and potentially hazardous operations. Then, autonomous and tele-robotic rovers for planetary resource excavation, transport, and processing will follow, to prepare for EVA assistant rovers for site exploration. The tool should allow these programs to significantly reduce the need for costly manual assessment and planning of the system missions before the operations. In the future, the tool could be applicable to the lunar habitats supporting the new exploration vision.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A tool that can be customized to different systems will be useful within DoD organizations using complex autonomous systems such as UAV, UCAV, ULV transport equipment, or logistics support equipment.<BR>In the commercial arena, robots are becoming more ubiquitous and used in an ever growing range of disciplines. They are used for carrying hazardous tasks, routine security tasks, and performing a variety of surgical tasks such as hip replacement, cardiac surgery, or supporting laproscopic surgery. These Robotic surgical assistants have potential application in the nearly one million endoscopic surgical procedures performed each year in the U.S. alone. Our concept could provide significant improvements to these commercial robots. <BR>Resource and mode management is also being used in a broad range of different domains, such as airplane operations, power plant, refineries, and chemical plants operations. This type of technology can be adapted to these different domains and provide benefits similar to those provided to NASA.<BR>

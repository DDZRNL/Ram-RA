		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Flutter is a potentially explosive phenomenon that is the result of the simultaneous interaction of aerodynamic, structural, and inertial forces.  The analytical prediction of flutter in the transonic regime requires high fidelity simulation models that are computationally expensive.  Due to the computational demands, traditional uncertainty analysis is not often applied to flutter prediction, resulting in reduced confidence in the results.  This Phase I research is aimed at exploring methods to reduce the previous computational time limitations of traditional uncertainty analysis. To dramatically reduce the computational burden of uncertainty analysis, Systems Technology, Inc. proposes to investigate both the coupling of Design of Experiment (DOE) and Response Surface Methods (RSM), and the application of robust stability techniques, namely Ý-analysis.  Using Reduced Order Models (ROM), the DOE/RSM and Ý-analysis approaches will be compared to traditional Monte Carlo based stochastic simulation.  The result of the Phase I program will be to demonstrate the utility of the core elements of the Aeroelastic Uncertainty Analysis Toolbox (AUAT).  AUAT will contain multiple methods for addressing flutter uncertainty analysis, coupled with a state-of-the-art nonlinear aeroelastic code.

		<BR>
		Enhanced predictive flutter boundaries using the Aeroelastic Uncertainty Analysis Toolbox will decrease the likelihood to test beyond the flutter boundary, thus decreasing the risk of unexpected flutter that may lead to catastrophic failure and thereby increasing flight safety. The software will be developed with the intent of being used for flight test planning. Rapid uncertainty analysis capability will be highly beneficial during aeroservoelastic flight tests to more accurately predict the flight envelope prior to testing.

		<BR>
		Applying the uncertainty analysis early in the design process will enable manufacturers to design high performance aircraft with expanded flight envelopes that are robust to uncertainties pertaining to aeroelastic phenomena such as flutter. Rapid uncertainty analysis capability will enable designers to evaluate a larger design space in less time, decreasing the amount of incremental flight testing, thereby reducing the cost of development.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		New engine fan blade containment structures are being manufactured with advanced composite structures such that they can withstand blade-out events. The use of advance composites requires the understanding of the possible effects of aging degradation on the performance of "hard wall" or "soft wall" composite fan containment structures to ensure durability in their use in jet engine applications. Acellent Technologies, Inc. proposes to develop an innovative, low-cost and reliable system for assessment of the integrity of composite fan containment structures that will automatically monitor in real-time the location and extent of damage in the containment structure. The system will utilize a network of miniature sensors integrated with the structure to scan the entire structural area for any impact events, resulting structural damage and monitor degradation due to usage. Phase I will focus on developing a prototype of the system and demonstrating functionality to detect damage both on the inner and exterior surface of the fan containment structure.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed system directly the need for inspection of fan containment composite structures and it is expected that once developed, the proposed system will provide the following advantages over current inspection techniques:<BR>·	Low-cost built-in reliable damage detection system for monitoring of containment structure integrity<BR>·	Improved personnel safety<BR>·	Improvement of fan containment structure reliability 			<BR>·	Ease of installation<BR>·	Reduction of labor time<BR>·	Real-time convenience and automation of inspection during service<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Since nearly all in-service composite structures require some form of inspection and maintenance procedures to monitor their integrity and health condition to prolong life span or to prevent catastrophic failures, the potential applications of the proposed system are very broad. In the future, this system can potentially be used to monitor all types of composite structures on aircraft and spacecraft.

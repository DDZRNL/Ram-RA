		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Long-life, high-capacity cryocoolers are a critical need for future space systems utilizing stored cryogens.  The cooling requirements for planetary and extraterrestrial exploration missions, Crew Exploration Vehicles, extended-life orbital transfer vehicles, and space depots will range from 10 to 50 W at temperatures between 20 and 120 K.  Turbo-Brayton cryocoolers are ideal for these systems because they are lightweight, compact and very efficient at high cooling loads, in addition to their inherent attributes of high reliability; negligible vibration; long, maintenance-free lifetimes; and flexibility in integrating with spacecraft systems and instruments.  To date, space-borne turbo-Brayton technology has been developed for low cooling loads.  During the proposed program, Creare will develop an advanced, high efficiency turbine optimized for a high-capacity cryocooler.  The advanced turbine will enable a landmark reduction in cryocooler input power and overall cooling system mass.  In Phase I, we will define the requirements for a particular mission class, develop the conceptual design of a multistage cryocooler to meet these requirements, develop the preliminary design of the advanced turbine and perform proof-of-concept tests.  During Phase II, we will fabricate the turbine and demonstrate its performance at prototypical operating conditions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced turbines will enable high-capacity turbo-Brayton cryocoolers that are compact, lightweight, and consume minimal power.  Space applications include cryogen storage for planetary and extraterrestrial exploration missions, Crew Exploration Vehicles, extended-life orbital transfer vehicles, long-term geosynchronous missions, in-space propellant depots and extraterrestrial bases, and cooling systems for observation platforms requiring large arrays of infrared and X-ray detectors.  Terrestrial applications include cooling for spaceport cryogen storage and cryogen transportation systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA commercial applications include cooling for laboratory- and industrial-scale gas separation; liquefaction; cryogen storage and cryogen transportation systems; high-temperature superconducting magnets in motors and magnetic resonance imaging systems; liquid hydrogen fuel cell storage for the automotive industry; and commercial orbital transfer vehicles and satellites.

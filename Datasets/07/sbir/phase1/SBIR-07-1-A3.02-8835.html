		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The complexity and interdependence of operations on the airport surface motivate the need for a comprehensive and detailed, yet flexible and validated analysis and modeling capability. This modeling and analysis can be used to identify the most beneficial areas of research for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) -ATM Airportal Project. It is essential, therefore, that the modeling approach properly considers all operational activities and possible capacity constraints in the entire airport surface and terminal operation as a complete system. To accurately model airport surface operations with detail and accuracy, we propose that it is necessary to consider techniques and strategies used to determine the flight's taxi route, and to determine the sequence to be used whenever two or more flights have contention for a taxiway or runway resource. This proposed effort will produce tools to support fundamental research of the concept and requirements for airportal operations in the NGATS by providing microscopic airportal surface modeling components that provide higher fidelity and greater validity of modeling than previously available. Through this effort we will also enhance the Surface Operations Data Analysis and Adaptation tool to provide the analysis capabilities required to support this microscopic airport surface model.

		<BR>
		The proposed work will support NASA's Airportal research and is highly relevant to NASA's Strategic Goals and Outcomes, as described in the 2006 NASA Strategic Plan.  The project will produce tools to support fundamental research of the concept and requirements for airportal operations in the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) by providing microscopic airportal surface modeling components that provide higher fidelity and greater validity of modeling than previously available.  In this way, the work supports NASA Strategic Goal 3E, "Advance knowledge in the fundamental disciplines of aeronautics and develop technologies for safer aircraft and higher capacity airspace systems."

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Aviation delays and the associated costs will continue to motivate research and development to improve air transportation efficiency and the airport surface domain has been largely neglected in the past, leaving substantial opportunities.  The availability of advanced surface surveillance data is a new, enabling many novel applications for the data.  In fact, this data is currently only available at a few airports.  Much of the industry has not yet had access to this data and, therefore, has not started planning how it can be used.  Still, the data will revolutionize the airport surface in ways not yet imagined. The enhancements to the SODAA technology provides a tool that can be used by airlines or airports for detailed analysis or standard reporting capabilities to analyze the efficiency of their airport's operations

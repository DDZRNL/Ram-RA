		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR Phase 1 project shall investigate novel radar absorbing materials (RAM) for use in space or simulated space environments. These materials are lightweight composites having novel fiber architecture, enabling a combination of performance characteristics not available with conventional RAM: high broadband absorption, lightweight, low outgassing, low contamination, and high power capability. The fiber materials potentially serve a functional role in composite radar absorbing structures. <BR><BR>Phase 1 will gather performance requirements and assess the potential benefits compared with current baseline materials.  Selected fiber configurations will be prepared and characterized. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed RAM materials are intended to serve in NASA thermal-vacuum testing of MW and RF hardware such as transmitters, radar altimeters, and remote sensing.  Upcoming Mars missions rely on radar altimeters that require associated vacuum-compatible RAM. <BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		<BR>RAM is used for testing and evaluation of radio frequency hardware. <BR>MW and RF technologies are important in Defense, where RAM serves in low observables, and in Wireless Communications, where RAM is used for shielding. <BR> <BR>

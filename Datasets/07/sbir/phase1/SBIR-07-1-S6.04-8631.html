		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Visual Data Mining (VDM) is an Internet-based software that supports spatial and temporal analyses of multimodal NASA science data including satellite images and in-situ sensory data. It combines computer vision, multi-physics simulation and interactive visualization. VDM tools can be integrated to NASA-related systems for detecting, tracking, modeling and predicting the movement of surface objects. The proposed system will use NASA products such as MODIS as a satellite imagery data source. The system will also incorporate the in-situ data from NOAA and JPL. The development tasks include designing object detection and tracking algorithms in Java for online distributed applications, designing compact cellular automata based simulation and prediction tools, designing data fusion and 3D navigation interface that links to Google Earth. It is expected that the VDM tools can increase the utility of scientific research data, models, simulations, and visualization in practical applications, for example, real-time detection and tracking of river plume discharged to the open water, or harmful algal blooms along the coastline. It will increase the speed of image analysis process in one order of magnitude.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		1. NASA Sensor Web projects. Sensor webs will generate a large amount of data. VDM system can be seamlessly integrated into the new sensor web through online connectivity. Ambint company is working with Robotics Institute for possible collaboration with their robotic sampling boat project for NASA.<BR><BR>2. Upgrading Giovanni System. We have been talking to Dr. James Acker and Dr. Christopher Lynne at GSFC DAAC about the potential in Giovanni system. We could integrate our modules to Giovanni for dust storm tracking and HAB detection.<BR> <BR>3. NASA Education Programs. Our data fusion and navigation interfaces enable less experienced users to access and seriously use the data for scientific projects. <BR><BR>4. New Technologies. Our VDM technology potentially enables NASA to move from data collection to data products. Also it may help NASA to develop more onboard data fusion systems so that it might save a lot of telecommunication bandwidth.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		1. Public Health Care. VDM can be used at stations of NOAA Coastal Monitoring Center for detecting, tracking and predicting Harmful Algal Blooms, River Plumes and other pollutants.<BR><BR>2. Telecommunication.  VDM can be used for mobile device system analysis and mobile user behavior analysis, such as mobility modeling and quality of service studies.<BR><BR>3. Transportation. GM managers have found VDM useful for analyzing large amount of GPS data.<BR><BR>4. Sensor Network for Smart Buildings. VDM can be used for energy saving building design and real-time optimization based on spatiotemporal patterns of occupants and weather.<BR><BR>5. Education. VDM can be used as an educational tool for high schools and colleges. It exports animated movies for their science projects. In the future releases, we will enhance the real-time data assimilation functions so that students can perform the real-time data stream mining on their own laptops.<BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We build a software tool which enables the user (airline or Air Traffic Service Provider (ATSP)) the ability to analyze the flight-level-by-flight-level permeability of airspaces constrained by weather-hazards (turbulence, icing, and convection).  The Airspace Analyzer automatically determines the space-time boundaries where weather hazards constrain capacity.  The solution approach is based on an algorithm using computational geometry techniques for estimating the directional permeability of an airspace given the direction of the dominant demand flow on an airspace and the safety requirements of aircraft passing through the airspace.  Phase I will result in theory, software, and examples that demonstrate proof of concept, and Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3.  Phase II will produce a prototype that demonstrates benefit to the airline and ATSP customer at TRL 4.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		For NASA, the proposed software product enables NASA researchers to investigate future NGATS concepts.  Used in conjunction with a NAS-wide simulator like FACET or ACES, our software can be used to study Dynamic Airspace Configuration (DAC) adjustments in the NAS triggered by automated Flow Constrained Area (FCA) algorithms that we provide.  DAC can potentially maximize capacity in highly constrained hazardous weather regions given our recommended FCAs and airspace usage results.  DAC has a need to study where critical boundaries must transition from relatively unconstrained flight into capacity-constrained FCAs.  Super Dense Operations (SDO) research also needs to evaluate the capacity around an airportal, and our Airspace Analyzer can be used to identify how SDO operations may be constrained by severe weather.  Human factors investigations may be studied at NASA to evaluate further benefits and tradeoffs of this new approach to DAC and Traffic Flow Management (TFM) planning.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed software has application to military systems as well.  In wartime, the constraints are very dynamic and automated airspace usage planning is required to support the pilot and the mission.  The airspace may be constrained by weather, but also by hostile threats, both moving and stationary.  With minor modifications, our solution approach for estimating the capacity of an airspace can be used to evaluate for a military a risk assessment for the threat level, possible avenues of approach, and estimates of total troop movement.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address the NASA need for lightweight, space suit-mounted displays, Luminit proposes a novel Holographic Waveguided See-Through Display. Our proposed Holographic Waveguided See-Through Display (HoWSD) will integrate highly selective waveguiding Bragg holograms, Luminit diffuser technology, a unique LCD backlight into a helmet-mounted display (HMD) that will provide easy- to-access clearly visible information to astronauts during extravehicular activity (EVA). The proposed HoWSD incorporates a unique design and Luminit novel diffusers into a functional HMD, which enables us to meet NASA goals for a functional, unobtrusive display device that provides information to astronauts during EVA.  HoWSD offers a compact, low-profile display with high brightness and contrast, which is fully see-through and high resolution.  In Phase I Luminit will demonstrate the feasibility of a see-through helmet-mounted display that can operate under various illumination levels, and which will prepare us for Phase II.  In Phase II, Luminit plans to develop a fully-functional rugged prototype and demonstrate HoWSD functionality.  The demonstrated results will offer NASA the capability of incorporating a non-obtrusive, rugged, wide field-of-view display into a space suit helmet designed for EVAs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		If successful in Phase I and in Phase II, the HoWSD system, integrated into a space suit helmet, will enable astronauts to see important mission information, such as updates from the Primary Life Support System (PLSS), warnings and checklists, during EVA.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The HoWSD system will find applications in avionics, combat vehicle crew, soldier's integrated protective ensemble, logistics and training, fire fighting, and in other areas where rugged helmet-mounted displays are needed.  HMD technology advances made possible by successful development of the proposed HoWSD visor optics system will lead to cost-effective commercialization. In particular, the new HMD system will find numerous real-time 3D virtual reality applications. Medicine, avionics, education, CAD, portable computing and communication, law-enforcement, fire fighting, space exploration, and video games represent major markets for compact, low-cost lightweight HMDs in the private sector.

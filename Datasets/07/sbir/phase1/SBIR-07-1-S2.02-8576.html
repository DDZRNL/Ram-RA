		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will research a novel deformable mirror design for NASA adaptive optics telescope applications . The innovation offers reliable mechanics for the strained architecture, facilitating dynamic modeling and the control of the overall mirror system. A system-level finite element analysis and design optimization, in combination with proof-of-concept experimental verification methods, will be adopted to identify the most promising design for the future adaptive optics telescope systems. Focus will be given to improve the long time reliability and stability of the system while reducing thermal distortions for the mirror system. In Phase I, the proposed deformable mirror system will be designed and extensively modeled using finite element analysis technique to examine its electro-mechanical response, thermal-mechanical responses, and the various radiation-induced thermal-mechanical responses, respectively. Based on the design, Phase I will see the prototyping and testing of a 5x5 array sub-scale model.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The current STTR research will use the proposed DM technology to address the high-end application requirements for astronomical telescope systems including (1) correction of aberrations in large-aperture, space-deployed optical interferometers and telescopes, (2) high-resolution imaging and communication through atmospheric turbulence, (3) laser beam steering, and (4) optical path alignment, (5) propagation of directed laser energy through atmospheric turbulence, will require deformable mirror (DM) wavefront correctors with several hundred to millions of elements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The actuator and deformable mirror technology, if successfully verified, will realistically enable high performance adaptive optics systems for other adaptive optics applications including medical imaging, aberration correction, optical communication, and air- and space-borne higher energy lasers. In particular, the knowledge obtained will be directly applicable to developing commercial instruments for retinal imaging and laser surgery applications. With the reliability and cost goals both met without sacrificing one another, the commercialization of the deformable mirrors for adaptive optics ophthalmic instruments will become a practical task in near future. <BR><BR>

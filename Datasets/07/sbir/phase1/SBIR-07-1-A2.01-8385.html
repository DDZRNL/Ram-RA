		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		M4 Engineering proposes to develop a method of incorporating several analyses into one process and then optimizing the structure.  This method will allow for significant weight savings of structural compoents by incorporating analyses for damage tolerance, and durability in the design phase.  Damage tolerance analyses, especially, have been difficult to iterate on since it has been time consuming to create models of each damage condition.  The proposed method will be a highly efficient and useful method in reducing weight of structures.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA will find great use for this method as they deal with applications that are highly sensative to weight.  This method is suitable for both aviation and spacecraft applications of which is NASAs buisness.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This proposed method is suitable for application outside of the NASA network.  Aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing, Lockheed-Martin, and Airbus will find great use for this tool in applying weight savings techniques to their structures.  In addition, the automotive industry will find significant use for this tool since structures with weight concern are also developed.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		CFD modeling and simulation has been heavily invested in decades of manpower by a large community of researchers. However, the excessive numerical diffusion inherently caused by discretization errors plus the possibly largest/finest grid requirement for rotor wake modeling prevents CFD to be routinely used in practical engineering calculations. The proposed Gradient Transport Correction (GTC) method provides an innovative artificial compression that can serves as a general confinement for greatly enhancing the resolution of rotor wake capturing while significantly reducing the grid requirement. In this proposal, we have demonstrated the great potential of GTC method to counteract the numerical dissipation and absolutely preserve the wake vortical structure with a small number of grid cells. Phase I will develop an initial capability, and the capability to be established in Phase I will be developed into a general engineering tool that has engineering analysis accuracy as well as transparent set-up for a broad range of important engineering calculations, such as computing hover performance, high-lift and separation flows, as well as various types of multiple rotors.

		The major beneficiary of the proposed research program will be NASA centers. It has been demonstrated that the proposed Gradient Transport Correction (GTC) method has the great potential for enhancing the resolution of a wide range of engineering calculations with significant grid reduction, particularly for rotor wake capturing that affects almost every aspect of rotorcraft analyses and evaluation. The resulting performance improvement is, therefore, an important asset for various types of rotorcraft development and upgrades in NASA centers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The resulting methods and software ability will, of course, benefit other DoD components, such as Army, Navy and Air Force. The US aviation and rotorcraft industries, including Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, General Electric, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Textron, and others, will be the major non-military potential customers. Moreover, improvement of computational accuracy and efficiency is common interest in CFD community, thus is highly demanded. The aviation and rotorcraft industries in Europe, China and Japan represent another large potential marketing of the resulting methods and software. Advanced Dynamics will promote the international sales through resale partners of local companies abroad. Therefore, the methods and software abilities gained from this SBIR project will be additional to Advanced Dynamics' existing commercial offerings.

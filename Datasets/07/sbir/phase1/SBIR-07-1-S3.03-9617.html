		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Quallion's response to this solicitation calls for expanding the nominal operation range of its space rated lithium ion cells, while maintaining their long life capabilities. To expand  this temperature range, Quallion will conduct analysis on a variety of materials. At the end of the program, Quallion will choose the two most promising formulations and deliver test cells for analysis by NASA. <BR><BR>In Phase II, Quallion will further optimize the formulations from Phase I and fabricate our large format satellite cells for cell and battery level qualification. Quallion is also proposing a "right sizing" of this production facility to allow for cost effective, low volume production with enhanced reliability, long-term supply guarantee and design flexibility that allows for future production for NASA missions. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		If Quallion is  successful in Phase I, Quallion would introduce a aerospace satellite lithium-ion cell capable of enhanced operating temperature range, while maintaining long cycle life. Quallion will provide a right sized production line to offer NASA cell configurations specific to orbiting and surface operation needs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Expanding the operational temperature range of lithium ion cells are specifically relevant to key military applications. The ability to have a chemistry that demonstrates wide temperature long term performance is desired by the military. <BR><BR>On the commercial side, the ability to have a lithium-ion cell chemistry capable of a wide operating temperature is ideal for the automotive HEV/EV industry. Current use of commercial cells, require an extensive cooling and heating components to maintain the cells in the ideal operating temperature range. This system reduces the overall energy density savings of the lithium ion pack over the traditional nickel based chemistries and adds costly electronics and complexity to the battery system.

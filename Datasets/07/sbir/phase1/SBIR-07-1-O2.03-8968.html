		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Launch site infrastructure and space vehicle assets represent multi-billion dollar investments that must be protected. Additionally, personnel and equipment must be protected against the hazards of launch operations.  PercepTek's approach to the launch site surveillance and security problem will enable multiple platforms and sensing modalities to support detection, classification, tracking, and unmanned system response.  Our comprehensive system approach to launch site surveillance and security provides support for heterogeneous assets involved in security functions with a focus on the Aerostat platform.  An Aerostat platform will be outfitted with GMTI radar to provide wide area coverage and an EO/IR sensor pod for high resolution video detection and tracking.  Phase I will result in a detailed set of design reference scenarios tailored to the surveillance and security problem, identification of system level elements necessary to address the needs of launch site security, a system architecture design based on the Autonomous Collaborative Operations autonomy architecture, and a feasibility demonstration of key technology components that would be installed on an Aerostat platform.  Phase II will result in a fieldable prototype surveillance and security system utilizing an outfitted Aerostat platform.  At the completion of the Phase I activities, component technologies with be at a TRL-4 level.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Almost all other NASA facilities contain sensitive areas requiring persistent surveillance and security response capabilities. The proposed system is readily tailored to adapt surveillance assets as a function of specific site needs. This is accomplished by conducting a brief site survey of the facility to identify specific configurations that may be applied. The plug and play nature of the architecture then makes any expansion of the system to include additional sensor types straightforward.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The military have long used surveillance devices in the form of optical, thermal, magnetic, acoustic, seismic, radio, and radar technology to obtain information and to provide security.  However, to date a person is required to be in the surveillance loop since robust, automated detection, tracking, and activity recognition of humans with visual sensors has not yet been achieved. This is particularly unacceptable in military scenarios where the only people available to interact with the surveillance system are often occupied with other critical tasks. As a result, there is a clear need for the truly automated, robust surveillance system proposed by PercepTek. Our system can provide soldiers with more complete situational awareness and allow them to perform their other activities with increased safety.

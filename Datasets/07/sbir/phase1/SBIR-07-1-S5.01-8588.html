		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Thermal energy storage systems with 300  1000 kJ/kg energy density through either phase changes or chemical heat absorption are sought by NASA. This proposed effort will design, fabricate and demonstrate an energy storage system utilizing a composite of silicone polymers (organosiloxanes) and sorption materials.  The proposed technology would provide cooling from a source at 100<SUP>o</SUP>C or higher.  In proof-of-concept experiments, related composites have already been produced, and energy densities exceeding 400 kJ/kg have been demonstrated. The innovative encapsulation technology can provide a barrier that prohibits poisoning of the sorption material by planetary atmospheric gases, and ensuring long-duration storage and safe handling before and during mission. The composites can be produced in a form that facilitates conformal coverage of intricate parts and hard to reach surfaces.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications include electronics and surface cooling on short-lived probes , over-temperature protection on critical space hardware, and edge cooling.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications also include electronics cooling, aircraft and missile edge cooling, and thermal barriers and protection for high temperature reactors and other high temperature chemical processes.

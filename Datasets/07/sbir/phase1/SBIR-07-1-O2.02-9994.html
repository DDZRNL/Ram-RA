		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The term Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) is used to describe a capability that focuses on determining the condition of every element in a complex System (detect anomalies, diagnose causes, prognosis of future anomalies) to provide data, information, and knowledge (DIaK) to control systems for safe and effective operation. ISHM capability is achieved by integrating data, information, and knowledge (DIaK) that might be distributed throughout the system elements (which inherently implies capability to manage DIaK associated with distributed sub-systems). DIaK must be available to any element of a system at the right time and within the proper context. ISHM capability is measured by how well a system performs the following functions: Detect anomalies; Diagnose causes; Predict future anomalies/failures; and Provide the user with an integrated awareness about the condition of every element in the system and guide user decisions. Mobitrum proposes to develop a Sensor Area Network (SAN) for ISHM to bring the distributed intelligences together across all elements within ISHM system with effective communication mechanisms using distributed and/or hierarchical architectures to deliver intelligence across all elements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Ground testing of propulsion systems is a critical requirement to enable NASA's New Vision for space exploration.  The proposed sensor area network technology will enable a cost effective remote testing and health monitoring through shared sensor networks. Mobitrum anticipates the following applications that NASA will benefit from the proposed technology: 1) Data analysis, processing, and visualization for Space Exploration and Earth Science observations, 2) Rocket engine test, 3) Remote test facility management, 4) Field communications device for spatial data input, manipulation and distribution, 5) Sensor, measurement, and field verification applications, 6) RFID for identification and tracking, 7) Condition-aware applications, 8) Location-aware applications, 9) Biometric identification applications, 10) Data collaboration and distribution applications, 11) Wireless instrumentation for robotic manipulation and positioning for audio and visual capture, and real-time multimedia representation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The sensor area network (SAN) will have tremendous potential for commercial market. Specifically, SAN has great applications in the automotive industry. It would be the dominating system for in-vehicle networks if it could be made compact in size and economical to deploy. The proposed Sensor Area Network may apply to one of the following applications: 1) In-vehicle network - SAN could be used to network drive train electronic control units (ECU) and communication systems for body electronics; 2) Aircraft and aerospace electronics  SAN could be a backbone network in aircrafts for flight state sensors, navigation systems and research PCs driving displays installed in the cockpit; 3) Home control  SAN could be a sensor network for Internet-based home utility control; 4) Energy management for cost saving  SAN is an idea platform to integrate various sensors for energy management; 5) Security; 6) Safety; 7) Utility; and 8) Building automation systems.

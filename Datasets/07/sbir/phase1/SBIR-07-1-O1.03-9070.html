		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		An Integrated MEMS IMU is proposed that will operate effectively in a spinning rocket up to 7 revs/sec. The IMU contains three gyroscopes and nine accelerometers on the same chip. The instrument designs have the low cross-axis sensitivity that permit the orthogonal gyros to sense the relatively smaller pitch and yaw rates in the presence of the much larger rate about the spin axis. An algorithm is proposed to combine the signals from the instruments to co-operatively obtain spatial reference. A lab experiment is planned during Phase I that will use available equipment and MSSA IMUs to prove the concept.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed work addresses NASA's specific need for low-cost tactical grade IMUs which can function reliably on spin-stabilized rockets and that can be coupled with GPS receivers for use in GPS/IMU Metric Tracking and Autonomous Flight Safety Systems.  MSSA's technology enables new approaches to processing and merging the independent outputs of GPS and Inertial Navigation Sensors and combining them with rule-based systems for autonomous navigation and termination decision making.  MSSA's low-cost/high-performance single-chip MEMS IMU technology enables the integration of inertial instruments and IMUs with GPS and other sensors into innovative, very highly-integrated systems for Attitude Determination for Launch Vehicles, Integrated Avionics Systems for Small Scale Remotely Operated Vehicles, and Modular ("plug & play") Robust On-Board GN&C Avionics for Nano-Sat Launch Vehicles and for Low-Cost Small Spacecraft.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		MSSA's single-chip Integrated MEMS IMU will be substantially smaller and less expensive, and will enable more highly-integrated applications than are possible with other MEMS IMUs. The principal military applications of MEMS IMUs for spin-stabilized rockets are for spinning munitions and small missiles.  Other military and commercial applications for MEMS IMUs are for the stabilization of small UAVs and for stabilization of sensors, seekers and cameras; lower-cost IMUs for air, land and water vehicle navigation, with or without GPS-aiding; Personal Navigation for warfighters and "first responders"; robotic stabilization and GN&C; precision motion tracking for portable/wearable systems (helmets & headsets), and bore-hole measurement systems.

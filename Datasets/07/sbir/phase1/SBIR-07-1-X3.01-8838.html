		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Seldon Laboratories, LLC, will apply its patented carbon nanotube filtration technology for air and nanoscale particulate engine exhaust filtration to NASA's Lunar Exploration challenges. This project focuses on the problem of efficient removal of nanoscale (10-100nm) and larger lunar dust particulates from air using a nanostructured fiber media containing carbon nanotubes. Lunar dust presents an important challenge to Lunar exploration and habitation, nonetheless it has some unique properties that can be taken advantage of in designing specialized filtration media capable of achieving efficient removal from air.  The rough surface shape combined with the electrically and magnetically charged nature of the dust means that rough, electrically activated filtration media will be effective tools for filtration.  Seldon's work with its proprietary fused carbon nanotube media offers a unique path to significant new purification applications that meet important needs for NASA's Lunar Exploratory Initiatives.  The unique physical properties of the carbon nanotubes will be capitalized upon to create a filtration media with high efficiency and low pressure drop that can be electrically powered to enhance filtration of charged lunar dust particles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are important applications for this product throughout NASA's operations from protecting human life on lunar explorations, to cleaning the air of clean rooms, to reducing emissions from its vehicle fleet. The potential health and environmental impacts of airborne ultrafine particles are now known to be significant. Typical filtration solutions struggle to remove these very small contaminants. As a result, energy is wasted and, because of cost, some filtration applications are just not pursued. Products based on this technology will protect astronauts and sensitive equipment from lunar dust in the air handling systems of spacecraft and even in personal breathing apparatus. They will efficiently remove very small particulates from the air in NASA's clean rooms. Finally, filters will help to clean the emissions from the many earthbound diesel and other engines NASA operates to help reduce NASA's carbon footprint and improve the health of its employees and communities.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The estimated global market size for air purification equipment is estimated by some observers to be about $2.5 billion. As the public awareness of the health and environmental consequences of very fine particles increases, the demand for improved filtration will continue to increase. Protecting humans, animals, and delicate machinery from these tiny contaminants will continue to be a growing opportunity. The care that has been given to filtration in clean rooms will likely be more common in other spaces such as offices and vehicles. Through careful strategic partnerships, products based on this technology will be sold to fit into the many air handling systems (e.g., vehicles, emission systems, and HVAC systems) that are already in wide use. Seldon has successfully produced thousands of linear feet of a related carbon nanotube media  proving that the media can b easily manufactured.

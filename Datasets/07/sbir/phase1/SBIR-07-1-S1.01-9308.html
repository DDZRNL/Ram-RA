		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to employ a recently developed, efficient, high-power, heavily-doped Tm:silica-fiber technology as a high-gain fiber pre-amplifier and as a fiber-laser-pump for the laser crystal Ho:YLF to provide a 2050-nm source for remote-sensing applications, including coherent DIAL systems. The resultant source has the potential for much higher electrical efficiency than current technology. One of our innovations is the use of a directly diode-pumped, heavily-doped Tm:silica fiber laser as the pump, to provide efficient conversion of electrical power to optical pump power. The second innovation is the use of heavily-doped Tm:silica fiber as a high-gain pre-amplifier for a low-power 2050-nm master oscillator. The third innovation is made possible by the high gain available from our fiber-laser-pumped Ho:YLF amplifiers. In contrast to seeded oscillators, our laser system has enough gain to amplify a cw, externally-modulated, single-frequency laser, allowing control of the pulsewidth and wavelength while preserving the frequency stability of the source. The use of a Tm-fiber preamplifier simplifies the system architecture and increases the system efficiency. In the Phase I effort, we plan on demonstrating the amplification of a cw, single-frequency laser, as well as developing designs for complete compact, efficient mJ-level lidar sources.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed work has direct application to NASA coherent lidar programs based on the use of eyesafe, 2000-nm region lasers. The system concept we propose provides improved performance, by the nature of the direct amplification of cw, single-frequency lasers, the potential for improvement in overall system efficiency and the reduction in the required number of diode pump lasers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are many commercial applications of coherent lidar that will become viable once their cost and complexity is reduced significantly.  That the system be eyesafe is definitely a requirement since concerns for public safety will outweigh any potential benefits of non-eyesafe sources.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

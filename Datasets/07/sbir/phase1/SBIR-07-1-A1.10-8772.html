		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A novel approach is proposed for the suppression of the aircraft's structural vibration to increase the resilience of the flight control law in the presence of the aeroelastic/aeroservoelastic (AE/ASE) interactions. Currently aircrafts with non-adaptive control laws usually include roll-off or notch filters to avoid AE/ASE interactions. However, if changes in the aircraft configuration are significant, the frequencies of the flexible modes of the aircraft may be shifted and the notch filters could become totally ineffective. With the proposed approach, the flexible modes can be consistently estimated in real-time via system identification algorithm. The identified flexible modes information is sought to be injected to the adaptive control algorithm to update a set of pre-chosen basis functions, These are the key elements for the effectiveness of the proposed method. As a result, undesirable effects of elastic modes will be suppressed while the whole system stability being maintained. Two case/analysis scenarios will be considered. First, the feedforward filter topology will be mainly used to reduce any atmospheric induced structural vibration of the aircraft. Second, the adaptive feedback control is triggered to suppress any AE/ASE interactions, and prevent any possible Flutter/Limit Cycle Oscillation (LCO) of the actual flexible aircraft.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Being capable of on-line estimation/monitoring of the elastic modes of the aircraft, the proposed adaptive control technology can be automatically adjusted to attenuate any potential adverse aeroelastic/aeroseroelastic effects of an aircraft before a sustained limit cycle and vehicle damage are encountered. Hence, the proposed project will assist NASA in its goal to achieve an integrated flight control system resilient to failures, damage, and upset conditions unforeseen during the development of the aircraft's original control law.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed adaptive feedforward/feedback control framework will have extensive application in non-NASA commercial applications. Firstly, due to the potential Flight Control System (FCS) benefits from avoiding notch filters, the proposed methodology can be used by military and commercial aircraft manufacturers for new aircraft designs, modifications and upgrades. Secondly, it brings a variety of applications in other industries. Among others it can be mentioned: (1) Acoustic noise cancellation in headphone devices; (2) Reduction of the noise level for rotating fans in computer servers; (3) Suppression and/or attenuation of vibrations in large satellite structures; (4) Cabin noise reduction for the next generation executive transport aircraft, such as the Marcel Dassualt's Falcon 7X. The noise source can be associated with engine or gust noise; (5) Vibration suppression across the automotive industry, such as vehicle's engine vibration, adaptively tuning of the suspension in formula 1 racing cars, and so on.

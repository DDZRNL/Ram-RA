		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Small Business Innovative Research project by Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) will develop an advanced high temperature heat pipe solar receiver that can be used for the production of oxygen from lunar regolith. ACT proposes a high temperature heat pipe solar receiver that can accept and and transfer the solar thermal energy to the lunar soil, thereby extracting oxygen. The heat pipe design will also be able to isothermalize the reactors, increasing the available area for soil evaporation, and consequently increasing the throughput and efficiency.  The overall objective of the Phase I and II programs is to develop a heat pipe solar receiver for the production of oxygen from regolith.  In Phase I, the principal objectives are to design the receiver, and fabricate and test a representative heat pipe under simulated conditions.  The Phase II program will fabricate and test the full scale heat pipe solar receiver.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary application is the development of a heat pipe solar receiver for oxygen production.  A lunar oxygen production plant is projected to provide breathable oxygen for astronauts a well as oxygen for rocket propulsion. The heat pipe solar receiver could also be used for materials processing. There is a vast amount of resources on the moon that could be processed into materials such as concrete, cast and sintered basalt, fiberglass and metals such as aluminum.  Anorthite, available on the moon, could be processed using the furnace to produce aluminum, calcium and silica materials.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Remote materials processing is a second application for both NASA and commercial industries.  The heat pipe solar receiver could be used for remote materials processing where there is insufficient electricity or funding to operate expensive furnaces.

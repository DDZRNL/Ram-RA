		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		CSA Engineering proposes the design of an adaptive aeroelastic mode suppression for advanced fly-by-wire aircraft, which will partition the modal suppression function from the rigid-body Flight Control System (FCS).  CSA is recognized as having world-class expertise in the areas structural dynamics, vibration control, and control-structure interaction.  Phase 1 will leverage expertise in structural dynamics and system-identification to develop adaptive filtering algorithms which operate in both the spatial and time domains to identify/estimate key aeroelastic generalized (modal) DOF and suppress aeroservoelastic interactions while minimizing the degradation of phase margin with respect to the FCS.  During Phase 1, CSA will develop an end-to-end aeroelastic aircraft dynamic model of appropriate complexity as well as related sensors and measurement systems which will support the adaptive mode suppression effort.  Sensors and measurement systems will be evaluated concurrently with adaptive filtering algorithms with regard to convergence, stability, and robustness.  Filter architecture parameterization and constraints will be investigated.  The goal of this development is to partition the suppression of aeroservoelastic interactions separate from the rigid body FCS, enabling FCS design and configuration/adaptation to be independent of aeroservoelastic considerations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology will be applicable to manned and unmanned vehicles and will enable safe operation in the presence of large uncertainties, component failures and system changes.  This research will enable the R&D of others who are working with NASA on adaptive flight control by addressing the area of aeroservoelasticity and allowing others to focus on other core flight control aspects.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The ability to field adaptive fault-tolerant flight control systems will undoubtedly be of interest to developers of civil transport aircraft from the standpoint of improved ride quality and safety, especially if such technologies can readily be certified for such applications.  Advances in adaptive flight control will serve future growth in air traffic in the US, continuing to reduce the fatal accident rate over time.  Potential customers for CSA's algorithms, sensor subsystems and control systems are aerospace and defense companies with government often being the upstream customer.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase I SBIR proposal describes proposed development of a conceptual design for a Self-Calibrating Vector Helium Magnetometer (SVHM) for design and fabrication of a SVHM brass-board model in Phase II. The SVHM instrument is capable of making both scalar and vector component measurements of Earth and planetary magnetic fields. The SVHM innovation is use of the scalar field value to self-calibrate the vector measurements thereby eliminating the three fluxgate vector magnetometers and an independent scalar magnetometer usually required to correct for fluxgate drifts and offsets. The SVM concept was demonstrated under an ESTO IIP contract. The SVHM concept can achieve a dynamic range of +/-100,000 nT, vector and scalar accuracy with self-calibration of 1 nT, and sensitivity of 5 pT /©Hz. Miniaturization of the SVHM instrument to meet volume, power and mass goals will be achieved using fiber-coupled laser pump source and resonance drive, which permits miniaturization of the SVM sensor by reducing helium cell volume, by a factor of 10. The feasibility of designing and fabricating a brass-board SVHM model using advanced laser and digital components will be established in Phase I. A self-calibration and test protocol will be developed for demonstration in Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The SVHM will have a variety of commercial and military applications including measurements of the magnetic fields around the Earth in support of monitoring the solar magnetic field activities for telecommunication applications and climate change predictions. The SVHM will be used at the Earth's surface for geophysical airborne and surface magnetic prospecting as well as the new standard for geomagnetic observatories. The laser-pumped scalar helium magnetometer  technology is currently being developed in high sensitivity (0.3pT©Hz) magnetometers for use by the US Navy for submarine detection and mine countermeasures applications. The SVHM capabilities of outstanding accuracy, scalar and vector measurements, omni-directionality without dead zones, and high-frequency detection will open up a variety of applications in commercial security and surveillance applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Laser magnetometers can become the new state-of-the-art instrument for magnetic observatories and scientific instrumentation for geomagnetic investigations. A combination of absolute accuracy, greatly improved sensitivity, omni-directionality, and high frequency detection could also open up new applications for portable magnetometers.

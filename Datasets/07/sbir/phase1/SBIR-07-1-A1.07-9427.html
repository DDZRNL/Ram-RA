		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Impact Technologies, in cooperation with Raytheon, proposes to develop and demonstrate an innovative prognostics approach for aircraft digital electronics. The proposed non-invasive prognostic approach consists of advanced software and a minimal sensing, focused on incipient fault detection, isolating failure modes and predicting remaining useful life using improved prognostic models. The innovations will include development and validation of physics of failure models, applicable to a broad range of CMOS digital systems; associated damage accumulation models; and a signal processing and feature extraction approach for detecting and isolating VLSI failure modes.  In this approach, cradle-to-grave health state awareness is achieved through the use of model-based assessments in the absence of fault indications, and by updating these model-based assessments with sensed information. The PowerPC MPC7447 microprocessor will be used for validation testing during this program based on its use in such systems as the F-35 fighter Integrated Core Processor (ICP) and the fact that it is representative of the wide spread CMOS technology found in modern digital devices.  Finally, a commercialization path beginning with testing of the technologies within Raytheon's Labs will be presented along with the team's vision of how e-Prognostic technologies can be transitioned into safety critical commercial and military digital.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA systems, ranging from flight controls to data and signal processing systems will benefit from these technological advancements. Any digital system incorporating Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) and Large Scale Integrated (LSI) CMOS technology can benefit from the developed technologies. These digital systems are used in computing, communications, data transport, and digital control systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The development of e-Prognostics for aircraft digital electronic boards will provide multiple benefits including: improved safety associated with system operations, reduced life cycle or total ownership costs, and increased availability of commercial and military systems. Furthermore, the work will contain many generic elements that are readily applicable to a wide range of related applications. The integrated e-Prognostic approaches, techniques, and specific algorithms could also be implemented in a wide range of ground-based and naval military applications, as well as in civilian commercial aviation applications (passenger aircraft, cargo transports, business jets, private aircraft, etc.).

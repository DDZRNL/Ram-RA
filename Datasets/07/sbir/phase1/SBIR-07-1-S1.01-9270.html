		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR will develop single frequency cw laser technology for 2um lidar and UV interferometer locking control critical to NASA missions that will measure atmospheric winds and aerosols. NASA recently completed the Earth Science Decadal Study that identified atmospheric global wind and aerosol measurement as high priority missions with recommended satellite deployments within the next decade. Our general approach to this SBIR is to perform proof of concept research that results in optical designs that can be readily integrated into existing flight ready hardware. After Phase 2 we anticipate the technology will readily transfer to NASA mission use. We expect successful completion of the proposed work to increase the TRL from 4 to 5.  <BR><BR>The innovation of this SBIR is the development of space-qualifiable CW single-frequency lasers at 2 µm and 355 nm, products that are not commercially available. Numerous pulsed 355 nm sources are available for commercial applications but they are not space-qualifiable. There are several scientific investigations of 355 nm CW lasers described in the literature but no effort has been made to create high vibration aircraft nor space qualified products available to NASA. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The lasers that would be developed in the proposed SBIR would meet the following NASA needs.<BR><BR>1. We have supplied the GSFC researchers with the pulsed single frequency 355 nm transmitters for both their GLOW and TWiLiTE systems.  They have also expressed an interest in a stable CW 355 nm laser for locking the etalon filters in those systems<BR>2.  We have supplied NASA LaRC researchers with the pulsed laser transmitters that they are using on their original High Spectral Resolution Lidar aerosol lidar system as well as their next generation High Spectral Resolution Lidar/Ozone DIAL lidar systems.  They have expressed an interest in a stable CW source at 1064 nm for seeding the primary pulsed oscillator, 532 nm for locking to an iodine absorption line, and 355 nm for locking a receiver etalon.<BR>3.  Both NOAA and NASA LaRC have expressed an interest in procuring stable CW 2 µm lasers for use in their coherent wind lidar systems. <BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The non-NASA commercial potential for the lasers we would develop in the proposed SBIR include the following.<BR><BR>1.  For use in a direct detection wind lidar system that would to fly on NOAA's Gulfstream IV-SP aircraft.  <BR>2. As the seed laser for a water vapor DIAL laser transmitter we recently proposed in response RFQ from the University Center for Atmospheric Research.<BR>3.  We have recently delivered field hardened single frequency lasers to Michigan Aerospace Corporation, Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems, and the Air Force Research Labs for wind lidar and space-based demonstrator applications.  Being able to supply the field hardened/space-qualifiable seed lasers needed for future versions of these systems would be a new product line for Fibertek.<BR>4.  NOAA researchers have expressed an interest in procuring stable CW 2 µm lasers for use in their coherent wind lidar systems.  <BR>

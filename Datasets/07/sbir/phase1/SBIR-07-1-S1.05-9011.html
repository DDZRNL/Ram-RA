		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Aymont Technology, Inc. (Aymont) will demonstrate the feasibility of SiC p-i-n avalanche photodiodes (APD) arrays.  Aymont will demonstrate 4 x 4 arrays of 2 mm2 APDs for visible-blind high-sensitivity UV detection.  These arrays will exhibit high gain (10^6), high quantum efficiency (peak < 50%), and high speed ().  They will demonstrate scalability, allowing for larger arrays (20 x 20) in Phase 2.  They will give nearly 2x the quantum efficiency of other solid state solutions such as Si at UV wavelengths.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High-sensitivity, large-area ultraviolet light detection is essential for detection of species that may indicate presence of organic processes such as sulfur oxides, hydrocarbons, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, ozone, and nitrogen oxides.  Better, higher resolution ultraviolet detection than currently available is necessary for future missions. Arrays of SiC APDs will meet the imaging and analysis needs of TPF and subsequent possible missions such as Life Finder and the Large UV/Optical Telescope over the next two decades.  Specific NASA missions using near ultraviolet detectors include Terrestrial Planet Finder, and NASA's Astronomical Search for Origins program.  These missions require exceptional sensitivity for species detectable in the UV that may indicate organic processes, the presence of water, or perhaps life.  These species include sulfur oxides, hydrocarbons, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, ozone, and nitrogen oxides.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The SiC APD arrays can be used for flame sensing, environmental monitoring, biodetection, gamma detection in combination with appropriate scintillator crystals for oil-well drilling and radiation detection applications, and other applications currently covered by photomultiplier tubes (PMT).  Achievement of performance comparable to or better than PMTs without need for high supply voltages (1000V), at smaller size and weight, at faster speeds, and at lower component cost will allow these APDs to replace PMTs in many commercial applications.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

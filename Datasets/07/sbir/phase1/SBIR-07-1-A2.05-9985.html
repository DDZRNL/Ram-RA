		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Turbulent flows associated with advanced aerodynamic designs represent a considerable challenge for accurate prediction. For example, the flow past low-speed wings requires the representation of complex physics involving separation onset/progression (both leading-and trailing-edge), vortex/viscous interactions, merging shear layers with strong curvature, juncture flows and jet-exhaust flows  all phenomena that are not amenable to robust modeling and simulation by traditional grid-based techniques.  Recent advances in the technology of gridfree turbulent flow simulation via vortex methods, most notably as manifested in the VorCat code, has raised the possibility of efficiently and accurately capturing the behavior of aerodynamic flows for use in design and performance analysis. The goal of this SBIR phase I proposal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of VorCat in simulating high lift airfoil flows  both in regards to computational speed and accuracy. This will form the basis for developing a tool able to well model arbitrary aerodynamic flows past finite wings including complicating features such as flow control devices in the Phase II study.  Upon completion of Phase II, a validated technology will be ready for use by industrial and governmental users.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This project brings to NASA a means for circumventing the persistent limitations of traditional turbulence modeling and simulation techniques that have delayed or prevented progress across a spectrum of innovative flow technologies. With this project NASA will be able to more freely and effectively pursue true design innovations and make better use of corroborating physical experiments. Some particular examples where VorCat can have high impact for NASA include supplying transient pressure data for evaluating noise generation, vehicle design optimization, and safety.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The tools derived from this research are of direct benefit to airplane manufacturers faced with difficult design problems as well as numerous companies engaged in fluids engineering in the automotive and shipbuilding industries, among many others. The VorCat technology that will be perfected in this project can also form the basis for studies including heat and mass transfer and thus have an impact on countless more companies in such fields as electronic cooling, chemical process industry, pharmaceuticals and so forth.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The goal of rHEALTH sensor is a universal handheld sensor that can provide rapid, low-cost complete blood count (CBC) with differential, electrolyte analysis, and potential for advanced lab tests such as biomarker analysis all in one single microfluidic sensor.  The first innovation is that the device can perform multiple lab measurements in a single microfluidic device.  Most sensors can only perform one test at a time, such as CBC analysis.  Adequate health monitoring requires at the minimum measurement of CBC and electrolytes.  Second, our microfluidic chip is reusable because of its flow-through design.  This minimizes cost and obviates the need for bulky consumables.  Third, our sensor uses fluorescent analyte sensing dyes and fluorescence technology, which allows the sensor to measure a broad range of analytes.  In Phase I, we plan to fabricate a prototype microfluidic sensor and test it for its ability to perform both CBC and electrolyte measurements.  Upon proof-of-principle, in Phase II, our goal is to complete and deliver a prototype rHEALTH sensor for NASA to monitor astronaut health on a routine and cost-effective basis.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		(1) Real-time health monitoring.  The proposed rHEALTH sensor is designed to monitor daily astronaut status so that adverse health events can be managed.  (2) Real-time intervention.  The ability to measure routine health status allows clinical intervention at appropriate times.  (3)  Electrolyte measurement on a daily basis for long space flight. (4) CBC measurements on a daily basis.  (5) Measurement of cardiac biomarkers for chest pain to rule out myocardial infarction.  (6) Measurement of CBC and electrolytes in response to astronaut illness.  (7) Monitoring of astronaut renal function to assess volume status.  (8) Tracking of bone biomarkers and calcium levels throughout duration of missions to assess intangible bone loss and remodeling.  <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		(1) Real-time health monitoring.  Development of the rHEALTH allows monitoring of health status in real-time at the bedside or doctor's office.  (2) Real-time intervention.  Clinical intervention can be accomplished rapidly in acute situations with a handheld monitor.  (3) Measurement of daily hematocrit for patients on coumadin or other anti-coagulation to diagnose early blood loss.  (4) Detection of acute myocardial damage rapidly and outside the hospital so that life-saving therapy can be administered for heart attack patients.  (5) Monitoring resolution of a patient's infection by tracking white blood cell counts throughout a prolonged antibiotic course.  (6) Monitoring daily renal function of patients with kidney transplants or those with end-stage renal disease.  (7) Measurement of athletes volume status during prolonged training for early diagnosis and dehydration.  (8) Daily monitoring of electrolyte status for those individuals taking diuretics.  Frequently, diuretics such as furosemide may cause hypokalemia and need to have their daily electrolyte status assessed.<BR>

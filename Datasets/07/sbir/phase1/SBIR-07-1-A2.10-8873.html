		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Rotorcraft engineers traditionally use the wind tunnel to evaluate and <BR>finalize designs. Insufficient correlation between wind tunnel results and flight tests,<BR>have been often attributed in part to uncertainty in blockage corrections.<BR>Estimation of rotor blockage is significantly more complex than bluff body<BR>blockage as the correction depends on operational characteristics such <BR>as rotor RPM and thrust produced.<BR>This proposal offers to develop a design tool, which can simulate a complete <BR>rotorcraft inside a wind tunnel including all the facility effects.<BR>At the heart of the innovation are:<BR>1. An automated hybrid grid generator.<BR>2. A robust and economical incompressible flow solver for the <BR>grid system.<BR>3. Momentum source based rotor model that is suitable and economical <BR>for simulating multiple rotors including the drive fans of the wind tunnel.<BR>Phase I will develop the proof-of-concept and will use unstructured Cartesian <BR>grid for the model and wind tunnel. The wind tunnel will be modeled with the <BR>diffuser, test section and nozzle. <BR>In phase II, the tool will be extended to hybrid grid with viscous grid near <BR>solid surfaces and will include drive fans of the tunnel.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The design tool to be developed under this initiative will find wide usage throughout <BR>NASA where wind tunnel testing is integral to any design study.<BR>The tool can be effectively used for rotorcrafts and <BR>V/STOL aircrafts where quantification of<BR>blockage effects is complex.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The computational wind tunnel to be developed will be an asset to other government agencies<BR>including ARMY, NASA and AIR FORCE and industry where wind tunnel testing of rotorcraft <BR>and V/STOL aircrafts is routine.<BR>In short, the tool is a compliment to all wind tunnel testing.<BR>

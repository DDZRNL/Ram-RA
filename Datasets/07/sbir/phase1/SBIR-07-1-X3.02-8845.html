		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose a new spray drying technology for the recovery and recycle of water while stabilizing the solid wastes or residues as found in advanced life support systems.  The proposed effort is focused on the recovery of water from concentrated waste water recovery system brine and other concentrates.  Hypogravity and microgravity environments will make space based systems compact thus reducing its equivalent system mass.  The application of spray drying to brine is a first step in the development of a space-based system but spray drying is likely to be applicable to the  dewatering and stabilization of solid wastes.  Spray drying is a one step continuous process where a solution, slurry, sludge or paste is transformed from a fluid state to dried masses by spraying the feed into a hot drying medium.  The resulting dry products are granules or agglomerates and the drying medium bearing the removed moisture.  Using one of several methods the drying medium yields the recovered water.  The exact nature of the dried solid and recovered moisture depends on the physical and chemical properties of the feed and the design and operation of the drier.<BR><BR>At the end of Phase II the technology will be at a TRL = 6.<BR>

		Hypo and microgravity spray drying technology will largely close the water recycle loop for long interplanetary missions, and lunar and mars surface missions.  Spray drying can be applied to several points in the advanced life support water recycle system including water recovery from solid wastes and the stabilization of the solid residues with low ESM.  The proposed Phase I work will provide NASA with bench testing performance data and a design for a system capable of rendering concentrated aqueous solutions with viscosities and heat capacities similar to those relevant to life support systems.    <BR><BR>Component interchangeability allows a wide variety of input streams while avoiding cross contamination and other real or perceived problems associated with the processing of potable and non-potable streams.  Advanced controls allow for process optimization of any waste stream without bench tests or prior characterization of the waste stream.   <BR><BR>The proposed work will serve as a foundation for more advanced space manufacturing operations, including resource recovery, space manufacturing and any other area where efficient, safe physical separation of solids and liquids is required.  The work proposed here will lay the foundation for future hypo and microgravity spray drying resource recovery system designs.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Nanomaterials seeks the opportunity to provide NASA with new life support tools, but as important to this goal is the opportunity to explore new production tools so that we can reach a wider customer base.  We believe the proposed work will be directly applicable to our in-house materials processing needs.  This often involves the recovery of valuable solvents during the processing of our materials.   Spray drying is a process with applications throughout industry and products touching every aspect of nearly every American.  The application of spray drying to space water recovery problems will spawn new development.  Because its use is so wide spread, it will have great economic impact.  One innovative aspect of our proposal will likely lead to its application to materials not currently processed via spray drying and may lead to less expensive proprietary pharmaceutical compounds.

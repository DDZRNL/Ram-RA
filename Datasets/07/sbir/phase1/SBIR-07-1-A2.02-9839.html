		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		For many applications involving liquid injection, the ability to predict the details of the breakup process is often limited due to the complexity of the two-phase phenomena.  Likewise, the ability to experimentally characterize these phenomena is also limited due in part to the need to rely upon visualization tools which are inherently qualitative.  As a result, the ability to validate predictions using these diagnostic tools is also limited.  In recent years, visualization diagnostics have evolved substantially in terms of spatial and temporal resolution.  The advancements, coupled with a tool to conveniently quantify the results obtained relative to the breakup process offer the potential for a marked increase in understanding of this phenomenon.  The proposed effort will develop such a tool that will be applied initially to the problem of liquid injection into a crossflow.  The typical characteristics associated with this type of liquid breakup, such as column flattening, bending, fracture point, dynamics, etc. will be automatically quantified using the tool proposed.  The project will utilize existing results obtained with state-of-the-art high speed imaging.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The project will result in a novel experimental technique that can be applied to existing and new imaging based diagnostic available at NASA.  As applied to various two-phase flow problems, the tool developed will facilitate CFD validation as well as increased understanding of the breakup of liquids for a variety of applications.  The tool is particularly well suited for quantitative comparison of experimental results with predictions from advanced simulation techniques such as LES and/or VOF or other high fidelity phase interface tracking methods.  ERC will work closely with NASA to focus the Phase I efforts on areas/imaging problems of immediate interest to NASA.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The product produced by the proposed project will be of interest to end users of advanced high speed imaging systems that are currently being applied to liquid injection problems.  It will also be of interest to those using CFD calculations coupled with experiments.  As a result, the potential for deployment of the product within software provided by vendors of advanced imaging systems as well as CFD vendors is significant.  The understanding provided through this efficient analysis tools can potentially lead to breakthroughs in models for liquid breakup phenomena which can then be applied in a wide variety of applications involving liquid injection/application.

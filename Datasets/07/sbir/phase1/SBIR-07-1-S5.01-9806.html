		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We shall develop wide temperature range DC-DC boost converters that can be fabricated using commercial CMOS foundries. The boost converters will increase the low voltage supply (~ 0.7 to 3V) of an advanced CMOS integrated circuit to the higher values (3-10V) required for integrated command/control/drive electronics for sensors, actuators and instrumentation. The high voltage capability is a result of our patented, CMOS compatible transistor technology that is radiation tolerant (TID>1 MRad), SEL immune and capable of wide temperature range operation (-196C to +150C). This new transistor technology has been demonstrated at multiple foundries and advanced device models are available for circuit design and simulation. The DC-DC boost converters will be integrated directly with the CMOS components to provide a single chip solution, greatly reducing the number of active and passive components that would otherwise be required. By allowing enhanced voltage operation in future CMOS technology nodes we will be avoiding many of the obsolescence problems facing NASA missions that are dependent upon commercial electronics. The circuits will be designed to operate in low temperature environments that experience wide temperature swings such as those found on the moon, Mars, Titan, Europa and comets.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Wide temperature range DC-DC boost converters that are compatible with advanced CMOS technologies will be widely applicable to NASA science and exploration missions scheduled for the next decade and beyond. It is expected that sensors and actuators based on micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) will feature heavily in future NASA missions. Often these MEMS components use operating voltages that exceed the anticipated CMOS values. The current solution requires additional interface and control electronics and associated point-of-load power sources, with a corresponding increase in mass, volume and system complexity. By integrating a low-input-voltage/high-output-voltage capability directly on an advanced CMOS component we are providing an elegant solution to the potential obsolescence problem facing MEMS-based sensors, actuators and other instrumentation components. By developing components for wide temperature range applications (-180C to +150C) we are enabling missions that will benefit from components to be mounted directly in the Lunar and Martian environments i.e. outside of any thermally controlled warm box. These components will also be of use in missions to Venus that employ environmental chambers with temperatures controlled to < 150C.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The MESFET technology we are developing will have widespread applications in commercial electronics, wherever low-power, mixed-signal circuits are required. SOI MESFETs offer significant 'added-value' to existing SOI product lines because of their high voltage capability that greatly exceeds the maximum operating voltage of the SOI MOSFETs. This will allow new SOI products to be developed, without additional manufacturing costs. Examples include the DC-DC boost converters described in this proposal as well as multiplexers, voltage and current regulators, and precision voltage references. Circuits that are required to drive inductive loads such as certain types of power amplifiers (Class E and F) will also benefit from the high breakdown voltage of the SOI MESFETs<BR>We expect the non-NASA commercial applications of SOI MESFETs to be significant. NASA will benefit from the strong leverage that a cost-effective commercial SOI MESFET technology will provide to all extreme environment electronics applications.<BR>

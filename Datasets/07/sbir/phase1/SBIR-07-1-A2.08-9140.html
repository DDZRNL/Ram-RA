		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The development of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) has received considerable attention in recent years for both military and civilian uses.  MAVs typically suffer from operation in an extremely low Reynolds number flight regime.  At these very low Reynolds numbers, the aerodynamic flow features can be nonlinear and are dominated by laminar separation and separation bubble effects, which can be a source of poor performance from both an aerodynamic and stability and control standpoint.  If a stable platform is required for sensor effectiveness, or the vehicle is to be controlled by a relatively inexperienced operator, controllability of a vehicle operating in this very low Reynolds number regime can be a critical factor in determining the success or failure of a design.  Flight control systems implemented on this class of vehicles are severely constrained in size and available power.  They suffer from inadequate knowledge of the vehicle state, both statically and dynamically.  Rolling Hills Research Corporation proposes to use a simple and robust biologically inspired air data system capable of providing instantaneous vehicle state information, including rates, to provide revolutionary stability, control, and performance for these ultra low Reynolds number vehicles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed MAV air data system has significant potential application in several NASA programs. The robust and simple sensing technology could be fielded in several NASA aircraft unmanned systems, from MAVs to Mars exploratory aircraft.  NASA designers will be eager to exploit the advantages of the proposed air data system on vehicles requiring augmented control and stability in space constrained, low power environment. The technology will allow controllability and performance levels for this class of aircraft previously unobtainable.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced sensing technology in the form of a robust MAV air data sensor and flight control will provide RHRC with a unique and highly marketable product.  The market for MAVs is expected to grow substantially in the coming years.  The technology developed by RHRC under this program will allow controllability and performance levels for this class of aircraft previously unobtainable.  A robust, cost effective, and low power system would be highly desirable in all classes of MAV vehicles.  Considering the recent proliferation of small UAVs and MAV designs, the commercialization potential for the technology is excellent.  RHRC will be able to provide complete MAV air data/flight control systems.  The technology can also be easily licensed.

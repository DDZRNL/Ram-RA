		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Single frequency high power lasers have been considered to be an enabling technology for NASA's Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). PolarOnyx proposes, for the first time, an ultra low noise high power (> 1W, scalable to 10W) single frequency (< 1 KHz) fiber laser source to meet with the requirement of solicitation. It is a specialty fiber based MOPA. The mode selection in seed laser is achieved by using a fiber based ultra narrow bandpass filter. The side mode suppression ratio can thus be suppressed over 80 dB. In the amplifier stage, our unique spectral shaping technology enables us to reduce the SBS and ASE noise significantly by using a commercially available YDF and reuse the residual pump to further increase the efficiency. Radiation hardness will be intensively studied in selection of space qualified fibers and components. A tabletop experiment will be demonstrated in Phase I time frame for proof of concept. A compact prototype will be delivered in Phase II meeting major space qualification such as radiation hardness.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Immediate NASA applications include LISA, coherent communications and lidars. By frequency doubling to 532 nm and quadrupling to 266 nm, it will be able to find other applications for optical sensing systems. Other military applications include coherent systems for airborne lidars and laser transmitter for satellite communications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed fiber laser can be directly used in space, aircraft, and satellite applications such as LIDAR systems, remote sensing system, optical fiber sensors, illuminator system, and phase array antenna system. Single frequency lasers represent the next generation of critical optical components. The market is growing and will be of great potential for the next a few years. There are a number of commercial applications for the proposed fiber laser. These include material processing (several billions market), medical instruments (several hundreds of millions market), and fiber telecommunications (tens of billions market).

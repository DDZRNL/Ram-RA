		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A key component of NASA's human exploration programs is a system that monitors the health of the crew during the space missions. The wearable physiological monitor proposed by Linea Research Corporation can be used to continuously observe the beat to beat blood pressure. The monitor can be used to observe the physiological effect of various countermeasures against prolonged exposures to reduced gravitational environments. The proposed device will allow the monitoring of the pharmacological effect on blood pressure over prolonged periods. Currently, beat to beat monitoring of blood pressure is done primarily in hospital settings through invasive procedures involving percutaneous insertion of catheters into the radial or brachial arteries. While non-invasive beat to beat blood pressures based on either the Penaz method or arterial applanation tonometry are currently available, they each have limitations. In addition, all monitors are based on large stationary equipment that requires the subject to be immobile. Successful implementation of the proposed program will result in an accurate wearable beat to beat blood pressure measurement.

		Autonomous medical care for the crew during human exploration missions is critical in preventing degradation in health due to adverse physiological responses to space flight environments. A wearable multi-parameter physiological monitor that includes continuous blood pressure measurements will be crucial in providing proper medical support for both normal activities and medical emergencies. The device can be used to monitor the long term physiological effects of hypogravity and the effects of the countermeasures against hypogravitational environments. The device can also be used to monitor the health status of crew during extravehicular activities (EVA). The system will be developed with the goal of implementing the monitor as a wearable device which necessitates low power consumption and compact and lightweight form factor. The size criterion is a key factor for space applications as launch costs are directly determined by mass and volume.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed device can fundamentally change the way beat to beat blood pressure is measured in clinical settings. Currently, an accurate measurement of the beat to beat blood pressure requires an insertion of a pressure transducer into the blood vessel. While non-invasive methods that use the Panaz method or applanation tonometry exist, they do not provide the accuracy and repeatability provided by the invasive method. The goal of the proposed research is to develop an accurate beat to beat blood pressure monitoring device that will eventually eliminate the need for cannulation. The wearable nature of the device also provides significant market opportunities. There is a strong need for devices that can provide ambulatory monitoring of physiological parameters for the elderly or for individuals with chronic illness. There is also a market need for devices that can track the physiological status of individuals whose health is at risk from environmental hazards in their working environment (e.g. soldiers, first responders, mountain climbers, etc.).

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Numerous spacecraft component databases have been developed to support NASA, DoD, and contractor design centers and design tools.  Despite the clear utility of component databases for improving and accelerating the spacecraft design process, they are observably uneconomic for individual organizations to build and maintain otherwise there would be several that were actively maintained and growing.  The problem is not the challenge of architecting the database or identifying the component types and data elements.  In fact, many organizations have succeeded in developing excellent solutions that have languished due to the cost of populating and maintaining them.  <BR>Microcosm is focused on developing an economically viable solution to creating a sustainable component database.  The approach is four-fold: 1. Reduce the cost of gathering/maintaining data by leveraging web-based data with automated gathering and monitoring tools; 2. Drive sufficient value to component suppliers such that they are motivated to supply and maintain their own data; 3. Supply data to a broad range of users and organizations; and 4. Enable value-added contributions from users via venues like wikis, discussion rooms, links to relevant websites.  This solution will stand on its own as a viable business, and provide increasing value to customers (suppliers and users) over time.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The spacecraft component database system promises to be used broadly within NASA, with enterprise versions supporting spacecraft/mission design tools and design teams at centers focused on space system development.  In addition, a much broader group of NASA users will likely access the system via the web or internal networks on an occasional basis.  This will bring tremendous value to NASA in terms of improved design processes, reduced design schedules, and reduced non-value-added design activities.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications are essentially the same as those for NASA.  DoD space organizations, support contractors and commercial space system developers will likely implement enterprise versions to support design and procurement systems as well as to enable addition and management of proprietary data as part of the system.  Smaller space related businesses will in some cases use the enterprise version, but will often rely on web based access as will a broad range of occasional users.  Additionally, component suppliers will use web access or supplier focused applications to view and maintain their component data in the system.  Foreign users and organizations will also access the system particularly as it expands to include a broad range of non-US made components.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

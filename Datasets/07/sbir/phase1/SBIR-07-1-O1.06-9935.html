		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The objective of this research is to propose a reliable, lightweight, programmable, multi-band, multi-mode, miniaturized frequency-agile EVA software defined radio (SDR) that supports data telemetry, voice, and high-rate video.<BR><BR>The proposed radios would be a part of an advanced, incrementally expandable ad hoc wireless network. For improved reliability and to assure stand-alone functionality, the network would support a real-time 3D location function using mobile-assisted navigation and utilizing TOA/TDOA methods.<BR><BR>To achieve unparalleled power consumption efficiency, Lexycom proposes the use of energy-aware packet routing and cognitive selection of operating point of the transceivers. Along with the scheduling, we plan to use an innovative RF packetization technique aimed to virtually obsolete negotiations between the network nodes prior to change in transmitted signal parameter on a packet-by-packet basis.<BR><BR>We anticipate that after completion of the Phase I, Lexycom will be more than capable of delivering an operational prototype EVA SDR for further evaluation and enhancements of the chosen concepts and approaches.<BR><BR>Since Lexycom Technologies is the manufacturer of an FCC certified, reconfigurable, small form factor and low power consumption SDRs, we are in an ideal position to transfer and expand our knowledge base from our existing radio platform over to the EVA radio.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		With lunar and interplanetary exploration becoming more and more common, the need for a highly reliable, reconfigurable communication system is paramount. Once established, a multi-band software re-configurable radio system has the potential to perform a multitude of functions.<BR><BR>Hence, the state-of-the-art radios designed under this proposal would provide the required building blocks for independent remote communication and navigation networks. Cognitive functionality and stand-alone accurate 3D location capabilities of such networks are a necessity for both manned and unmanned missions and outposts. The scalable, re-configurable, low power consumption concept used in the proposed EVA SDR design would enable the use of such devices for battery-powered handheld operation.<BR><BR>The proposed incrementally expandable ad hoc wireless network architecture can be easily adapted for use in the exploring not only lunar, but the environments of other planets. A system such as this could provide the building blocks for future planetary communication and navigation demands.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Low power consumption radios with adaptive programmability and interoperability that are capable of providing communication and navigation functions would be in demand for defense training and field activities, first responder emergency activities as well as remote monitoring and control applications.<BR><BR>On-the-fly programmability coupled with navigational functionality would allow defense operations to optimize their communications.   An adaptive network would prevent jamming and eavesdropping; the stand-alone 3D navigational functionality would allow tracking and monitoring of all tagged assets even inside a mine.<BR><BR>Interoperability capability between firemen, police and medical personnel would be extremely beneficial in emergency situations when first responder activities need to be highly coordinated between several different groups.<BR><BR>Remote monitoring and control of well heads, pipelines, and tank levels would benefit a wide variety of industries by providing an interactive communications platform that could also track personnel and assets.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed Phase I program will demonstrate the feasibility of the in-space production of large aperture antenna structures.  The use of a novel open cell foam, previously developed for NASA space antennas, will allow the deployment of reflectors at low cost and very low transport volume compared to currently used technologies like solid metal or mesh reflector.  The use of a foam substrate also dampens thermal expansion distortions of the reflector shape, assuring high surface accuracy.<BR>The shape accuracy of the antenna will be ensured by using Rigidization on Command<SUP>TM</SUP> technology to form a rigid mold from an inflatable.  This approach allows to verify the correct antenna shape before the structure is stabilized using foam.<BR>The development effort will be supported by computer modeling of the necessary strength parameters for a very large antenna structure based on foam support.<BR>

		he foam supported antenna structures are directly applicable to NASA's need for very large aperture antennas for interplanetary mission date relays in the 10  20 m size range.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The eventual markets for inflatable and deployable spacecraft are extremely large, particularly for communications antennas and radars.  In the commercial sector, over 200 satellites are expected to be launched in the next 10 years to meet consumer demand for cellular phones and other communication devices.  A large number of military satellites are also expected to be launched in that timeframe.  Current mesh antennas sell for $25-40 million each.  Self-deploying antennas using related foam technology should be priced in the $3-4 million range each.  As such, self-deploying and inflatable spacecraft should claim the majority of the market for antennas and radiometers.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

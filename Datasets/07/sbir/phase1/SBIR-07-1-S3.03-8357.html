		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Hybrid photovoltaic cells that combine nanostructured inorganic semiconductors with organic conductors such as the cell proposed, show promise for energy generation in technical applications due to the higher efficiencies and significantly lower costs resulting from cheaper materials and easier manufacturing processes.  These hybrid solar cells can be tailored to have efficiencies comparable to inorganic solar cells hitherto studied. Quantum Dot (QD) semiconductor based photovoltaics exhibit promise for fabrication of lightweight and efficient sources of power, especially in conjugation with organic semiconductors. In this Phase I effort, Materials Modification Inc. will develop a novel CIGS quantum dot enhanced hybrid photovoltaic cell that exhibits promise of a conversion efficiency of 15-30% or even higher and good radiation resistance.  MMI's proprietary plasma process will be used to produce the CIGS quantum dots, which will be incorporated in a suitable organic semiconductor to fabricate simple, cheap and efficient photovoltaics.

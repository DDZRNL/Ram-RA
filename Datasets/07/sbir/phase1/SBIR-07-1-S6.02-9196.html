		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to develop a collection of computer tools and libraries called SciViz that enable researchers to visualize large scale data sets on HPC resources remotely from their workstations at interactive rates.  The proposed technology will interoperate with common existing scientific visualization software and provide equivalent core functionality optimized for very large data sets. Existing scientific visualization tools have specific limitations for large scale scientific data sets.  Of these four limitations can be seen as paramount: (a) Memory Management, (b) Remote Visualization, (c) Interactivity, and (d) Specificity.  SciViz overcomes these four issues and uses stack oriented approach in order to produce tools that can be more easily and widely adopted with minimal interruption within existing visualization environments. SciViz  will be an open source implementation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Our initial target markets are NASA supercomputing centers and heliophysics community where we already have an established contact base.  The situation within the heliosciences is representative of many other fields where there is no dominant visualization software in use and there exists considerable duplication of effort as each group tries to develop similar customization on their favorite visualization platform.  Often the limitation of the particular visualization software becomes evident after the individual or the group has spent a great deal of effort in building the particular customized features.   As the attached letters of support attest, there remains a strong need for visualization software for analysis of large data sets.  This select group of scientists who have agreed to serve as our beta testers are users of NASA's supercomputing systems.   By addressing the specific needs of this group, we hope to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution and enhancing user productivity and in so doing pave the way for infusion of SciViz into NASA's supercomputing system.  Through our connection with San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), we also plan to test and deploy our product at SDSC.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The amount of data collected and stored electronically is doubling every three years.  In the face of this unprecedented growth in the amount of data from simulations and instruments/spacecraft, our capability to manipulate, explore, and understand large datasets is growing only slowly. Scientific visualization which transforms raw data into vivid 2D or 3D images has been recognized as an effective way to understand large-scale datasets. However, most existing visualization methods do not scale well with the growing data size and other parts of a data analysis pipeline.  This is a problem affecting science, engineering, medicine and business.  According to Microsoft Partner Capacity Research Group, data visualization represents a US$2 billion worldwide market.  SciViz provides a solution that enables interactive visualization of large data sets.  As such, we expect strong marketing opportunities for SciViz within the federal government, scientific organizations, and commercial sector.  A critical business decision is open source vs. commercial approaches.   We plan to have SciViz as open source software. Our stack oriented approach rather than a framework driven method should produce tools that can be more easily and widely adopted with minimal interruption within existing visualization environments. This enables us to immediately reach market segments where VTK is already been deployed.

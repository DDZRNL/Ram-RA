		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		There are several ongoing challenges in non-contacting blade vibration and stress measurement systems that can address closely spaced modes and blade-to-blade variations (mistuning).  Traditional NSMS systems are applicable but have limitations due to the undersampling that is inherent in time-of-arrival data processing and the uncertainty that is introduced by inferring, as opposed to calculating, the mode of vibration.  <BR><BR>Based on Navy SBIR research, MSI is developing a radar-based blade vibration measurement system with the following capabilities:<BR>Provides a continuous time series of blade displacement data over a portion of a revolution (solving the undersampling problem).<BR>Includes data reduction algorithms to directly calculate the blade vibration frequency, modal displacement, and vibratory stress (solving the mode inference problem).<BR>Uses a single sensor per stage to monitor all of the blades on the stage.<BR><BR>The goals for the proposed project are to design and construct an innovative blade vibration measurement system with resolution capable of characterizing mistuning parameters and closely spaced modes of vibration.  Development and demonstration of such a system will provide substantially superior capabilities to current blade vibration technology.  Phase I demonstration testing will be conducted in MSI's laboratory with an existing instrumented compressor rig.  <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Improvements in blade vibration measurement capability will significantly reduce the cost and risk of development and operation of gas turbine engines.  The potential applications include any turbine engine ranging from gas turbine propulsion engines to industrial steam turbines used for power generation.  However, commercialization to existing NSMS users is the most direct and near term path.  The costs associated with maintenance, downtime, and readiness are already well established and understood by both military and industrial users, so an improved NSMS would be attractive to many types of customers.<BR><BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Successful project completion addresses two of the commercialization hurdles that face current NSMS technology especially for new users  physical complexity and technical complexity.  By characterizing closely spaced modes and mistuning parameters, and needing only a single sensor per stage, this project will lower the barrier to entry for new NSMS users.  This will serve to widen the user base and help insure the successful commercialization of this technology for both civil and military aircraft as well as for industrial turbomachinery.

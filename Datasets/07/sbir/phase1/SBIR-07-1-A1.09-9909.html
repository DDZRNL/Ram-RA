		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The use of UAVs has increased exponentially since 1995, and this growth is expected to continue. Many of these applications require extensive Research and Development; however, the need to fund development of the UAV often competes with funding intended for the end-user application. Therefore, off the shelf, low cost, easily configurable integrated avionics systems will significantly reduce the budget impact for UAVs yet will support the wide range of applications for their use.<BR>CTSi and Virginia Commonwealth University are proposing the use of an integrated VCU developed avionics package with a user configurable autopilot system that will meet the needs of a wide range of experimental test bed UAVs.  The system will include:<BR><BR>1. The ability for the safety pilot to take direct control of the aircraft using an on-board fail-safe control switch<BR><BR>2. A built-in autopilot to provide return-to-home capability upon failure of the RF links, safety/ground pilot assistance in performing research maneuvers, and limited upset recovery<BR><BR>3. An open-architecture hardware design enabling customer upgrade of sensors, actuators, and data links<BR><BR>4. An open-architecture software design enabling push-button auto-coding of control algorithms direct from Simulink<BR><BR>5. A flexible architecture allowing customer-developed control laws <BR>to be executed on ground-based computers via uplink and downlink telemetry or onboard the aircraft  using an optional Advanced Adaptive Flight Control Processor.<BR><BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has many applications for Unmanned Vehicles as Research and Development tools.  Our proposal describes one use as part of the NASA AirStar System.  In this application our ASROV system provides NASA with an integrated avionics system that allows NASA to focus on their experimental research in flight dynamics, vehicle state assessment and automatic flight control.  ASROV will allow NASA to quickly and easily update control laws, without tedious hand coding of the new software.  <BR> 	The CTSi/VCU ASROV system is a modular, open-architecture hardware and software design that allows the customer to change or upgrade the avionics as needed depending on the specific application.  This architecture can be used throughout NASA as an avionics/auto-pilot system that allows maximum flexibility for the user quickly and easily update components of the system, to meet the data quality requirements for their specific application.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Government agencies such as DoD, DoT, NSA, and civil research and development entities such as Universities and defense contractors are all heavily invested in using UAVs for Research and Development.  Companies such as Northrop Grumman, and Universities such as Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of Texas at Arlington have expressed interest in a low cost, reconfigurable open architecture UAV avionics system.  Each of these entities have specific interest in the ability to rapidly change the platform control laws to meet the requirements of their specific application without having to request changes from the autopilot manufacturer.  <BR>	ASROV provides the ability to go from SIMULINK models to C/C++ code on an ASROV platform without ever having to go back to the autopilot manufacturer.  This capability allows UAV operators to focus their funding and their development efforts on their application, instead of on developing a UAV Testbed.<BR>

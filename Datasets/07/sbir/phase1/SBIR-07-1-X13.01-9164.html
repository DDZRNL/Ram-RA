		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed project is to design, develop and fabricate a handheld video game console for astronauts during long space flight. This portable hardware runs entertaining games that detect neurocognitive deficits and give an objective feedback to the astronaut about this decrement. This facilitates the crewmembers and flight surgeons to prescribe recommended countermeasures to the cognitive decrement.

		<BR>
		This project has a number of innovative aspects, which will provide the crewmembers an entertaining and portable tool for cognitive monitoring. Benefits include early detection of cognitive decrement and identification of cognitive decrement catalysts. It also provides a handheld gaming platform for the crewmembers to play multi-player interactive games to promote teamwork and to reduce stress during long space flight.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Handheld portable game console with an open architecture will attract a lot of game developers to build games on this platform. With the CAT game engine built-in the handheld game console, other non-violent games will be developed for all ages. This opens up a new type of game for the gamers. In addition, the DoD personnel can use CAT based video game to train their personnel as well as a recruiting tool.<BR>

		<BR>
		As NASA prepares for future space missions and the return to the moon by 2020, astronauts will be required to spend more time exposed to the hazards of performing Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA).  Providing and maintaining reliable communications and overall information transfer is imperative during EVA operations not only to relay progress during the  task but also to monitor the health and ability of the astronaut to perform in hazardous environments.  Therefore, in order to improve astronaut mobility and primarily space to space communications, Applied EM, Inc. is proposing conformal, body-worn antennas that will be integrated into space suit designs to enhance EVA operations.  In addition, antenna designs for wireless RF telemetry will be developed to enable the use of wearable computers for astronaut space operations.  Recognizing the increased EVA operations anticipated for future missions, NASA has been studying and testing new space suit designs in efforts to improve the astronaut's ability to move his or her body while wearing the space suit and to carry out EVA tasks as efficiently and safely as possible.  These new antenna designs will be developed to be compatible with the new suit designs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This multi-disciplinary research project will produce a wide range of products that include novel body-worn antenna designs, conformal helmet mounted antenna designs, antennas for wireless RF telemetry systems, fabric systems for accommodating body-worn antennas, and fabrication methods to produce flexible, integrated body-worn antenna systems. The body-worn UHF antenna designs and wireless antennas for wearable computer applications can be used in the new space suit designs, that are currently being considered, as well as potential EVA communication systems for Constellation Program and the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), ISS, and Lunar Surface Access Modules. The actual antenna designs as well as the electromagnetic simulations and test data obtained during this project can be used in a wide range of NASA research programs and applications. In addition to improving EVA communications capability, the potential for wireless antenna nodes for wearable computers is extensive.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This multi-disciplinary research project will produce a wide range of products that include novel body-worn antenna designs, conformal helmet mounted antenna designs, antennas for wireless RF telemetry systems, fabric systems for accommodating body-worn antennas, and fabrication methods to produce flexible, integrated body-worn antenna systems. These products will have much potential in a wide range of non-NASA applications commercially as well as government.  Commercial applications would include body-worn antennas for health monitoring, communications, remote sensing, information transfer systems as well as in uniform designs using conductive coatings.  Government applications would primarily be for DoD (military) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as body-worn antennas can be used for Warfighter, Special Operations Forces, special uniforms requiring communications in severe environments such as chemical and biological threat situations.

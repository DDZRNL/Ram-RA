		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Cog-Gauge is a portable hand-held game that can be used by astronauts and crew members during space exploration missions to assess their cognitive workload decrements that possibly result from fatigue, stress, or neurocognitive deficits.  Cog-Gauge combines behavioral workload assessment using a dual-task approach with predictive workload models to counter the effects of game learning.  The game will be built using an iterative usability driven approach where emphasis will be placed on building an engaging relevant game that builds from contextual task analysis and user profiling.  The specific technical challenges foreseen are integrating two approaches of cognitive workload modeling, and using learning curves to model game learning, then using algorithms to determine a user's workload as soon as they complete a timed interaction with the game.  Specific questions to address pertain to feasibility of proposed solution and hardware/software requirements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		CogGauge, once developed, forms foundations for several tools that can be integrated within shuttle (or its future replacements) controls to assess astronaut cognitive workload during a mission.  Another possible expansion is to assess ground operations centers workload while monitoring a mission progress.  In essence, the concepts/approach implemented in CogGauge can potentially expand to several applications within NASA that involve intense human-system integration.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		CogGauge can be potentially tailored for use by aircraft pilots to assess their cognitive workload after long flying hours.  In many situations, the approach/algorithms implemented in CogGauge can be used to model an operator interacting with a complex system, these include:  Command and Control, Power Plant Control Units, Nursing Stations, and so on.  It is more and more required from single operators to monitors several stations, which is resulting in ever increasing overload, and currently, there is a lack of tools to monitor that increase in workload in real-time, this can be addressed using a real-time variant of CogGauge in systems such as airport security checkpoints, customs, police stations, etc.

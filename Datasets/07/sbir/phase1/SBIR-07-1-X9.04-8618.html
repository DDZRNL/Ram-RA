		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Engineers at SpaceDev have conducted a preliminary design and analysis of a proprietary annular design concept for a hybrid motor.   A U.S. Patent application has been submitted and is pending approval.  The annular hybrid motor is an improvement to hybrid rocket motor technology that can be used for a wide range of applications.  The technology will lead to improvements in hybrid payload mass fraction, increased performance during throttling, and reduced costs associated with casting hybrid fuel grains.  The technology is highly scalable and can be used for applications ranging from small thrusters on satellites, to launch vehicle booster applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		SpaceDev believes that the Annular Hybrid Motor has a wide range of possible applications to both government and commercial customers.  Efficiency gains realized by decreased O/F shift and increased fuel utilization benefit all applications using the Annular Hybrid Motor. Similarly, cost savings associated with simplified fuel grain design and thermal management are beneficial across the board Applications that are currently being explored for the annular hybrid motor include:<BR>Compact motors for satellite applications<BR>Sounding Rockets<BR>Upper Stage Motors<BR>Full Launch Vehicle<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Given that space is at a premium in satellites  particularly in microsatellites and nanosatellites  the Annular Hybrid Motor's increased packing options would be of immediate benefit to satellite designers. Also, many satellite CONOPs call for multiple burns in their nominal missions as well as to be available for additional contingency burns. The improved restart ability of the Annular Hybrid Motor would be helpful in this regard for both satellite motors and upper stages.  Finally, the Annular Hybrid Motor has possible applications in the space tourism market.

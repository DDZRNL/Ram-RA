		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		An acoustic igniter eliminates the need to use electrical energy to drive spark systems to initiate combustion in liquid-propellant rockets. It does not involve the use of catalysts (which have a limited life), it does not exhibit typical wear and tear as seen in spark and catalytic igniters, and it is simple in design with no moving parts. Orion's proposed Acoustic Igniter is expected to offer a long-life, highly reliable ignition system that does not require high-voltage electrical connections. It is less complex to operate and simpler than a traditional ignition system. <BR>	<BR>Orion's primary technical objective is to produce an acoustic igniter design that will ignite combustion of common liquid rocket fuel and oxidizer combinations such as gaseous oxygen and kerosene, and oxygen/methane. During Phase 1, we will analyze the operational issues that inhibit acoustic igniter performance. Based on these results, Orion will build a prototype unit, test it, and evaluate its performance. This work will be sufficiently broad and deep to establish a basis for the follow-on Phase 2 effort to refine the design and upgrade the technology level of the acoustic igniter. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The acoustic igniter can be used in every current and planned liquid propellant rocket engine to cut cost, weight, and complexity. When the technology level of the igniter reaches a sufficient level to be considered on a competitive tradeoff basis, NASA programs, i.e., Ares and Orion, will be obvious candidates for the acoustic igniter benefits. Commercial launch vehicles such as the Space-X Falcon 1 and 5 launchers, Pegasus, and Taurus are also candidates. Orion is developing its own small launch vehicle for commercial applications. Consequently, we will be performing such a trade off study when it is timely.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The acoustic igniter can be used in every current and planned liquid propellant rocket engine to cut cost, weight, and complexity. When the technology level of the igniter reaches a sufficient level to be considered on a competitive trade off basis, Non NASA programs, i.e., Air Force heavy lift launcher vehicles. Delta and Atlas, are likely prospects. Other vehicles, mostly foreign, such as Ariane, Soyuz, Long March, Vega, Proton, Athena and Zenit (Sea Launch) could be candidate users, if ITAR restrictions can be overcome.

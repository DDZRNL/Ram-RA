		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Field Programmable Gate Arrays are a widely used technology; however, they are generally limited in reprogrammability. Radiation hard, low power and high density ReProgramable FPGAs (RP-FPGAs) would be a tremendous asset in long duration missions. The ability to adapt to changeing mission profiles and on board capabilities is highly desirable. We herein propose to develop a RP-FPGA for flight use. In Phase I we will prove basic device concepts working with a leading FPGA manufacturer. In Phase II we will develop a viable demonstration prototype that will enable routine Phase III device manufacture.

		Long duration missions often must adapt to changes in mission capabilities and mission profiles. This project will provide NASA mission planners (and prime contractor builders) with a significant enhancement in device programming capability

		<BR>
		FPGAs serve a wide range of applications as an alternative to ASICs. Highly desirable is a FPGA that could be reprogrammed. Product revisions are often constrained by past programmed logic or suffer from extra cost as programmed arrays must be replaced. A reprogrammable gate array would be a significant benefit to product designers and enable a new form of product upgrade to be easily carried out - hence offering opportunity to gain a significant market share.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

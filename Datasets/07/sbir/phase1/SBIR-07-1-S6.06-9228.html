		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is seeking innovative spatial and visual methods for search analysis and display of scientific data, to aid outreaching of this data to the interested mass-users. To address this need, AGNC proposes to develop innovative Attribute Image Map Fused 3D Web-Objects (AIMFO-3DWO) technology and software toolsets, based principally on new organization of geospatial datasets that integrates topographical maps, attributive information, remotely sensed imagery and DEM into one unified data aggregate and format. The AIMFO-3DWO will bring together a fully functional Web-GIS, relational database management system (RDBMS) and image processing tool with new means of data management and manipulation, based on singular software toolset including super-compact data format that will be very effective in fused datasets distribution over networks and will make it possible to deploy PDA and even mobile phone clients.<BR>The AIMFO-3DWO will be operated by XML/GML compatible non-schema non-SQL mass-user oriented man-machine interface. The AIMFO-3DWO for the first time provides rapid network access to geospatial datasets by means of unique Geospatial Image Language and interoperable system architecture.<BR>Phase I is devoted to the AIMFO-3DWO proof-of-concept. Phase II will result in development of a fully functional AIMFO-3DWO system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The IMFO-3DWO will be useful to NASA in its handling of remotely sensed datasets and advanced processing of those datasets. For example, the AIMFO-3DWO may help non-GIS experts to map National Weather Service modeled hurricane paths over a background of NASA MODIS sea surface temperatures, visualize in 3D deploying GoogleEarth and extract attributes of these datasets even on PDA or mobile phone for non-specialist field users. The AIMFO-3DWO will also enhance the following NASA programs: characterization and validation in the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) at Goddard and other centers; DEM quality assurance for the SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission) for JPL; interdisciplinary geospatial data aggregation for the Population, Land Use and Climate Estimates (PLACE) project using NASA remotely sensed data, and adding of attribute information to the databases of NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Advances in Internet and wireless communication technologies make the commercialization of AIMFO-3DWO for non-NASA users realistic. A great amount of data in the hands of the forestry, risk assessment, agricultural, land organization, transportation, military, and other communities may benefit from the interoperability of AIMFO-3DWO software toolsets for interpretation and its integration of remotely sensed data into various distributed Web-GIS and imaging environments.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Any manned missions to extraterrestrial locations will require shelter structures for a variety of purposes ranging from habitat usage to biomass production.  Such shelters need to be constructed in such a way to minimize stowed volume and payload weight.  The structures must also be very durable and have the ability to survive punctures without collapsing.  Ways of increasing available crew-load volume without greatly increasing launch weight or volume are also sought.<BR>Inflatable structures are ideal candidates for habitat structures for several reasons: (1) they feature the low stowage volume and payload weight required, (2) deployed volume can be easily increased without large increases in launch weight or volume, (3) they offer unique opportunities for incorporating intelligent and/or multifunctional systems such as self-healing capability, power generation and storage, sensor systems, and radiation protection.<BR>Adherent Technologies, Inc. is proposing an inflatable, rigidizable shelter system based on our Rigidization on Command<SUP>TM</SUP> (ROC) technology.  The proposed shelter system would feature not only the required low stowage volume and lightweight character, but would also feature a self-healing foam system incorporated into the final structure to minimize the damage caused by any potential punctures to the structure.  Additional features will be incorporated in the Phase II follow-on, including thin film photovoltaics to provide power for the lighting system and later habitat function, sensor systems for monitoring both structural and crew health, and radiation protection systems.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This system is being designed to support the need for structures on future manned space missions to the moon and Mars.  Applications are seen as shelters for equipment with the potential for expansion into habitats and airlock structures.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The rigidizable shelter that is the focus of this Phase I program is very similar in concept to air beam structures currently being pursued by the military.  Inflatable air beam technology is enabling rapid deployment of various shelters for military applications.  Our rigidizable, self-healing system should find easy application in military applications, where light weight, low storage volume, and limited manpower required to construct shelters are of interest.

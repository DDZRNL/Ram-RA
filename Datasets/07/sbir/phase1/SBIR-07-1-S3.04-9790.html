		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		CU Aerospace and its University of Illinois teammate propose the design, sub-component fabrication and preliminary test of an UltraSail "Cubesat" 20 m2 solar sail spacecraft leading to a flight test in low Earth orbit.  The complete flight test program consists of: preliminary design and sub-component tests; fabrication and assembly of a University of Illinois Cubesat spacecraft bus adapted to solar sail deployment; spaceflight qualification testing; and the flight test.  The proposed innovation will demonstrate a scalable flight test in a 3 kg package of a high performance 200 m long solar sail plus two Cubesats to achieve a solar sail areal density of 5 gm/m2, and a large cost reduction factor for flight test of advanced solar sails.  Successful development of the UltraSail solar sail will enable very high energy inner heliosphere and interstellar scientific missions with large scientific payloads.  In addition, near-earth missions, such as Heliostorm for early warning of solar storms, will provide more warning margin as the solar sail performance is increased with UltraSail technology.

		Successful development of the UltraSail solar sail would enable very high energy inner heliosphere and interstellar scientific missions.  In addition, near-earth missions such as Heliostorm for early warning of solar storms will provide more warning margin as the solar sail performance is increased with UltraSail technology.  Spacecraft design studies show that for sail areal densities below 5 gm/m2, as proposed with UltraSail, spacecraft payloads can be significantly increased because of the elimination of the propellant, without sacrificing flight time.  Furthermore, sail development promises to be lower cost than competing SEP or NEP systems, enabling more missions for the research dollar.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA applications are very long term, such as lunar or Mars commercial cargo missions.  The flight test procedure proposed here, involving two identical Cubesats, might also be an economical approach to the testing of space tether systems.<BR><BR>

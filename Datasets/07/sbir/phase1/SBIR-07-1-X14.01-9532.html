		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR effort will take the first step in improving the existing Medipix dosimeter technology in terms of advancing the technique now used to couple the actual sensitive detector material to the underlying readout electronics.  Prototypes of current Medipix2-based devices have been developed using "bump-bonding" techniques, and we will improve this design by employing direct epitaxial deposition of the detector layers onto the Medipix2 wafers.  This will allow us to deploy very specialized detector structures within the detector layers that can enhance the efficiency and resolution of the device for neutron detection, as well as improving both the charge and energy resolution for charged particles.  This includes the application of high hydrogen content polymer coatings to enhance neutron sensitivity.  The epitaxial technique will also produce more mechanically robust detectors and potentially avoid one of the significant failure modes for such hardware, namely loss of contact at the bump-bonding sites.  Versions of the current bump-bonded prototypes exist that are essentially the size of a typical USB Flash-Memory plug-in device, and like those "USB-Smart-Drives," these prototypes can be fully powered and read-out electronically via standard USB interfaces such as found on most current laptop computers

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA needs for monitoring radiation exposure and hence crew health in the space and lunar environments requires an efficient, low mass, low volume, low power dosimeter. The ability to deploy the proposed dosimeter technology within a crew member's extravehicular space suit as well as to provide active real-time monitoring within spacecraft and on the lunar surface, including the provision for giving alarms directly to the crew members themselves as well as to download archival data to the associated ground-support personnel, will be invaluable in satisfying NASA's needs for portable active personal dosimeter.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential commercial applications for the compact radiation sensor are multi-fold with medical, radiation security, homeland security, DoD and high energy physics arenas that can be addressed by the detectors.  Of immediate interest and the largest market is the radiation security market which includes the medical market.  Monitoring of exposure to radiation in the private sector is an important segment, and when linked with the ability of the Radiation Dosimeter to read out in real time through USB connections the radiation environment, this promises to be a very profitable business area.  Further, DoD and homeland security areas also will benefit from the development of the compact and versatile dosimeter additionally enhancing the business proposition.

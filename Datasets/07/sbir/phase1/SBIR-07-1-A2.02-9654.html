		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this proposed SBIR project, we seek to implement the Adaptive Chemistry methodology in existing CFD codes used to investigate the emissions performance of gas turbine engine combustors. We will demonstrate the feasibility of integrating Adaptive Chemistry algorithms to current CFD codes. We will also further develop the Adaptive Chemistry method to take advantage of species reduction enabling even larger CPU speedups. The value of the technique is enhanced predictive capability and computational efficiency of existing CFD codes for reacting flows such as gas turbine engine combustion systems. The successful completion of this project will produce the first CFD numerical code that is able to model detailed chemical kinetics as well as fluid dynamics. The end results allow the user to easily and transparently control the balance between computational efficiency and solution accuracy.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		As a result of this project, an interface of Adaptive Chemistry to any generic reacting flow solver will be constructed. The techniques developed in this project offer a combination of high efficiency, low computational cost, and enhanced accuracy on the reacting flow simulation. The interface developed in this work will complement NASA's combustion research, and NASA's in-house combustion codes can be integrated with the techniques developed to enhance its efficiency and simulation capability.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA application includes implementing Adaptive Chemistry into other commercial CFD codes. The technique developed in this project will potentially provide significant CPU speedups to current CFD codes. The predictive capability of existing CFD software will also be greatly improved to facilitate flow field simulations with more detailed chemistry included.

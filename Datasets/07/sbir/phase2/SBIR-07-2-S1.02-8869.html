		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase II proposal, builds upon the extensive research and digital radar design that has been successfully completed during the Phase I contract. Key innovations of the proposed Phase II work will be<BR><BR>	High update rate software configurable Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS) design. The state-of-the-art DDS ICs can operate at 1 GHz update rates. IAI proposes to achieve the same or higher update rates, with increased flexibility (in frequency/ phase tuning) which arises from the software defined nature of the DDS implementation. <BR><BR>	High-sampling rate (400 MHz and above), multi-channel digital receiver design. On-board signal processing capabilities will be integrated in the receiver. This includes digital implementation of commonly used radar receiver architectures (Digital down-up conversion, Digital filtering, Correlation, SAR imaging).<BR><BR>	Digital implementation of direct RF generation techniques for L-Band frequencies. Flexible and scalable analog up-conversion techniques would be implemented to generate frequencies in the S-Band, X-Band, going up to the Ku band. <BR><BR>	Scalable and modular hardware architecture to support multiple radar missions. Such a design approach would also address the issue of portability between different reconfigurable logic device families/ vendors.<BR><BR>	Technology transition to adapt the radar design to meet space qualified standards.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology is built upon the radar design and communications expertise of IAI, developed over several SBIR and non-SBIR contracts. Our innovation is the digital synthesis of critical radar blocks and reconfigurable design to support most commonly used radar modes.<BR>Our proposed technique can be used for a wide range of remote sensing applications for NASA including:<BR><BR>	High bandwidth channel sounders<BR>	Weather surveillance radar for aircrafts<BR>	Earth science measurements like surface deformation, topography and soil moisture measurements<BR>	Space based radar missions<BR>	Non-cooperative target tracking radar in air space<BR><BR>IAI has a long history of successfully designing custom radars for DoD and NASA, and most NASA applications could be supported by our reconfigurable radar design. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The most promising Non- NASA commercial applications are:<BR><BR>	Reconfigurable radar for commercial applications<BR>	Cognitive Radios/ Radar for Defense related applications<BR>	High bandwidth arbitrary waveform generator<BR>	UAV based applications (due to the small form factor and plow power). This would include UAV based weather surveillance, target tracking and other commonly sought after UAV radar applications<BR><BR>IAI has tremendous experience of designing customized radar assembly and packaging them as field-ready units. <BR>

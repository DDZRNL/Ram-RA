		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The potential benefits of advanced algorithms for diagnostics and prognostics, inner-loop control, and other flight critical systems have been demonstrated in a number of research efforts.  Because many of the new algorithms differ significantly from the approaches used in most operational vehicles, and because of factors such as non-deterministic behavior due to adaptation, flight certification of the approaches has been challenging.  Verification and validation (V&V) of advanced control laws has received significant research attention, and progress has been made in terms of tools, methods, and architectures for facilitating V&V.  Building on this prior V&V work, the proposed research will develop innovative methods and tools for validation of diagnostic systems.  The Phase I research demonstrated the value of probabilistic analysis in general, and generalized Polynomial Chaos techniques specifically for measuring diagnostic system performance.  The Phase II research will further develop probabilistic methods, and will combine them with worst-case analysis techniques to assess traditional diagnostic system metrics, as well as interactions between diagnostic systems and inner-loop control approaches.  Building on the CAESAR tool control law validation tool, a software package to facilitate validation of diagnostic systems will be implemented, and the tool will be demonstrated on a representative diagnostic system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed software tool will be a key enabling technology for flight certification of advanced diagnostic algorithms.   Such diagnostic algorithms have significant potential in terms of improving safety of flight in a wide range of fixed-wing and rotary-wing air vehicles.  Diagnostic systems are of particular interest in unmanned and autonomous vehicles, because there is limited or no human interaction to aid with fault recognition, or to identify failures and take appropriate corrective action.  The proposed technology will be applicable to NASA research aircraft such as the AirSTAR both in terms of certifying diagnostic systems for these aircraft, and in reducing the risk associated with flight testing of new diagnostic approaches on these research platforms.  The proposed technology will also aid in realizing the goals of the Aviation Safety Program by helping to transition diagnostic technologies developed by NASA and other to production aircraft.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA aerospace applications of the diagnostic validation approaches include commercial and military fixed-wing and rotary-wing air vehicles, and particularly autonomous and unmanned aerial vehicles.  Diagnostic systems play a particularly important role in autonomous systems, which lack human interaction to aid in fault detection and isolation.  With growing interest in autonomous vehicles from both military and commercial users, this represents a large potential market.  The diagnostic validation procedures will also be valuable for marine and ground vehicles, again, particularly autonomous and unmanned vehicles.  Other applications include industrial machinery such as factory automation and power generation equipment.  The Polynomial Chaos tools underlying the validation approach will have even broader potential application.  For example, these tools are already being applied to analysis of uncertainty in aeroelastic systems, which could easily be extended to other systems involving mechanical structures or fluid flows.  Clearly, this represents a huge potential market.

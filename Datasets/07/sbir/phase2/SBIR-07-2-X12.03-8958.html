		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The goal of the rHEALTH sensor is to provide rapid, low-cost, handheld complete blood count (CBC), cell differential counts, electrolyte measurements, and other lab tests based on a reusable, flow-based microfluidic platform.  For Phase II, we will develop an rHEALTH prototype to be delivered to NASA for reusable CBC, cell differential counts, and electrolyte measurements.  Each subassembly and individual assay will be tested individually prior to full integration into the system level prototype.  The rHEALTH sensor is a compact, portable device that employs cutting-edge fluorescence detection optics, innovative microfluidics, and unique capabilities.  Based on its streamlined design, the rHEALTH sensor is able to perform a suite of different assays using a single drop of blood.  Furthermore, the entire system allows cost-effective operation because of its nanoliter operating volumes.  This is in contrast to existing point-of-care diagnostics devices such as the iSTAT and Piccolo systems which only perform one panel of assays per disposable reagent cartridge.   The result is a highly practical, cost-effective, and powerful sensor.  The successful completion of the Phase II program is a significant milestone for our rHEALTH sensor.  It means that we would have been successful in shrinking hospital-sized clinical laboratory into a portable device.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		(1) Real-time health monitoring. The proposed rHEALTH sensor is designed to monitor daily astronaut status so that adverse health events can be managed. (2) Real-time intervention. The ability to measure routine health status allows clinical intervention at appropriate times. (3) Electrolyte measurement on a daily basis for long space flight. (4) CBC measurements on a daily basis. (5) Measurement of cardiac biomarkers for chest pain to rule out myocardial infarction. (6) Measurement of CBC and electrolytes in response to astronaut illness. (7) Monitoring of astronaut renal function to assess volume status. (8) Tracking of bone biomarkers and calcium levels throughout duration of missions to assess intangible bone loss and remodeling.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		(1) Real-time health monitoring. Development of the rHEALTH allows monitoring of health status in real-time at the bedside or doctor's office. (2) Real-time intervention. Clinical intervention can be accomplished rapidly in acute situations with a handheld monitor. (3) Measurement of daily hematocrit for patients on coumadin or other anti-coagulation to diagnose early blood loss. (4) Detection of acute myocardial damage rapidly and outside the hospital so that life-saving therapy can be administered for heart attack patients. (5) Monitoring resolution of a patient's infection by tracking white blood cell counts throughout a prolonged antibiotic course. (6) Monitoring daily renal function of patients with kidney transplants or those with end-stage renal disease. (7) Measurement of athletes volume status during prolonged training for early diagnosis and dehydration. (8) Daily monitoring of electrolyte status for those individuals taking diuretics. Frequently, diuretics such as furosemide may cause hypokalemia and need to have their daily electrolyte status assessed.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Field Programmable Gate Arrays are a widely used technology; however, they are generally limited in reprogrammability. Radiation hard, low power and high density ReProgrammable FPGAs (RP-FPGAs) would be a tremendous asset in long duration missions. The ability to adapt to changing mission profiles and on board capabilities is highly desirable. We are developing a RP-FPGA technology for flight use. In Phase I we have proven basic device conceptsincreasing temperature stability, demonstrating scalable production process, and developing refining Phase II tasks.  We have achieved this success by working with a leading FPGA manufacturer, and the enabling materials technology inventor and others. The range of technical interactions has also been increased as a result of the Phase I effort. In Phase II we will develop a viable demonstration prototype that will enable routine Phase III device manufacture. Present work has shown the desired end should be well achievable.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Long duration missions often must adapt to changes in mission capabilities and mission profiles. This project will provide NASA mission planners (and prime contractor builders) with a significant enhancement in device programming capability.  The ReProgrammable FPGA will serve (1) near- and far-Earth orbit missions, (2) return to moon mission, (3) go to Mars missions, and (4) other interplanetary missions. The technology developed will further NASA's contributions to the nation's needs as a whole

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		FPGAs serve a wide range of applications as an alternative to ASICs. Highly desirable is a reprogrammable FPGA. Product revisions / upgrades are often constrained by past programmed logic or suffer from extra cost as programmed arrays must be replaced. A reprogrammable gate array would be a significant benefit to product designers and enable a new form of product upgrade to be easily carried out - hence offering opportunity to gain a significant market share. Radiation resistant applications span DoD, DoE, and civilian space use.  Non-hardened devices are useful to commercial consumers in general.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

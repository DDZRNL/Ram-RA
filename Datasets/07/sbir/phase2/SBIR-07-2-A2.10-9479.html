		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The overall objective of this NASA SBIR program is to develop technology enablers for NASA's rotorcraft vision to facilitate rotorcraft operation in all weather environments.  Specifically, NanoSonic will build on its successful completion of Phase I objectives and first generation test article demonstration to optimize, scale up, and qualify high performance, multifunctional, nanostructured, icephobic appliqués with enhanced erosion resistance for rotorblade leading edges.  <BR><BR>Reliable all-weather service has specifically been identified as one of the barriers to achieving NASA's rotorcraft vision.  To truly revolutionize air transportation mobility, rotorcraft must be able to operate in similar environments to current fixed wing vehicles  including environmental conditions in which icing may occur.  NanoSonic's multifunctional appliqués will help to enable NASA's rotorcraft vision by completely preventing ice buildup on rotorblades.  Implementation of NanoSonic's erosion resistant hydrophobic appliqués will facilitate mission critical operations in icing conditions and mitigate concerns of vibration transmission and shudder that are associated with ice buildup.  NanoSonic's appliqués integrate erosion resistant nanocomposites, enhancing rotorcraft operation in high erosion environments.   Maintenance and associated costs are reduced, as a new appliqué can be readily placed on the rotorblade leading edge when the existing appliqué has exhausted its functionality.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Of immediate interest to enabling NASA's rotorcraft vision, as the proposed technology is matured and qualified throughout the proposed effort, multiple manufacturers and customers will integrate this technology within their rotorcraft designs to help enable all-weather rotorcraft operation.  In addition to rotorcraft, the proposed nanocomposite appliqués will be useful for a wide range of NASA applications where water repellency, minimization of water ingress, or reduced frictional drag is desired.  The inherent water repellency provides anti-icing functionality useful in nearly any vehicle or structure for missions where icing or the risk of ice formation inhibits progress.  Water repellency also suggests minimized water ingress, minimizing water uptake and potentially enhancing corrosion resistance.  Minimization of corrosion on metallic surfaces would minimize maintenance and reduce concerns of potential structural integrity damage resulting from corrosion.  Hydrophobic materials can also significantly reduce frictional drag, which may be particularly useful for operation of small exploratory vehicles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed multifunctional appliqués integrate high durability and hydrophobic functionality, which is marketable to an extremely broad range of applications outside of rotorcraft.  Water repellency provides anti-icing functionality useful in nearly any vehicle or structure for missions where icing or the risk of ice formation inhibits progress.  Water repellency also suggests minimized water ingress, which is a significant problem in nearly all applications where composites are used for metal replacement.  For metallic materials, the proposed materials will minimize corrosion, reducing maintenance and concerns of potential structural integrity damage resulting from corrosion.  Similar hydrophobic nanocomposites can also significantly reduce frictional drag, enhancing performance.  Commercial applications are nearly limitless, including corrosion protection and frictional drag reduction for higher performance, cost and energy saving commercial aircraft and automobiles.  Because of the dynamic applicability of NanoSonic's nanocomposites, the potential market spans from military to civilian, opening the door to endless possibilities in multiple industries.

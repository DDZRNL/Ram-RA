		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		An Adaptive Feedforward and Feedback Control (AFFC) Framework is proposed to suppress the aircraft's structural vibrations and to increase the resilience of the flight control law, in the presence of AE/ASE interactions. Specifically, the adaptive feedforward controller is designed to reduce any atmospheric induced structural vibrations of the aircraft. The adaptive feedback controller is applied as an additive perturbation of the flight control system to suppress any undesired AE/ASE interactions, and prevent the onset of Flutter/Limit Cycle Oscillation (LCO) instabilities within the flight envelope of a flexible aircraft.<BR>The proposed research effort fits very well within the scope of the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center topic "A1.10 Adaptive Structural Mode Suppression," specifically within the Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control (IRAC) effort under the Aviation Safety Program. This research will help the original flight control system to robustly recover from or adjust easily to any unforeseen change during its normal operation due to AE/ASE interactions. In addition, practical concerns will deal with the minimal interference with the original rigid-body controller, as well as its feasible implementation using the standard controller's sampling rate frequency.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Being capable of on-line estimation/monitoring of the elastic modes of the aircraft, the proposed adaptive control technology can be automatically adjusted to attenuate any potential adverse aeroelastic/aeroservoelastic effects of an aircraft before a sustained limit cycle and vehicle damage are encountered. Hence, the proposed project will assist NASA in its goal to achieve an integrated flight control system resilient to failures, damage, and upset conditions unforeseen during the development of the aircraft's original control law. Once this adaptive control technology is developed, it can be readily adopted by NASA for a wide class aerospace vehicles ranging from current to the next-generation designs such as F/A-18 AAW, Hyper X, X-43 and oblique flying wing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed adaptive feedforward and feedback control framework will have extensive application in non-NASA commercial applications. Firstly, due to the potential Flight Control System (FCS) benefits from avoiding notch filters, the proposed methodology can be used by military and commercial aircraft manufacturers for new aircraft designs, modifications and upgrades. Secondly, it brings a variety of applications in other industries. Among others it can be mentioned:<BR>  Acoustic noise cancellation in headphone devices<BR>  Reduction of the noise level for rotating fans in computer servers<BR>  Suppression and/or attenuation of vibrations in large satellite structures<BR>  Cabin noise reduction for the next generation executive transport aircraft, such as the<BR>  Marcel Dassualt's Falcon 7X. The noise source can be associated with engine or gust noise.<BR>  Vibration suppression across the automotive industry, such as vehicle's engine vibration, adaptively tuning of the suspension in formula 1 racing cars, and so on.<BR>

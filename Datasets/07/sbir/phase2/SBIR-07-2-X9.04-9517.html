		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The ARES  J-2X requires a large nozzle extension. Currently, a metallic nozzle extension is being considered with carbon-carbon composite as a backup.<BR><BR>In Phase 1, Plasma Processes Inc. (PPI), with the support from subcontractor ATK Launch Systems, fabricated, coated and test fired Haynes 230 and domestically produced 2-D carbon-carbon nozzle extensions. The test results show coated carbon-carbon intact and Haynes 230 in need of film cooling and emissivity and, or thermal barrier coatings. Oxide emissivity coating reduced the Haynes 230 wall temperature by 500F.<BR><BR>In Phase 2, the primary goal will be to develop the optimum thermal solution for a metallic J2X nozzle extension. Working with Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, high emissivity and thermal barrier solutions will be demonstrated on successively larger components until full size capability is demonstrated. A secondary goal is to continue the demonstration of domestically produced 2-D C/C composite nozzle extension materials and oxygen protective liners for use on liquid rocket engines. The team of Plasma Processes, Inc., Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne and ATK Launch Systems offers the state of the art skill set that is uniquely suited to the Phase 2 program.<BR><BR>

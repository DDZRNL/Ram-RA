		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this Phase 2 SBIR program submitted to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in response to Topic S1.05 (Detector Technologies for UV, X-Ray, Gamma-Ray and Cosmic-Ray Instruments), Aymont Technology, Inc. (Aymont) and GE Global Research will enable high-sensitivity ultraviolet imaging.  We will build upon our Phase 1 result showing working SiC UV avalanche photodiodes with high quantum efficiency as well as GE's product expertise in SiC photodiodes.  Our team will demonstrate 16 x 16 arrays of SiC photodiodes including electronics for visible-blind high-sensitivity ultraviolet (UV) detection.  We will demonstrate imaging using these arrays at UV wavelengths.  In order to enable large scale arrays needed for future NASA missions, we will also demonstrate a 3 x 3 array of SiC photodiodes and avalanche photodiodes without front side contacts.  In Phase 3, this array will be scaled to VGA dimensions (640 x 480) and utilized by NASA and others as the best-performing choice for UV imaging in space, satellite, security, and other applications.   Additionally, APD arrays will be enabled.  These will give the capability of imaging where each pixel has the sensitivity of a PMT.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High-sensitivity, large-area ultraviolet light detection is essential for detection of species that may indicate presence of organic processes such as sulfur oxides, hydrocarbons, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, ozone, and nitrogen oxides. Better, higher resolution ultraviolet detection than currently available is necessary for future missions. Arrays of SiC APDs will meet the imaging and analysis needs of TPF and subsequent possible missions such as Life Finder and the Large UV/Optical Telescope over the next two decades. Specific NASA missions using near ultraviolet detectors include Terrestrial Planet Finder, the Beyond Einstein program and NASA's Astronomical Search for Origins program. These missions require exceptional sensitivity for species detectable in the UV that may indicate organic processes, the presence of water, or perhaps life.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential commercial applications include machine vision, environmental monitoring, analysis of artifacts, medical imaging, and radiation detection.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

		<BR>
		NASA's exploration, science, and space operations systems are critically dependent on the hardware technologies used in their implementation.  Specifically, the performance and deployment of autonomous and computationally-intensive capabilities for space based observatories, orbiters, autonomous landing and hazard avoidance, autonomous rendezvous and capture, robotics, relative navigation, and command, control and communications systems are directly dependent on the availability of radiation-tolerant, high-performance, reconfigurable and adaptable, energy-efficient processor technology.<BR><BR>Coherent Logix, Incorporated proposes to develop a radiation tolerant HyperX technology based processor to address these critical needs.  This program will leverage more than $18M of previous investment by the Department of Defense.  Building on the research done in Phase I, the Phase 2 program will develop the radiation hardened by design (RHBD) HyperX. This will be followed in Phase 3 by the completion and productization to a TRL 8/9 of a Radiation Tolerant HyperX Processor.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA applications include processing for exploration, science, and space operations systems.  Specific examples include space based observatories, orbiters, autonomous landing and hazard avoidance, autonomous rendezvous and capture, robotics, relative navigation, and command, control and communications systems.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential Non-NASA applications include high-reliability processing for automotive, aviation, and medical markets, among others.

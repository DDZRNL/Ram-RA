		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The primary objective of the proposed Phase II program is to develop and deliver a ruggedized, compact single-frequency 2050-nm-laser system suitable for coherent LIDAR applications. Such a system uses the latest Tm:silica heavily-doped fiber technology to provide as much as 3X efficiency improvement over existing systems. An all-amplifier technology provides flexibility and stability in the generation of coherent lidar waveforms. The hybrid fiber/bulk amplifier scheme allows to combine the advantage of high small-signal gain attainable in a fiber amplifier with the advantages of a bulk crystal amplifier such as high storage efficiency, immunity to various non-linear processes and damage-free operation for pulse generation.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed work has direct application to NASA coherent, wind-sensing lidar programs based on the use of eyesafe, 2000-nm region lasers, as well as CO2 DIAL applications. The system concept we proposed provides improved performance, enhanced ruggedness and the potential for improvement in overall system efficiency. Other applications are as a pump source for mid-infrared-generating parametric oscillators, for application to DIAL sensors.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial uses are for ground- and aircraft-based wind sensors in commercial aviation for wind shear and turbulence detection.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

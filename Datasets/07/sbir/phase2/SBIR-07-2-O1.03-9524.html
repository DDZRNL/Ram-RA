		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Attitude determination of spin-stabilized platforms is especially challenging. Current low-cost gyroscope technology does not lend itself to attitude determination of platforms spinning in excess of one rotation per second. Traditional GPS-based attitude (GPS/A) sensors require three or more antenna elements separated by large baselines. Single-element designs require extensive calibration of the satellite signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and are not very accurate. Toyon Research Corporation proposes to develop a small, single-aperture low-cost GPS/A sensor for space launch vehicles, and to demonstrate the sensor in an operational environment. The sensor determines the platform attitude with a single GPS antenna having a diameter of approximately 6.5 cm. The standalone performance of Toyon's GPS/A sensor on a spinning platform is better than 2.1 degrees for roll, and better than 1.2 degrees for yaw and pitch (one-sigma). The system performance can be further improved when integrated with accelerometers and/or magnetometers. Although current low-cost gyroscope technology does not allow their use on spinning platforms, non-spinning platforms may take advantage of gyro measurements for further improvements in attitude performance. During the proposed Phase II program Toyon will develop, build and test a prototype system that will be delivered for validation onboard an actual space launch vehicle.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Toyon's Miniature Integrated Direction-finding Attitude-determining Anti-jam System (MIDAAS(TM)) provides drift-free and temperature insensitive GPS-based attitude (GPS/A) measurements for small expendable launch vehicles and micro-satellites in a small package and at a lower cost than array-based GPS attitude systems. The stand-alone MIDAAS sensor performs equally well for spinning and non-spinning platforms, and can be integrated with alternative sensors such as accelerometers, magnetometers, and gyroscopes, when feasible. The MIDAAS technology has direct applications to any navigation system requiring 3-D attitude measurements including manned and unmanned vehicles and robots. When feasible, the integration of low-cost gyroscopes results in a ten-fold improvement in navigation accuracy without significant increases in cost: the MIDAAS sensor provides tactical-grade performance when integrated with a commercial-grade inertial measurement unit (IMU).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The MIDAAS GPS-based attitude (GPS/A) sensor technology is applicable to a wide range of military and civilian applications including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), micro air vehicles (MAVs), unattended ground sensors (UGS), handheld positioning units, recreational and military virtual- and mixed-reality orientation devices, radio-controlled (RC) vehicles, ground vehicles, and far-target locators, as well as military spin-stabilized munitions and platforms. The technology appeals to customers who desire robust position and attitude measurements for spinning and non-spinning platforms that have stringent cost and size, weight and power (SWAP) constraints.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Quallion's Phase II proposal calls for expanding the nominal operation range of its space rated lithium ion cells, while maintaining their long life capabilities. To expand this temperature range, Quallion will conduct analysis on a variety of materials. Based upon our results from Phase I, Quallion will further optimize the formulations and fabricate our large format satellite cells for cell level testing. Quallion is also proposing a "right sizing" of this production facility to allow for cost effective, low volume production with enhanced reliability, long-term supply guarantee and design flexibility that allows for future production for NASA missions. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Once the design is verified, Quallion will be able to provide the aerospace satellite community with a satellite cell with expanded operation temperature capabilities for specialty mission. As an option to NASA, this chemistry configuration can be incorporated into our existing production 15Ah and 72Ah lithium-ion satellite cell design, in which the validation of the cells performance will occur during the Phase II execution.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		If successful in Phase II, Qualllion can incorporate this developed technology for other applications requiring a wide operating temperature range. Such applications include military, automotive and aerospace.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

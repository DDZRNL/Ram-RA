		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Although a number of airportal surface models exist and have been successfully used for analysis of airportal operations, only recently has it become possible to conduct detailed validation of such models through the use of airport surface surveillance data. In this effort, we propose to go a step further than existing models, by actually incorporating empirically-derived airport surface control practices into NASA's overall airportal simulation modeling capability. This effort will produce tools to support fundamental research of the concept and requirements for airportal operations in the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) by providing microscopic airportal surface modeling components that provide higher fidelity and greater validity of modeling than previously available. Through this effort we will use the Surface Operations Data Analysis and Adaptation (SODAA) tool to conduct detailed analysis of airport surface operations using actual data.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase 2 SBIR supports the research of airport operations toward implement of NextGen operational improvements. Until recently detailed analyses of airport surface operations could only be conducted through visual observation of taxi routes, runway occupancy times, and sequencing decisions whereas now it is possible to analyze such details using airport surface surveillance data through the use of the SODAA tool.<BR>We expect that the research and development components of this Phase 2 effort will be of greatest value to NASA and to the FAA to enable such analyses to be conducted more efficiently and effectively.  The most likely commercialization and Phase 3 activities involve further development of the airport surface analysis capabilities begun in Phases 1 and 2. These capabilities will be used by NASA and other research organizations to further study operations on the airport surface.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The FAA requires detailed collection of operational metrics to support measurement of operational performance and investment analysis for new systems. The SODAA tool is already being used to support FAA programs in the conduct of Concept and Requirements Development. We expect that this use of SODAA and the analysis capabilities to be developed in this Phase 2 effort will be expanded further.<BR>The airport operations analyses that are enabled through the SODAA tool and the enhancements to be created through this Phase 2 effort also provide valuable analysis capabilities for airlines, fleet operators, airports, and other organizations in the aviation industry. Through the use of these microscopic analysis tools, airlines can refine their schedules and procedures to optimize their operation on the airport surface.<BR>

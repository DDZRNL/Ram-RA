		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address the NASA need for lightweight, space suit-mounted displays, Luminit proposes a novel Holographic Waveguided See-Through Display. Our proposed Holographic Waveguided See-Through Display (HoWSD) will integrate highly selective waveguiding Bragg holograms into a helmet-mounted display (HMD) that will provide easy-to-access clearly visible information to astronauts during extravehicular activity (EVA). The proposed HoWSD incorporates a unique design and Luminit novel Holographic Optical Elements into a functional HMD, which enables us to meet NASA goals for a functional, unobtrusive display device that can be incorporated into NASA EVA helmets. HoWSD offers a compact, low-profile display with high brightness and contrast, which is fully see-through and high resolution. In Phase I Luminit demonstrated the feasibility of a see-through helmet-mounted display which prepared us for Phase II.  In Phase II, Luminit plans to develop a fully-functional rugged prototype HoWSD that can operate under various illumination levels and demonstrate its functionality. The demonstrated results will offer NASA the capability of incorporating a non-obtrusive, rugged, wide field-of-view display into a space suit helmet designed for EVAs.<BR>

		<BR>
		If successful in Phase II, the HoWSD system, integrated into a space suit helmet, will enable astronauts to see important mission information, such as updates from the Primary Life Support System (PLSS), warnings and checklists, during EVA.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The HoWSD system will find applications in mobile devices, avionics, combat vehicle crew and soldiers' integrated protective ensembles, logistics and training, fire fighting, and in other areas where rugged helmet-mounted displays are needed. HMD technology advances made possible by the successful development of the proposed HoWSD visor optics system will lead to cost-effective commercialization. In particular, the new HMD system will find real-time 3D virtual reality applications. Medicine, avionics, education, CAD, mobile computing and communication, law-enforcement, fire fighting, and video games represent markets for compact, low-cost HMDs in the private sector.

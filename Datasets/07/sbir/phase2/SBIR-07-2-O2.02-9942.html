		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Current hydrogen flame detection systems exhibit shortcomings ranging from limited detection range, to localization inaccuracy, limited sensitivity, false alarms, and inability to self-diagnose failures. During Phase I. International Electronic Machines Corporation IEM created and tested a prototype version of an Intelligent FlameFinder Detection and Alert System (IFDAS), demonstrating that IEM's system could accurately detect, track, and localize hydrogen flames and reliably discriminate between hydrogen flames and over two dozen sources of false alarms including reflections of flames or the sun, welding, other flame sources, etc., using a unique, innovative, and expandable Flame Detection Expert System design. In Phase II, IEM proposes to develop a full working prototype system employing multiple IFDAS sensor units, an enhanced flame detection expert system, and a comprehensive user interface including means for notifying emergency personnel when a fire is detected. This IFDAS Prototype will be demonstrated under real-world conditions at Stennis Space Center.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Launch vehicles used by NASA rely heavily upon use of hydrogen as a fuel. As such several NASA centers (Stennis, Marshall, and Kennedy, for example) use large quantities of hydrogen in conjunction with engine testing and rocket launches. At each of these facilities, there are existing devices in place for hydrogen flame detection ranging from Fire Wire and Hydrogen Gas Detectors to UV detectors and even Long Wave IR imaging systems. In discussions with engineers at each of these facilities, IEM has learned that they are actively investigating alternative hydrogen Flame detection systems for the Constellation Program. IEM continues to work with these engineers to better understand the specific needs for each of these programs but believes that IFDAS can perform an important role in improved flame detection and localization while at the same time eliminating a long list of potential false alarm conditions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary non-NASA markets identified for include a variety of first responders including EMTs, fire and police departments, and fire brigades for large chemical manufacturers and refineries. Using an intelligent device to actually monitor and area where hydrogen was in use to detect flames early and to assist in guiding the first responders safely to the site of the fire has been identified as an important commercial objective. IEM has identified a partial list of potential commercial applications, including, but not limited to:<BR>	Hydrogen production, storage, and transmission industry<BR>	Chemical manufacturers<BR>	Refineries<BR>	Fuel cell industry<BR>	Hydrogen refueling industry<BR>With the emergence of hydrogen as an alternative fuel, the Hydrogen Economy is now beginning to build momentum towards greater market penetration in areas from consumer vehicles to commercial trucks and buses to hydrogen fueled railroad locomotives.<BR>

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

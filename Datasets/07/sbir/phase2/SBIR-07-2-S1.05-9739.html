		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address the NASA need for high-quantum-efficiency, high-resolution, low-cost photodetectors for the far-UV spectral range, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Silicon Microchannel Plate-based Large Area UV detector (UV-Si-MCP) with a highly efficient, negative electron affinity (NEA), solar-blind AlGaN photocathode fabricated directly on the surface of a silicon-based microchannel substrate. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of fabrication of the AlGaN photocathode on the MCP structure, and developed the technology for fabrication of the entire device that meets NASA specifications for the area of sensitivity, quantum efficiency, and spatial resolution. In Phase II, POC will develop a fully functional prototype with a large number of channels and high quantum efficiency, assembled with NASA active pixel readout electronics. This efficient and radiation-hard UV photodetector with low background noise will offer NASA capabilities to improve sensitivity and spatial or spectral resolution of UV instruments for several missions devoted to a better understanding of the origin of the universe and its evolution to modern form.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		 Future NASA applications of Si-based Microchannel Plate photodetectors with AlGaN photocathodes fabricated directly on the entrance plate include several missions such as Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF), SUFO, GALEX, and others. The highly sensitive, solar-blind, low noise, radiation-hard detectors for the FUV region (from 100 nm to 200 nm) will open new opportunities in the investigation of the evolution of the universe, planet finding, investigation of Sun-Earth interactions, etc.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Military applications for new detectors include missile plume detection, fire detection, and detection of biochemical agents. Silicon Microchannel Plate technology will be used in several commercial applications including microchannel chemical reactors with high surface area, beneficial for catalysis (efficient conversion of bio-products into diesel fuel, hydrogen production, and other reactions). This technology will be useful for high-density electronic devices where silicon wafers can be used both as a substrate for the fabrication of semiconductor devices and for creating micro-heatpipe systems. It is applicable to the fabrication of disposable microarrays with nanoliter volumes for fast testing tissue samples against thousands of pathogens.

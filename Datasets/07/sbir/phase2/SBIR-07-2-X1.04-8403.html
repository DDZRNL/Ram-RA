		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Under Project Constellation, NASA is developing a new generation of spacecraft for human spaceflight.  A significant percentage of the structures used in these spacecraft will be made of composite materials, and the Ares V payload shroud will be one of the largest composite structures ever built.  This offers many challenges, not only for design and manufacturing, but also for inspection and maintenance.  Inspection of large composite structures using traditional NDE methods is time consuming, expensive, and often not possible when access is limited (e.g. covered by a thermal protection system), resulting in a conservative (higher weight) design.  Acellent proposes to develop a robust, state-of-the-art structural health monitoring (SHM) system to overcome these concerns.  The Phase II will optimize the design and quantify the benefits for SHM on the Ares V payload shroud, and then expand the results to include other Ares V components such as the Altair Lunar Lander Structure, Earth Departure Stage (EDS) payload adapter, forward skirt and intertank, and the Core-to-EDS interstage.  The proposed solution will be capable of detecting and quantifying damage with a high probability of detection (POD), accurately predicting the residual strength and remaining life of the structures with confidence, and providing information that will allow appropriate preventative actions on the monitored structure.

		The proposed system directly addresses the need for structural inspection of the new generation of spacecraft being developed in Project Constellation.  The system is specifically being designed for large composite structures such as the Ares V payload shroud, and can be applied to other Ares V components such as the Altair Lunar Lander Structure, Earth Departure Stage (EDS) payload adapter, forward skirt and intertank, and the Core-to-EDS interstage. It is expected that once developed, the proposed system will provide the following advantages over current inspection techniques: Low-cost built-in reliable damage detection system for monitoring of structure integrity; Improved personnel safety; Improvement of composite bonded joint reliability; Ease of installation; Reduction of labor time; Real-time convenience and automation of inspection during service. With the proposed system, the structural monitoring and functionality evaluation can be performed while the structure remains in service.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology developed under the project together with Acellent's current SMART Layer technology offers the potential to provide a complete solution for a wide range of structural analysis, evaluation, and maintenance requirements. The resulting products will enable a number of high value economic benefits to the Federal Government including: Increase in service life for manned and unmanned aircraft; Reduced life-cycle costs from improved maintenance scheduling; Reduced structure or vehicle downtime for inspection; Reduced costs for structural analysis and evaluation; Increased structural reliability. The work will be conducted in close collaboration with the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and industrial partners such as The Boeing Company, ATK-Thiokol, and Lockheed Martin to ensure that this research will be directly beneficial to them.

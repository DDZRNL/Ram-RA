		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Tai-Yang Research Company (TYRC) of Tallahassee, Florida, will design, build and test a superconducting magnet system optimized for low current space based applications.  Adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR) for milli-Kelvin sensor cooling is enabled by the use of superconducting magnets to eliminate ohmic heating.  Present systems use low temperature superconductors and require significant cooling system power to operate the magnets.<BR><BR>TYRC's proposed superconducting magnet will operate at higher temperature and lower current than systems presently available, and will therefore reduce the total system burden.<BR><BR>In Phase I, TYRC successfully demonstrated a method for producing a high temperature superconductor optimized for the low currents (< 10 amps) required for space based magnets.  <BR><BR>In Phase II, TYRC will produce several small test coils from the optimized conductor to develop the manufacturing technology.  TYRC will design a demonstration magnet with input from NASA personnel to address mission requirements.  TYRC will then manufacture and test the demonstration magnet to validate the design.  <BR><BR>At the conclusion of the project, TYRC will be positioned to supply low current superconducting magnets optimized for space based ADR systems identified for NASA missions.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA missions requiring sensor cooling to < 1 Kelvin may be cooled by adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR) systems.  These novel coolers are enabled by the use of superconducting magnets.  Present ADR systems use low temperature superconducting magnets that must be cooled to 10 Kelvin.<BR><BR>The superconducting magnets developed by TYRC will utilize a conductor technology that operates at 20 Kelvin, and will therefore reduce power consumption and cooling system mass.<BR><BR>NASA low temperature sensor cooling applications for space based systems require current leads that minimize heat conduction and heat generation in a mechanically robust configuration.  Unlike other superconductor current lead technologies presently used for NASA missions, TYRC's novel, proprietary conductor technology addresses the requirements for structural strength and low heat leak.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Low current high temperature superconducting magnets find application where weight savings and system power requirements are important.  One such application is for magneto-optical imaging systems for studying low temperature material properties.  TYRC has already produced a conceptual design for such a system using its novel, proprietary superconductor technology.  The proposed coil technology is directly applicable to these systems, and may be introduced to this market during Phase II.<BR><BR>NASA has licensed its ADR cooling system technology to a supplier interested in supplying such systems to research laboratories.  TYRC's proposed coil technology may be used in these systems.<BR><BR>Low current superconducting leads with higher temperature thermal intercepts may be of interest to cryogenic systems integrators seeking new methods of reducing heat leaks.  TYRC's novel, proprietary conductor technology, now available, is directly applicable. <BR>

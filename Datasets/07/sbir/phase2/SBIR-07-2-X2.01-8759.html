		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		With NASA's exploration initiative to return to Lunar Exploration and eventual human exploration of Mars, NASA has an increased need for an Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking (AR&D) solution.  First generation rendezvous sensors used video guidance and required extensive human intervention and ground control.  Data latency in these systems is problematic and has uncovered the need for an autonomous rendezvous and docking system.  Scanning Ladar and stereo video have significant shortcoming and have not proven they can provide a solution to reduce the reliance on human interaction during proximity operations. ASC's Flash Ladar video cameras can provide the 6 Degree-of-freedom data in real time, not available in any other video system.  <BR>	Advanced Scientific Concepts Inc. (ASC) is a small business that has developed a number of 3D flash LADAR systems.  Flash Ladar Video Cameras (FLVC) are 3D vision systems that return range and intensity information for each pixel in real time.  The ASC camera with its 128x128 3D array is the equivalent of 16000 range finders on one chip.  This allows the sensor to act as a 3D video camera with functionality well beyond just range finding.  Its small size, low power and fast range data frame rate (30Hz) allows the sensor to be configured for a variety of rendezvous and proximity missions.  <BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		ASC is working with SpaceX to deploy a 3D FLVC system for rendezvous and docking on one of their space missions.  This Phase II will be the first step in developing a commercial AR&D product.  ASC will work with SpaceX to launch and increase the TRL of this sensor. <BR>	Flash Ladar can meet NASA's requirements for a sensor that will increase the success of EDL operations for Mars Landed Exploration, Exploration of Moons (ALHAT, Jupiter Icy Moons), Asteroid and comet rendezvous and sample return. <BR><BR> Flash Ladar will have may other space applications. <BR>This sensor will increase the success of NASA operations such as:<BR>	Rover Mobility and Navigation <BR>	Topographical Mapping <BR>	Mars Landed Exploration <BR>	Exploration of Moons (ALHAT, Jupiter Icy Moons) <BR>	Asteroid and Comet Rendezvous and Sample Return <BR>	ISS Rendezvous and Docking <BR>	Space Situational Awareness <BR>	Rock Abundance and Distribution Maps <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		ASC is pursuing many non-NASA applications.<BR>Collision avoidance to save pedestrians and prevent vehicle damage, Helicopter landing in BrownOut conditions, Surveillance, Terrain Mapping, Autonomous Navigation for UGVs, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and UAV, Smart intersection, Ladar brakes, Robotics, Machine Vision, Hazard Material Detection and Handling, Underwater 3D Imaging, Sub Nanosecond Dynamic Imaging and data transmission, consumer electronics. <BR>

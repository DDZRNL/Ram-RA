		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Software testing is a complex and expensive phase of the software development cycle.  Effective software testing is especially important in mission-critical software, where erroneous behavior poses a risk to safety or mission success.  Automated test case generation can make testing more efficient and effective, saving resources and reducing risk.  Under Phase 1, Safeware Engineering Corporation successfully developed the algorithms necessary to streamline software testing by automatically generating test cases directly from SpecTRM-RL models.  SpecTRM-RL (Specification Tools and Requirements Methodology  Requirements Language) is a requirements language that was designed to be highly readable, allowing even non-specialists to understand them, but is also completely formal.  Test cases generated from the black-box models written in SpecTRM-RL will focus on the intended behavior of the system.  The test case generation tool will be designed to allow the user to choose between a smaller set of test cases, allowing for more rapid error identification, and a larger set providing more comprehensive coverage.  The phase II effort will implement these algorithms, adding test-case generation to SpecTRM, the tool suite which allows for editing, analysis and execution of SpecTRM-RL models.  The new test case generation tools will be tested on the Max Launch Abort System.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is involved in the development of complex systems that are highly reliant on software, such as human-rated space vehicles.  NASA has recognized the need for innovative requirements analysis methods and automated tools; the basic SpecTRM toolset was developed under a NASA SBIR.  The addition of automated test case generation to the SpecTRM toolset will provide testers with valuable assistance, streamlining software testing.  The tool based on the algorithms developed in Phase I could potentially apply to any NASA project with a need for reliable, safe and cost-effective mission-critical software.  It should be particularly important in systems with significant software control and in large projects.  As stated in the abstract, during Phase II arrangements have been made to test the test case generation tools on the Max Launch Abort System, a potential component of the Orion spacecraft, and which is being used on the Flight Test Vehicle.

		<BR>
		The need for innovative requirements analysis methods and automated tools has been recognized across industries as varied as aerospace, automotive, defense, and medical device, providing an ample market for such a tool.  In fact, the basic SpecTRM toolset, which was developed under a NASA SBIR, is now used in the aerospace industry, for example, the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA and JAMSS) use it extensively on their space projects, it is also being used in the United States defense industry.  JPL completed a successful Technology Infusion project to evaluate the use of SpecTRM for TeamX and is now planning how to use the tool on JPL TeamX projects. Lockheed Martin Space Systems has expressed interest in using SpecTRM and other SBIR-supported tools now in Beta Test on the Orion space vehicle.  The addition of automatic test-case generation to the SpecTRM toolset will be applicable to these projects and others throughout the industry.

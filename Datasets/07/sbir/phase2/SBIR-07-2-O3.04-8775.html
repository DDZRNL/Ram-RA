		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Emergent Space Technologies Inc. proposes to develop the Ground Enterprise Management System (GEMS) for spacecraft ground systems.  GEMS will provide situational awareness for distributed ground systems, and an understanding of how events and automated actions impact the system in real-time.  Recent software advancements have improved sustainability, extensibility, fault tolerance, and ease of automation for ground systems.  These traits are important for NASA's missions, from Exploration to Earth and Space Science, but can pose challenges, especially when the system has a high degree of interoperability and communications between components that isn't visible to the end-user.  Operators can quickly become overwhelmed with the increased complexity of software components constantly exchanging data and the volumes of information being passed around behind-the-scenes.  In fact, for largely distributed systems, as much "situational awareness" is needed for the ground system as for the spacecraft itself.  GEMS will provide a centralized integration framework that is needed to provide operators with transparency into the ground system, its state, and its component interactions.  GEMS will enhance plug-and-play integrations while providing information management and system coordination.  The innovation that enables GEMS is the development of "data-driven" algorithms and software adapters that gather data from the various components of the ground system to construct a data model that captures the system state, organizes the data, and displays it to the mission operators.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		GEMS can support any NASA project that requires a ground system, including earth-orbiting satellites, lunar, deep-space, and interplanetary missions, as the key ground system technologies for these different classes of missions are inherently the same.  The concepts we propose allow GEMS to adapt to existing ground systems as well as integrate with ground systems in development.  A high percentage of NASA projects, especially the middleware-based projects, can benefit from the increased awareness of the ground system state and automation.  As such, under a Phase II proposal, Emergent will demonstrate GEMS to candidate missions for early adoption.  <BR><BR>Emergent has had recent involvement integrating modern IT technologies with the SSMO Multi-Mission Operations Center, GMSEC, and TRMM.  Emergent employees have also worked with the Earth Observing System (EOS) missions in the past.  Current and future missions that could be targeted include the lunar missions such as LRO and exploration missions like Orion. Some potential NASA ARC missions for a GEMS implementation include GeneSat, PharmSat, LCROSS, LADEE, SMEX, and potentially others.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The GEMS system can be applied to commercial and other Government space industries directly.  Sample commercial applications could include the OrbImage satellites or the replenished ORBCOMM and Iridium satellites.  DoD and NOAA are government agencies that operate many satellites as well.  During Phase 2, Emergent will seek proposal calls and Broad Agency Announcements for opportunities to integrate GEMS into Non-NASA missions.  Looking outside of the space domain, GEMS could be applied to domains which use a large number of distributed systems and are highly automated, such as manufacturing.  Opportunities outside of the space industry would be pursued in a Phase 3 effort.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

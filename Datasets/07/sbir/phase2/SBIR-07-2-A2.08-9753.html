		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Visualization of turbulence and shock phenomena by schlieren imaging has led to important discoveries in aerodynamics, and there has been much interest in applying schlieren methods for aircraft in flight. The goal of this project is to develop the next generation of Schlieren for Aircraft in Flight (SAF) systems. SAF is a technique for obtaining schlieren images of aircraft as they fly past the edge of the sun. In its original form, images were recorded with a time delay and integration (TDI) camera using slit masks that conformed to the edge of the sun. Problems arise if the cutoff mask is not precisely aligned with edge of the sun, or if the TDI camera is not aligned and synchronized with the aircraft flight path. These problems can be solved using the synthetic TDI method, where the aircraft transit of the sun is recorded on high-speed video, and then the TDI process is carried out computationally using programmable masks. Synthetic, TDI-based SAF systems are less sensitive to movement of the observation platform, and can be used with non-cooperative targets whose flight paths and velocities are not known in advance.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Flight testing is often used as a final critical check of aerodynamic designs developed by computational and wind tunnel methods because the information obtainable in wind tunnels is subject to interference. Outdoor schlieren systems using the sun and moon make it possible to examine shock waves and other phenomena from aircraft in flight. Applications exist in all forms of research and development associated with turbulent flow fields, including aero optics, flow control, drag, boundary layer transition, and flow separation. The proposed developments will be extremely important in flight-testing, where few such instruments can perform in a flight environment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential commercial applications include aero-optics, flow diagnostics, flow-control, free-space laser communication, active laser imaging, high bandwidth video transmission, spectroscopy, and high-resolution imaging.<BR><BR><BR>

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

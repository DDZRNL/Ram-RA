		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will research a novel deformable mirror design for NASA adaptive optics telescope applications. The innovation offers reliable mechanics for the strained architecture, thus facilitating dynamic modeling and the overall control of the DM system. A system-level finite element analysis and design optimization, in combination with proof-of-concept experimental verification methods, will be adopted to identify the most promising design for the future adaptive optics telescope systems. Focus will be given to improve the long time reliability and stability of the system while reducing thermal distortions. Phase II objectives are to (1)design and pragmatically build and integrate the monolithically integrated 100x100 Single Crystal Bimorph Array (SCBA) Deformable Mirror (DM) system onto VLSI substrate for VIS/NIR infrared operating range to demonstrate the monolithic proof-of-concept operating of the DM system, and (2) demonstrate a beam shaping system employing the SCBA DM chips to efficiently compensate rapidly changing aberrations and characterize the final integrated corrector system for phase modulation depth, framing speed, operating field of view, influence function, spatial uniformity, and scalability to millions of actuators. <BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The current SBIR research will use the proposed DM technology to address the high-end application requirements for astronomical telescope systems including (1) correction of aberrations in large-aperture, space-deployed optical interferometers and telescopes, (2) high-resolution imaging and communication through atmospheric turbulence, (3) laser beam steering, and (4) optical path alignment, (5) propagation of directed laser energy through atmospheric turbulence, will require deformable mirror (DM) wavefront correctors with several hundred to millions of elements.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications include laser beam shaping, ophthalmology and other microscope applications. In particular, for the Department of Defense, if needed, the prototype adaptive optical systems based on the Phase II results can be applied to military seekers, FLIRs, optical communications, and other adaptive optics systems for military operations. For optical computing, the VLSI circuit could be combined with piston-only micromirror structure for a phase-only spatial light modulator. Commercial markets for these systems also include retinal imaging, supernormal human vision, and amateur telescopes. The research is also expected to lead to a family of compact, low-cost, high performance spatial light modulators for direct retinal display, head mount display, and large-screen projection display applications.

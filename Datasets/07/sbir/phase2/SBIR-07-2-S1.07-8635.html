		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Peregrines innovation will reduce the required input power, increase a coolers systems margin for a giving cooling load and reduce vibration accordingly for Cryocoolers.  Our innovation will enhance the thermal conductivities of structures associated with the cryocooler, enable much more efficient heat removal and thereby produce a more efficient system.  Effectively we will be increasing the thermal conductivities of the structures associated with the Cryocoolers by embedding Thermal Pyrolytic Graphite within a matrix of material to produce a thermal conductivity 5 times higher than current available materials.  As cryocooler technologies attempt to cool components down around the 4<SUP>o</SUP>K level, waste heat and the management thereof becomes critical to the performance of the cryocooler.  Thermal conductivity structures made from our innovation possessing a thermal conductivity of 700 W/mK will eliminate thermal loads more effectively and will lead to a more efficient and better performing cryocooler.  Phase I has proven feasibility, Phase II will development and demonstrate our innovation resulting in a flight component for the MIRI cooling system for the James Webb Space Telescope.  <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This innovation will have an enabling effect on Cryocoolers reducing their power requirements, size, mass and vibration.  Beyond Cryocoolers, this product can provide an advanced solution for many thermal control applications like radiators, conduction bars and structural components.  In some instances it will replace active cooling systems (heat pipes) with a passive solution based upon this high conductivity innovation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial satellites will use this technology for the same reasons NASA will to produce high thermal conductivity devices including conduction bars, radiators, and structural components.  This technology can also be applied to provide tight thermal control for instruments, detectors and lasers.  Commercial electronics can use the technology for laptop computers, ignition switches for automobiles, and heat sinks for power amplifiers.<BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR phase II project proposes a single frequency high energy fiber laser system operating at low repetition rate of 10 Hz to 1 kHz for coherent Lidar systems for remote sensing. Current state-of-art technologies can not provide all features of high energy and efficiency, compactness, narrow linewidth, super frequency and power stability, low noise, and high extinction ratio at the same time. PolarOnyx proposes, for the first time, a high energy (100 mJ) single frequency (< 1 KHz) PCF fiber laser transmitter to meet with the requirement of solicitation. This proposal is based on the spectral shaping sub-mJ fiber laser we have achieved in our labs.  In the high power amplifier stage, PolarOnyx proposes an innovative PCF fiber based regenerative amplifier approach by employing our patent pending proprietary technologies in fiber lasers, that will be able to operate at low repetition rate (10 Hz to 1 kHz) and reach high energy level of 100 mJ. These will make the fiber laser transmitter system superior in terms of wall plug efficiency (over 30%), energy(100 mJ), noise, size, and cost.  Proof of concept experiment has been demonstrated in Phase I time frame. A compact prototype will be delivered in Phase II.

		Immediate applications include coherent lidars applications for atmospheric parameters measurement. It can also be used as a laser source for NASA's remote sensing system, and as a transmitter for optical communication systems between GEO, LEO, and earth.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are a number of potential applications for the proposed high power fiber laser transmitter system:<BR>	Medical equipment and biomedical instrumentation. The high power laser can be applied to ophthalmology, refractive surgery, photocoagulation, general surgery, therapeutic, imaging, and cosmetic applications. Biomedical instruments include those involved in cells or proteins, cytometry, and DNA sequencing; laser Raman spectroscopy, spectrofluorimetry, and ablation; and laser based microscopes.<BR>	Military / aerospace. The proposed fiber laser can be directly used in military applications, and space, aircraft, and satellite applications such as LIDAR systems, remote sensing system, illuminator system, and phase array antenna system. <BR>	Optical fiber communications. Tunable lasers represent the next generation of critical optical components needed to build the local optical networks of the future and cable TVs that will deliver increased communication bandwidth and improved Quality of Service (QoS) to local access users. The market for the application is growing and will be of great potential. RHK reported the tunable lasers will have a market potential of 800 millions dollars in 2009 as a result of applications of local optical networks and cable TVs. With successful development of the fiber lasers, the technology proposed by PolarOnyx will provide a vital tool to solve the existing and potential issues and merge with the huge market of optical fiber communications. <BR>

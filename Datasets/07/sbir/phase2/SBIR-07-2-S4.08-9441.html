		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		An integrated environment for rapid design studies of small satellite missions will be developed. This environment will be designed to streamline processes at the NASA Ames Mission Design Center. Several key concepts are introduced. The proposed environment introduces modern Product Data Management and Product Lifecycle Management (PDM/PLM) tools and processes to satellite mission design. Specifically, the notion of product structure, or bill of material (BOM), is expanded to a simulation BOM, or SBOM, with the capability to manage engineering analysis data, files and processes in the context of a product, in this case satellite mission. This approach constitutes a significant step beyond mere document management, which limits the traceability of which model of which analysis belongs to which version of the geometry or other analysis. It is a key enabler for model re-use. A Linked Model Environment (LME), i.e. an environment where all engineering analysis models are associatively linked, which was developed concurrently in the commercial aerospace and automotive industry, will extended to satellite mission design. This environment significantly reduces the amount of manual intervention engineers have to perform to translate information from one simulation tool to another. The concept of digital mockup (DMU), which typically addresses form and fit of components in an assembly, is expanded to include function, such that the inclusion of components in a satellite assembly that are functionally incompatible is rejected. Repetitive-iterative engineering tasks will be automated with the help of an integration framework tool which automates the execution of a sequence of codes and provides the capability to wrap drivers like optimizers or quality engineering tools around an automated analysis workflow.

		The results of this research directly benefit the NASA Ames Mission Design Center in their activity of assembling Small Satellite missions. Currently, the Missions Design Center does not employ an integrated, PLM-based approach in their design activities. The Mission Design Center receives geometric information from component suppliers in a variety of formats. The current in-house CAD package is Solidworks. Analysis tools such as STK and disciplines such as structural and thermal analysis need subsets of the detailed CAD geometry in particular formats that they can process. Currently, much time is spent converting geometry from one format to another, and critical information can be lost in the process. The proposed work will directly address these issues.<BR>In addition, there are a number of additional potential applications of this technology. For example, JPL could use our tools in the design of exploratory space probes. The tools could also play a role in the development of micro and nano satellites all the way to manned space missions.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed VSIE is directly applicable to the Plug&Play space vehicle design approach currently being investigated by the US Air Force at AFRL Kirtland AFB. The goal of the plug and play space vehicle design approach is to apply the proven capability of computer peripherals to integrate themselves with computers to space vehicle components. This will enable space vehicles to be assembled quickly enough to meet rapidly developing operational needs where time is the critical factor.  Advatech Pacific is currently working with AFRL Kirtland AFB to develop the ISET tool which enables pre-conceptual/conceptual level design of space vehicles by both traditional approaches and utilizing standardized plug and play space vehicle components.  The enhanced DMU and data management concepts suggested in the present proposal will be directly applicable to support this Plug&Play scenario. This type of technology will be a key enabler for the Responsive Space Launch program by the US Air Force. On the commercial side, any of the primes or first tier suppliers could benefit from the tools being developed, specifically on small satellite projects.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Stable, single-frequency cw lasers operating at 2 µm and at 1064/532/355 nm are needed in a number of lidar systems that are being planned for NASA airborne and space-based lidar systems. These include the following.<BR>	1. Direct Detection Doppler Wind Lidar systems that operate at 355 nm.<BR>	2. Coherent Wind Lidar systems that operate at 2 µm.<BR>	3. High Spectral Resolution Lidar systems that operate at 1064/532/355/nm.<BR>	4. Ozone DIAL systems.<BR><BR>At least two missions that have been recommended by the NRC Earth Science Decadal Survey will need the technology that we propose to develop. These are the 3D-Winds mission and the ACE (Aerosol/Clouds/Ecosystems) mission.<BR><BR>In our Phase 1 SBIR we successfully completed proof of principle demonstrations of the desired cw single-frequency lasers. Our approach for the 2 µm source was a compact linear resonator that demonstrated 65 mW of single frequency output compared to a goal of 20 mW. Our approach for the 1064/532/355 nm source was intracavity second and third harmonic generation in a compact 1064 nm ring laser that demonstrated simultaneous single-frequency outputs of 520 mW at 1064 nm, 240 mW at 532 nm, and 1.9 mW at 355 nm. The goal was > 1 mW at 355 nm. For Phase 2 we propose to build more hardened engineering demonstration units of the lasers, to develop electronics that could be readily transitioned to radiation hardened designs, and to demonstrate a frequency locking module for the 1064/532/355 nm source. We expect both lasers to be at a TRL of 5 at the completion of the Phase 2 work.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We have identified the following three possible non-NASA commercial applications.<BR><BR>1) Fourier Transform Spectroscopy for remote sensing applications. A stable and robust single frequency 1064 nm source is needed to support these activities.<BR>2) Direct Detection Wind Lidar development at a number of aerospace companies. We have identified at least four companies that are interested in using the technology we are proposing to develop as a part of wind lidar systems that they are developing for balloon-based, airborne, and space-based applications. <BR>3) Development of an aircraft based water vapor lidar for atmospheric studies of the troposphere.  A 1064 nm seed laser will be needed for the water vapor lidar we have jointly proposed to build. <BR>

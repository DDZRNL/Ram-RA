		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We have built and tested an optical extinction monitor for the detection of spacecraft cabin particulates. This sensor sensitive to particle sizes ranging from a few nanometer to tens of micrometers in diameter. Designed to utilize commercial off- the-shelf components, the monitor, once calibrated, requires minimal recalibration and only periodic baseline determinations, a process which can be automated as part of the operation of the instrument. It employs no consumables. This monitor employs cavity attenuation phase shift technology and involves the use a light emitting diode coupled to a low-loss optical cavity. The Phase I project  involved a proof-of-principle demonstration that demonstrated a sensitivity of less than 0.1 micrograms per cubic meter.  During the Phase II project, a prototype sensor will be delivered to NASA for the purpose of laboratory and field measurements.  A major goal will be to miniaturize the monitor.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This sensor can be deployed on board spacecraft cabins for the purpose of monitoring the presence of airborne particulates. It can also be used for the same purpose in climate change studies where particulate concentrations and their optical extinction are key parameters in determining the amount of radiation forcing attributable to the presence of particles in the atmosphere. The low cost of this sensor will allow the deployment of far more sensors of this type than are currently used. <BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are two large commercial markets for this technology. The first is as a direct competitor to 'smoke nunber' measurement devices which are used to measure the opacity of combustion plumes from aircraft engines and smokestacks. The other involves in situ monitoring of engine exhaust emissions with respect to the presence of PM2.5, a newly designated criteria pollutant. <BR><BR>

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

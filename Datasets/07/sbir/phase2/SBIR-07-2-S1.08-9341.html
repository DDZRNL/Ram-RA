		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The innovation is a miniaturized airborne imaging central server system (MAICSS). MAICSS is designed as a high-performance computer-based electronic backend that integrates a complete set of power and signal interfaces to serve a suite of advanced LWIR, SWIR, EO, and hyperspectral imaging sensors and an inertial measurement unit for atmospheric and surface remote sensing. MAICSS records continuous precision geo-referenced and time-tagged multi-sensor throughputs to mass storage devices at a high aggregate rate, typically 100+ Megabytes/sec. MAICSS compatible sensor packages include 1) a pair of NASA's 1024+ x 1024+ pixel LWIR QWIP cameras, 2) a pair of  60.5  Megapixel BuckEye EO cameras, and 3) a fast (e.g. 200+ scanlines/sec) and wide swathwidth (e.g. 1920+ pixels) CCD/InGaAs imager based VNIR and SWIR imaging spectrometer. MAICSS consists of a suite of interchangeable and interconnected modules in precision-machined boxes for flexible system deployment. It has a total solid state compact design with a typical volume of 0.03 m3 and a mass of 20kg. Without hard drives and other moving parts, it is operational at high altitudes and survivable in high vibration environments. MAICSS is a complete standalone imaging server instrument with an easy-to-use software package for either autonomous data collection or interactive airborne operation. <BR><BR>

		<BR>
		MAICSS is a cost-efficient multi-sensor imaging instrument server for high performance reflective and emissive spectral imaging and stereovision data collection. These multi-sensor data are valuable to retrieve the Earth's surface, atmospheric, and oceanic geo-physical and geo-spatial parameters. <BR>Its near term NASA commercial applications include: <BR>1) Location and mapping of water-harboring subsurface caves and new sources of spring waters in the southwestern United States (Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah); <BR>2) Use in the NASA-aided international Earth remote sensing program in Thailand for airborne atmospheric aerosol optical property retrieval and agricultural environment studies; <BR>3) Deployment in a UAV/Airship for either field-expedient or persistent launch range surveillance/intrusion data collection; <BR>4) Mapping of river, river delta, and coastal water thermal gradients, color gradients, and pollution. <BR>Its long term NASA applications include: <BR>1) Exploration of Martian water-harboring subsurface caves; <BR>2) Mapping the extent of certain Moon/Mars surface resources and identifying promising outpost/science sites and traversable terrains. <BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		MAICSS can be fit into light aircraft, UAVs, and airship for low-cost commercial geophysical and geospatial remote sensing. Its competitive advantages include its simultaneous geo-referenced foot resolution hyperspectral, inch resolution stereovision, and 0.02 K thermal images. It is capable of performing challenging remote sensing missions, including and pertaining to: <BR> High-resolution aerial thermal mapping over a wide variety of industrial, commercial, and residential areas to detect thermal anomalies, including insulation deterioration of a powerline and rooftop thermal leakage; <BR> Thermal and pollution effluents from mining and other industrial operations such as paper mills and power plants; <BR> Mapping of homeland and national and international border security; <BR> Rapid disaster and emergency response; <BR> Forest fires and residual warm spots and other forest/park services; <BR> Law enforcement; <BR> Aerial IED detection; <BR> Aerial deer and seabird counts; <BR> Precision agriculture, crop growing status monitoring, and vegetation species mapping; <BR> Coastal and river corridor environment monitoring. <BR><BR>

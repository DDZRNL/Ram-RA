		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Phase I project successfully demonstrated that the advanced non-contacting stress measurement system (NSMS) was able to address closely spaced modes and blade-to-blade variations (mistuning).  MSI's advanced NSMS method uses a radar-based blade vibration measurement system with the following capabilities:<BR>	Provides a continuous time series of blade displacement data over a portion of a revolution (solving the under sampling problem). <BR>	Includes data reduction algorithms to directly calculate the blade vibration frequency, modal displacement, and vibratory stress (solving the mode inference problem). <BR>	Uses a single sensor per stage to monitor all of the blades on the stage.<BR>The Phase II work begins by confirming the sensor calibration process, modifying the sensor module so it is compatible as an upgrade to existing NSMS system, and improving and finalizing the NSMS software.  The result will be a stand-alone radar/tip timing radar module for current conventional NSMS users (as an upgrade) and new users.  The hybrid system will use frequency data and relative mode vibration levels from the radar sensor to provide substantially superior capabilities over current blade vibration technology.  This frequency data, coupled with a reduced number of tip timing probes, will result in a system capable of detecting complex blade vibrations which would confound traditional NSMS systems.  The hardware and software package will be validated on an existing compressor rig at MSI.  Finally, the hybrid radar/tip timing NSMS software package and associated sensor hardware will be installed for use in the NASA GRC spin pit test facility.  MSI will also supply the stand-alone radar module to a major engine prime.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Based on the Phase I progress and Phase II plans, Phase II will conclude with the delivery of the system to NASA, GRC (software and radar hardware) and the stand-alone radar module to an engine prime.  Improvements in blade vibration measurement capability will significantly reduce the cost and risk of development and operation of gas turbine engines. Customers include any government or engine test facility that currently uses an NSMS system and wants to upgrade or a facility that is considering the use of NSMS.  The potential applications include any turbine engine ranging from gas turbine propulsion engines to industrial steam turbines used for power generation. The costs associated with maintenance, downtime, and readiness are already well established and understood by both military and industrial users, so an improved NSMS would be attractive to many types of customers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Applicable to DOD/commercial engine primes and government test facilities, as well industrial gas turbine and steam turbine manufacturers in the power generation and oil/gas markets.  These industrial vendors are striving for improved stage performance and are beginning to more seriously address mistuning issues.   With further development a variation of the system has a role in Predictive Health Management (PHM) for aerospace and industrial machines.

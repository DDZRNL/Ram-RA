		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Development of energy storage capable of operational temperatures of 380ºC and 486<SUP>o</SUP>C with a specific capacity 200 Wh/kg for use as a power source on the Venusian surface and for planetary probes in similar high temperature atmospheres and where ambient pressures of 90 atmospheres are to be expected.  This proposal provides for further research and development of the Li(Al)/CoS2 high temperature energy storage chemistry to develop high temperature space energy storage, which will enable the in situ exploration of the atmosphere of Venus and deep atmospheres of Jupiter or Saturn for future NASA missions. This energy storage will provide power for thermal control systems, high temperature electronics and sensors, and high temperature motors and actuators.<BR>The approach has a parallel path of evaluation of low melting point electrolyte for 380ºC operation and optimization of the 486ºC Venus energy storage chemistry. The final task is battery level characterization at various temperatures and discharge rates, with implementation of the previously completed design of a robust battery/cell container and ceramic to metal seals. The development includes the delivery of a prototype battery to JPL for testing.

		<BR>
		Successful completion of this development of high temperature batteries will enable in situ planetary exploration for NASA missions, where energy storage must be occur at high temperatures due to environmental conditions. The energy storage will have a specific energy >200 Wh/kg based on Phase I development which demonstrated battery discharge profiles in excess of 7 days (173 hrs) at 475ºC temperature with background and burst (pulse) discharge currents. The cell specific energy demonstrated in Phase I was greater than 270 Wh/kg.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The R&D conducted under this program will have the potential to make improvements to thermal batteries, low temperature thermal batteries, high temperature energy storage for borehole and terrestrial applications, geothermal batteries and other specialty high temperature energy storage for space applications.

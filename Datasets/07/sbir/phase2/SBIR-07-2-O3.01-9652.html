		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Electronic procedures are currently being used to document the steps in performing medical operations for the Space Shuttle and/or the International Space Station (ISS). Capturing the data electronically makes is easier to manage, modify and query the contents of the procedures. For the ISS, NASA is currently transitioning to electronic procedures based on the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) standard.  Modeling procedures electronically using XML has a number of benefits.  Procedures can be quickly and effectively searched to determine which procedures are affected by software and hardware changes.  Procedures are more easily shared by other computer-based systems.  And procedure execution aids become possible, such as real time data capture and automatic book marking of the current procedure step.  Such procedure models will be an important component of an integrated Medical Decision Support needed for future exploration missions.  The primary purpose of this project is to continue to research and develop a Procedure Representation Language (PRL) and support tools that will benefit the creation, maintenance, and use of the medical procedures, and to develop them in such a way that new advances can be easily inserted, eventually leading to the Medical Decision Support system.

		<BR>
		NASA has been using checklists and procedures to support space operations since its beginnings. Recently there has been an effort to move away from paper documents to electronic documents. The ISS program is now in the process of converting their medical procedures documented in Micrsoft Word to an XML-based representation. We expect this work to continue under the Constellation program.  We believe that our work and research in modeling procedures in XML will be applicable to both the ISS and the Constellation programs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Recent news stories on NPR discuss a new initiative for hospitals to use medical checklist procedures before, during, and after operations to improve safety. The World Health Organization (WHO) is encouraging surgeons world-wide to use them. Our work on medical checklists for ISS can be easily moved to other medical settings such as hospitals. Hospitals in the Houston area that may be interested in our work include UTMB and the Medical Center. In addition, first responders such as EMT, Firefighters, and Park Rangers could benefit by using electronic checklists/procedures.<BR><BR>Other industries, such as aviation and the military have been using electronic checklists, to the extent that many pilots use PDAs rather than paper to perform their preflight procedures.<BR>Software in aviation checklists are introducing hyperlinks associated with the steps in the checklist. These hyperlinks let them link a step in the procedure to another document for additional information. Our work in modeling checklist procedures for ISS and their ability to reference other procedures and documents can benefit the growing needs in this area. <BR>

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

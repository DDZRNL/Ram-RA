		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed effort seeks to develop a digitally steered polarimetric phased array L-Band radar utilizing a novel, high performance architecture leveraging recent advances in radio frequency and digital signal processing components. The driving methodologies are: the minimization of costly and inflexible analog circuitry, adoption of standardized manufacturing processes, and inclusion of reconfigurable software/firmware architectures to facilitate fulfillment of varied sensing requirements.  The Phase II effort will build upon the successful Phase I demonstration of the system concept through fabrication of a 2 Dimensional instrument and system validation in a relevant environment.

		The conical scanning beamforming scatterometer leverages recently developed processing technology in order to enable collocated measurements of emission and backscatter in a compact aircraft instrument with no moving parts. These measurements are not currently available in NASA's L-Band radar systems. The measurements support Earth science applications and are an important step in the path to space for L-band scatterometer/radiometer systems. The short term goal of this work would be to enable collocated measurements with the 2-D Electronically Steerable Thinned Array Radiometer (ESTAR) instrument. In addition this work serves as validation for the Soil Moisture Active/Passive Mission (SMAP) mission which will carry a mechanically conical scanning radiometer/radar system.  Also, the system is well-suited for high-resolution SAR measurements in planetary exploration, as well as GNSS backscatter measurements (CLARREO).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The need for data produced by the proposed system is not limited to NASA.  Within the government, agencies such as USDA, NOAA and DOE have needs for an accurate soil moisture product.  Private corporations in the energy and hydrology services fields are also potential customers.  The system concept is also applicable to other microwave frequencies, opening the possibility of instrument development to meet a growing demand for lower cost, agile, multi-mission phased array radar systems in fields such as atmospheric remote sensing and aviation.

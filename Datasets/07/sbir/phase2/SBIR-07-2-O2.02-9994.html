		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The term Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) is used to describe a capability that focuses on determining the condition (health) of every element in a complex system (detect anomalies, diagnose causes, prognosis of future anomalies), and provide data, information, and knowledge (DIaK) to control systems for safe and effective operation. Therefore, ISHM capability is achieved by integrating DIaK that can be distributed throughout the system elements. DIaK must be available to any element of a system at right time and within a proper context. The implementations of the ISHM in the past have primarily focused on data access, and have not emphasized the integration of intelligence across all elements that make up a system. In order to distribute DIaK effectively, the integrated system must have the distributed capabilities and they require effective network functions across the whole system. Mobitrum proposes to develop a Sensor Area Network (SAN) for ISHM to bring the distributed intelligences together across all elements within ISHM system. The proposed SAN can be mixed of wireless and wired architecture. In order to implement credible ISHM functions, SAN must provide ISHM with effective communication mechanisms using distributed and/or hierarchical architectures to deliver intelligence across all elements.

		"Sensor Area Network for Integrated Systems Health Management" is a state-of-the-art technology offering wide ranges of capabilities for network-based data sensing, condition monitoring, and acquisitions.  This implementation offers great opportunities to NASA for distributed sensor applications. The device, when integrates with intelligence, is powerful for remote sensing and monitoring control across many heterogeneous networks. The technology has many NASA applications: Test Facilities and Test Article; Integrated System Health management (ISHM); Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) for Aviation Safety Program; Advanced Control Technology - Fundamental Aeronautics Test Program; Earth science applications; Field communications device for spatial data input, manipulation and distribution: Intelligent Rocket Test Facilities (IRTF) with smart sensor elements, measurement, and field verification applications; Sensing and monitoring for Aircraft - icing on wings - data from heaters and sensors and Aircraft emissions - collection of data around airports; Verification and validation of equipment (e.g., RFID); System Diagnosis and Prognosis.

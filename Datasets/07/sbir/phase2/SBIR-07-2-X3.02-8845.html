		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This purpose of this project is to develop a spray drying prototype to for the recovery and recycle of water from concentrated waste water recovery system brine.  Spray drying is a one step, continuous process where a solution, slurry, sludge or paste is transformed into a dry solid and clean water.  The dry solids powder is easy to transfer and does not foul surfaces.  The process is suitable for dewatering brine from the vapor compression distillation processor and other sources.  It may serve as a backup processor for one or more existing water recovery systems unit processors.  We will employ alternative heating methods and advanced process control.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential applications are brine dewatering, water recovery in life support systems for: the international space station, the Lunar surface, Mars transit and Mars surface missions.  Additionally, spray drying can be used for the drying of high-solids-content moist matterSpray drying is well suited for the single step drying of liquid solutions or suspensions to a dry free solid while producing clean recovered water.  A system of modest size can also serve as a backup unit or alternative for other water recovery processors.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Innovations in control and efficiency will be find applications in the production of pharmaceuticals.  The focus on water recovery will draw interest from the chemical manufacturing and advanced materials industries.  Spray drying is a promising technique allow for the optimization of precursor production to produce highest quality nanomaterials at the fraction of the current cost thus enabling many nanomaterial applications

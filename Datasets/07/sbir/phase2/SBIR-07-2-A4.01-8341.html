		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Development of an Aircraft Nodal Data Acquisition System (ANDAS) based upon the short haul Zigbee networking standard is proposed.  It employs a very thin (135 um) hybrid microminiature sensor assembly (MSA) and a host module with USB interface.  At several nodes on the aircarft, MSAs are cemented for measurement.  They transmit the measured data to the host module plugged into a PC.  The MSA incorporates an integrated sensor (capable of measuring pressure, temperature, acceleration and surface strains), a microcontroller, a Zigbee transceiver and a battery for power. The host module incorporates a microcontroller and a Zigbee transceiver.  In Phase I these modules were designed after trade-off analyses and experimental evaluation of the sensors and networking hardware.  Based upon the design, the PCB packages for the MSA and the host module were built for initial characterization and testing during Phase II.  In this phase the MSA design would be refined as a cement-and-forget-device (except for the battery).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Test and measurement of airplanes during flight as well as on ground with various simulated loading scenario.  Devices cab used in hard to reach remote locations and locations to which hardwired instrumentation is not possible.  The low cost MSAs are designed for cement-and-forget applications with long battery life. By adding real time aircraft dynamic modal assessment software, real-time correlation and control algorithms, the MSA could be utilized in light weight, flexible and unstable aircraft structures.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
			The resulting technology can be employed many commercial test applications.  It can also be used in hard to access or remotely located nodes on any structural test and measuremnt scenario.  Examples of these applications include monitoring of power plants, vehicle engines, medically implanted devices for monitoring of human body etc.

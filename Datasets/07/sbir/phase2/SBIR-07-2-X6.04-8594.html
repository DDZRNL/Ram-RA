		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The process known as double bag vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (DBVARTM) was developed by NASA to help deplete by products.  To date, the NASA DBVARTM process has reduced void content to approximately four to five percent.  This number has fallen short of the goal of two percent.  During the Phase I effort, San Diego Composites (SDC) was able to reduce the void content to 0.8 percent to 1.5 percent.   <BR>There are three primary technical objectives to the Phase II effort.  The first objective is to perform a trade study to evaluate and optimize the effect of stitched performs.  Stitching has had a large effect on the void content in the laminate and several different stitching variables will be evaluated.  The second objective is to transition the work done in Phase I to larger components.  These components will consist of larger plates and structures will be evaluated using non destructive testing along with mechanical testing.  At the end of the Phase II effort, a full scale component will be fabricated, evaluated using non destructive testing, and then the component will be tested. The final objective is to transition the technology to Boeing Phantom Works.  This objective will demonstrate that the process developed in a laboratory can be reproduced at any facility.  By the end of the Phase II program, the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) is expected to be 5-6.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are many different applications that may come from the development of low cost high temperature composite processing.  Programs such as Mission to Mars could have benefited from such composite processing, and all future deep space explorations programs.  Specific components include airframes, large antennas and telescopes, launch and flight vehicle structures, and components that require power management and thermal protection systems.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA commercial applications include commercial aircraft and Integrated Defense Systems such as advanced UAV's.  Specific components that would benefit from this technology includes aircraft engines, control structures, fluid storage and handling containers, fan blades, engine ducts, supersonic engine cowlings, high speed missile bodies and nose tips, and rocket motor cases.  Additional applications could include the transportation industry such as automobile and rail components.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		As NASA prepares for the Constellation Space Missions and Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) on the moon by 2018, astronauts will be required to spend more time exposed to the hazards of EVA operations.  Providing reliable communications is imperative during current EMU/ISS operations as well as future Constellation Missions. Communications during EVA is required to relay progress regarding the task and to monitor the health and ability of the astronaut to perform in hazardous environments.  Therefore, in order to improve astronaut mobility and space communications, Applied EM, Inc. will apply the results of Phase I to develop and demonstrate a prototype multi-frequency design of a conformal, flexible, body-worn antenna that can be integrated into space suit designs to enhance UHF communications during EVA operations.  In addition, the antenna design has multi-frequency capability that enables wireless bio-med telemetry for wearable computer applications during space operations.  NASA's new Constellation Space Suit System (CSSS) will provide new space suit designs to improve the astronaut's mobility, efficiency, and safety while wearing the space suit during long periods of EVA operations.  Therefore, the objectives for Phase II will consider antenna designs for both near term and far term space mission applications.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This multi-disciplinary research project enables a wide range of products that include novel body-worn antenna designs, conformal helmet mounted antenna designs, antennas for wireless RF telemetry systems, fabric systems for accommodating body-worn antennas, and fabrication methods to produce flexible, integrated body-worn antenna systems. The body-worn UHF antenna and wireless designs for wearable computer applications can be used in the new space suit designs, that are currently being considered, as well as potential EVA communication systems for Constellation Program and the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), ISS, and Lunar Surface Access Modules. The final antenna designs, electromagnetic simulations, and test data obtained during this project can be used in a wide range of NASA research programs and applications. In addition to improving EVA communications capability, the potential for wireless antenna nodes for wearable computers is extensive.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This multi-disciplinary research project will produce a wide range of products that include novel body-worn antenna designs, conformal helmet mounted antenna designs, antennas for wireless RF telemetry systems, fabric systems for accommodating body-worn antennas, and fabrication methods to produce flexible, integrated body-worn antenna systems. These products will have much potential in a wide range of non-NASA applications commercially as well as government.  Commercial applications would include body-worn antennas for health monitoring, communications, remote sensing, information transfer systems as well as in uniform designs using conductive coatings.  Government applications would primarily be for DoD (military) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as body-worn antennas can be used for Warfighter, Special Operations Forces, special uniforms requiring communications in severe environments such as chemical and biological threat situations.<BR><BR>

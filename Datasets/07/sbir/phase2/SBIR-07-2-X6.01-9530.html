		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Any manned missions to extraterrestrial locations will require shelter structures for a variety of purposes ranging from habitat usage to biomass production.  Such shelters need to be constructed in such a way to minimize stowed volume and payload weight.  The structures must also be very durable and have the ability to survive punctures without collapsing.  Ways of increasing available crew-load volume without greatly increasing launch weight or volume are also sought.<BR>Inflatable structures are ideal candidates for habitat structures for several reasons: (1) they feature the low stowage volume and payload weight required, (2) deployed volume can be easily increased without large increases in launch weight or volume, (3) they offer unique opportunities for incorporating intelligent and/or multifunctional systems such as self-healing capability, power generation and storage, sensor systems, and radiation protection.<BR>Adherent Technologies, Inc. is proposing an inflatable, rigidizable shelter system based on our Rigidization on Command<SUP>TM</SUP> (ROC) technology.  The proposed shelter system features not only the required low stowage volume and lightweight character, but also feature a self-healing foam system incorporated into the final structure to minimize the damage caused by any potential punctures to the structure.  The Phase I program successfully demonstrated the self-healing foam concept.  This system will be optimized in Phase II and incorporated into a fully functional subscale prototype habitat utilizing ROC composite outer layers, self-healing layers, thermal and micrometeoroid protective layers, integrated lighting, and power systems. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This system is being designed to support the need for structures on future manned space missions to the moon and Mars.  Applications are seen as shelters for equipment with the potential for expansion into habitats and airlock structures.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		These rigidizable shelters will find application in military and disaster relief scenarios where transport of large numbers of structures into difficult areas is paramount.  Individually, the ROC composite and self-healing foam materials will find applications in space-based communications structures, structural repair tapes, advanced fuel tanks, and hazardous material transport cars.

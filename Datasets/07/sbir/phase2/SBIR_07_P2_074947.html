		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Aero-assist technologies are used to control the velocity of exploration vehicles (EV) when entering earth or other planetary atmospheres. Since entry of EVs in planetary atmospheres results in significant heating, thermally stable aero-assist technologies are required to avoid the high heating rates while maintaining low mass. Polymer adhesives are used in aero-assist structures because of the need for high flexibility and good bonding between the different layers of polymer films or fabrics. However, current polymer adhesives cannot withstand temperatures above 400 C.  Therefore, polymer adhesives capable of withstanding high temperatures (> 400 C) are highly desirable for NASA applications. The present proposal, a collaborative effort between NEI Corporation and a NASA supplier of inflatable structures, aims to utilize our nanotechnology capabilities to address this need. The goal of this program is to develop high temperature adhesives that exhibit high thermal conductivity in addition to increased thermal decomposition temperature. Enhanced thermal conductivity will help to dissipate heat quickly and effectively to avoid temperature rise to harmful levels. This, together with increased thermal decomposition temperature, will enable the adhesives to sustain transient high temperature conditions. A key innovation of the program is to control the nanoparticle morphology so that enhanced thermal conductivity can be realized at relatively low nanoparticle loading levels. Building upon the Phase I proof of concept, the Phase II program will further develop the technology and implement it in NASA and commercial prototypes, thereby increasing the TRL to 4 or greater.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Adhesives of various types are used for different NASA applications, and newer adhesives with even higher temperature capabilities will be needed for future NASA space missions. Generally these applications include bonded joints, seams and sandwich structures (such as metallic facesheet with bonded core). Examples of space structures that need high temperature adhesives include support toruses, solar concentrators and antennas, aeroshells, inflatable aerocapture decelerators, and deployable space structures (antennas, trusses, solar arrays).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The HAA (High Altitude Airship) is an unmanned lighter-than-air vehicle which will be used to enhance the Ballastic Missile Defense System. Hull temperatures can increase significantly due to solar radiation, requiring high-temperature capable seaming solutions. These seaming solutions require high temperature adhesives.  <BR>Adhesive applications in the commercial markets are many and varied. High temperature adhesives, especially those that are polyimide-based, are used heavily in the semiconductor industry.  Polyimide and related adhesives are also used in circuit boards; MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems); opto-electronics; anti-static/high temperature control release dicing tapes; high temperature and anti-static doubled-sided tape for wafer thinning; thermal interface materials for thermal dissipation from CPU¡¦s, video chips, power models, and memory modules.<BR>

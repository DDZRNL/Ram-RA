		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Conventional software defined radio (SDR) backend signal processors are limited by a priori system definition and RF hardware.  Ideally, advanced SDR RF front-end sections would be as flexible as their software back-ends, allowing in-use or in-orbit reconfiguration of original bands and modulation types.  The FPMA/UTR proposed herein should meet this challenge.<BR><BR>This proposed Innovation is a distillation of Phase I concept evaluations with the goal of yielding a producible and functional prototype with Phase II funding.  The proposed RF front-end provides a post-launch, in-orbit reconfigurable RF module and is capable of Hz to >150GHz bandwidth.  Benefits include vastly reduced shelf inventory of equipment addressing different RF requirements and permits ever-ready deployment capabilities using a single piece of equipment featuring this proposed RF front-end.<BR><BR>The UTR/FPMA's modular open architecture fully complements the flexibility of SDR technology. The UTR/FPMA services communications or radar functionality, narrow (kbps) to ultra-wideband (GHz) modulation bandwidths, center frequencies scalable >150 GHz: herein UHF to Ka band.   Small size and exceptional robustness (radiation hardness, reliability) are expected due to low active component count and mainstream manufacturing techniques. The UTR/FPMA RF module uses only conventional technologies but can yield excellent SW&P characteristics.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		For NASA applications similar to the Lunar Program Schedule, development of the UTR/FPMA MCM can be used on the LRO where its re-configurability and superb SW&P characteristics and can add much value to this type of space and outer-space missions.  The UTR technology will be sufficiently mature after the Phase II program to become a viable tool for platform development and can be inserted into the Lunar Program Schedule.  Only the local oscillator circuitry will need to be designed.  Appropriate application vehicles include, but are not limited to the CEV and LSAM.  <BR><BR>The present UTR technology is highly compatible with Ka-band applications due to the fact that the associated six-port network can be implemented on-chip.  However, for lower frequencies below Ka band, the 6-port network of the present UTR technology will have to be off-chip.  But, when combined with Space Micro's FPMA technology, the six-port UTR technology enables a wide spectrum of reconfigurable communication architectures.  FPMA configurations can handle the ranging applications at S-band and the FPMA with UTR can cover the wide bandwidth applications at Ka-Band. <BR>

		1. In flight reconfigurable SDR agnostic RF front end for current and future RF communications and radar  EFA, SDST, STDN, SGLS, TDRSS, Lunar Crew Communications, CEV, networked, surface/harsh environment, etc.<BR>2. DOD software defined radio (JTRS, AMF, etc), terrestrial, airborne, naval, Electronic Warfare, C41SR<BR>3. Wideband operation and low power are ideal for cognitive and mobile adaptive ad hoc networked (MANET) communications (802.XX) AS WELL AS TRIDITIONAL COMMERCIAL WIRELESS (GSM/EDGE, CDMA, UMTS-WCDMA, etc)<BR>4. Homeland Security and Emergency inter-network access with a single mobile radio<BR>5. This technology is also feasible for radar, and in particular, in collision avoidance automotive applications. Here the six port is configured as a reflectometer that establishes amplitude and phase relations between RF signals.  Using a patch antenna at Ka-band frequencies, the sensor module volume would not exceed 3 cubic inches.  Maximum range would be about 20 feet with 2% accuracy. <BR><BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The use of UAS's in the military and the commercial field has grown tremendously over the last few years and is set to explode over next several. An open-architecture avionics system that utilizes standard communication interfaces and allows for rapid reconfiguration would be an attractive addition to the UAS market. <BR>CTSi is proposing development of such a product in phase II that provides a full Avionics Suite. This would include an avionics platform, a closed loop test environment and development tool kit and provide a turnkey solution for NASA AirSTAR program. The system will include:<BR><BR>1)	powerful programmability, ease of integration of new sensors and actuators, and ease of expansion to new platforms and applications<BR>2)	interfaces for sensor inputs in Analog, PWM and serial stream formats<BR>3)	A high performance data link for data telemetry and control<BR>4)	reliable ground based safety piloting and augmented safety pilot control modes<BR>5)	Operations in an EMI sensitive environment<BR>6)	An autopilot fail-safe mode with basic aircraft recovery and Return-To-Base (RTB) capability and custom control law integration<BR>7)	support for a variety of GPS/INS and other aircraft sensors<BR>

		NASA AirSTAR has an immediate need for a flexible yet robust avionics system that provides rapid reconfiguration to allow for program resources to be focused on research tasks. ASROV will provide a turn-key solution for the NASA AirSTAR program with the RTB capability and a development tool kit to allow for rapid reconfiguration.  The open source approach allows the customer to make changes on all levels so project funding is focused on operational requirements rather than OEM customization costs. An Open-architecture design allows the customer to change and upgrade sensors, actuators and datalinks. High speed time synchronized data recording will allow the customer to post process data for accurate performance analysis. The custom control law integration allows ASROV to expand it's capability much beyond the immediate needs of the program. Ground based execution of control laws and piloting makes the datalink a flight critical system with stringent requirements.  Capability to execute experimental control laws including auto flight profile and maneuver execution will give the customer the power to focus on flight based research rather than control and latency issues.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Government agencies such as DoD, DoT, NSA and civil research and development entities such as Universities and defense contractors are all heavily invested in using UAS's for Research and Development. CTSi recently won a Navy P-8A Poseidon innovative modeling and simulation techniques SBIR. P8-A SBIR program will rely heavily on ASOV's ability for rapid reconfiguration and Simulink<SUP>REG</SUP> based control law execution capability. There is a need for auto flight profile execution to force aircraft into complex maneuvers while applying real time System ID and collecting high speed data. ASROV will be critical for the success of the P-8A by providing a low cost capability to focus funding on research tasks rather than development of custom autopilot system. The core needs of AirSTAR and P-8A SBIR are similar to those of several programs across the industry, some of which have been identified as potential customers for ASROV.

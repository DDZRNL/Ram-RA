		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has identified the need for development of technologies to support Lunar Lander and Lunar Habitats programs and for transfer of relevant technology to Crew Exploration Vehicle and Crew Launch Vehicle programs, including revolutionary advances in shielding materials to protect humans from the hazards of space radiation.  To address this need and in response to NASA Subtopic X6.03, International Scientific Technologies, Inc. in conjunction with the College of William and Mary, proposed in Phase I the development of hydrogen-rich monomers for high performance polymers, such as aromatic polyimides, and the incorporation of metallic nanoparticles into nanocomposite materials to achieve multifunctional properties.  The Phase II Technical Objectives include synthesis and characterization of hydrogen-rich monomers, fabrication and tailoring of high performance nanocomposite materials, acquisition of test data to determine key parameters of hydrogen-rich, multifunctional nanocomposite materials, and optimization of prototype hydrogen-rich, multifunctional materials.  The Phase I program demonstrated that hydrogen-rich monomers can be prepared and polymerized with metallic nanoparticles.  The feasibility established in Phase I will be realized in Phase II through development of polymeric nanocomposite materials consisting of hydrogen-rich monomers and metallic nanoparticles.  The nancomposite materials will have multifunctional properties, including radiation shielding against galactic cosmic radiation, neutrons and electromagnetic radiation, structural integrity for flexible and rigid structures and habitats, and electrical conductivity for electrostatic control for dust mitigation during lunar missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed multifunctional nanocomposites will find application in the Exploration Systems mission in protecting astronauts and sensitive optical, electronic, thermal and acoustic components from environmental hazards including radiation, dust and thermal transients, while, at the same time, providing lightweight structural functions.  It is expected that nanocomposite systems will provide a high-performance-to-weight radiation shield that can be used within human habitats, spacecraft and protective apparel.  Other missions supported by NASA could also make use of the nanocomposite materials in low earth orbit or in other orbital paths traversing high radiation regions of space.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Lightweight multifunctional radiation shielding will find application in the commercial (e.g., hospitals and nuclear power plants) and defense (e.g., nuclear-powered ships and surveillance satellites) sectors.  The shields will provide protection for homeland security first responders employed by law enforcement agencies, fire departments and hospitals.  It is also expected that the shielding can be fabricated into temporary shelters used by defense personnel and considered for use in the protection of individuals in case of a nuclear or radiological events.  The radiation-shielding material will be suitable for fabrication into protective clothing for healthcare professionals involved in X-ray and nuclear medicine.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced Situation Awareness Technologies (ASAT) will facilitate exploration of the moon surface, and other planetary bodies. ASAT will create an Advanced Situation Awareness Technology by creating an integrated display from disparate data sources including video, telemetry, and geographic databases which in addition to topographic data can provide ortho-imagery, meteorological, hazard, and cultural data.  This new augmented reality display will fuse multiple information streams into a high information density, three dimensional display with a common temporal context.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		ASAT will support:<BR>- safe lunar lander vehicle operation<BR>- safe planetary exploration vehicle operation<BR>- manned exploration of extratrestrial bodies <BR>ASAT will provide enhanced situation awareness to explorers (either present or telepresent) by providing and information rich augmented reality display running on a handheld appliance.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		ASAT will be commercialized for use in many applications but starting with the operation and teleoperation of optical sensors in a geographic context.  Other applications may include aircrew situation awareness, and recreational multiplayer gaming.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

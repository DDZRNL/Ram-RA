		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Phase I effort demonstrated, through actual development and tests with a spacecraft system, the technical and programmatic feasibility of developing, within the SBIR phase II program, the prototype of an  innovative and low-cost Open System of Agile Ground Stations using the new commercial Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology. The prototype agile stations will operate in a wide band used by NASA and other science and technology satellites and will be able to switch between communications frequencies, modes and data protocols, in real time, to service multiple satellites. The stations will be remotely programmable to store portfolios of satellite applications, and will switch between applications on demand from the largely automatized Ground Station Management and Maintenance Center (GSMMC). Multiple station sites will provide a high level of back-up capability and link opportunities at up to 3.5Mbits/s and will eliminate down-times. The GSMMC will interface with the different satellite Mission Operation Centers, and oversee the scheduling and programming of the station system. The prototype system will be implemented on the existing HETE-2 network of three stations, opening that system to service multiple missions at very low cost, while significantly enhancing its capabilities and performance. <BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Open System of Agile Stations will be of interest to many developers of NASA science and technology missions. Developers of SMEX projects for example are and will be interested in a ready-made low cost ground system that provides a flexible, reliable and economical solution to their spacecraft communication requirements, at up to 3.5 Mbit/s, and more in future versions.<BR>Another application is as a back-up system for NASA and other missions. Existing and future NASA systems, operating in the S-band (and beyond in future versions) could  have their specific applications on file at all the ground stations in the network, ready to be activated when the need arises. This for the small cost of developing and testing SDR code adapted to their communication system, which can be done in a few weeks. Current  NASA projects such as TESS have already expressed a strong interest in using the prototype system, and are encouraging its development. There is no doubt that when the Open System of Agile Stations prototype is build and tested it will find NASA applications, and requirements will grow.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		DoD experimenters have a potential need for a network of agile stations to support experimental missions with a high level of flexibility and at low communication costs. AFRL promoted the development of a pilot SDR ground station system to support the PnPSat project and test the Agile Station concept.  DoD has specific requirement concerning data security that can be accommodated by separate clusters of agile  ground stations. We expect that when the Phase II prototype Open System of Agile Ground Stations is developed and tested, a DREN version of the system will be of interest to DoD experimenters.<BR>Non governmental projects have also expressed similar needs and interest, and the Open System of Agile Stations has potential  users within the low-earth-orbiting projects where it can be used either as the primary system or as a back-up and an easy alternative way to download additional data or send commands to the satellites.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

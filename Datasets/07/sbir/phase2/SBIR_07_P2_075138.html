		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Both manned and unmanned off-Earth missions of the future will require very lightweight, inexpensive, high efficiency, flexible and single-use photovoltaic (PV) arrays to generate electric power.  Current PV technology horizons do not meet the requirements for expanded mission capability.  Although inorganic PVs hold the record for solar power conversion efficiency, they are inflexible, heavy, and expensive to produce.  There is increasing interest in a new type of PV technology that is based on organic semiconducting materials.  However, the performance of these devices has been limited by the availability of stable n-type (acceptor) organic semiconductors.  TDA Research, Inc. proposes to use a new class of n-type conjugated polymers to produce more efficient organic PV devices (OPVs).  The first generation of our new acceptor materials is already commercially available through Sigma-Aldrich, and the current technology readiness level (TRL) at the end of the Phase I stands at 4 with proof-of-concept results, OPV prototypes, and commercial sales.  A successful Phase II project will lead to several commercial n-type organic semiconductor products being sold by Sigma-Aldrich to both the research and commercial markets, and the use of our products in the full scale production of lightweight flexible OPVs (TRL 6-7).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A successful project will produce a new class of n-type conjugated polymers for high efficiency, thin film organic solar cells.  This technology will revolutionize PV power generation where cost, weight, flexibility, and form-factor are major concerns.  Spaced-based platforms such as manned and unmanned vehicles, probes, and rovers all require lightweight, high efficiency, single-use power generation and will benefit greatly from the realization of this new technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		New semiconducting polymers with good electron accepting and transport properties are needed for the fabrication of highly efficient organic solar cells.  Potential immediate applications of organic PV devices include disposable flexible power sources, foldable and deployable arrays, charging systems for smart magnetic cards and for smart packaging materials, photovoltaics on fabric and textiles, and various military applications.  Other future applications may include solar panels for private homes and foldable charging pads for cellular phones, GPS units, laptop computers and other portable devices.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Single crystal piezoelectric deformable mirrors with high actuator density, fine pitch, large stroke and no floating wires will be developed for future NASA science and communications applications. Single crystal piezoelectric DMs share the fine pitch with co-fired electrostrictive or ceramic piezoelectric DMs and MEMS DMs, but with large stroke at relatively low voltages (< 150 V) and with a broader operation temperature range (< 20 K - > 300K). Specifically,  a 32x32 actuator array with stroke > 2 um, pitch of < 1mm  and a 8x8 actuator array with stroke > 12 um, pitch of < 2mm will be developed for fine and coarse DMs. Actuator driving electronics will be scaled up to a multi-channel actuator driver and optimization of the design, facesheet mounting process and characterizations for deformable mirrors will be investigated.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Single crystal microactutaors can be used for large stroke, high precision deformable mirrors in NASA coronagraphic instruments, interferometric telescopes, and space-based observatories.  ORIGINS missions SUVO, SAFIR, and Planet Imager, Earth Science applications, such as LIDAR systems as well as Coastal Ocean Imaging systems will all benefit from this deformable mirror technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Large stroke, high precision actuator arrays based deformable mirrors are also attractive to DOD adaptive optics programs<BR>such as directed energy applications and medical adaptive optics such as retina imaging applications. Apart from adaptive<BR>optics applications, large stroke, high precision piezo actuators are also good candidates for active vibration control and<BR>structure morphing, RF communication tuning, bio-medical manipulators, photonic tooling, cryogenic microscopy tools,<BR>micro/nanofabrication and nanoassembly.<BR>

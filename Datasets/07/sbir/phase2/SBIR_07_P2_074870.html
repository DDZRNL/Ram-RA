		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Large aperture antennas are of interest to NASA for applications in establishing high-speed communication relays for interplanetary missions.  Design goals include 20 meter apertures.  In order to minimize mission costs at these large diameters, weight must be severely restricted. <BR>Adherent Technologies, Inc. (ATI) has developed two technologies for ultra-light space structures and antennas, the Rigidization on Command<SUP>TM</SUP> (ROC) concept, uses UV-curing resins to stabilize inflated structures and a self-deploying foam antenna concept at small aperture.  These technologies were combined in the Phase I program to produce a foam stabilized antenna with a ROC reflector surface.  The areal density of the 0.6 m devise was 2.2 kg/m3.<BR><BR>In the Phase II program, ATI will team with ILC Dover and Allied EM to develop the needed materials, design, manufacture, deploy, and test a 3 m Ka band antenna based on the foam stabilized inflatable technology.  ATI will lead the materials development effort, optimizing the foam formulations and injection methods, as well as create a custom ROC resin for antenna applications. ILC Dover will manufacture the necessary inflatable mold, and Allied EM will be responsible for the RF design and testing.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology is designed to stabilize inflated structures in a vacuum environment.  The primary application is for very large aperture antennas as they are needed for interplanetary missions.  The design goal is an areal density of 1 kg/m3, which is easily met by the new approach.<BR>The concept is easily expanded for other inflatables like habitat modules for lunar exploration or connecting structures for modular space stations.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		At the current development stage, the technology is limited to space applications.  Here it is competitive with state-of-the-art technology satellite antennas due to its low weight.  It has been shown that the foam formulations can also be modified for terrestrial applications.  This opens a whole new area of stabilized inflatable structures as a potential market.  Primary targets would be shelters for emergency management and for military deployments where semi-permanent installations are needed.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

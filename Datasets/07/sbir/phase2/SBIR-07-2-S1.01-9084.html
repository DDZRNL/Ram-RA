		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Michigan Aerospace Corporation (MAC) is pleased to present the following Phase II proposal for a Fabry-Perot Based Interferometer Receiver for the High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) System.  Under the Phase I work, MAC successfully developed instrument models and created a conceptual design for an aircraft-qualified receiver that can be used with the current HSRL collection optics.  This design is optimized to spectrally separate the aerosol and molecular backscatter for the calculation of the aerosol-to-total-scattering ratio and aerosol extinction coefficient.  Additionally, wind and temperature data products can be produced with this system.  The proposed Phase II efforts are directed at designing and building a bench-top HSRL 532nm receiver that is capable of taking accurate measurements of aerosol scattering ratio, extinction coefficients, molecular temperature and line-of-sight (LOS) velocity.  This demonstration unit will verify a new adaptive interferometer measurement technique, called the Programmable Edge Technique (PET), which makes use of a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) in conjunction with a Fabry-Perot interferometer and two photo-multiplier tubes (PMT).  The completed bench-top receiver design will serve as the baseline for future aircraft mounted implementations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This research is directly applicable to the highly-modular HSRL system at NASA Langley Research Center. Subsequent development of this work will result in a system that can validate and extend the current HSRL system. A 532nm implementation of this work will allow cross-validation of the HSRL and PET techniques, as well as add extended capability for temperature, density, pressure and line-of-sight (vertical) wind velocity estimation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The atmospheric measurement capabilities made possible through this research aids in military areas such as atmospheric mitigation for snipers, long-range gunnery and precision landing zones for manned and unmanned aircraft as well as meteorological monitoring to assist in Nuclear/Biological/Chemical (NBC) threat analysis and tracking.<BR>Non-military applications include clear-air turbulence sensing for commercial aircraft, meteorological monitoring of tropospheric and upper-atmosphere winds, and site selection and improved efficiency for wind farms.<BR>

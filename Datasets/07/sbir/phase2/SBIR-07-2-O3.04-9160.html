		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Future space programs will require extensive monitoring of complex, highly instrumented systems such as the Orion spacecraft and lunar/Martian habitats. To handle tasks and situations that cannot be fully delegated to automation software, future flight controllers and crew must be able to monitor, review and interpret voluminous and complex telemetry data quickly to maintain necessary levels of situations awareness and make critical decisions rapidly and accurately.<BR><BR>We propose to develop Intelliviz, an intelligent telemetry data visualization assistant for NASA.  This software system will create data visualizations automatically to reduce the effort and difficulty of specifying and constructing effective telemetry data visualizations. Intelliviz will determine the user's data analysis goals by enabling users to express their data analysis goals directly and by posing system diagnosis or system management questions or problems from which analysis goals can be inferred. Intelliviz will then generate appropriate displays that support the user's data analysis goals by retrieving the relevant telemetry and systems data, selecting appropriate data display methods, and instantiating and configuring those displays.<BR><BR>During the prior Phase 1 SBIR project, we reviewed research literature describing prior work in automated visualization design, reviewed related NASA R&D programs, specified scenarios and test cases, identified promising early applications for Intelliviz, refined our requirements and design, implemented a software prototype that demonstrates Intelliviz capabilities, and developed a plan to create an operational prototype during Phase 2.   During the phase 2 project proposed in this document, we will develop a technology readiness level 6 operational prototype of Intelliviz to demonstrate its feasibility, utility, and usability by a NASA-relevant user community and task area.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Intelliviz can be used to provide design-time and run-time data visualization design assistance to support manned and unmanned space missions. It can also be used to support other types of users and tasks such as scientists and engineers. Intelliviz would enable automated creation of data visualizations on-the-fly during missions. In addition, it will support semi-automated development of configurable, data visualization templates before they are needed.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Intelliviz can be used by corporations and federal, state, and local government organizations to analyze complex data more quickly and effectively, especially in time-critical situations.  The application area most similar to the NASA application would be assessing situations or diagnosing problems in factories, complex equipment, computer and communication networks, and other complex, mission-critical systems.  Other potential applications include military command, control, and planning systems, knowledge management and analysis systems for intelligence analysts, civilian emergency operations centers for incident management, computer systems and communications networks, and safety-critical or high-value manufacturing operations.

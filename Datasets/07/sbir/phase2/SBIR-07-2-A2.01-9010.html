		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Recent advances in propulsion, aerodynamic, and noise technologies have led to a revived interest in supersonic cruise aircraft; however, achieving economic viability for these vehicles requires dramatic improvements in cruise efficiency.  Optimization of inlet performance offers a potent method for achieving this goal, and a range of conceptual flow control systems are available to address critical problems like blockage, boundary layer bleed, duct length, and flow distortion.  By exploiting High Temperature Smart Memory Alloy (HTSMA) technologies, these concepts can be mechanized into robust, compact and lightweight devices, enabling actuators suitable integration into the inlets of supersonic aircraft.   The proposed effort leverages prior successful development of solid state smart structures by the investigators in developing of small scale surface-mounted flow control devices as well as large scale actuation systems for inlet ramp mechanisms actuated via HTSMA technology.  The proposed Phase II will build upon the Phase I proof of concept study to further develop a fully integrated active supersonic inlet system, including active inlet ramp and deployable flow control devices, as well as the aero/thermo/structural analysis models required to design such systems and subcomponents.  In addition, Phase II will be the continued refinement and characterization of actuator-ready HTSMAs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		By providing foundational research on innovative concepts for propulsion system components for supersonic transport aircraft, the proposed effort will directly support a wide range of fundamental NASA goals in aeronautics.  One key result of the effort will be extended development and characterization of highly promising HTSMA materials, a resource of great potential for high speed and/or high temperature applications in subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic aircraft.  In addition, the Phase I effort will lay the groundwork for enabling technology to provide integrated inlet/engine control to ensure safe, stable, and efficient operation for continuous flight above Mach 2.  Also, the projected integrated aero/thermo/elastic models of actuator performance to be assembled and validated will assist the development of concurrent engineering tools for analysis and design of smart-materials-based propulsion flow control systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A successful Phase II effort will open the door to prototype testing and eventual implementation of a HTSMA-driven adaptive flow control system.   The most direct beneficiary would be next-generation supersonic aircraft that could incorporate these robust, low-profile, low-power flow control devices to permit an optimal balance of improved engine/inlet performance and enhanced engine safety.  Successful implementation in this application would also lead to spin-off developments in a number of actuation tasks, including follow-on control concepts for compressor and turbine stages in subsonic or supersonic engines that would directly benefit both civil and military systems.  Supersonic cruise technology is also of interest to U.S. Department of Defense agencies, and the developments projected here would directly benefit numerous missile designs as well as both manned and unmanned aircraft systems.  Finally, spin-off applications of this technology for control of subsonic engine noise emissions of interest to commercial engine manufacturers, and commercialization of derivatives of the technology to be developed in Phase II for this application will be undertaken in partnership with commercial aircraft engine manufacturers.

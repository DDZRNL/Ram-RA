		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Seldon Technologies will further test and develop its patented carbon nanotube filtration technology to NASA's Lunar Exploration challenges. This project focuses on the problem of efficient removal of nanoscale (10-100nm) and larger lunar dust particulates from air using a nanostructured fiber media containing carbon nanotubes. Lunar dust presents an important challenge to Lunar exploration and habitation, nonetheless it has some unique properties that can be taken advantage of in designing specialized filtration media capable of achieving efficient removal from air. As demonstrated in Phase I, rough surface shape combined with the electrically and magnetically charged nature of the dust means that rough, electrically activated filtration media will be effective tools for filtration. Seldon's work with its proprietary fused carbon nanotube media offers a unique path to significant new purification applications that meet important needs for NASA's Lunar Exploratory Initiatives. The unique physical properties of the carbon nanotubes will be capitalized upon to create a filtration media with high efficiency and low pressure drop that can be electrically powered to enhance filtration of charged lunar dust particles. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are important applications for this product throughout NASA's operations from protecting human life on lunar explorations, to cleaning the air of clean rooms, to reducing emissions from its vehicle fleet. The potential health and environmental impacts of airborne ultrafine particles are now known to be significant. Typical filtration solutions struggle to remove these very small contaminants. As a result, energy is wasted and, because of cost, some filtration applications are just not pursued. Products based on this technology will protect astronauts and sensitive equipment from lunar dust in the air handling systems of spacecraft and even in personal breathing apparatus. They will efficiently remove very small particulates from the air in NASA's clean rooms. Finally, filters will help to clean the emissions from the many earthbound diesel and other engines NASA operates to help reduce NASA's carbon footprint and improve the health of its employees and communities.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		According to the Centers for Disease Control the inhalation of fine particles is now estimated to be the ninth leading cause of death in the US. In the past, the best, most expensive filters have typically been used in clean rooms where the quality of products are dependent on the lack of contaminants in the environment. The market size for clean room air filters is estimated to be approximately $0.5 billion worldwide. As the production of sensitive equipment increases and employers acknowledge the health risks of their employees' exposure to some ultrafine particles, the market for such filters will continue to rise dramatically.<BR><BR>The estimated global market size for air purification equipment is estimated to be about $2.5 billion.  The tremendous surface area of Seldon's media and its ability to effectively capture and/or destroy pathogens with a relatively open structure gives the product an extended life making it a more effective barrier than available technology.  Further, the material's high electrical conductivity offers an additional means for enhancing the purification efficiency by adding electrostatic attraction capabilities. Other product opportunities include incorporating the media into facemasks, gas masks, vehicle cabin air filters, and filters in building HVAC systems.  <BR>

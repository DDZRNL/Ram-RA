		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A broadband G-Band low noise amplifier has been designed using a 50nm MHEMT. The MHEMT model that was used for the design was measured. With the use of this model, a single ended MMIC low noise amplifier was designed using various analysis tools. The single ended amplifier had a midband gain of 27.0dB with a noise figure of 3.7dB, a significant advance in the state-of-the-art. A balanced amplifier was also designed under this contract. It consisted of a waveguide to microstrip transition, an input coupler, the balanced amplifier, an output coupler, and a microstrip to waveguide transition. The MMIC chip that consisted of the input and output coupler and balanced amplifier was 1.4mm long by 1.23mm wide. The simulated performance demonstrated a gain of 25.6dB with a noise figure of 4.4dB midband. Since the MMIC process that will be used is fully space qualified and has been used on NASA's ATMS program, the design at the conclusion of the Phase II program should be ready for a space system insertion. The design would only be changed to meet specific program objectives.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The G-Band amplifier that will be developed under the Phase II program has significant NASA commercial applications. Many of NASA's remote sensing satellites for weather forecasting and tracking presently have water band sensors that operate at G-Band. However, these sensors have limited capability since low noise amplifiers are not available at the present time. These systems presently have mixer front ends with limited sensitivity. The G-Band low noise amplifier will greatly enchance the sensitivity of these systems as well as providing more accurate weather forecasting and tracking of storms such as hurricanes. The fact that the MMIC is based on a proven space process and can be inserted into space systems almost immediately is a unique advantage for this design.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The development of the low noise G-Band amplifier using the 50nm device is an advancement in the state-of-the-art for low noise amplifiers.The innovative design can then be used to advance the low noise performance of MMIC amplifiers down to the microwave region. They can also be used to enhance the sensitivity of commercial satellite communication systems. In addition, the emerging market for imaging systems in the submillimeter and THz region could use a MMIC amplifier with this performance. In fact, JJW Consulting has developed and shipped a 140GHz Imaging system that was to be used for an all-weather landing system. The system used a 140GHz LNA. The sensitivity of this system could be enhanced by the inclusion of these amplifiers.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		As air-breathing combustion applications advance, increased use of fuel for cooling, combined with cycle advancements, leads to a situation where the fuel can become superheated. While this can lead to potential benefit in terms of the eventual fuel injection process, with enhanced atomization and evaporation, it creates a significant challenge relative design of a system to successfully exploit this behavior.  Further, existing computational design tools have not be sufficiently validated to predict the behavior of superheated liquids.  Dealing with the superheat behavior in the injection of a liquid fuel requires substantially more physical phenomena to be accounted for compared to a subcooled system. As a result, detailed data and models for this behavior as encountered in practical fuels are needed in order to validate and evolve the models needed. In the work proposed, emphasis will be given to the injection of a plain liquid jet under superheated conditions. Building from the successful Phase I effort, the behavior of internal liquid and external spray in both quiescent and heated crossflow environments will be studied.  The models evolved will be incorporated into an existing simulation environment developed by ERC for atomization of liquid jets. In addition, data will be available for CFD validation.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		For Aerospace applications, development of fuel injection schemes that involve fuel superheat will be enhanced by model construction and validation resulting from the proposed project. Both standalone modeling tools and models for incorporation into a CFD environment will result from the project. NASA design tools will be enhanced in general and any simulation platforms needing to incorporate superheated fuel behavior will benefit in particular.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Any application with fuel injection systems involving the potential for superheated liquid will benefit from the proposed work.  Examples include automotive applications as well as boiler/furnace applications.

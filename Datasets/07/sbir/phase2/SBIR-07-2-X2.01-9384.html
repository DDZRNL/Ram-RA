		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase II SBIR project will provide real time, relative six Degree of Freedom (6DoF) information to the crew of the ORION for docking. Our technical innovation performs optimized correlation (ULTOR<SUP>REG</SUP>), using video from the centerline (boresight) camera, to accurately locate features of interest, and marry that with a passive pose and position algorithm (ULTOR<SUP>REG</SUP> P3E) to accurately measure relative position and pose.  In Phase II this ULTOR<SUP>REG</SUP> P3E process will be ported to an ORION VPU emulator, integrated with a centerline camera emulator, and demonstrated in a hardware in the loop (HWIL) docking experiment. The benefits of this program include:<BR> No additional weight or volume added to the weight constrained ORION baseline design.<BR> A backup docking sensor capability using different physics.<BR> The sensor output data will serve as an astronaut aid, working with the same imagery the astronaut views, and providing calibrated measurements.<BR> The sensor can work with Star Tracker imagery for long range relative navigation.<BR> The sensor data can be used directly with the Orion control system, allowing the astronaut to serve a supervisory role, relieving workload.<BR> Supports Lunar orbit docking (uncrewed Orion).<BR> Compatible with future robotic missions and robotic systems.<BR>

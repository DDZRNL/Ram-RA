		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Satellite design encompasses a multitude of steps from concept to flight, which can take several years, depending on the scope, requirements and budget of the mission. The process also requires a wide range of design and management tools, with limited consistency and data interchange capability.  Detailing the relationships between the satellite configuration (components and interrelationships), inventory control systems, life cycle management, design, analysis and test data is extremely difficult at best. No tool exists that meets these needs for the general satellite design, system engineering and integration process. Sci_Zone has begun development of our innovative Satellite Design Automation architecture QuickSAT<SUP>TM</SUP>, in conjunction with our step_SATdb open database architecture to meet this need. step_SATdb seamlessly integrates existing detail design tools with QuickSAT<SUP>TM</SUP>, as well as databases tracking requirements, hardware and software components and payloads in inventory, with the final configuration of the satellite. QuickSAT<SUP>TM</SUP>, provides for not only rapid design, via design wizards and integration to existing design tools, but will provide coherency between a range of applications and data sets. step_SATdb stores and distributes supporting satellite design, configuration, mission, support and test data from a centralized database server and can distribute the data across multiple platforms and via the internet.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Step_SATdb and QuickSAT allows for the rapid development, configuration management, and deployment of systems and satellites. NASA commercial applications include any Satellite or Subsystem development program, manned or unmanned mission - <BR>and any project requiring seamless integration between costing, performance, program and project life cycle support, and design processes. Once developed the product should be widely adopted within NASA due in part to QuickSAT, the open APIs, its ability to tie into NASA legacy systems and future environments such as NeXIOM and Step_SATdb's open architecture and platform independence, plus free cost. <BR><BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Step_SATdb and QuickSAT allows for the rapid development, configuration <BR>management, and deployment of satellites while considering performance, risk and managing the process through out the program life cycle. Non-NASA applications include any aerospace related applications requiring seamless integration between costing, performance and design. Non-NASA commercial customers include our own customers, AFRL and SAIC, interested in implementing QuickSAT, and supporting Step_SATdb Environments. This will provide us the opportunity to expand our offering and market to new customers due in part to the architecture's open environment and platform independence. It is planned this project will set a standard for data exchange and design management. A market will then exist of step_SATdb certified applications, guaranteeing increased software sales and support services. This process has begun with the acceptance by AFRL of step_SATdb as the standard data architecture for the Operationally Responsive Space Program.<BR><BR>

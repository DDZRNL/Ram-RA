		<BR>
		In a successful Phase 1 project for NASA SBIR topic A1.05, "Data Mining for Integrated Vehicle Health Management," Michigan Aerospace Corporation (MAC) demonstrated its SPADE anomaly detection software to key personnel in NASA's Intelligent Systems Division (ISD) and with data from our partners at Boeing, SpaceX and GMV Space Systems.  The feedback from these demonstrations was used to establish future development directions for Phase 2. <BR><BR>Phase 2 will consist of three major efforts: 1) the design and implementation of the Taiga system, a next-generation enhancement of the SPADE software, 2) an investigation into combining complementary functionality of Taiga with existing code at ISD including the Inductive Modeling System, Mariana and others, and 3) the implementation of a prototype automatic parallelizer, in cooperation with subcontractor Optillel Solutions, for a subset of C++ useful for hardware acceleration of machine learning applications.<BR><BR>The scope of the interaction with researchers in NASA ISD will be to explore the relationships between IMS and Taiga and gauge benefits such a Data Handling, Feature Reduction, Visualization and Explainability. We will also investigate heterogeneous ensemble methods by analyzing the Mariana system.<BR><BR>Optillel's C++ Parallelizer will reduce MAC's development costs for parallelizing C++ code for multi-core chips and clusters. This effort will build on Optillel's existing body of work that supports graphical programming languages, and will extend their technology to the analysis and parallelization of C++ code.<BR><BR>Both the Taiga system and Optillel's prototype have significant commercialization potential in industries as diverse as Chemical, Pharmaceutical, Manufacturing and Aerospace.

		MAC's Taiga data mining platform has a variety of important applications at NASA.  The need for next-generation data mining tools to aid in lifecycle support for aircraft, spacecraft, satellites and ships is widely recognized, as exemplified by the scope of the solicitation for this program. The Intelligent Data Understanding (IDU) Group at NASA Ames Research Center is a prime candidate for collaboration in developing and using Taiga. Through productive Phase 1 discussions with IDU, MAC determined that the most relevant area for Taiga at IDU is Discovery and Systems Health (DaSH), whose mission includes monitoring, data analysis, prognostics, diagnostics, and diagnostic decision aids. In this arena NASA will benefit from MAC's experience with Threat Assessment for satellites with the Air Force Research Lab. The Taiga system can be directly applied to problems being examined at DaSH, and it is highly complementary to existing software already being used and tested within IDU, including but not limited to Dave Iverson's Inductive Monitoring System (IMS) and Pat Castle's Mariana.  There is important synergy between Tiaga and these packages; with IMS Taiga complements feature reduction, cluster visualization, explainability, fusion and data synthesis for validation, and with Mariana it complements data fusion and parallelization.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Products for discovering novel events and detecting anomalies are quickly becoming indispensable for the proper operation and maintenance of the complex systems employed by modern industry, medical providers and the military.  Factories, health monitors, aircraft and other vehicles regularly produce hundreds or thousands of channels of telemetry in real time, which must be monitored for possible indications of failure.  These data resources present an extremely diverse market opportunity for Taiga, which will detect events of interest in high-volume data streams of large dimensionality, independent of the raw data source. This diversity is confirmed by the variety of customers who have already expressed interest in MAC's anomaly detection software, including Dow Chemical, Boeing and Space-X. The "Write Once Deploy Anywhere" (WODA) component of Taiga represents another major commercial opportunity. The emerging trend in hardware from single to multi-core systems is exposing a fast-growing requirement in the software industry for intelligent development tools to aid programmers in converting existing non-parallel algorithms to parallel algorithms. After Phase 2, Optillel will be positioned to license its technology for C++ on any Integrated Development Environment and leverage an enormous pre-existing market.  MAC will benefit by being the first partner to use Optillel's WODA technology and reduce development costs for multicore-enabled anomaly detection products.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Aurora Flight Sciences (AFS), in collaboration with the MIT Space Systems Laboratory (MIT-SSL), proposed the Synthetic Imaging Maneuver Optimization (SIMO) program to develop a methodology, calibrated through hardware-in-the-loop testing, to optimize S/C maneuvers to more efficiently synthesize images for missions such as Stellar Imager (SI).  Time and fuel-optimal maneuvers are only a part of the optimization problem.  Selecting the maneuver waypoints (number and location) determines the quality of the synthesized image.  The number of S/C, the size of the sub-apertures, and the type of propulsion system used also impacts imaging rate, propellant mass, and mission cost.  Capturing all of these mission aspects in an integrated mission optimization framework helps mission designers to select the most appropriate architecture for meeting the needs and constraints of missions such as SI.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The SIMO technology is directly applicable to, and motivated by, NASA GSFC's Stellar Imager mission. However, other NASA missions requiring staged control are the Space Interferometry Mission, Terrestrial Planet Finder Mission (Interferometer and Coronagraph), SPIRIT, and SPECS.  In fact, the Terrestrial Planet Finder Mission  Interferometer requires both sub-aperture reconfiguration as well as staged control.  Of particular interest may be the LISA mission.  NASA and ESA are currently trying to validate the ability to free-float a proof mass, measure its motion to pico-meter accuracy relative to the encompassing spacecraft, measure range between spacecraft as well as capture and maintain this knowledge.  This has proven to be a financially challenging endeavor.  The capabilities being developed for SIMO, as well as the potential to transition it to the micro-gravity environment of ISS, creates an opportunity to test staged sensing and control in support of LISA at a fraction of the cost.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We anticipate that there are other applications both within NASA and beyond, and in military and commercial sectors. The DARPA F6 program is creating a virtual satellite architecture where elements are flown in loose formation to enhance staged deployment, technology upgrade, payload reconfiguration, and survivability using the technologies of distributed communication/computing, power beaming, and cluster flight.  The AFS-MIT team is a member of three of the four competing teams under DARPA's F6 program, providing a direct path for SIMO technology transfer. The DoD is also interested in robust and efficient multi-vehicle reconfiguration for satellite servicing, docking, inspection, and assembly of large apertures.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

      words) <BR>Aero-assist technologies are used to control the =
velocity of=20
      exploration vehicles (EV) when entering earth or other planetary=20
      atmospheres. Since entry of EVs in planetary atmospheres results =
in=20
      significant heating, thermally stable aero-assist technologies are =

      required to avoid the high heating rates while maintaining low =
mass.=20
      Polymer adhesives are used in aero-assist structures because of =
the need=20
      for high flexibility and good bonding between the different layers =
of=20
      polymer films or fabrics. However, current polymer adhesives =

goal of=20
      this program is to develop high temperature adhesives that exhibit =
high=20
      thermal conductivity in addition to increased thermal =
decomposition=20
      temperature. Enhanced thermal conductivity will help to dissipate =
heat=20
      quickly and effectively to avoid temperature rise to harmful =
levels. This,=20
      together with increased thermal decomposition temperature, will =
enable the=20
      adhesives to sustain transient high temperature conditions. A key=20
      innovation of the program is to control the nanoparticle =
morphology so=20
      that enhanced thermal conductivity can be realized at relatively =
low=20

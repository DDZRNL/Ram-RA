		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Researchers at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition invented OZ, a primary flight display that provides a single, unified graphic display of critical flight information.  OZ virtually eliminate the need to scan flight instruments and provides superior performance for flight in low visibility conditions compared to current integrated avionics displays.  eSky licensed OZ and is commercializing it for general aviation applications. eSky previously demonstrated the superiority of OZ over current integrated avionics PFDs in high workload situations.<BR>NASA Langley and the German Aerospace Laboratory invented researchers H-mode, a collaborative flight control system that shares flight control between pilot and automation allowing the pilot to remain in-the-loop with a high level of situational awareness while retaining aeronautical decision making authority.  <BR>In phase 1 eSky designed an integrated system (H/OZ) that uses OZ as the primary flight display in the H-mode flight control system (HFCS).  H/OZ allows the pilot to maintain superior situational awareness while remaining engaged in the managing and directing the flight.  eSky incorporated into both HFCS and OZ graphical elements new to both that support improved functionality.<BR>H/OZ has the following primary advantages over current integrated avionics systems:<BR>superior situational awareness; critical navigational information displayed on the PFD;  real-time seamless allocation of control between pilot and automation;  Point to Program (P2P) mechanism for visually selecting  airspace elements for guidance; Focus to Display (F2D) mechanism for displaying on PFD and MFD screens only situationally relevant airspace information.  <BR>eSky will integrate HFCS and OZ into a prototype H/OZ simulator with new functionality and conduct extensive usability and performance tests of the H/OZ system using human volunteers.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Space Shuttle.  OZ was initially developed with the space shuttle application in mind.  The lack of power simply means that the bent wing and strut configuration can be used for energy management during the approach and landing phase.  Addition of the H-mode automation adds to the capability of precisely navigating any winged spacecraft during reentry.  The bent wing symbology allows precision angle of attack control in all configurations during descent.<BR>NASA Aircraft.  OZ was licensed by eSky for general aviation applications only, but the terms of the license allow its integration into any aircraft from a Piper Cub to an Airbus 380.  Any conventional (and even unconventional) aircraft operated by NASA can benefit from OZ.  Addition of the H-mode collaborative flight control system adds capability to any aircraft.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		F2D control of airspace element display and incorporation of the OZ airspeed graphic symbology into an advanced airspeed/power management indicator are applicable to any commercial aircraft.  <BR>OZ is applicable to all fixed wing platforms, both powered and non-powered.  H/OZ system adds to OZ the capability of replacing traditional autopilot and flight director systems with an intelligent, collaborative flight control system.  This is compatible with air transport aircraft as well, as a key component of an integrated avionics system.  Military aircraft, in addition to superior IMC flight capability, can use energy management for both tactical situations and aircraft carrier landings.  <BR>FAA certified light sport aircraft (LSA) are limited to 1320 pounds gross weight and limited airspeed and horsepower, with a maximum of two seats.  In addition to purely recreational flying, LSAs represent a new generation of training aircraft for pilots with private, commercial and air transport pilot ratings.  These trainers need IMC flight capability.  A substantial fraction of LSAs used as training aircraft will benefit from OZ technology.<BR>

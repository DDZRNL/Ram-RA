		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Spacecrafts rely on arrays of solar cells to generate electrical power. It is an on-going challenge to maximize electrical power available to spacecraft while reducing overall stowage volume and mass of solar array, which requires developing more efficient solar cells with higher specific power density. <BR><BR>The objective of this SBIR project is to develop a generic approach, based on novel functional nano-materials, to significantly increasing the solar cell efficiency (~10%), specific power density, radiation resistance and lifetime, without adding much cost or weight to the existing solar cells. The feasibility to synthesis such nano-materials has been explored and demonstrated in Phase I. Without optimizing, preliminary test on commercial solar cells show an efficiency gain approaching 5% after applying such nano-materials. Such nano-materials will be further improved for energy efficiency and environmental durability in Phase II, to reach the objective of at least 10% gain in energy efficiency on majority of commercial solar cells. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The novel nano-materials will find major applications in many NASA space programs. By significantly enhancing the efficiency and output of solar cells, with virtually no change on solar device volume or weight, it would be ideal addition to the solar panels used in space shuttles and other space vehicles. By enabling advanced solar cell with efficiency over 30% and specific power density over 550 W/Kg, the launch and operation cost of spacecraft can be lowered, which greatly benefit various NASA spacecraft programs.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology can also be applied to most types of commercial solar cells. By enhancing the efficiency of commercial solar cell (e.g. Silicon cells), without incurring much cost, it will reduce the key "cost per watt" of solar cells in competing with other sources of electrical energy; hence it help promoting the market adoption of solar energy, which benefit the Nation's environment as well as energy independence from foreign oil.

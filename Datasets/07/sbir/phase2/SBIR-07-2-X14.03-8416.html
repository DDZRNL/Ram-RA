		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Analysis of Phase I test data demonstrates that the Photogenics Spectroscopic Dosimeter will detect neutron energies from 0.8 up to 600 MeV. The detector efficiencies in the energy region of interest to NASA of 0.5 to 150 MeV were predicted by MCNP-X models.  These models were partially confirmed by the tests at the EAL and LANSCE, with a high confidence in the data for the 1-14 MeV range and a confirmation of the detector's spectroscopic capabilities between 15-150 MeV.   Further analysis of the high energy data will be performed in Phase II.<BR>Using the detection efficiencies determined Phase I and the IRCP74 damage coefficients, doses have been calculated for the neutron fluxes encountered in the test facilities.  During Phase II a full-scale working model of the spectroscopic dosimeter will be fabricated and tested.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is seeking improved neutron spectroscopy to enhance its characterization of the space environment and has also identified a need for improved accuracy in the estimate of neutron dose experienced by astronauts on long duration space missions.  
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA version of the dosimeter can be redesigned for use in radiation safety monitoring at a wide variety of facilities concerned with potential radiation hazards, i.e. laboratories, university research facilities, and private nuclear power plants.

		<P>
		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this Phase 2 project, we propose to develop, construct, and deliver to NASA a computed axial tomography time-domain terahertz (CT TD-THz) non destructive evaluation (NDE) system which will provide true three dimensional images of aerospace polymer, ceramic, and composite structures.   Traditional time domain terahertz reflection tomographic imaging captures only a single view of an object, generating images of laminar structure similar to an ultrasound "B-Scan".  This reflection tomographic imaging is limited, however, in revealing only the laminar structure which presents a clear specular reflection from each interface.  Furthermore, traditional time domain terahertz reflection tomographic imaging has substantial difficulty in determining the layer index of refraction an absorption properties without ambiguity.   In Phase 1 we demonstrated the feasibility TD-THz  axial computed tomography to generate cross-sectional slices of aerospace materials.  This method acquires not one view, but many radial axial views, generating a sinogram which can be used to reconstruct images using a derivative of standard X-Ray CT filtered back-projection.  The sinogram can be generated by the transmission absorbance, transmission time of flight, and, in principle, reflection measurements.  The reconstructed TD-THz CT images are 3D maps of the absorption coefficients and/or the index of refraction of the subsurface material.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed TD-THz CT NDE imager will be valuable in characterizing the aging and durability of aircraft and spacecraft materials and components.  Material examples include Kevlar, Zylon, and other non-conductive polymer matrix composites.  Example NDE applications where these materials are used include inspection of soft shell fan containment,  thermal protection systems, and composite overwrap pressure vessels.  These materials are in systems in which the 3D internal examination of new construction for flaws (voids, disbonds, inclusions, improper geometry and dimensions, and incomplete curing) may be critical.  It will be critical to periodically inspect systems for damage, fatigue and chemical degradation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Polymer matrix composites are used in automobile and ships and many other consumer and industrial products.  TD-THz CT 3D imaging applications can include inspection of automobile dashboards, imaging inspection for delamination of printed circuit boards, inspection of pipe insulation,  as well as with manufactured parts such as pure plastic and paper products. TD-THz CT imaging benefits homeland security applications under development such as personnel and luggage inspection for concealed weapons and explosives (in luggage, shoes, etc.).  TD-THz CT imaging and spectroscopy can inspect items in shipment such as mail, cardboards packages,  and plastic and wood crates.

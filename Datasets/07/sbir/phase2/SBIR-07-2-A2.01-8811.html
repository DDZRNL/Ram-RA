		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Materials Research & Design (MR&D) is proposing in the SBIR Phase II an effort to develop a tool for predicting the fatigue life of C/SiC composite laminates, which incorporates mechanical loading at any minimum stress to maximum stress ratio (i.e., R value), at room and elevated temperatures, in either inert or oxidizing environments.  The success of this effort would represent a significant state-of-the-art improvement in fatigue projections of ceramic matrix composites, since no tools capable of accomplishing this have ever been developed.  The developed algorithm, implemented via user-defined subroutines operating within the ABAQUS public domain finite element software, will represent a significant new addition to the suite tools currently available to CMC designers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology developed here will directly support the design of existing and future NASA space exploration vehicles.  A working model which successfully predicts the thermal and mechanical fatigue life of C/SiC materials and components will enable confident predictions of the useable structural life of CMC TPS components.  Such a tool would also enable inspection and maintenance schedules to be generated for C/SiC materials, using actual data from flown mission environments collected from integral health monitoring sensor systems.  CMC thermal protection system (TPS) elements, ranging from thick leading edges to doubly-curved acreage TPS panels and hot structure control surfaces, will all benefit from the proposed program.  A successful Phase II effort would also provide the beginnings of CMC life prediction tools applicable to oxidation-protected, i.e., coated CMC TPS components.  The successful Phase II program would also lead to a fatigue life prediction tool applicable to propulsion system components exposed to the harmful oxidation effluents, e.g. steam, common in the exhaust stream of turbojet and scramjet engine systems.  Additionally, the fatigue life prediction tools developed in the Phase II program, if successful, will support the development of any hot structure materials used on the Crew Exploration Vehicle and subsequent airframes required for the Mission to Mars.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology proposed in the Phase I program will also be of direct interest to the Department of Defense (DOD) to support the development of scramjets, hypersonic missiles, and maneuvering reentry bodies. The results are also expected to be of direct interest to programs including the USAF Common Aero Vehicle, and the DARPA Hypersonic Cruise Vehicle.  Hypersonic vehicles such as USAF global strike vehicles will employ load bearing TPS as acreage regions to minimize the TPS mass fraction for launch.  The use of C/SiC for other non-aerospace applications, such as in wind turbine blades and friction components such as brakes and clutches, offer another route for the utilization of the technology developed within this Phase II effort.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The overall objective of the proposed research is to design, develop and demonstrate fluidic actuator arrays for aerodynamic separation control and drag reduction. These actuators are based on a compact design of low mass-flow fluidic oscillators that produce high frequency (1-5 kHz) sweeping jets. Preliminary experiments on separation control over a trailing edge flap on a NACA 0015 airfoil, V-22 wing section for download reduction, cavity tones and jet thrust vectoring have shown encouraging results for these actuators.  <BR><BR>Based on the results from Phase I, and the commercial interest from a leading aircraft manufacturer, we propose to conduct a systematic study of the scaling parameters of the fluidic actuator arrays in relation to the geometric and aerodynamic parameters of the wing using wind tunnel tests on a specially designed airfoil model.  This will include the effects of actuator spacing, array location, pressure gradient and wing sweep on the actuator effectiveness.  Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) will be undertaken to estimate the risk of the proposed technology.  A rapid inspection technique will be developed for conducting quick, in situ testing of the fluidic arrays. Projecting to the future, a synchronous array of actuators will also be developed.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed work would be of interest to the ARMD for the aerodynamic flow control needs of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), subsonic fixed wing and rotary wing programs and transonic flow control programs.  The fluidic actuators would also be of interest to the Active Combustion Control, Active Stall Control and Active Inlet Control and Jet Noise Control Programs at NASA.  Such arrays can also be used for de-icing systems using either hot air or de-icing liquids since the fluidic jets work with both liquids and gases.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Aerodynamic flow control has a large number of applications in the commercial and military aerospace industry. We foresee applications of our technology to separation control over leading and trailing edge of airfoils to achieve high lift and minimum-drag configuration for aircraft wings, control of jet exhaust noise in aircraft engines, intake flow control, and internal flows in gas turbines. One other area of application we are exploring is the flow control and de-icing over wind turbine blades.

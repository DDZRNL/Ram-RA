		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed program will develop an hermetic, CTE matched, thermal shock resistant ceramic packaging technology that will facilitate the operation of Si and SiGe devices at extreme temperatures (-230ºC to 130ºC) encountered on the Moon and Mars. Processes that were developed in Phase I to assemble the components into a hermetically sealed package will be used to package SiGe operational amplifiers. Process and materials reliability will be demonstrated by fabricating and testing a 12 or 28 pin single chip module packages. <BR>

		<BR>
		Ceramic package for Si and SiGe devices that is capable of operating at extreme temperatures will provide an enabling technology for space exploration efforts including Moon and Mars missions.<BR><BR>The technology could be used for upcoming NASA Robotic Lunar Exploration Program (RLEP) initiatives.  Starting with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter launch in October 2008, the RLEP is responsible for a series of robotic missions to the moon and supports future exploration activities for sustained robotic and human exploration to Mars and beyond.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are several terrestrial applications that stand to benefit from the development of extreme environment microelectronic devices and associated packaging by achieving performance improvements and competitive advantages.  These applications include low temperature radiation environments, magnetic levitation transportation systems, medical diagnostics, cryogenic instrumentation, and super conducting magnetic energy storage systems.  The use of power electronics designed for and operated at low temperature is expected to result in more efficient systems than room temperature systems.  Extreme environment electronics can be characterized as a niche electronics market, albeit a fairly important one to many other products and systems that affect modern human life.

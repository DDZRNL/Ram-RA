		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Impact Technologies LLC, with the support of Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), proposes to continue developing key enhancements to NASA's Hybrid Diagnostic Engine (HyDE) that represent valuable and, in some cases, critical features for Integrated System Health Management (ISHM) developers in NASA and non-NASA application domains.  Specifically, the proposed program will be focused on attaining three milestones.  The first goal is to achieve commercial-grade readiness of a HyDE Developers Pack (HyDE DP) to TRL 6 or higher.  To facilitate Phase III NASA transition, the second program goal is deploying HyDE DP to Kennedy Space Center's (KSC) Integrated Ground System in support of the Constellation Program.  Finally, to facilitate Phase III commercial transition and dramatically improved the embedded capability of HyDE, preparation for Beta-site deployment and tech transition with PARC on a commercial printing platform will be performed.  Building off the significant Phase I SBIR accomplishments, the Impact team believes that the proposed Phase II program is the ideal mix of innovative development work in the form of modeling, simulation, validation and verification tools for HyDE DP and tech transition activities designed to position HyDE as the diagnostic and reasoning engine for a broad application space that spans NASA, commercial and military domains.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		As developers of HyDE, NASA has already utilized HyDE (and its predecessor; Livingstone) for some limited ISHM applications.  However, the proposed program will make major strides towards a comprehensive and commercial-grade readiness level for a HyDE Developers Pack (HyDE DP) that will be focused on supporting the new Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Integrated Ground System (IGS) for the Constellation family of launch vehicles.  Furthermore, HyDE DP is anticipated to be valuable to NASA Ames as it continues to utilize and market the Advanced Diagnostics And Prognostics Testbed (ADAPT).  It is anticipated that these case studies will generate the necessary exposure of HyDE DP to NASA ISHM developers so further proliferation of the software product can be established.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The need for improved ISHM design tools and reasoning capability within the DoD is very significant given aggressive diagnostic and prognostic requirements for major new acquisition programs like Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) and Future Combat Systems (FCS).  Impact Technologies is directly involved in these and other DoD programs and views the HyDE DP as a powerful tool that can address this need.  The non-military commercial domain has equally many, if not more, potential applications including, but not limited to, the automotive industry, large printing and papermaking machines, commercial aviation, communication satellites, power distribution networks, and high-end process manufacturing equipment to name a few.

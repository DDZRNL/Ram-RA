		<BR>
		Los Gatos Research proposes to develop a powerful new technology - next generation Micro-Capillary Electrochromatography - a high performance and low power consumption microfluidic sample separation device suitable for separating organic molecules as signatures as past and present life on Mars.  In this Phase II effort, we will refine this enabling new microfluidic technology that we have successfully demonstrated in Phase I in order to integrate with NASA Mars Organic Detector.  Specifically for the Phase II work, we will target two important classes of compounds:  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and amino acids.   The overall objective is to integrate the micro-CEC devices with the existing micor-CE analyzers to form a dual micro-CE/micro-CEC system capable of separating all neutral and charged organic molecules targeted by Urey, thus significantly broaden NASA organic sample separation capability.  In addition, this research work will also be performed in parallel with efforts to develop microfluidics devices for the commercial analytical markets.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed micro-CEC technology has great potential to complement NASA's current efforts to find signature of life on Mars such as Urey Mars Organic Analyzer and Mars Organic Detector. The proposed technology has broad applications including on-chip biosensors, electrochemical sensors, wet-chemistry systems, as well as high pressure micropumps for fluid positioning, mixing, metering, storage, and filtering systems.  In addition, our novel technology is naturally suited to such applications as planetary and small body surface chemistry studies, clinical diagnostics, spacecraft and biosphere environmental monitoring, and toxicology studies.  Finally, the novel micro-CEC technology will also benefit NASA's other "Micro Laboratories" programs such as monitoring Space Station environment and in-situ explorations of Europa and Titan.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The next generation mciro-CEC technology described in this proposal possesses a myriad of potential commercial technologies and applications in markets ranging from specialty medical and aerospace industries to consumer electronics. The primary commercial products based on such CEC technology are components for DNA, protein and drug separation and analysis, biological and chemical analysis systems, and drug delivery systems in pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.  In addition, the EOF based technology is also well suited for MEMS actuator systems and embedded health monitoring systems.  Our proprietary technology vastly improves robustness and reliability, thus clearing one of the last hurdles of a wider acceptance of CEC in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries

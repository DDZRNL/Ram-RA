		<BR>
		Surface Optics Corporation (SOC) will develop a band pass filter comprised of a visible dielectric mirror and an induced transmission filter, applied to two sides of a cast polyimide membrane.  The mirror/filter combination will block 95% of the incident solar radiation, while allowing a narrow pass-band for laser communication.  The combination of a visible dielectric mirror constructed on one side of a membrane and a band-pass filter on the second surface, offers a means of creating a very efficient solar reflector with relatively few coatings layers.  The exceptionally thin and flat optical substrate will minimize degradation of the laser signal.  2-meter membrane filters are sought by NASA to prevent over-heating of ground-based laser communication receivers operating during daylight hours.<BR><BR>In Phase II, the designs will be scaled to large membrane substrates approximately 2-m in diameter.<BR>

		High quality membranes coated with precision optical coatings may be useful for large ground-based, segmented telescopes such as TMT and Hobby-Eberly.  Although the concept is still in its infancy, a coating transferred to a glass segment via a polymer membrane would be analogous to tinting an automobile car window.  Preliminary evaluations indicate a membrane with less than lambda/6 PTV error, may be useful for segmented mirror systems with active correction.  A coating transfer process would eliminate the need for a segment assembly containing motors, controllers, and actuators, from being placed in a vacuum chamber for periodic recoating.

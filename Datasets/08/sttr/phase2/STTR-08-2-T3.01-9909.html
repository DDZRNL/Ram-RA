		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Currently used cathode materials in energy storage devices do not fully satisfy the power density and energy density requirements for NASA's exploration missions. Working in collaboration with our STTR partner at University of California  San Diego, we propose to develop layered-layered composite cathode materials that offer superior performance over commercially available positive electrode materials such as, LiCoO2, or LiNi1-xCoxO2. This includes delivering high discharge capacity and high energy density, which significantly reduces the volume and mass of the battery pack. To date, through innovations in the structure and morphology of the composite electrode particles, we have successfully demonstrated an energy density in excess of 1000Wh/kg (at 4V) at room temperature. The objective of the Phase II program is to enhance the kinetics of Li-ion transport and electronic conductivity at low temperature (T=0 C) so as to meet the target performance set by NASA. This is being done through modifications to the atomic structure as well as the surface of the cathode particles. This will allow us to (i) maintain high energy and power densities at low temperature, (ii) lower the first cycle irreversible capacity loss and improve the efficiency, and (iii) further stabilize and enhance the safety of the cell. The practical implication of the R&D in Phase II is that it will lead to an advanced and robust energy storage system. By the end of the Phase II program, this next generation cathode material will be ready for implementation in NASA missions for powering the Altair Lunar Lander, Lunar EVA spacesuit and Lunar Surface Systems. The capabilities developed in this program will enhance NEI's abilities to service the US Li-ion battery market with specialty electrode materials.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced Li-ion batteries with high specific energy and power densities are required for NASA's lunar exploration missions. These batteries, which need to have good low temperature performance, are required to power the Altair Lunar Lander, EVA Spacesuit Portable Life Support Systems (PLSS), and Lunar Surface Systems (LSS) or Rovers. The composite cathode material developed in this program will lead to a high performance Li-ion battery that meets NASA's high power and high energy density requirements (> 800 Wh/kg, C/10 at a temperature of T=0 C).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA commercial applications for the proposed composite electrode include (i) automotive applications such as Li-ion packs in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs), (ii) consumer electronics such as laptops, mobile phones, cameras, camcorders, electric razors, toothbrush, portable TVs and radios, and power tools, (iii) medical devices, (iv) electric bikes/scooters, and (v) military applications such as underwater batteries, air, ground, emergency and pulse power applications.    <BR><BR><BR>

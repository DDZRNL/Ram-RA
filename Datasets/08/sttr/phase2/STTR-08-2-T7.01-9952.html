		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		An efficient and accurate software package named ZMGP (ZONA Multi-scale Gaskinetic/Particle simulation package) is proposed as a 3D tool to predict the lunar dust trajectory and crater formation process when a retro-rocket lands on the lunar surface. ZMGP has many special features including: 1, the hybrid flow module by coupling the gaskinetic Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model and the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method (BGK/DSMC) to efficiently compute the rarefied flowfield; 2. by dividing the crater into different small slices, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) provides an accurate external Mass Erosion Rate (MER) database; 3. one Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) is built up from the vast DEM runs with the Neural Network (NNW) method, and then coupled with the BGK/DSMC module to predict the MER from the lunar surface; 4. integrating the lunar crater MER results provides the initial velocities for the dust particles off the lunar crater; 5. ZMGP utilizes an Overlay module or a two-species BGK module alternatively to produce the trajectories and shootout velocity of ejected particles. With finished concept verification for 2D case in Phase I, we plan to fully develop the software for 3D case and validate it with available experiment data in Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The ZMGP method is to simulate various PCIDI problems in vehicle landing/launching for NASA space explorations.  These include events taking place on the Moon, Mars, Titan or asteroids.  ZMGP can be used efficiently to simulate various conceivable PCIDI interactions. Thus NASA could decide the worst case scenario for vehicle design, e.g. a robot, or for landing site selection to avoid engine/hardware damage. <BR><BR>ZMGP can also be used for space access and space exploration which includes atmospheric entry/maneuver on Earth/Mars in term of (a) Aerothermodynamics analysis and vehicle/TPS design, (b) Aeroassist design/analysis to increase drag of capsules/ballutes during atmospheric entry for vehicle maneuver needs the ZMGP method to handle a relatively rarefied, 2-phase, dusty flow environment. ZONA will package the ZMGP simulation package into commercial software for the above applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Other applications of the ZMGP simulation package are supported by non-aerospace domains and private industry related with single or two-phase flows, especially for rarefied flow situations, i.e.,<BR>- Army/Navy air-breathing engine vehicle operation in desert/dusty environment.<BR>- Fluid dynamic aspects of Geophysics and Astrophysics, e.g. space weather prediction.<BR>- R&D in multiphase flows and reacting flows.<BR>- Dust storms and dust devils, and their contribution to air pollution.<BR>- Wind erosion.<BR>- Aerosols and their effects on weather.<BR>- Avalanche with a large amount of snow.<BR>- Shell explosion in desert or other dusty area.<BR>- Materials processing with vacuum chamber, thin film deposition, aerosol reactors.<BR>- Masks with thin fiber to filter air for dust, pollen, and industrial waste.<BR>- Gas-solid two-phase flows inside micro-machines, e.g. MEMS.<BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Pico-satellites are an emerging new class of spacecraft.  Maneuverable pico-satellites require active guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C) systems to perform coordinated tasks such as formation flying and automated rendezvous and docking.  A compact, low power GN&C system will be fabricated and tested for use on pico-satellites.  The proposed design provides 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) translation and rotation control in less than 25% of a 3-Unit CubeSat or 3 DOF rotation only control in less than one half a standard Cubesat volume.  During Phase 2, flight components will be procured, integrated, and tested as a single embedded system and delivered as a flight unit for environmental qualification and in-orbit demonstration on a suitable pico-satellite flight opportunity.  The technology is expected to reach TRL 6 by the conclusion of Phase 2.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Maneuverable pico-satellites have many potential NASA commercial applications.  For example, swarms or formations of pico-satellites could provide global real-time space weather monitoring in a way that is presently not possible from a single satellite.  Autonomous rendezvous and docking technology could perform on-orbit inspection of a nearby vehicle.  The relatively low-cost and rapid access to space of pico-satellites enables lower cost on-orbit testing of new components, allowing quicker and more reliable progression to higher Technology Readiness Levels.  Pico-satellite maneuverability and control is a key, often required aspect of mission performance.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA federal agencies and commercial ventures will benefit from maneuverable pico-satellites.  Rapid response communications, imaging, and situational awareness solutions are needed by the Department of Defense, National Reconnaissance Office, and Department of Homeland Security.  DARPA's F6 program is an example of a fractionated spacecraft formation application that can be addressed with pico-satellites.   Low cost and rapid access to space will also improve the  profitable realization of new commercial space applications.  Commercial applications such as on-orbit spacecraft servicing and direct to user remote sensing are viable.  The mission return will be substantially improved with reliable low-cost pico-satellite maneuverability.

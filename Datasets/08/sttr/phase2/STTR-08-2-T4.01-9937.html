		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		AdvR, Inc. proposes the development of an efficient process for fabricating ridge waveguides in magnesium-doped lithium niobate (MgO:LN).  The effort will include, but will not be limited to, fabricating ridge waveguides in periodically poled MgO:LN for highly efficient, single-pass, quasi phase-matched frequency conversion.  Ridge waveguides in MgO:LN will significantly improve the performance (power handling and conversion efficiency), increase photonic component integration, and be well suited to space based applications.  The key innovation in this effort is to combine recently available large, high photorefractive damage threshold, z-cut 5% MgO:LN with novel ridge fabrication techniques to achieve high optical power, low cost, high volume manufacturing of frequency conversion structures.  The ridge waveguide structure maintains the characteristics of the periodically poled bulk substrate, allowing for the efficient frequency conversion typical of waveguides and the high optical damage threshold and long lifetimes typical of the doped bulk substrate.

		<BR>
		Ridge waveguide structures will directly benefit a wide range of NASA laser-based missions including:  efficient frequency doubling and tripling elements used for the Tropospheric Wind Lidar Technology Experiment (TWiLiTE-GSFC), next generation planar lightwave circuit (PLC) components for the High Spectral Resolution cloud and aerosol Lidar system (HSRL-LaRC), high optical power phase modulators used for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA-GSFC), integrated waveguide components such as fast switching logic gates for use in quantum communication systems (Quantum Information Laboratory-AMES), and high power second harmonic generation (SHG) at 1550 nm for O2 detection (ASCENDS-LaRC).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		AdvR has identified NLO ridge waveguide structures as having suitable value to be the leading frequency conversion structure.  Its value is based on having the low cost fabrication necessary to satisfy the challenging pricing requirements as well as achieve the power handling and other specifications in a suitably compact package.  Green lasers have major revenue potential in displays, projection, spectroscopy, and instrument markets.  The display and projection market will be the primary product focus of AdvR.  AdvR will also maintain a secondary focus on the lower volume spectroscopy and instrument markets, due to its allowable higher pricing.  These two markets share the common need for green and other visible wavelength lasers particularly in the 50-100 mW range.

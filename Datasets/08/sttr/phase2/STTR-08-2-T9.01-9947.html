		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The innovation proposed here is a high-performance, high-fidelity framework in the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code called Loci-STREAM to enable accurate, fast and robust simulations of unsteady multiphase flows such as combustion involving liquid-gas phases in liquid rocket injectors and solid-gas phases in solid rocket motors, and cryogenic cavitation in delivery systems of liquid rocket engines.  This framework will provide a state-of-the-art multiphase unsteady turbulent flow simulation capability employing Hybrid RANS-LES (HRLES) methods which are a blend of Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approaches.  Robust primary atomization models for liquid jet breakup and both phenomenological and stochastic secondary droplet breakup models will be developed.  Lagrangian particle tracking and Eulerian multiphase models will be coupled to enable simulation of multiphase combustion involving solid particles or liquid droplets.  The work proposed here will result in a state-of-the-art design and analysis tool to enable the accurate modeling of: (a) multiphase combustion in solid and liquid rocket engines, (b) combustion stability analysis (c) acoustic fields of space propulsion systems in near-ground operation, (d) small valves and turbopumps, etc. which constitute critical components of versatile space propulsion engines part of NASA's space near- and long-term space programs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The outcome of Phase 2 work will be a powerful CFD-based design and analysis tool for propulsion engines at NASA.  This will facilitate analysis of flow environments in propulsion devices including full rocket engine simulations, injector design, turbopump and valve design, etc.  Specific applications at NASA include: (a) design improvements of injectors of J-2X and RS68 engines as well as other engines using LOX and LCH4 as part of the PCAD project, (b) modeling of multi-element injectors coupled with fuel and oxidizer feedlines and manifolds, (c) prediction of stability and stability margins, (d) design of acoustic cavities for combustion stability, (e) analysis of small valves and turbopumps, (f) prediction of loads during launch of new launch vehicle, (g) prediction of acoustic loads on rocket engine test stands, (h) launch pad modifications, (i) development of new launch facilities, (j) analysis of rocket engine exhaust plumes, (k) modeling of flow of liquids and supercritical fluids through piping system components such as valves and run tanks.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The computational tool resulting from this project will have wide-ranging commercial applications.  The Hybrid RANS-LES methodology can be used for a wide variety of engineering applications involving unsteady turbulent flows.  The multi-phase combustion modeling capability can be used for simulating combusting flows in various industrial applications, such as gas turbine engines, diesel engines, etc.  The real-fluids methodology can be used in a large number of industrial flow situations involving both chemically inert and reacting flows.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Intelligent Fiber Optic Systems Corporation (IFOS) in collaboration with Washington State University (WSU) proposes an approach of utilizing structurally integrated, distributed optical FBG sensor/piezo actuator arrays to monitor the health of a structure with accurate interpretation of sensor signals and real-time data processing.  Our method involves a dynamic response-based damage detection technique that offers a simple identification method with easy implementation.  We use electrically passive, electromagnetic interference (EMI) immune, multiplexable, fiber optic sensing technology with many sensors on a single light-weight small diameter optical fiber.  This is currently the most cost-effective and aerospace friendly way to overcome the sensor impoverished state of present day structures. This method has the capability of inspecting large area structures to provide global as well as local structural health information in real time.  As well as providing weight reduction, the miniaturization enabled by our optical fiber technology is key to diverse spin-off applications such as for sensor matrices in NASA's extra-vehicular and planetary exploration robots as well as sensor arrays for medical applications and homeland security robotic disarming of bombs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The integrated, distributed optical FBG-sensor/Piezo-actuator systems developed by the IFOS/WSU team will greatly contribute to improved aviation security technologies.  The IFOS high-speed, high resolution, and high multiplexing optical FBG sensor interrogation system coupled with advanced structural health monitoring (SHM) algorithms together make up a unique and viable system to monitor the health and real time condition of air transportation systems (ATS) through accurate interpretation of sensor signals and real-time data processing. The sensor/actuator technology proposed in this program can easily be developed into on-board real-time monitoring systems, allowing continuous damage detection, security risk assessment and incident precursor identification.  Thus, timely preparedness, preventive maintenance or repair activities will be more focused and efficient, which will increase the safety, security and service life of the ATS.  Furthermore, integration of cost-effective smart optical FBG and piezoelectric actuators with wireless technology provides great potential for commercial development.

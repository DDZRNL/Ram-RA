		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A Multiscale GasKinetic/Particle (MGP) computational method is proposed to simulate the plume-crater-interaction/dust-impingement(PCIDI) problem.  The MGP method consists of a multiscale gaskinetic (MG) method for gasdynamics of rocket plume-in-vacuum flowfield, an Overlay method for gas-particle interaction.  MG combines BGK Gaskinetics (BGK) and direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) methods with a domain decomposition technique to account for various scales of rarefied gasdynamics, covering continuum to free-molecular regimes. The dust particles are modeled by an additional distribution function in BGK, thus carried by the MG-generated flowfield through an overlay method. Dust properties are to be modeled using Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation, which will lead to comprehensive continuum equations for crater formation. Phase II will extend the present MGP method to 3D, with more advanced dust particle properties and complex crater formulation.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		MGP method is to simulate various PCIDI problems in vehicle landing/launching for NASA space explorations, especially for lunar robotic and human mission architecture definition. These include events taken place on Moon, Mars, Titan or asteroids. The developed technology will also be applicable for analysis of solid propulsion systems with embedded solid particle. MGP can be used efficiently to simulate various conceivable PCIDI interactions. Thus NASA could decide the worse case scenario for vehicle design or for landing site selection to avoid engine/hardware damage. Other potential NASA applications for space access and space exploration include atmospheric entry/maneuver on Earth/Mars in term of (a) Aerothermodynamics analysis and vehicle/TPS design, (b) Aeroassist design/analysis to increase drag of capsules/ballutes during atmospheric entry, (c) Flight mechanics/Aerodynamics and turbomachinery in Martian atmosphere for vehicle maneuver need MGP method to handle a relatively rarefied, 2-phase, dusty flow environment. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non NASA applications are supported by non-aerospace domains and private industry, i.e.,, Army/Navy airbreathing engine  vehicle operation in desert/dusty environment; Aerosol effects on  weather; R&D in multiphase flows and reacting flows; Dust, sand and snow stir-up during helicopter landing/takeoff in a desert or arctic environment; Wind-borne landscape erosion and dust transport to populated areas. ZONA will package MGP method into a commercial software for above applications. Potential customers include DoD, chemical engineering firms, etc.

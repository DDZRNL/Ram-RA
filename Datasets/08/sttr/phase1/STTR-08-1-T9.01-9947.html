		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The innovation proposed here is a computational framework for high performance, high fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to enable accurate, fast and robust simulation of unsteady turbulent, reacting or non-reacting flows involving real or ideal fluids in several applications.  This framework will provide a state-of-the-art unsteady turbulent flow simulation capability employing Hybrid RANS-LES (HRLES) methods which are a blend of Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approaches.  Low-dissipation schemes will be employed which will enable high-fidelity modeling of unsteady flows as well as acoustic fields.  Additionally, Lagrangian particle tracking and Eulerian multiphase models will be incorporated to enable simulation of multiphase combustion involving solid particles or liquid droplets.  The work proposed here will result in a state-of-the-art design and analysis tool to enable the accurate modeling of: (a) multiphase combustion in solid and liquid rocket engines, (b) combustion stability analysis (c) acoustic fields of space propulsion syatems in near-ground operation, (d) small valves and turbopumps, etc. which constitute critical components of versatile space propulsion engines part of NASA's Constellation Program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The outcome of Phase I and Phase II research activities will be a powerful CFD-based design and analysis tool for propulsion engines at NASA.  This tool is envisioned to be a powerful design and analysis tool for propulsion devices including full rocket engine simulations, injector design, turbopump and valve design, etc.  Specific applications at NASA of this capability include: (a) design improvements of J-2X injectors, (b) modeling of multi-element injectors coupled with fuel and oxidizer feed lines and manifolds, (c) prediction of stability and stability margins, (d) design of acoustic cavities for combustion stability, (e) analysis of small valves and turbopumps, (f) prediction of loads during launch of new launch vehicle, (g) prediction of acoustic loads on rocket engine test stands, (h) launch pad modifications, (i) development of new launch facilities, (j) analysis of rocket engine exhaust plumes, (k) modeling of flow of liquids and supercritical fluids through piping system components such as valves and run tanks ,etc.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The computational tool resulting from this project will have wide-ranging commercial applications.  The Hybrid RANS-LES methodology can be used for a wide variety of engineering applications involving unsteady turbulent flows.  The reacting flow capability can be used for simulating combusting flows in various industrial applications, such as gas turbine engines, diesel engines, etc.  The real-fluids methodology can be used in a large number of industrial flow situations involving both chemically inert and reacting flows.  With additions of multi-phase combustion modeling capability, the applicability of this tool can be further broadened.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Thermoelectric (TE) generators/refrigerators have the advantages of lack of moving parts, quiet operation, and flexibility in deployment, but their use has been limited because of their relatively low conversion efficiency.   Two major loss components are conductive (phonon) heat transfer through the TE lattice and parasitic losses at fabrication interfaces.   Shock wave consolidation of thermoelectric nanopowders to produce TE devices will reduce both loss sources, leading to enhanced efficiency devices.  <BR><BR>The conversion efficiency of a TE device will always be thermodynamically limited by the Carnot ratio of (Th-Tc)/Th, where Th and Tc are the temperatures of the hot and cold junctions.   Present technology thermoelectric devices can provide conversion efficiencies up to a third of the Carnot limit.  With the restrictions on phonon transport acruing from nanopowder consolidation, conversion efficiencies of over 50% of the Carnot limit should be possible.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Thermoelectric efficiency enhancement will allow the fabrication of smaller, lighter TE devices such as radioisotope generators in satellites and deep space probes.   Efficiency enhancements will also enable applications that have not previously been addressed such as harvesting sensor energy from astronaut body heat and piggybacking thermoelectric generating cells on the back of photovoltaic cells to allow the maximum extraction of energy from solar radiation.<BR><BR>Improvements in thermoelectric efficiency benefit Peltier cooling of astronauts, CCD cells and electronics since less energy will be required for these heat pumping applications.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High efficiency thermoelectric generation allows significant energy capture from waste heat streams in industrial and power plants.  Combined with escalating electricity prices, the payback times are reduced and this allows wider deployments and both scale and scope economies.   Even relatively small thermal differentials become candidates for energy capture including electric generation from roadways for powering local lights and signage.   Another application is for automatic flush valves, where small differences between ambient air and ambient water temperatures can be exploited to trickle charge battery powered actuators.

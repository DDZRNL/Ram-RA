		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Launch Abort System (LAS) for the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) will provide a safe escape for the crew in the event of an emergency during launch.  A key component of the LAS is its Attitude Control Motor (ACM).  Recent testing of the ACM valve assembly has resulted in failure during hot-fire testing.  These failures are believed to be the result of the molybdenum alloy component distorting during firing.  Based on these results, alternative materials with higher temperature capability are needed for the ACM valve assembly.  During Phase I, innovative electrochemical forming (EL-FormTM) techniques will be developed for producing ACM hot gas components near net shape.  Both rhenium and rhenium coated graphite composite materials will be evaluated.  PPI will partner with Southern Research Institute, a leader in the testing of advanced, high temperature materials, for the materials properties testing.  During Phase II, ACM hot gas components will be fabricated and hot fire tested.  In addition to rhenium and rhenium coated graphite composites, alternative materials such as molybdenum-rhenium and tungsten-rhenium materials will be evaluated.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		PPI's targeted NASA application is the Attitude Control Motor (ACM) for the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) Launch Abort System (LAS).  Other NASA applications include in-space propulsion components for apogee insertion, attitude control, orbit maintenance, repositioning of satellites/spacecraft, reaction control systems, and descent/ascent engines, nuclear power/propulsion, microgravity containment crucibles and cartridges.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Both government and commercial entities in the following sectors use advanced high-temperature materials for the following applications: coatings, defense, material R&D, nuclear power, aerospace, propulsion, automotive, electronics, crystal growth, and medical.  PPI's targeted commercial applications include net-shape fabrication of refractory and platinum group metals for rocket nozzles, crucibles, heat pipes, and propulsion subcomponents; and advanced coating systems for x-ray targets, sputtering targets, turbines, rocket engines, wear and thermal/electrical insulation.<BR><BR>

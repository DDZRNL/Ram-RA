		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has very specific requirements when it comes to power generation technology. Solar panels are an obvious solution but making them suitable for the grueling space environment. Panels must withstand intense radiation bombardment and extreme temperature swings while maintaining acceptable levels of efficiency. Additionally because of the exorbitant costs of current technology NASA would like to reduce the costs associated with power generation. We propose to introduce a new class of solar cells that utilize the environmental strengths and absorption properties on InGaN technology. This material has an amazingly high defect tolerance but even more impressively can be tuned to capture any wave length of light in the solar spectrum. Our proposal offers the possibility of solar cell efficiencies exceeding 70% while providing excellent radiation resistance and a price point similar to that of silicon, 100 times cheaper than current space age technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Our solar panels will be of interest to NASA on each and every operation that is under taken. Power generation in space is essential to drive all the electronics necessary to keep machinery working and astronauts alive. Our panels will be light, powerful and resilient allowing them to take less space and be stored more efficiently. These are very important characteristics, millions of dollars ride on the performance of the power generation system. When Hubble was first deployed it was almost a complete disaster, if the solar panels had not successfully deployed the circuitry of the enormous satellite would have frozen in space. Increased efficiency will increase operational restrictions allowing probes to last longer, travel farther, and recover more information. Such projects as a lunar base will become cheaper, and more feasible when combined with our power generation technology. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Beyond NASA the strength of our technology lays in its outstanding efficiency and low production costs. As our country depletes its energy resources the alternative energy market becomes more volatile, waiting only for a suitable solution. Our panels will bring solar power within a range that will make its wide spread use economical. Our economy relies heavily on energy, and this demand is growing rapidly in our quest for technology.  From residential and commercial operations to solar cars and chargers for handheld devices the market opportunities are immense.

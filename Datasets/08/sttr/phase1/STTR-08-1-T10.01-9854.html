		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The objective of this project is to demonstrate intelligent health and maintenance status determination and predictive fault diagnosis techniques for NASA rocket engines under online and offline conditions from either on-board or maintenance, test and analytic data. AGNC proposes a Health and Maintenance Status Determination and Predictive Fault Diagnosis System (HMSD/PFDS). The fuzzy qualitative model for model-based residual generation and the rule-based evaluation of residuals using neural-fuzzy combination are defined. Intelligent data fusion strategies for health and maintenance determination and predictive fault diagnosis are developed for rocket engine systems/subsystems. The goal is to ensure safety, cost reduction, graceful degradation and re-optimization in the case of failures, malfunctions and damages. Kalman filter based and rule based evaluation of residuals using neural-fuzzy combination are developed. The use of fuzzy qualitative models takes into account the uncertainties associated with behavior descriptions and incorporates available expert failure symptom knowledge to recognize the particular failure features. Actual or simulated rocket engine sensed or derived data are utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the health and maintenance determination and fault prognosis approaches for NASA platforms. Phase I is devoted to the HMSD/PFDS design and simulation. Phase II will result in development of a functional prototype.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The HMSD/PFDS system will directly support a host of NASA's health monitoring requirements by detecting anomalous operating conditions and actual or impending faults. The proposed technology is not only available for rocket engines but is extendable to accommodate entire spacecraft health monitoring systems.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The HMSD/PFDS system also finds a large market in the military and civilian sectors. Typical applications for HMSD/PFDS will be in aircraft engines, power plants, commercial aviation industry, general manufacturing and industrial operations monitoring environments.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

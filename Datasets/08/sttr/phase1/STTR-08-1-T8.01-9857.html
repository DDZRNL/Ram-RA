		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA space exploration missions stand to benefit from reliable means to conserve energy that is otherwise given off as waste heat. Thermoelectric generators have demonstrated the potential for scavenging waste heat energy, yet are still limited by technical and geometrical boundaries that must be overcome for long term reliability in applications such as interplanetary missions. To address these limitations, Nanohmics Inc. and Professor Kevin Stokes at the University of New Orleans propose to fabricate conformable thermoelectric generators for long-term radiation resistance in space applications. The proposed device will incorporate thermoelectric p- and n-doped high ZT thermoelectric legs that aredeposited onto a substrate.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Lightweight thermoelectric generators that have the ability to conform to custom geometries offer many advantages in waste heat recovery over traditional rigid plate TEG devices.  The proposed device will possess inherent radiation hardness as well as have low stowed weight making it ideal for thermoelectric-driven waste heat energy scavenging on interplantary and other space missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Thermoelectric devices have the ability to enable/accelerate a wide variety of applications. Major applications of thermoelectric devices include:<BR><BR>	Cooling of electronics (integrated circuits,  detectors/focal plane arrays, microprocessors, disk drives, solid state lasers)<BR>	Power generation from waste heat or engine exhaust (thermoelectric generator mode)<BR>	Power generation in remote areas using temporal fluctuations with daily cycles<BR>	Satellite power recovery<BR>	Cooling of heavy equipment and machining processes<BR>	Distributed cooling systems for confined spaces (automobiles, military vehicles, submarines)<BR>	Man portable or embedded cooling systems for soldier battle dress uniforms (BDUs) or other wearable devices that can extract energy from body heat<BR>	Precision temperature control<BR>

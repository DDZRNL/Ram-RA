		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The challenges of designing, developing, and fielding advanced propulsion systems continue to increase as NASA's Vision for Space Exploration Program moves forward with new solid propulsion elements ({i.e., Ares I and V).  Our existing computational tool for solid motor analysis (BurnSurf) generates modest surface recession, but the mesh deformation techniques employed often fail as the surface regression increases, particularly near corners.  For complex grain designs with highly complicated surface topologies (e.g., star shapes), simple mesh deformation is no longer desirable.  Our proposed innovation will utilize surface mesh modification and volume mesh generation to locally rebuild the burning surface mesh and the adjacent volume mesh.  The innovation will address integrated surface and volume mesh regeneration and reconnection techniques for modifying mesh topologies along with two phase burning surface models to create a unique 3D software tool for next generation solid motor internal environment characterization.  Our research products will provide NASA with the important capability to simultaneously analyze solid propellant combustion, heat transfer, and grain burnback within a single framework.  We will demonstrate feasibility of the approach using a two phase grain burning model coupled with surface recession for a simple shape in the TRL range of 3-4.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology will provide NASA with an advanced analysis capability for the prediction of two phase flows in solid motors with dynamic surface recession, including burning surface particulate injection and volume and mass flow constraints for the receding surface..  Potential enhancements to the these tools include improved droplet/gas interface modeling for better statistical representations of particle laden flows, improved near-wall turbulence modeling, and extended model validation.  The proposed methodology for two phase solid motor flows is also well suited for extensions to additional multi-physics capabilities of commercial interest to NASA, including conjugate heat transfer within the solid propellant.  ATK, a leading manufacturer of solid rocket engines, has formally indicated interest in this technology, and our development plan appropriately reflects this NASA commercial potential.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The growing trend toward complex multi-phase analyses is opening significant new markets as more difficult problems can be addressed using advanced computational techniques.  The ability to easily set up and analyze solid motor problems in a timely manner will allow industry to speed development of new products and streamline testing.  Further enhancements to our modeling system will find application in the aerospace, automotive, environmental, and nuclear industries.  The basic architecture of the software will remain the same while new plug-in physical models will be developed to address niche markets.

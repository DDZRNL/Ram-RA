		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to design, construct and test a first implementation of a non-dispersive technique for the measurement of atomic absorption in the plumes of liquid rocket engines in altitude test facilities.  Led by NASA Stennis Space Center (SSC), the observation of metal atom emission from liquid rocket engine exhausts at sea level conditions has become a highly successful health monitoring technique, but in altitude tests emission intensities are low.  SSC developed an atomic absorption system which has provided useful measurements, but improved sensitivity is required.  Non-dispersive atomic absorption presents a far simpler, smaller, lower cost alternative to other techniques with comparable spectral resolution and, of particular importance, should allow a more forgiving receiver geometry, so that noise-modulated source light or plume emission can be eliminated.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The goal of the proposed program is an atomic absorption system for NASA SSC altitude test facilities with substantially better sensitivity for a set of metal atom species similar to that now detected.  Extensions to other elements and other test facilities should be straightforward.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential applications exist in two areas,  plume signature phenomenology, and analytical chemistry instrumentation.  We have a long history in the first area and are currently involved in a research program in which the spectroscopy of rocket exhaust plumes may play a key role in developing new early warning systems, to which the technology to be developed in the proposed program could make a substantial contribution.  In the second area, non-dispersive methods have received many academic studies but few commercial applications.  The new source, filter and detector technologies we expect to take advantage of in the proposed program, on the other hand, may allow new analytical instruments that are cheaper and more robust than previous instruments, while retaining the capabilities afforded by the high spectral resolution of non-dispersive methods.

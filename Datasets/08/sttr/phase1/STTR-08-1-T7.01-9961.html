		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		ORBITEC and Duke University have teamed on this STTR to develop the ALERT (Advanced Lunar Exhaust-Regolith Transport) code which will include new developments in modeling of regolith erosion and entrainment as well as plume transport with full mass and momentum conservation. The Plume is handled in a Vlasov formalism with drag force on dust grains, dust equations of motion are solved over a size spectrum.  Because of its significant gravity and lack of atmosphere landing on the Moon's surface must involve impingement of the rocket plume directly on the Lunar regolith. The experience in the Apollo landings, both from the perspective of the astronauts viewing surface conditions during decent, and the effects on the exposed surfaces of the Surveyor 3 from the nearby landing of Apollo 12 have alerted us to the importance of good modeling of rocket exhaust plume regolith interactions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary focus of this activity is to develop a highly-reliable, accurate software tool to support NASA's Exploration Vision.  A user friendly, accurate, ALERT code will be developed during the multiphase program for testing in near-term Lunar operations.  The technology could be used in other NASA space applications including: Lunar surface operations, both manned and unmanned and logistics, Moonbase planning and design, Mars surface and Mars-Moon operations, manned and unmanned, etc.   Beyond the needs of NASA, it is expected that this technology will be integrated into ORBITEC applications for other customers such as the Bigelow Aerospace's Space Station, propulsion approaches for supporting the Jamestown Group that will have many commercial Lunar missions, the USAF multimode spacecraft mission needs, etc.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Beyond the needs of NASA, it is expected that this technology will be integrated into ORBITEC applications for other customers such as the Bigelow Aerospace's Space Station, propulsion approaches for supporting the Jamestown Group that will have many commercial Lunar missions, the USAF multimode spacecraft mission needs, etc. Lunar mining for ISRU, polar water, or Helium 3 extraction form the regolith will require large Moonbases and many landings and liftoffs. Plume entrainment of lunar dust is a major hazard and planning consideration in the design of any commercial Moonbase will benfit from the ALERT code as a planning tool.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

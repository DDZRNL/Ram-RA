		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Keystone and MSU team propose to demonstrate the feasibility of solid-state joining high strength and temperature alloys utilizing the Thermal Stir Welding process. The alloy selected for this proposed effort is Haynes 230; the alloy of choice typically utilized in rocket engine nozzel skirts. This class of alloys is difficult to fusion weld and has not been shown weldable by friction stir methods. Thus, the Keystone team is proposing to utilize the Thermal Stir Welding process; a solid-state welding process that decouples the stirring and heating features of the process to enable optimization of each key parameter. By independently controlling and optimizing these two process parameters, the best metal working parameters can be identified and utilized to plasticize and stir the Haynes 230 alloy to achieve solid-state welding. Achievement of this objective will enable superior mechanical properties in the weld joint and thus maximize the capability of the weld for the intended application.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Solid-state welding of high strength and temperautre alloys is required to support the NASA ARES I and V system. Specifically, Haynes 230 is a high strength and high temperature alloy utilized in the engine nozzel skirt. The proposed Phase I STTR program will demonstrate the feasibility of solid-state welding the alloy by a process known as Thermal Stir Welding. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA applications include thermal stir welding of high strentgh and temperature alloys for aerospace applications; specifically, military and commercial gas turbine engines. Non-aerospace applications include component welding for chemical processing and heat exchanger industries.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

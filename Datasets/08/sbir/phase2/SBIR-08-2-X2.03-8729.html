		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Recovery of water from brine is critically important for future manned space exploration.  Resupply of water is prohibitively costly for such extended missions.  Water reclamation processes typically recover 90-95% of the water present in wastewater formed by combining urine, hygiene water, and humidity condensate with the remaining concentrated in brine.  This concentrated brine contains a significant amount of water, potentially a very valuable resource.  The proposed prototype development will recover virtually all of the remaining water using an ultrasonic brine dewatering system (UBDS).  In the UBDS process, extremely small nebulized droplets of the brine are created ultrasonically at the brineair interface.  Small droplets enable quicker drying due to their high relative surface area. This is particularly important when drying brines that contain thermally labile materials, which require relatively low temperature drying.  The UBDS prototype has no nozzles to become plugged, requires little power, is simple and small, requires minimal astronaut attention and is compatible with continuous, closed cycle operation that can be made gravity independent.  The innovative Phase 2 prototype will fulfill the unmet need to significantly improve water loop closure during extended manned missions.  The Phase 2 project will provide an automated UBDS prototype that will be delivered to NASA for further testing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA application of this innovative technology will be as Hardware for Lunar Base and other Early Planetary Bases.  The partial gravity at these locations will permit nebulization without the use of a wick.  Gravity based water accumulation at the bottom of the condenser will be accomplished without the assistance of an air/water separator.  This technology will enable efficient water recovery from brines resulting in a major mass closure for water usage on Lunar Base.  Use as Flight Hardware for Transit Missions is also anticipated.  With this application, a wick will be used to hold the brine at the desired location during nebulization.  An air/water separator will be included to facilitate separation without the assistance of gravity.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		For the private sector, a major application is improved drying processes for pharmaceuticals.   Many biologically active compounds are thermally labile and would benefit from the use of this technology for preparation of inhalants.  In addition, the ultra-small size of the resulting particles is desirable for inhalation because they are more easily suspended in air and because solvation and uptake through the alveoli in the lungs is more efficient for small particles.  For example, NaCl particles are widely used in dry powder inhalers for bronchial provocation tests to identify people with active asthma or exercise-induced asthma.  Such powders are currently made using laborious processes to control particle sizes and distributions. The technology developed during this SBIR project will allow continuous formation of small, dried NaCl crystallites, in a process more amenable for large-scale production.

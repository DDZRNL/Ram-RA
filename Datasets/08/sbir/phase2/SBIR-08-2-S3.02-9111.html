		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		High performance thermal control technologies are needed to achieve the near term goals of NASA's science spacecraft development programs. High conductivity materials to minimize temperature gradients and provide high efficiency radiators and heat spreader panels are required.  Integrated panels that minimize the challenges caused by thermal interfaces, including those of attached heat pipes and cooling loops would provide high performance and high reliability. <BR>kTC proposes a general technology development that permits the design of a high performance thermal distribution panel (TDP). The panel will be fabricated with a high conductivity macro-composite skin and in situ heat pipes.  This advanced TDP concept will have high conductance that will obviate the need for bulky metal thermal doublers and heat pipe saddles. The conductivity of the proposed material system can be configured to exceed 800 W/mK with a density below 2.5 g/cm3. This material can provide efficient conductive heat transfer between the in situ heat pipes permitting the use of thinner panels further reducing the mass.<BR>kTC proved the feasibility of producing the proposed TDP and confirmed by measurements the performance gains the technology affords in the Phase I program.  The Phase II work will concentrate on process refinements and scale up.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIS), NASA GSFC instrument will form a part of the instrument compliment on the LANDSAT Data Continuity Mission.  There are many bonded-on heat pipes in the current configuration.  The proposed technology would, if fully developed and qualified, offer design simplicity, performance gains, and weight savings for this application.<BR>kTC is also working with NASA and NASA contractors for use of the proposed technology as part of the Constellation Program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		kTC is working with a major space system prime on several DoD and other government satellite programs.  kTC's encapsulated APG thermal doublers have been qualified and designed into these programs.  Although, the configuration of these systems are established, there are future opportunities to integrate the proposed technology (if successful) on future builds whereas new technologies are added during the planned "tech refresh" activities.

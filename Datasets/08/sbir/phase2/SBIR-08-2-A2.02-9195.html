		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The objective of the Phase I is to develop, demonstrate and test a novel instrument based on laser absorption diagnostics for fast, in situ measurements of important parameters (static gas temperature, bulk gas velocity, and gas concentration) in the high speed flows typical in NASA propulsion test facilities.  In addition, the instrument will be easy to move (translate) during operation and thus allow measurements at different locations during a test run.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Instrumentation for rapid measurements in high speed, high enthalpy propulsion test facilities will enable NASA scientists and engineers to monitor the important parameters including: gas concentrations, gas temperatures and gas velocities under realistic engine operating conditions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA Commercial Applications include: Instrumentation for measurements, control and thus optimization of combustion engine flows (gas turbines, waste incinerators) based on measurements of gas concentrations, temperatures and velocities.
		<P>
		<P>
		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

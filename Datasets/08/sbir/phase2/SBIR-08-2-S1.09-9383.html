		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Los Gatos Research proposes to develop a novel microfluidic device that combines rigid monolithic porous polymer based micro-capillary electrochromatography (microCEC) with ultra-high sensitive UV laser induced fluorescence (LIF)optical detection capable of accurately measuring concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) molecules.  This novel device is ultra-compact and light weight with low power consumption, ideally suited for NASA planetary science applications such as analyzing complex organic molecules on Mars, Titan and elsewhere in the solar system.  Specifically for the Phase II work, we will design and fabricate a microfluidic prototype that offers vast improvements over current PAH separation methods as well as significant enhancements over the current detection sensitivities.   The overall objective entails integrating this microfluidics technology with NASA miniaturized scientific instrumentation program, thereby significantly enhancing NASA organic compound separation capability.  In addition this Phase II work will be performed in parallel with efforts to develop micorfluidics devices for the commercial analytical markets.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed polymer microfluidics and optical technologies can be readily adapted to NASA's miniature "Micro Laboratories" scientific instrumentations for in-situ exploration of the solar system.  In particular, it is directly applicable to analyze PAH and other neutral organic molecules on Mars and Titan surfaces.  The proposed technology has other broad NASA applications including on-chip biosensors, electrochemical sensors, wet-chemistry systems, as well as high pressure micropumps for fluid positioning, mixing, metering, storage, and filtering systems.  In addition, the novel microfluidics technology is naturally suited to such applications as clinical diagnostics, spacecraft and biosphere environmental monitoring, and toxicology studies.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The microfluidics technology described in this proposal is directly applicable for terrestrial analysis for PAH molecules in health and environmental studies.  Compared to existing micellar electrokinetic chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC, the microCEC technology described in this proposal offers a natural alternative providing inexpensive, rapid, nondestructive, in-situ techniques for the measurement of PAH contamination in sediments.  Additional commercial devices based on such microfluidics technology envisioned include components for DNA, protein and drug separation and analysis, chemical analysis systems, drug delivery systems, and embedded health monitoring systems.

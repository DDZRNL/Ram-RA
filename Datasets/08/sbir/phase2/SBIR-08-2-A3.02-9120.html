		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Wake vortices are a critical constraint to aircraft separation and therefore airportal throughput, which is already at or near capacity at many major airports in the NAS. Improvements to current methods of spacing aircraft could significantly increase airportal capacity, but there is currently limited awareness of wake encounters and information with which to assess spacing in real-time or to design new spacing schemes. AeroTech proposes to improve situational awareness of wake vortices and enhance the prediction of wake vortex transport and decay by continuing development of the In Situ Wake Vortex Encounter Detection and Reporting System (VEDARS). The VEDARS will quantitatively detect wake encounters from flight data; downlink encounter reports in real-time to enhance ATC awareness and enable assessment of spacing schemes; and collect and report meteorological parameters from aircraft for use in wake transport and decay predictions. AeroTech is also proposing to improve the accuracy and reliability of reported wind speed and direction (and hence crosswind estimation) by improving and validating an estimator for sideslip angle. A reliable and accurate crosswind estimate is a key component in predicting the transport of wakes. By the end of Phase II, the operational feasibility concept for the VEDARS will have been established.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The In Situ Wake Vortex Encounter Detection and Reporting System (VEDARS) will directly support NASA's NextGen-Airportal project goal to realize an airportal environment that will achieve the highest possible throughput and operational efficiency, while balancing safety and environmental requirements. VEDARS will support the Safe and Efficient Surface Operations and Coordinated Arrival and Departure Operations Management (CADOM) focus areas by enhancing researchers' awareness of wake encounters; supporting the assessment and optimization of merging and spacing schemes; providing data that assists in the characterization and prediction of wake transport and decay; and providing a capability for simulations that can be used to assess airportal operations and procedures within various weather conditions and airfield layouts. VEDARS data could be used in the development and assessment of automated wake vortex advisory and spacing systems. VEDARS will also support NASA's research efforts under the JPDO in NextGen Super Density Arrival/Departure Operations and Trajectory-Based Operations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		AeroTech's In Situ Wake Vortex Encounter Detection and Reporting System (VEDARS) will provide benefits to aircraft separation and wake research, real-time situational awareness of wake encounters for controllers and pilots, and merging and spacing operations at airportals. The VEDARS will enable the FAA Wake Vortex Program, RECAT, and researchers to assess historical aircraft separation schemes through identification of wake encounters from historical flight data, and develop new spacing techniques for various airfield configurations. Real-time implementation of VEDARS on aircraft and within ground decision support systems will enhance controllers' and pilots' awareness of wake encounters and their decision making regarding merging and spacing. Additionally, the meteorological information provided will enhance wake transport and decay predictions and weather forecasts for airportal operations. Finally, data from the VEDARS can be used by commercial organizations to develop and validate the performance of wake vortex detection systems and automated spacing systems.

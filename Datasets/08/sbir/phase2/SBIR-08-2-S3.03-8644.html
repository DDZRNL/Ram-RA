		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Deployable Space Systems (DSS) has developed an ultra-lightweight elastically self-deployable roll-out solar array (ROSA) structural platform that when combined with ultra-thin 33% IMM PV or 29.5% standard ZTJ PV solar-cell flexible blanket technologies can produce a near-term and low-risk solar array system that provides revolutionary performance in terms of high specific power (>500 W/kg BOL with IMM & >225 W/kg with ZTJ), lightweight, high deployed stiffness, high deployed strength, compact stowage volume (>50 kW/m3 BOL), reliability, affordability, and rapid commercial readiness.  ROSA's predicted performance metrics are incredible improvements over current state-of-the-art, and in many cases are mission-enabling for future applications.  The ROSA technology innovation is applicable to practically all NASA and non-NASA missions as a direct replacement for current solar array technologies.  The proposed Phase 2 program has been uniquely structured to methodically develop a feasible scaled-up ROSA solar array system specifically configured for NASA's Outer-Planets mission applications, collaboratively with all the technology stakeholders, and increase technology readiness to TRL 5/6.  The successful completion of the proposed program will rapidly ready the mission-enabling ROSA solar array technology for commercial infusion into future programs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA applications for DSS's ROSA solar array include practically all missions as a direct replacement for classical state-of-the-practice solar array technologies.  DSS's ROSA solar array is applicable for all LEO Orbital, GEO Orbital, Interplanetary, Deep Space, Outer-Planets, Lunar Surface, and Planetary Lander missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA applications for DSS's ROSA solar array include practically all commercial and military missions as a direct replacement for classical state-of-the-practice solar array technologies.  DSS's ROSA solar array is applicable for all LEO Orbital, MEO Orbital, GEO Orbital, fixed-terrestrial, and mobile-terrestrial applications/missions.  These missions include, but are not limited to: Operational Responsive Space (ORS), Nano-Satellite, MILSATCOM, Space Based Radar, Solar Electric (SEP) Tugs, SBIRS, DARPA space and/or terrestrial applications, and Army mobile power applications.

		<BR>
		This SBIR effort is focused on developing a Dynamic Airspace Configuration (DAC) concept where-in ARTCCs can benefit from re-configuring airspaces based on Traffic Flow Management (TFM) restrictions, and the development of a preliminary Airspace Concept Evaluation System (ACES)-framework and initial algorithms to demonstrate that ARTCCs need to engage in a coordination framework of exchanging TFM restriction until they determine mutually-agreeable optimal airspace configuration. The development of algorithms that leverage and recognize the interactions and interdependencies between DAC and TFM is the key innovation of this effort. Some examples of expected operational improvements include 1) reduction in congestion and delays when sector capacities (Monitoring Alert Parameter or Dynamic Density) are violated, 2) reduction in controller workload and improved safety, 3) ability to accommodate user preferred routes and weather uncertainty and 4) achieve a balance between airborne delay and grounding holding delay. The SBIR Phase-I effort demonstrated how a combined DAC-TFM algorithm determines an optimal airspace configuration different from a DAC-only algorithm and could result in minimization of peak count and dwell time variance. The effort also included the design and preliminary implementation of a TFM model that uses ARTCC sector configuration to determine the delays that is generated, absorbed and propagated. The Phase II effort includes development of DAC-TFM framework as an enhancement to NASA's ACES- DADS (Dynamic Airspace Design Service) work and interaction of NASA's airspace partitioning DAC algorithms such as MxDAC, DAU slicing and Sector Combination algorithms with the TFM models using the same framework.

		We anticipate the post applications for this technology to be initially tied very closely to NASA's Airspace DAC research efforts. We anticipate that the algorithms and framework developed in this effort will be further enhanced and integrated into ACES main branch under ongoing ACES effort in the 2012 -2014 timeframe. This research will complement ongoing NASA research in DAC and will support the following NASA DAC milestones<BR> Validate by simulation that airspace could be reconfigured every x hours without adverse effects (AS.3.3.04, due FY09)<BR> Candidate airspace allocation algorithms proposed (AS.2.3.01,)<BR> Candidate airspace allocation algorithms validated (AS.2.3.02,)<BR> DAC concepts experimentally validated (AS.4.3.01)<BR> <BR>In addition to Airspace DAC research, the ACES products will also significantly benefit from the enhancements made to ACES software. ACES is currently actively used by NASA contractors and researches.  IAI has been involved in NASA's ACES development since its inception in 2001. IAI is thoroughly familiar with the ACES software and actively supports it for NASA's researchers and analysts.

		<BR>
		System integrators who will prime the deployment of technologies in the roll out of NGATS, and the ones working with the US Air Force for Special Usage Airspace (SUA) management will use the technology developed under this Phase II.<BR><BR>Both JPDO and FAA are working on modernizing the NAS (under SE2020 FAA) anticipates spending over $1billion over the next 10 years in various efforts for this goal. DSTs for concept evaluations, modeling and simulation and airspace design are integral components of this transition. The products developed under this phase II will help IAI, as a key player in the market, as a leading ATM R&D organization.<BR><BR>SUA is required by the military to fly military aircraft for training and combat purposes. The proposed DAC-TFM based airspace management tool can be enhanced for SUA management to provide DOD and FAA advisories in terms dynamically changing structure and control of SUA, and optimize SUA utilization, NAS capacity, workload and delay.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Mechanical and thermal performance of CMC components benefit from low part count, integrally fabricated designs of 3D woven reinforcement.  The advantages of these designs include the elimination for the need for post-fabrication mechanical attachment and the higher interlaminar properties offered by the through thickness paths of the fibers within the 3D preform architectures. The specific innovations MR&D is proposing are to improve the preform geometry definition through the use of the Kansas State University digital element approach, improve the material properties calculation module using a modified unit cell algorithm associated with the new geometry, and enhance the code calibration through additional CMC fabrication, imaging and material property testing.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The preform design and CMC property prediction code developed in the Phase II program will support the development of any hot structure control surface, TPS, or propulsion system materials used on the Crew Exploration Vehicle and subsequent airframes required for the Mission to Mars. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology proposed in the Phase II program will also be of direct interest to the Department of Defense (DOD) to support the development of CMC scramjets, hypersonic missiles, and maneuvering reentry bodies.  The results are also expected to be of direct interest to programs including the USAF Common Aero Vehicle, and the DARPA Hypersonic Cruise Vehicle.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In general, development and validation of diagnostic models for complex safety critical systems are time and cost intensive jobs. The proposed Phase-II effort will automate some vital processes essential in developing integrated diagnostic schemes and cost-effective revalidation of the integrated models. The automated processes, resulting from this effort will be incorporated as tools in TEAMS Design and Analytic Platform. For reducing the burden of testing diagnostic models, capability for automatically generating test cases, regression test suites along with the options for their playback will be developed under this effort. Additionally, an option for efficient diagnostics and troubleshooting in multi-mode systems will be introduced in TEAMS via this SBIR effort. To ensure the readiness of the TEAMS tools and options developed through this effort, those will be verified and validated with one or more NASA's ground support systems that are associated with the ARES or Constellation Program Ground Support. Collectively, these achievements will significantly reduce the time and cost in developing and better utilizing large scale fault diagnostic systems using TEAMS.

		<BR>
		The outcomes from the effort will be useful in developing diagnostic models and applications for large and complex onboard and offboard NASA systems involving aircraft and spacecraft. Health management of onboard systems, whose components or subsystems are interactive, such as power, climate control, thrusters, etc can be benefitted from the envisioned tools. HM of ground support systems including LH2, Pneumatics, LOX, Launch Control, etc will be the other area of application of the envisioned tools. The integration and revalidation helper tools will cut down the time and cost requirements for developing diagnostic schemes for both onboard and ground support systems. "Optimal diagnostic and troubleshooting options for multi-mode systems" will be especially useful for onboard systems in aiding fast and safe fault prevention and recovery actions during missions. It will be also useful in ground support systems for minimizing the cost of diagnosis and maintenance under time constraints.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The outcomes from the Phase-II effort will be useful in developing diagnostic models and applications for large and complex commercial systems such as commercial aviation, marine, automotive and other high-value industrial systems. In addition to the safety critical systems in aviation, marine and automotive sector, the "optimal diagnostic and troubleshooting option for multi-mode systems" will be especially useful for industrial systems that require high availability, such as medical equipment, semiconductor fabrication equipment etc. The tool facilitates HM in the high-availability centric systems by without pulling them out of operation. The test case generation, regression test suite generation and playback capabilities will be useful in cutting down the testing and retesting costs of diagnostic models. These capabilities are especially useful for systems that undergo update at periodic intervals, such as automotive, and plant machinery.

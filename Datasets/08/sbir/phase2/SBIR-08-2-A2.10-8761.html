		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		SynGenics Corporation proposes a program that unites mathematical and statistical processes, Response Surface Methodology, and multicriterial optimization methods to design optimized, failsafe technologies to control shockwave-boundary-layer interactions and realize improvements in supersonic inlet performance and vehicle efficiency. The innovation described in this proposal is the development of SynGenics Optimization System (SynOptSys), a software product that will provide expert guidance to the user in the capture and documentation of response variables, identification of factors, and statistical design of experiments (DOE).  Furthermore, the software system will assist the user in the analysis of DOE data, model building, diagnostics, and system optimization. The software will implement multicriteral optimization methods developed by SynGenics personnel, which will enable the simultaneous optimization of the flow-control (FC) system with respect to multiple, competing inlet-system requirements. SynOptSys will help designers and product developers overcome the barriers that prevent them from using powerful mathematical and statistical techniques to develop better products in a less costly manner. SynOptSys will implement the final task in a suite of methods developed by SynGenics to transform a need and candidate solution concepts to an affordable solution. Use of these powerful techniques enables the development of high-value systems. The significance of this program is that it will provide tools necessary to conduct multicriterial, inlet system-level-assessments and optimizations of enabling technologies, including, but not limited to flow-control technologies  This program supports the Propulsion Efficiency key research area of the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Supersonics Program by working to develop inlet FC technologies that will facilitate low TSFC of highly integrated supersonic inlets and improved overall cruise efficiency through reduced inlet drag.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed innovation supports the Propulsion Efficiency key research area of the NASA Supersonics Aeronautics Program. Moreover, it is applicable to any system whose suitability can be described in terms of measurable responses (e.g., stability, distortion, fuel consumption, cost, TRL, producibility) and that have associated factors that can be manipulated to influence the level of achievement of one or more of the desired responses. SynOptSys could be used for optimization of a high-temperature material, a mixed compression inlet system, an individual component within such a system, solution of acoustics problems associated with rotary-wing aircraft, hypersonic system concept optimization, and improving the return on investment of resources in physical testing and modeling, such as CFD. SynOptSys is also applicable to Long Range Strike Aircraft, and supersonic commercial and business aircraft.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA similarly include optimization of any product with attributes associated with customers' perception of its value. If the suitability of the product or system can be described in terms of measurable characteristics (e.g., strength, wear resistance, taste, cost, number of defects) and if there are factors whose values influence the level of achievement of one or more of the desired responses, then SynOptSys can be used in its design and optimization. It is also likely that SynOptSys can be used in the design and optimization of the process to produce it. Examples include nearly all products manufactured and sold in the world. Examples include rubber formulations for tires and windshield wipers, a severance system for aircraft canopies, the shape of turbine blades in a jet engine, a high-temperature material for thermal protective systems or engine components, an alloy for a specific application, manufacturing processes for a broad range of industries. Ceramic products like bathroom fixtures and dinnerware, chemicals, ophthalmic lenses, food products, pharmaceuticals, commercial aircraft seating configurations, fluffy pulp for disposable diapers, laundry detergent, and an endless list of other products could be designed using the proposed innovation.

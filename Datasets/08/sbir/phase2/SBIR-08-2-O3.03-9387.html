		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Kennedy Space Center maintains approximately $2 billion worth of ground support facilities to support its launch vehicle program.  Maintenance of the ground facilities is a difficult and ongoing task since the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is located in one of the most aggressive corrosion environments in the U.S.  The effects of the corrosive environment at the KSC are compounded by the exhaust of the Space Shuttle's solid rocket boosters which produce an estimated 17 tons of hydrochloric acid with each launch.  The Phase II project will continue the development of the models began in Phase I for classification of corrosion inhibitors for structural steel.  We will produce even more robust models for selecting synergistic corrosion inhibitor compositions through a sequential program of algorithm development and high throughput electrochemical screening.  We will then demonstrate the efficacy of the new compositions in protective coatings by electrochemical impedance studies, cyclic corrosion tests and outdoor exposures. In addition we will also develop toxicity classification tools for organic corrosion inhibitors. We will also scale up production of the corrosion inhibitor additive packages for evaluation by coating manufacturers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology will have primary application to the ground support equipment and facilities at KSC, but the proposed technology could be used at any location where NASA maintains either equipment or facilities exposed to corrosive environments.  The compositions of TDA's corrosion inhibitors and the nanostructured carriers arising from the Phase II efforts can be used as a low-toxicity, high performance corrosion inhibiting additive for protective coatings on the structural steel that makes up most of the ground facilities at KSC.  Furthermore the methodology can be used to identify corrosion inhibiting packages for other metals and alloys that NASA needs to protect from the environment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The direct losses to the U.S. economy attributed to corrosion each year exceed $300 billion.  The methodologies and materials arising out of the Phase II effort can be applied to protect not only steel, but aluminum and magnesium.  For, example, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force and commercial airlines need low-toxicity, high-performance corrosion inhibiting additives for corrodible aerospace aluminum alloys.  New and effective corrosion inhibitors could replace the toxic chromates that are still being used in aerospace applications. Protective coatings employing our corrosion inhibitors could be used for low-toxicity corrosion protection for metals employed in a wide range of applications, including, automotive, aerospace, bridges and buildings.  Additionally, the corrosion inhibitors could be used in related products such as adhesives and sealants where low toxicity corrosion protection is desired.

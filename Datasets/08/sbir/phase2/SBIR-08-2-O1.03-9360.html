		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		IAI is actively developing Software Defined Radio platforms that can adaptively switch between different modes of operation by modifying both transmit waveforms and receiver signal-processing tasks on the fly. The proposed software reconfigurable radio implementation technique and the system design will leverage IAI's experience in SDRs, RF design, signal processing and firmware design. Our innovation focuses on implementing maximum transceiver functionalities digital reconfigurable devices (FPGA), and minimizing the number of analog components. Our SDR designs are based on COTS components and are modular in nature. This makes it easier to upgrade smaller units of the design with development in state-of-the-art, instead of re-designing the entire SDR platform. The proposed innovations are: <BR>	STRS implementation on COTS SDR platforms to realize NASA objectives of simultaneously capturing the benefits of SDR technology and the economies and benefits of an open architecture standard.<BR>	Integration of cognitive capabilities (with focus on STRS compliant implementation) for the SDR which have been developed under the Phase-I contract. This would include Adaptive Modulation and Coding, Automatic modulation recognition and Spectrum Sensing.<BR>	Reconfigurable digital transceiver design using high-speed FPGAs. This would enable multi-mode operation and scalable architecture for SDRs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology is built upon the Software-Radio communications system design expertise of IAI, developed over several SBIR and non-SBIR contracts. Our proposed SDR design can be used for a wide range of NASA STRS related communication applications, with enhanced cognitive capabilities. This includes:<BR><BR>1.	Cognitive capabilities for  NASA STRS like AMC, AMR and Spectral sensing<BR>2.	Reconfigurable communication radios for EVA and  space missions<BR><BR>IAI has a long history of successfully designing custom communication systems for NASA and DoD, and most NASA applications could be supported by our reconfigurable radio design.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The most promising Non- NASA commercial applications are:<BR><BR>1.	Cognitive Radios for DoD applications <BR>2.	High  bandwidth, plug-and-play waveform synthesizer<BR>3.	Real-time digital processors <BR>4.	UAV based applications (due to the small form factor and low power). This would  include UAV based  communications and radar applications <BR><BR>IAI has tremendous experience of designing customized radar assembly and packaging them as field-ready units.

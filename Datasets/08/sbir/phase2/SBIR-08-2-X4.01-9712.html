		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) proposes to synthesize, characterize, and test new ionic liquids and formulations as lubricants for aerospace applications.  The compounds will have low vapor pressures/outgassing and appropriate thermal stability.  Upon addition of the innovative ionic liquids to the base lubricants, a 20% decrease in viscosity, friction coefficient, and wear will result.  Minimal corrosive effects of the formulations at will be observed.  The formulations will be shown more effective as liquid lubricants for use at low temperatures (-70oC) with long-term operational stability in aerospace systems.  Several new ionic liquids will be scaled and a novel formulation will be evaluated in a NASA test bed.  The technology will be at a TRL range from 3-4 upon completion of Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed lubricants and formulations will have direct applications to NASA aerospace systems that require minimal/no maintenance over extended periods of time. These systems include rovers and machinery used in constructing the lunar habitat.  The compounds will provide lower volatility, decreased wear effects, and better tribological characteristics than those of standard liquid lubricants that are currently used, particularly at lower temperatures.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed lubricants and formulations have applications in terrestrial machinery.  They will substantially increase performance, and reduce maintenance costs and frequencies of industrial transportation and construction systems.  The compounds will also be valuable in gyroscope bearings on board satellites.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Accurate measurement of atmospheric parameters with high resolution needs advanced lasers. In this SBIR program we propose to develop innovative Q-switched high power 2.05micron fiber laser with pulse energy greater than 10mJ, repetition rate of 10Hz to 1KHz, and pulse duration of 200ns using our proprietary innovative highly efficient Tm-doped glass fiber. This new fiber laser will be an all-fiber laser system consisting of actively Q-switched fiber laser oscillator and fiber amplifiers. This proposed all-fiber laser system is compact, highly efficient, robust and highly reliable, which is especially suited for NASA's application where operating environment is always extremely rough. In Phase II we will further optimize Tm-doped glasses and fibers based upon Phase I results, design and engineer 2.05micron Q-switched single frequency fiber laser oscillator, design and engineer 2.05micron fiber amplifiers, integrate Q-switched single frequency fiber laser oscillator and fiber amplifier, build and deliver a prototype high power Q-switched single frequency 2.05micron fiber laser.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) encompasses research in the areas of Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics, and Planetary Science. A major objective of SMD instrument development programs is to implement science measurement capabilities with smaller or more affordable spacecraft so development programs can meet multiple mission needs and therefore make the best use of limited resources. This proposed innovative Q-switched high peak power single frequency fiber laser can be used as innovative lidar component for measurements of the atmosphere and surface topography of the Earth, Mars, the Moon, and other planetary bodies. Because it is fiber based, this Q-switched high peak power single frequency laser is compact, efficient, and extremely reliable.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are a number of potential non-NASA commercial applications for Q-switched high peak power single frequency Tm3+-doped fiber laser. This eye-safe laser source can be used to build commercial lidar for ranging and surface topography applications, as the light source for generating mid-IR lasers, and for research and development.

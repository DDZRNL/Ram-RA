		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) along with collaborators at the University of Iowa and Old Dominion University (ODU) developed an advanced closed-loop Adaptive Task Management System (ATMS). The ATMS is designed to accurately monitor Operator Functional State (OFS) during flight in real time based on an individualized OFS assessment model. The individualized OFS assessment model is trained and individualized using different sources of training input (physiological signals, system dynamics measurements, etc.) and training output derived from the dynamic cognitive workload reference analysis. If the OFS of an individual decreases below a certain threshold, we will apply a task performance augmentation strategy to even-out workload and maintain the operator in an optimum cognitive workload level. As a result, the operator can be continuously engaged and able to respond quickly and appropriately to unusual situations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA Applications: the closed-loop adaptive task management system can be directly deployed to many NASA applications that can benefit from more sensitive and robust workload and operator functional state assessment for the purpose of designing work environments, tools and procedures. On the other hand, the adaptive task management system providing sensitive monitoring of human operator functional status in situ allows other human and automated agents to adapt appropriately in NASA's aviation safety mission. The closed-loop adaptive task management system would also be applicable to those missions in manned space flight and exploration

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA Applications: The closed-loop task adaptive management system would also be appropriate for spin off to other operational environments such as military and civilian arenas, military UAV mission controllers, general transportation operators (particularly long haul trucking), and other supervisory control environments.<BR><BR>In addition, the technology can be used to increase the training/learning efficiency by utilizing the real-time monitoring of the functional state. Possible applications include the training of transportation security agents, air traffic controllers, and pilots, etc.

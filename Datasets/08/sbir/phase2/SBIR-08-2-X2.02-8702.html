		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The work proposed herein focuses on waste subsystems with emphasis on odor control associated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The development of efficient odor removal systems for use inside lunar architectures is one of NASA's critical needs (2008 SBIR Topic X2.03). Because of the limited space and resources in both exploration vehicles and non-moving habitats, a treatment system must be compact, lightweight, and robust, and have low energy and material input requirements, with focus on reducing equivalent system mass (ESM). We have developed a novel, robust, and highly effective Silica-Titania Composite (STC) technology capable of adsorbing and oxidizing VOCs to harmless byproducts when irradiated with UV light. The effectiveness of the technology for removal of ethanol from air when irradiated continuously with UV was proven under Phase I. This Phase II proposal will focus on the design, fabrication, and evaluation of a prototype employing the STC technology with UV LEDs as the light source, challenged with several VOCs simultaneously. The prototype will be designed based on the requirements of the Lunar Habitat in NASA's Lunar Outpost mission. Revised ESM calculations will be completed after system optimization, and a final prototype will be delivered to NASA for future testing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed system is equally well suited for use in space exploration vehicles, as well as permanent space habitats. The STC technology has numerous applications in air and water purification, most of which fit into the specific needs of NASA's Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) systems. This includes not only gas-phase odor removal related to VOCs, but also pathogen inactivation in both gases and liquids, removal of organic compounds from gray water, and removal from a number of inorganic compounds from air. Although VOC-related gas-phase odor removal is the primary application for which the system will be tailored, further development of the treatment system may make it suitable for other NASA applications. Some specific missions of interest within the Constellation Program include the Altair Lunar Lander, Lunar Outpost, Small Pressurized Rover, Payload, Mars Transit Vehicle, Mars Lander, Mars Outpost, Mars Rover, and ground support applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The STC technology is applicable to several non-NASA applications. For example, the technology can be used to remove VOCs from indoor air in commercial buildings, homes, hospitals, and schools. It may also be used by the military for air purification in submarines and aircraft. The technology is currently being developed for use in commercial aircraft cabin air purification. Significant work has been done in the development of the technology for methanol removal from gaseous exhaust at pulp and paper mills. Furthermore, the STC technology has been commercialized for mercury removal from caustic exhaust at a chlor-alkali facility, and a pilot-scale study is under way for mercury removal from coal-fired power plant flue gas.

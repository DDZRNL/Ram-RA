		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Wireless communication of small, nano and micro satellites will play a vital role to NASA mission and marketability of the satellite. The use of an Internet-based protocol, especially TCP/IP, can provide seamless network command and control continuity between terrestrial and space-based platforms and environments, as well as between distributed ground and space stations. However, long propagation and/or large transmission errors can significantly degrade current TCP/IP performance. In addition, current TCP is too complex to fit in a small footprint, which is required in microsats and nanosats. To address this NASA/ARC need for wireless networking technologies for small launch vehicles, Broadata Communications, Inc. proposes to develop a Small Space Platform Internet Protocol Stack with Space-Enhanced TCP technology (or SSP IP & TCP in short) to dramatically increase TCP/IP performance (20 times improvements over standard TCP/IP was demonstrated in Phase I) and enable the use of TCP/IP for processor-footprint constrained spacecraft in NASA missions. The overall goal of this Phase II project is to further develop the SSP IP & TCP technology, and to produce a full-scale, highly-optimized, IP embeddable SSP IP & TCP prototype system for placement in NASA networks with micro- or nano-satellite platforms.  Our Phase II work plan is designed to complete SSP IP & TCP development and to produce: (a) a miniature, nanosat integrateable, standalone embedded network system module that provides all SSP IP & TCP functionalities and can directly meet NASA needs and resource-constraint integration requirements, and (b) a full-scale SSP IP &TCP software package that supports multiple network communication interfaces and provides automated installation for Linux or Windows operation systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to the NASA's direct application for the Space Networks, the SSP TCP technology can also be applied in many NASA, government, and military programs related to the Space Station, the Moon and Mars Initiative, C4I and tactical networking, and small, possibly secret devices where wireless links may be employed, especially in cases where thin platforms are employed in IP communications including but not limited to sensor networks, SATCOM, Gigabit SATCOM, JTRS DCRM or surrogate architectures, software radios, Link-16, and Link-11. In addition, the SSP TCP can be a space enabler for many sensors, devices, and components, which can gain communication effectiveness and efficiency due to the SSP TCP's features.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The SSP IP & TCP is also directly applicable to commercial network applications that can benefit from wireless enhanced TCP performance, especially in devices that are resource constrained. Major markets are cell phones and wireless packet networks for public IP access. Potential applications include, but are not limited to, wireless Internet access networks (especially for satellite, mobile/wireless Internet Service Providers), performance management of wireless technology, and commercial sensor applications.<BR><BR>The SSP IP & TCP can pervade cellular or wireless networks with long propagation, military embedded devices IP devices in ad hoc networking environments, and sensor networks with limited footprint modules, saving these private enterprises money and increasing their efficiency for consumers. Cell phone Internet access and small embedded wireless Internet Protocol use, as in sensor networks, will also benefit greatly from our SSP IP & TCP, helping consumers to have better Internet access, whether on earth or in the air.

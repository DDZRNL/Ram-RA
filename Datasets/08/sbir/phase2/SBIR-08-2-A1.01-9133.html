		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In support of NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate and Aviation Safety Mission,  NanoSonic has developed a series of moisture and corrosion mitigating, ultra-hydrophobic, environmentally tunable, nanophase separating adhesive modifiers and complementary high performance, wide service temperature range  (-60&#61616;C to 450&#61616;C) structural adhesives.  The smart nanostructured modifiers represent a significant discovery as the adhesion strength of our novel and commercial-off-the-shelf aerospace adhesives was increased by > 40% with inclusion of such systems upon aging in 100% relative humidity (RH), ten days, 140&#61616;F.  Of significant importance to manufacturability and dual-use commercialization, the novel modifying agents are inert, inorganic-organic, halogenated hybrid copolymers, and hence can be used with virtually any adhesive, paint or environmental aerospace materials systems.  The inorganic poly(octahedral silsesquioxane) (POSS), fluorination and copolymer molecular weight can be synthetically engineered to complement any paste of film adhesive.  The TRL of the novel adhesive system would be increased from 6-8 during Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications for the ultra-hydrophobic, nanostructured, modifiers and high performance, halogenated, POSS-copolymers include moisture/corrosion mitigating structural aerospace adhesives, anti-ice conformal coatings and gamma radiation resistant composites.  At the systems level, the moisture resistant, environmentally tunable adhesive systems would prevent the spontaneous bond dissociation associated with water wicking at the metal-epoxy interface of bonded joints.  In humid environments, diffusion through the bulk epoxy adhesive on composite-composite bonded joints would be mitigated via a reduction in the free volume of the water permeable epoxy.  The universal, inert nanostructured modifiers could therefore support composite or metal aircraft substructures.  For dual-use NASA applications, NanoSonic's spray ESA process is an economically feasible option for manufacturing multilayer nanostructured stacks and environmental coatings for large area aircraft and space structures.  NanoSonic's hydrophobic, yet polar, hybrid adhesives and coupling agents offer excellent adhesion, moisture and corrosion resistance over a wide service temperature range of -90<SUP>o</SUP>C to > 450<SUP>o</SUP>C.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NanoSonic's high performance polar, yet hydrophobic adhesives would result in advanced aerospace adhesives and surface treatments with increased durability to minimize subsonic aircraft aging and durability related hazards with a TRL of 6 upon completion of the Phase I program.  NanoSonic's polar resins are synthetically engineered to offer stronger adhesion over commercial aircraft adhesives, and the hydrophobic backbone allows for superior moisture resistance and corrosion mitigation.  The down-selected polymers would also serve as adhesives or sealants with solvent resistant against jet fuel, sea water and harsh aircraft solvents.  The adhesives offered will be delivered in volumes up to 55 gallon drums and are roll-to-roll compatible for repair appliqué.  TRL 9 would be reached via successful flight testing and platform integration of the adhesives onto commercial subsonic, supersonic and near-space aircraft such as 787 Dreamliner, V-22, AH-1, UH-60 F/A-18, JSF, HAA and ISIS.

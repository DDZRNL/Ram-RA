		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
			This Phase II proposal is to develop a miniature, low power consumption, fused deep UV Raman and native fluorescence (DUV-RF) 1 meter stand-off sensor. The proposed instrument has an enhanced ability to measure the spatial distribution of chemical species containing C/N/H/O/S/Cl, and water, ice, and hydrated-minerals on a 1-5 mm spatial scale enabled by a novel wide-aperture, high-sensitivity ultraminiature UV Raman spectrometer. <BR>	Raman spectroscopy is a non-contact, non-destructive, method of identifying unknown materials without sample acquisition or processing; ideal for in-situ rovers. However traditional Raman instruments are plagued with fluorescence backgrounds, require sample altering, high-powered lasers, and require the use fiber optics; an instrument design with operational constraints and high power requirements. Our innovative instrument design incorporates our deep UV lasers for fiberless resonance Raman spectroscopy in a fluorescence free zone where resonance effects lead to enhancements by > 2-3orders of magnitude over 532 and 785 nm systems and can be coupled to native fluorescence for ppt detection of aromatic organics compounds.  <BR>	The New Frontiers has placed a South pole-Aitken Basin sample return as a future mission scenario. The enhanced detection capabilities of DUV-RF can be used to provide an understanding of organics and water distribution in the lunar regolith. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
			This technology is useful for a broad range of in situ measurements for: space science and terrestrial geochemical, geophysical and geobiological studies; planetary protection applications such as measuring/characterizing organic or biogenic contamination on outbound and inbound spacecraft; and for general application to high quality non-invasive, non-destructive measurement of trace levels of contamination on surfaces, in liquids and in the air, such as aboard the International Space Station.  The proposed instrument will provide the ability to measure trace levels of organic material at working distances up to 1 meter or more.  For space science applications, this would enable a Rover-body mounted instrument that could interrogate the vicinity of the Rover.  For terrestrial applications the stand-off measurements could be made in full sun-light conditions at least for Raman and potentially for the deep UV native fluorescence emissions.  For planetary protection applications it would enable direct measurement of bioloads on spacecraft surfaces without the need for sample collection using traditional methods.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
			The technology being addressed by this proposal is immediately useful for Department of Defense (DOD) and Homeland Security (HS) applications as well as non-government commercial and industrial applications.  DOD and HS applications include in situ biological and chemical warfare sensors to detect trace levels of biological, nerve, and blister agents as well as low-volatility toxic industrial chemicals (TICs).  The ability of the sensor to measure hazardous materials at meters of working distance vastly improves their use by first responders.

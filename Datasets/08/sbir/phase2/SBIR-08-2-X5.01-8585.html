		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
			Exploration of planetary surfaces will require a communication architecture that supports operational capabilities in which fixed and mobile assets on the planetary surface can communicate seamlessly and securely to coordinate planetary exploration as well as communicate back to Earth. Communication systems operating on planetary surfaces will also require innovative solutions for analyzing and characterizing the lunar propagation environment.  Communications capabilities will need to include bi-directional, multi-point links to provide on-demand, autonomous interconnection between base stations, mobile robotic rovers, mobile humans, and in-space relay stations.  Communications could consist of voice, video, data and control.  Current available system solutions do not fulfill this need with respect to range, mobility, bandwidth, size, weight, and power. Aeronix understands these issues and believes that the solution lies in the development of wireless devices that employ the radiation tolerant semiconductors and software radios as an underlying architecture feature.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has planned future exploratory Lunar and Mars missions that could use radiation hardened architecture to support wireless user applications.  NASA plans to place both astronauts and sensors on Lunar and Mars surfaces.  Robust communication links will be needed in support of these missions for Astronauts to secure communications with NASA's control center, transmission of medical data, transmission of sensitive sensor data, transmission of sensitive video and information.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There a number of future activities and potential customers for a radiation hardened wireless transceiver modem. One example is a robotic controlled system for a nuclear power plant. A robotic controlled system could take the place of human activities in a nuclear power plant, thus improving overall safety and mitigating undesired events. Another example is to use the transceiver modems in satellite relay applications.  The small form factor, low power, and light weight makes the modem ideal for satellite relay applications. The examples used for future activities and future customers have the potential to increase safety and reduce power consumption.

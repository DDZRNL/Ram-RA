		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Impact Technologies in collaboration with Pratt & Whitney and Wright State University, proposes to continue the development of an innovative nonlinear adaptive method for detecting and isolating sensor faults, actuator faults, and component faults for jet engines. In sharp contrast to many conventional methods which deal with either sensor faults or component faults but not both, our method considers all three types of faults under one unified framework. In the successful Phase I program, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach via a proof-of-concept demonstration using NASA's C-MAPSS model. The objective of Phase II is to raise the TRL by comprehensive development/improvement of the prototype system, extensive performance evaluation, and close collaboration with Pratt & Whitney for technology transition. The success of this program will bring significant benefits to the propulsion industry by providing a cutting-edge engine diagnostics system with features that have never been available, including adaptive nonlinear engine model, adaptive threshold, transferrable-belief-model-based residual evaluation within a unified framework. These novel technologies will greatly improve performance of onboard engine diagnostics system especially during transient operations and further reduce false alarm rate and missed detection rate, resulting in improved flight safety and significant reduction in overall engine maintenance cost.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The successful completion of the proposed work will lead to improvements in the safe operations of commercial and general aviation (GA) aircraft and address the goals of the NASA Aviation Safety program. The proposed fault diagnostic technologies with an emphasis on sensor / actuator / component failure isolation will be directly applicable to Propulsion IVHM, Crew Exploration Vehicle, Reusable Launch Vehicles, Unmanned Air Vehicles and future generation general aviation platforms. It will lead to benefits in the form of improved reliability, maintainability, and survivability of safety-critical aerospace systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The success of this Phase II program will bring significant benefit to the propulsion industry by providing a cutting-edge engine diagnostics system with features that have never been available. The potential commercial use of the developed technologies is broad. Examples of key customers that could benefit through use of the developed technologies include: commercial and military aircraft, unmanned combat air vehicles, JSF, future combat systems, land and marine propulsion systems, industrial actuation systems, and robotic applications. The aero propulsion domain alone has thousands of potential systems to address with this technology

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The development of a polymer laminate with water and oxygen barrier properties suitable for food packaging and preservation on 3-5 year manned space exploration missions is proposed. The laminate is a multilayer structure comprising polymer and inorganic dielectrics that will provide near-hermetic encapsulation of food items for the duration of these missions. In Phase I, flexible polymer barriers with an oxygen transport rate of <0.005 cc/m2-day and water transport rate of <0.005 g/m2-day were developed. The barriers contain no metal foils, have a areal density of <34 g/m2 for a 40 micron thick film, and tolerate high temperature sterilization treatments. The polymer laminates are mechanically robust exhibiting a 165MPa yield strength, 200MPa tensile strength, 550MPa tensile modulus, and 3% elongation to yield. In Phase II, we propose to optimize barrier properties to reduce weight, minimize ash on incineration, develop heat-sealing methods, and expand the testing to include heat sealed enclosures. The Phase II effort also includes a collaboration with a potential high-volume manufacturer of the barrier films for aerospace applications.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The specific NASA applications for the proposed barrier polymers are the following:<BR><BR>·	food packaging for long-duration space missions;<BR>·	packaging for medicines on long-duration space missions;<BR>·	packaging of air and moisture sensitive chemicals used in science<BR>        exploration on long-duration missions;<BR>·	packaging of astronaut  physiological samples;<BR>·	packaging of extraterrestrial materials for return to earth.<BR><BR>All these applications will benefit from the availability of a lightweight, high-strength flexible packaging material. Besides having exceptional barrier properties, the proposed barrier polymers have several other features that are important to these NASA applications including: 1) transparency to allow inspection and identification of package contents; 2) an internal surface to which biocompatible and non-thrombogenic coatings can be added; and 3) a low temperature heat sealing capability that allows astronauts in space to create sealed packages that exclude water and oxygen and also prevent bacteriological and viral contamination. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-Nasa commercial applications in both the private and Government sectors have been identified. These applications included:<BR><BR>· meals-ready-to-eat (MREs) packaging for the military<BR>· electronics packaging <BR>· flexible packaging for primary and secondary lithium, ion batteries<BR>· packaging of battlefield medical supplies for treating trauma (e.g.<BR>  biologically active hemostatic agents<BR>· very long storage of food and medicines in rapid response materiel caches<BR>· packaging emergency supplies at remote locations.<BR>

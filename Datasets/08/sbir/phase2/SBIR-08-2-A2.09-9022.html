		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The overall objective of the Phase I program was to demonstrate a system for simultaneous measurements of unsteady pressure and model geometry. During the Phase I program, system components were identified, evaluated, and selected and a preliminary system for model deformation and unsteady pressure measurements was demonstrated. This system utilized Porous Polymer fast PSP, lifetime-based detection, and a pulsed Laser for illumination to produce single-shot measurements. During the Phase II program, the basic system will be expanded in several steps. The final goal is to produce a mobile system that can be integrated quickly into a wind tunnel and produce near-real time pressure and deformation data. If an existing VMD system is available, it may be desirable to simply synchronize data acquisition with this system, and therefore, an external control capability is essential. Combining pressure and deformation data quickly, a process we refer to as data fusion, is essential for productive wind tunnel tests. Rapid data fusion will enable understanding of the flow while the model is in the tunnel, and therefore, facilitate quick and accurate decisions as the test evolves. The proposed Phase II system will include tools to facility combination of the PSP data with the model geometry.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The potential products of this research include pressure and skin friction sensors for unsteady flowfields including rotorcraft, flopping airfoils, compressors, and turbines. The unique frequency response of these sensors will allow investigations into the unsteady fluid dynamics of these systems. The resulting distributed measurements of pressure and model geometry are of significant interest to NASA in a variety of aeronautical applications. These systems would be employed directly in NASA wind tunnels and test stands. ISSI is currently pursuing commercial applications in these fields by developing and demonstrating production and research grade PSP systems to NASA and Federal Laboratory (DOD and DOE) customers.

		<BR>
		The potential products of this research include pressure and skin friction sensors for unsteady flowfields including rotorcraft, flopping airfoils, compressors, and turbines. The unique frequency response of these sensors will allow investigations into the unsteady fluid dynamics of these systems. The resulting distributed measurements of pressure and model geometry are of significant interest in a variety of fields including aeronautical, hydrodynamics, and bio-medical engineering. ISSI is currently pursuing commercial applications in these fields by developing and demonstrating production and research grade PSP systems to customers in North and South America, Euorpe, and Asia. These measurements include traditional aerodynamic models, rotor-craft models, micro-channels, bridge aerodynamics, and automotive aerodynamics. Several commercial customers have expressed interest in a combined PSP/VMD capability as well as significant interest in a fast PSP. system for flight testing.

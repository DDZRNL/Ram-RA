		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		FAA predicts that air traffic will double or even triple by 2025 and unless solutions that enable improvements in the use of airspace can be developed and implemented, significant airspace congestion will occur.  Advancements in aircraft capabilities via new technologies can enable aircraft to operate more efficiently in the NAS and to operate safely in areas previously restricted.  AeroTech proposes to enhance the assessment of Performance Based Operations (PBO) by implementing the Autonomous Weather Hazard Avoidance Model (AWHAM) into ATM simulations providing autonomous guidance for aircraft thru hazardous weather regions.  PBO and traffic flow schemes can be assessed for any scenario by varying the detection capabilities of simulation aircraft, regulations, and/or policies, and examining deviation decisions, flight paths, safety impacts, and NAS throughput.  Phase II will involve implementing the hazard avoidance model into an operational simulation and performing a proof of concept study that will establish and quantify the benefits of aircraft equipped with particular hazard detection capabilities from the perspective of an aircraft operator.  AeroTech also proposes to develop the structure and architecture for integrating the AWHAM with the Autonomous Operations Planner, which provides pilots assistance in determining flight paths that comply with safety constraints and reduce operational costs.

		<BR>
		When the goals of the Phase II research and development are met, the Autonomous Weather Hazard Avoidance Model will be supportive of NASA's NextGen-Airspace program's goal to develop methodologies and techniques to minimize or solve the demand/capacity imbalance problem in the NextGen future.  The proposed Model will support level 1 and 2 research areas in Traffic Flow Management (TFM), Separation Assurance, and System-Level Design Analysis & Simulation Tools by improving the autonomous decision making capabilities of simulation aircraft, enabling the exploration of Performance Based Operations (PBO) based on aircraft weather detection capabilities, enabling the assessment of 4-D weather cube information for PBO, and enabling the development and testing of new TFM techniques that maximize airspace usage through PBO.  AWHAM will also enhance NASA's laboratories and simulation tools and efforts in Modeling and Simulation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		AeroTech's Autonomous Weather Hazard Avoidance Model will provide benefits to ATM research efforts, autonomous maneuvering of UAV, and as a technology cost-benefit analysis tool.  The proposed Model will provide the FAA, the Joint Planning and Development Office, higher educational institutions, and commercial research organizations a tool to examine NextGen capacity and throughput issues due to aircraft weather detection and mitigation capabilities and weather avoidance policies.  Understanding the benefits of aircraft capabilities (PBO) will enable the development of techniques to safely maximize airspace usage.  Aircraft operators and system developers can use the proposed Model in simulations to analyze the cost-benefits (operational efficiency and safety) of specific aircraft weather hazard detection systems and weather hazard information dissemination systems to support purchase decisions and development decisions respectively.  The Model when integrated with UAV sensors, data links, and flight controls will enable enhanced autonomous maneuvering around weather and could assist certification for NAS operations.

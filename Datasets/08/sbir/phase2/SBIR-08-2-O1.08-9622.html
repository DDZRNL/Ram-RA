		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Based on our proposed innovations and accomplished work in Phase I, we will focus on developing the new MAC protocol and hybrid routing protocol for lunar surface networks and orbit access. The new MAC protocol includes a novel mechanism of TDMA overlaying CSMA/CA and ensures scalable throughput and QoS performance in the hierarchical multihop wireless mesh networks proposed for lunar surface networks. The new MAC protocol will be implemented on top of a reconfigurable 802.11 radio and is compatible to legacy 802.11 networks. It also includes advanced features like efficiency power management, adaptive channel width for improving receiver sensitivity and communication range, and error control for eliminate errors due to radiation and radio burst. The hybrid routing protocol combines the advantages of ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing and disruption/delay tolerant network (DTN) routing. Its performance is significantly better than AODV or DTN, and is particularly effective to wireless networks with intermittent links, as in lunar surface networks and orbit access. In this proposal a detailed prototyping plan to implement the developed protocols is also presented. By the end of Phase II, a prototype system will be available for demonstrating the delivered technical objectives proposed in this proposal.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technologies can support lunar exploration and will be used to provide scalable lunar surface networking and orbit access. Similar application scenario can be found even in Earth environment, where the surface network will be on the Earth surface and the orbit access will be from Earth to its satellite. The same technologies can be applied to the explorations of other stars like Mars and also to any deep-space communication networks. They will become critical building blocks of Inter-Planetary Internet. <BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The same technologies can be adapted to DoD applications. For example, a communication network formed by both planes and ground battling units is similar to the integrated system of lunar surface networks and orbit access. The developed technologies can be applied other military networks such as batterfield networks and airborne networks. On the non-government market, the most promising application areas will be IEEE 802.11 mesh networks, IEEE 802.16 mesh networks, and their integrated systems. The technologies will draw tremendous attentions from service providers, chipset companies, and networking software companies. The hierarchical architecture and routing protocol will provide viable solutions for service providers to deploy cost-effective and reliable wireless mesh networks. The dynamic DTN routing protocol will also find good applications in system integration between satellite communications and wireless mesh networks.

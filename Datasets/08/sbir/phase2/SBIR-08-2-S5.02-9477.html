		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed effort advances the design of an innovative core sampling and acquisition system with improved core break-off, retention and ejection features.  Phase 1 successfully demonstrated, at TRL 4, the ability of the system to acquire rock core samples that are 10 mm diameter and 100 mm long.  The proposed innovation employs a different drill tube design in the vicinity of the core that does not impose any loads on the core and does not rotate relative to the core.  This novel technique actually envelopes and protects the core as it is generated.  The benefits are two fold; first, the integrity of the core is maintained and second, core ejection is much easier which greatly reduces, if not eliminates the risk of the core jamming within the drill tube/bit.  These improvements can be obtained without increasing the annulus of the drill bit that would otherwise require more down force, torque, power and bit wear.  By the end of the proposed Phase 2 effort, a prototype design of the improved coring system will be tested at TRL 6 with Mars ambient conditions.

		Develop Small Satellite Analysis Laboratory (SatLab): A simulation-of-simulations framework to integrate component and engineering simulations into a single larger simulation capable of full satellite system trade analysis and optimization, in order to reduce the cost and increase the quality of design and development of new small satellites and space vehicles, and test system upgrades and modifications on other space systems.

		The NASA Low-Cost Small Spacecraft Program is focused on the technologies, subsystems, methodologies, and mission concepts for space missions which lower the over-all cost for scientific exploration. We propose to support these efforts through building a "simulation-of-simulations" software suite that allows<BR><BR>   1. Development of a standard small satellite architecture framework,<BR>   2. Capture of all available subsystems simulations or engineering models that provide design and functionality documentation for small satellite architectural elements,<BR>   3. Support for full small satellite systems' physical and functional simulations of simulations against mission profile descriptions using the captured subsystem sub-simulation elements, and<BR>   4. Support for mission planning and analysis trade-studies that change subsystem and system parameters, supports inclusion and exclusion of alternative subsystem elements, and<BR>   5. Support for mission effectiveness parameter evaluation and display (including cost optimization or optimization a particular performance factors). <BR><BR>The proposed technology will be directly applicable to reducing the cost and increasing the quality of design and development of new small satellites and space vehicles. Furthermore, it can be used to test system upgrades and modifications on other space systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed Small Satellite Analysis Lab will be an extension of our existing technology for automating and performing complex system of systems simulation. The Virtual Systems Integration Laboratory (VSIL) can be used to establish simulation standards on complex systems and can perform complex simulations for such systems. It has both military and commercial applications outside of the NASA uses.<BR>Military Uses<BR>The SatLab and VSIL technologies are directly applicable to ongoing systems development of all military branches.  In particular, it can be used to make the ground vehicle building/design process more efficient.  The technology can be used to create simulations to assess the reliability of new technology or modifying existing technology on Army vehicles.  It is directly applicable to improving the quality of the design and cost to implement new military vehicles - such as all of the new FCS vehicles.<BR>Commercial Uses	<BR>To continue increasing the capabilities of current technology, it is important to develop new materials and components. However, the development cycle of a new material or component can be very time consuming and costly.  We are creating a virtual prototyping simulation architecture that can increase the speed and reduce the cost at which new materials and components are developed.  In particular, Cybernet's VSIL is working to reduce the reliance on physical prototyping for the design and production of commercial vehicles and aircraft systems.

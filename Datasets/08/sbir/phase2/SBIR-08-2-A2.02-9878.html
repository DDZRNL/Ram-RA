		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A recent breakthrough in combustion stability analysis (UCDS) offers the potential to predict the combustion stability of a scramjet. This capability is very important due to the extreme scramjet operational environment, which makes cut-and-try development approaches impractical. With UCDS, it will be possible to accurately predict the scramjet pressure oscillation amplitudes, along with critical parameters, including the unsteady wall heat flux.<BR>The UCDS tools were recently applied to the Ares I thrust oscillation issue in support of NASA's Thrust Oscillation Focus Team (TOFT). After validating the UCDS capabilities by analyzing the RSRM, GTL applied the tool to identify a relatively minor motor modification that should eliminate the organized motor oscillations.<BR>Building upon this validation, GTL took the first step towards extending UCDS to scramjets in the Phase I effort.  While a variety of issues and challenges were uncovered during the effort, the effort confirmed that the UCDS framework is fully applicable to scramjets.  However, the effort also revealed that the DCR scramjet is far more complicated and difficult to analyze than a typical rockets.   In the Phase II effort, GTL proposes to address the key issues that were identified during the Phase I effort.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Since the UCDS models are built from a general formulation, they can be used to analyze practically any combustion device, including rockets (liquid, solid, hybrid), turbojets (combustors, augmentors), ramjets, scramjets, combined cycle engines and so on. As such, UCDS can be used by NASA in the development of practically any propulsive device. Specific near term NASA applications for UCDS include: - Continued effort to mitigate the Ares I thrust oscillation effort - Working with the Ares V team to avoid potential thrust oscillation issues - Supporting the Constellation Program by identifying and avoiding potential stability issues that will arise when engines and motors are scaling up to meet performance requirements - Supporting the development of new propulsion devices, such as scramjets

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		With its broad capabilities, UCDS can be used by any combustion device developer, including the Air Force, Navy, Army, MDA, DARPA, DOE, and commercial propulsion developers, such as ATK, Aerojet, Pratt & Whitney and others. One specific non-NASA applications for UCDS is the Air Force/Aerojet Hydrocarbon Boost Engine development program.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Pyrolysis processing can be used in near term missions for volume reduction, water recovery (drying), stabilization, and enhanced water and oxygen recovery through thermochemical reactions. For longer term missions, the added benefits include production of fuel, multi-purpose carbon, and reactants for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU). The objective of the Phase I SBIR program was to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating pyrolysis, tar cracking, and oxidation steps into a compact, efficient, system for processing spacecraft solid wastes. This integration, which was based on a microwave pyrolysis/cracking/oxidation unit, has resulted in a significant reduction in energy consumption per gram (~70% when compared to a conventional unit), and an overall reduction in system complexity. These improvements should lead to a lower Equivalent System Mass (ESM) for a full scale system.  Under Phase II, a prototype microwave pyrolysis/tar cracking/oxidation unit will be developed in collaboration with ETM Electromatic, Inc., a leading manufacturer of microwave power systems for commercial, space and military markets.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed work would make it technically feasible to process solid waste streams in space which will benefit long term space travel, such as an extended Lunar stay or a mission to Mars. The proposed approach is beneficial to NASA in allowing for volume reduction, solid waste sterilization and stabilization, and water recovery for near term missions and enhanced water and CO2 production, fuel and multi-purpose carbon production and in-situ resource utilization for longer term missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In the near term, the technology would have applications to solid waste resource recovery problems in remote areas such as underdeveloped countries, oil production platforms, rural areas, farms, submarines, ships, etc. analogous to the uses for NASA technology developed for water purification. In the long term, the technology could be integrated with microturbines or fuel cells and have widespread business or residential use for solid waste removal and power generation. It could also be used by the DOD in military operations.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The objective of the project is the development of an on-board envelope estimation, protection and upset recovery tool to address loss of control incidents in commercial aircraft. Loss of control incidents can be attributed to variety of factors including environmental (icing, clear air turbulence, wakes, etc.), failure of aircraft components (stuck control surfaces, failure of hydraulic systems, broken cables, etc.), human factors (pilot error, insufficient training, crew distraction, etc.) or a combination of any of them. Usually the final catastrophic event is linked to nonlinear phenomenon (like stall) and there is a small time window of opportunity for the pilot (or the flight computer) to recover but the action they take are critical to any such recovery. In Phase I, we have demonstrated how nonlinear equilibrium analysis can be brought to bear upon this problem to understand the dynamic behavior of the aircraft outside of the nominal operating regime. We have also shown using NASA Generic Transport Model (GTM) how such tools may be used to dynamically estimate the operational envelope of the aircraft. In Phase II, we will extend the methodology to design an on-board envelope protection system and study upset recovery schemes. The analytical tools will be supported by the development of commercial grade software for on-board envelope estimation and upset recovery for unimpaired and impaired aircraft. We have already implemented symbolic tools for modeling and analysis, database management, numerical validation and visualization. These tools will be extended, improved and evaluated experimentally. Our goal is to provide verifiable software for commercial aircraft flight safety.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary users of the proposed tools will be commercial aircraft manufacturers where air transport must provide improved capabilities to enhance passenger safety and mission performance, and commercial airline operators where improving safety is increasingly imperative as air passenger miles expand. The proposed research addresses the need to reduce accidents caused by loss-of-control in flight, the leading cause that accounted for 59% of the fatal transport aircraft accidents in the past ten years. The secondary market is the Department of Defense agencies. We expect that the secondary market may be the first adopter of proposed technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposal will directly impact the goals of the Integrated Resilient Aircraft control project and advance the technical goals of NASA's Aviation Safety Program by developing on-board flight envelope investigation for unimpaired and impaired aircraft. In particular, the technology proposed is closely linked to project's goal of "Stability, maneuverability and safe landings in presence of adverse conditions". The proposed technology will go a long way in making not just commercial aircraft safer but it has the potential to improve the understanding of flight dynamics and control including that is required for space shuttle safety.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA operates manned spacecraft according to rigorously-defined standard<BR>operating procedures.  Unfortunately, operating procedures are often written in<BR>different languages. For example, Orion will use automatic procedures written<BR>in SCL, the Spacecraft Command Language, while backup manual procedures may be<BR>developed in PRL, the Procedure Representation Language.  However, procedures<BR>developed in different languages may diverge, so that the backup PRL procedures<BR>do not operate in the same way as the SCL procedures.  This could lead to<BR>unintended effects that may range from simply unexpected to inefficient or even<BR>catastrophic. <BR><BR>We propose to develop the SAFE-P tool, which will use formal model-checking<BR>methods to prove that PRL and SCL procedures have the same underlying execution<BR>semantics.  Our Phase 1 effort validated the effectiveness of our approach;<BR>Phase 2 will completely automate the model checking process and integrate with<BR>the Procedure Integrated Development Environment (PRIDE).  SAFE-P will thus<BR>allow procedure authors to easily compare procedures as they are being<BR>developed.  When differences are found by SAFE-P, they will be highlighted<BR>immediately in the PRIDE interface, allowing the operators to either fix<BR>problems or annotate the respective procedures to explain the differences.<BR>Using SAFE-P, NASA personnel will rapidly and confidently verify that if an<BR>automatic SCL program cannot be executed, a backup manual procedure in PRL will<BR>be equivalent and safe.  Furthermore, as automatic translators are developed to<BR>transform procedures in one language into another NASA-relevant language (e.g.,<BR>Tietronix's current effort to translate PRL into SCL), the SAFE-P tool will<BR>provide a critical validation mechanism to double-check the correctness of the<BR>translation and highlight areas where the translator makes mistakes (or<BR>deliberate approximations that yield different behavior).<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed SAFE-P tool will be applicable to a wide variety of NASA<BR>missions including ISS, Shuttle, and Constellation operations.  For<BR>manned and unmanned spacecraft operations, SAFE-P will bridge a<BR>critical gap in NASA's safety procedures, preventing the possibility<BR>of inadvertent commands that do not conform to standard operating<BR>procedures and that could lead to dangerous or even catastrophic<BR>consequences.<BR><BR>SAFE-P fits directly within NASA's Automation for Operations (A4O)<BR>system concept, helping support significant reductions in operations<BR>costs and increases in operational efficiency while maintaining or<BR>improving system safety.  The SAFE-P tool will be designed to<BR>integrate with NASA's Procedure Integrated Development Environment<BR>(PRIDE), seamlessly supporting efficient development of future<BR>executable procedures and scripts.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Large-scale industrial control systems, in particular oil refineries,<BR>paper mills, and food processing plants, also maintain a large library<BR>of standard operating procedures which have been developed by system<BR>designers and installers.  These must be adapted on a daily basis to<BR>the specific system configuration and product targets for manual or<BR>automatic execution.  The SAFE-P technology will be directly<BR>applicable to ensuring that industrial plants' daily operating plans<BR>and scripts conform to the standard operating procedures.<BR><BR>SAFE-P technology may also be applied when manually-operated<BR>industrial control systems are being transitioned to more automated<BR>control systems, to verify that newly-written executable control<BR>scripts conform to legacy manual (textual) operating procedures.<BR>

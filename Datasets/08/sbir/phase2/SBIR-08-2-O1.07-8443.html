		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Typical communication satellites use traditional waveguide front-end architectures due to the excellent electrical performance and high reliability.  While the systems offer excellent performance and reliability they are large and heavy due to incorporation of waveguide-based switches, diplexers, and waveguide packaged solid-state power amplifiers.  Replacement of the waveguide components by micromachined parts that provide significant size, weight, and cost reduction without substantially affecting the electrical performance, can lead to a breakthrough in wireless communications.  During the Phase I program, Nuvotronics utilized its proprietary PolyStrataTM metal micromachining process to create X and Ka band filters with state-of-the-art performance.  During Phase II, tunable filters will be fabricated using the PolyStrata process and tuned using reliable and low actuation voltage MEMS devices.  The filters will be designed and tested for space operation and have immediate applications in the Deep Space Network communications system.  The PolyStrata process is capable of producing high Q, low weight and therefore compact filters.  The PolyStrata process is a new multi-layer technology that creates high quality air loaded copper microdevices.  High quality cavity resonator filters can be fabricated using this high precision micro-fabrication process, enabling very high Q filters while being compact, surface mountable and compatible with the integration of active chips.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Our primary goal is to provide NASA with robust space-capable technology that is lower cost, lower weight, and has improved performance over current technology.  The initial application is within deep space probes that communicate with the Deep Space Network system in the X and Ka bands.  Future missions require higher bandwidth capability, and as channels in the X band become crowded, NASA requires components at higher bandwidth in the Ka band with reduced size, weight, and power consumption.  Nuvotronics will be capable of offering products to NASA and its subcontractors at the end of the Phase II to satisfy this requirement.  The results of this Phase II will potentially support future on-board satellite communication requirements for NASA and millimeter wave sensing applications for landing and collision avoidance in radars on NASA platforms.  Future missions supported include Juno - a solar powered spacecraft set to launch in 2011 and orbit Jupiter, Constellation -   manned missions to Low Earth Orbit, the moon and ultimately Mars, and future spacecraft and rovers supporting the Mars Exploration Program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential applications for devices enabled by the Polystrata components exist in both DOD and Commercial Markets.  Advanced DOD communication systems under development such as the WIN-T tactical network require advanced microwave components in order to meet the demanding applications of satellite communications while on-the-move.  In addition to communications, devices developed on this program applied to higher frequency operation have applications in DOD radar systems for short range all-weather radars and automotive collision avoidance radar.  Non-defense communications applications exist in higher frequency communications systems (60 GHz, E, Q, and/or W bands) for high speed datacommunications servicing backhaul, wireless enterprise bridge, wireless fiber lateral emulation, government and public safety networks, WirelessHD, and WiMax markets.

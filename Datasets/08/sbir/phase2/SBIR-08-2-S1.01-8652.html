		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose the SBIR Phase II effort to develop and space-qualify  a 1.06 micron high reliability frequency-stabilized CW laser source that fully satisfies the requirements of this SBIR opportunity (Lidar System Components) . Our recommended approach builds on extensive experience developed through numerous spaceflight programs, and using single frequency laser sources in the near infrared, both for aerospace and commercial applications. Our technical approach is based on emerging technology, spawned by the telecom industry that is only now reaching the maturity level where space qualification can be undertaken. NASA requires highly reliable frequency stabilized laser sources for a variety of ongoing and planned missions including LISA and GRACE.  The Phase II program plans to place emphasis on the material selection, design verification and radiation testing to the proposed space laser. The proposed Phase II effort seeks to demonstrate the feasibility to space-qualify a high reliability frequency-stabilized laser source, to advance current space-based laser to TRL 6 level and to present a clear path to build a space-based ultrastable laser source for a 10 year space mission.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is planning space-based sensors, a critical component of which is the high reliability frequency-stabilized CW laser source. These missions include LISA (Laser Interferometric Space Antenna), upgraded GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiments), terrestrial and space-based distributed aperture telescopes, interferometric instruments such as SIM and TFP (Space Interferometer Mission and Terrestrial Planet Finder) and general space-based metrology, where ultrastable wavelength stability is the dominant requirement. These missions require lasers with sub-kHz linewidth at wavelengths from 1.06 to 1.5 micron. Several nearer-term missions also require single-frequency seed or local oscillator lasers with MHz linewidth. These missions include global Doppler winds lidar and coherent sensing of atmospheric constituents including CO2 and water vapor.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA commercial applications may include:  1) telescopes, 2) Injection seeders for pulsed lidar systems. There are currently NO flight qualified lasers available domestically, 3) Long range communication, requiring absolute wavelength stability, 4) Microwave Local Oscillators, 5) Spectrometer Instruments, 6)UAV, Spaceflight and  Manned flight system, 7) Interferometry, 8) Spectroscopy instruments and science requiring an absolute wavelength standard, 9) Dye laser replacement scientific lasers, 10) Injection seed laser with superior absolute wavelength stability, 11) Ground based telescope utilizing adaptive optics.

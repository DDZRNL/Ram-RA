		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		3D Flash LIDAR is ideal for determining real-time spacecraft trajectory, speed, orientation, and range to the planet surface, as well as evaluating potential hazards at the landing site.  The "framing camera" nature, of 3D Flash LIDAR systems, makes them well suited as hazard avoidance sensors for EDL.<BR>	The Phase II effort seeks to improve the range precision of the existing TigerEye<SUP>TM</SUP> 3D Flash LIDAR system, and do so over a much wider signal dynamic range.  A range capability of 1- 10,000 meter is feasible.  This effort will demonstrate the capability by producing an advanced sensor module incorporating newer detectors and other system advancements.  This advanced sensor module will be installed on NASA JPL's 3D Flash LIDAR TigerEye<SUP>TM</SUP> camera system. <BR>	Advanced Scientific Concepts Inc. (ASC) is a small business, which has developed a number of 3D flash LADAR systems.  Flash Ladar sensors are 3D video systems that return range and intensity information for each pixel in real time, and is functionally equivalent to 16000 range finders on one chip.  The TigerEye<SUP>TM</SUP> is 1.2kg, 20 Watts, and 10 cm on a side. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This sensor will increase the success of NASA operations such as:<BR>	Mars Landed Exploration <BR>	Exploration of Moons (ALHAT, Jupiter Icy Moons) <BR>	Asteroid and Comet Rendezvous and Sample Return <BR>	ISS Rendezvous and Docking <BR>	Space Situational Awareness <BR>	Rock Abundance and Distribution Maps <BR>	Topographical Mapping <BR>	Rover Mobility and Navigation <BR>NASA Langley Research Center has procured and flown two of ASC's existing FLVC systems for evaluation of this technology for use on the ALHAT program.  NASA JPL is evaluating the systems for use in Planetary EDL applications.  SpaceX Corporation has flown an ASC system on TS-127, and is preparing a DragonEye for use on a SpaceX launch. <BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		ASC is pursuing many non-NASA applications including:<BR>Automotive collision avoidance, helicopter landing in brown out conditions, mid-air refueling, surveillance, terrain mapping, autonomous navigation for UGVs, USVs and UAVs, smart intersection, ladar brakes, robotics, machine vision, hazard material detection and handling, underwater 3d imaging, sub nanosecond dynamic imaging, 3d sports imaging and data transmission, consumer electronics.<BR>

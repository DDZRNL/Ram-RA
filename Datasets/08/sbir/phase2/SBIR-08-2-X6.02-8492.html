		<BR>
		For this project Superior Graphite Co. (Chicago, IL, USA), the leading worldwide industrial carbon manufacturer and the only large scale battery grade graphitic carbon producer in the USA, will develop, explore the properties of, and demonstrate the enhanced capabilities of novel nanostructured SiLix-C anodes, capable of retaining high capacity at a rapid 2 hour discharge rate and at 0oC when used in Li-ion batteries. By thye end of Phase I we have demonstrated advanced anode materials with the specific capacity in excess of 1000 mAh/g, minimal irreversible capacity losses and stable performance for 20 cycles at C/1. We are confident that by the developing and applying a variety of novel nano-materials technologies, fine-tuning the properties of composite particles at the nanoscale, optimizing the composition of the anodes, and choosing appropriate binder and electrolytes we will be able to revolutionize Li-ion battery technology. In order to achieve such a breakthrough in power characteristics of Li-ion batteries, the team will develop new nanostructured SiLix-C anode materials to offer up to 1200 mAh/g at C/2 at 0oC and a long cycle life with less than 20% fading when cycled for 2000 cycles at C/2 at 0oC

		Advanced Li-ion batteries are state-of-the-art in serving as low-weight, high energy, and high power density energy storage systems. These outstanding features make Li-ion batteries an excellent candidate for numerous spaceflight applications, considering the high costs of transporting objects to orbit. Selected applications are listed below:<BR><BR>1) High capacity anodes for Li-ion battery-based Ascent Module of the Altair Lunar Lander <BR><BR>2) High capacity anodes for Li-ion battery for the Lunar EVA Suit and integrated Portable Life Support Systems<BR><BR>3) High capacity anodes for Li-ion battery for Lunar Surface Systems and Mobility Systems <BR><BR>4)High capacity anodes for Li-ion batteries to be used in Uninterruptable Power Systems (UPS) for ORION space shuttle, International Space Station (ISS) and other spaceflight vehicles

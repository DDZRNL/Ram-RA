		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal is for the development of an innovative compact, high power, and extremely reliable 1.26 micron Ho-doped single frequency fiber laser. The proposed single frequency seeder fiber laser consists of Raman pump laser and single frequency 1.26-micron fiber laser, which will be constructed by using Ho3+-doped fluoride glass fiber. A Raman fiber laser is used as a resonant pump laser source for Ho3+-doped fiber laser.  High gain per unit length at 1.26 micron can be achieved in Ho-doped fluoride glass fiber due to the strong pump absorption and strong emission at 1.2 micron transition.  5 W single frequency 1.26-micron MOPA system with high-speed frequency modulation capability will be developed.   It consists of a 1.26 micron single frequency seeder fiber laser and a 2-stage fiber amplifier.<BR>This type of fiber based seed laser is needed for remote sensing of O  and O -N  for measuring atmospheric pressure.  The single frequency 1.26-micron fiber laser with high-speed frequency modulation capability and electronic control can be used to build coherent laser radar to perform instantaneous measurement.  It offers much higher resolution compared to currently existing Raman fiber laser. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The high power single frequency 1.26-micron fiber laser with high-speed frequency modulation capability is needed for remote sensing of O  and O -N  for measuring atmospheric pressure.  Concurrent on-board O2 measurements using lines at 1.26 ìm to allow for the best relative compensation for aerosol scattering along the line-of-sight of the CO2 and O2 measurements. The particular O2 band was chosen so that the surface and atmospheric scattering characteristics from aerosols and thin clouds would be nearly the same as for the measurement of CO2 at 1.57 ìm.  It's a part of program to provide space-based active measurements of CO2 for Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS) Mission.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are several potential non-NASA commercial applications. The 1.26 micron seed laser can be used for commercial coherent LIDAR, remote sensing for environment monitor, and non-linear frequency conversion.

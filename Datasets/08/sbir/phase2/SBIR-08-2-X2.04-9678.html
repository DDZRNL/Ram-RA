		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The objective of the Phase II SBIR project is to develop a prototype sensor system to detect gaseous analytes in support of the spacecraft environmental monitoring and control system. InnoSense LLC (ISL) has utilized its Chemical Fingerprint§ sensor array fabrication technology in Phase I to establish the feasibility of a miniature device with multi-analyte detection capability.  In particular, we have detected oxygen, carbon dioxide and humidity as potential target analytes. The oxygen sensor performed over 3-45% concentrations under a variable pressure of 8-14.7 psia. The Phase I working model could generated discernible signal with 0.1% O2 concentration. Upon fine-tuning the indicators in Phase II, the system performance will be tested with a prototype hardware that will also be developed in Phase II.  ISL has received technology endorsement letter from a prime contractor in the NASA application area.  ISL has also secured Phase III follow-on funding commitment from a commercialization partner. For assuring success of this project, ISL has assembled a technical team with a cumulative 100 person-years of experience in developing commercially viable sensor systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA vision calls for safe, affordable human missions beyond Earth orbit to Moon, Mars, and through the Solar System. To support the transport of small crewed missions to the moon with capabilities to extend this to outer space, monitoring and controlling of the life-support process needs to be performed by devices having attributes such as: (a) high accuracy and precision, (b) reduced size and weight, (c) long operational life, (d) reliable performance, (e) minimal maintenance requirement, and (f) in-line operational ability. Hazardous trace gases within the space-craft crew habitat pose risks to human health during long duration missions. Therefore, the proposed sensor technology provides NASA with a low-cost, robust, real-time monitoring format for protecting both the crew and spacecraft.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The multi-analyte capabilities of the device make it very attractive for applications ranging from environmental monitoring to process control.  The study by Frost & Sullivan on World Gas Sensors, Detectors and Analyzers Market reveals that these markets earned revenues of over $1 billion in 2005 and estimates this to exceed $1.4 billion in 2012 (Source: Frost and Sullivan Report MC1377591, August 31, 2006). Pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, fermentation monitoring, cell culturing, and tissue culturing represent some important applications. Upon repackaging, the device will have applications in a variety of civilian emergency response and occupational environment monitoring or related research facilities.  Examples include: firefighting, hazardous material response, hazardous material workers, industrial safety workers (e.g., coal miners, steel workers, etc.), and industrial confined space monitoring associated with many occupations (e.g., industrial chemical manufacturing).

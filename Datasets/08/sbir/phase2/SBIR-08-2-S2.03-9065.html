		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Future NASA missions including the Cornell Caltech Atacama Telescope (CCAT) and Global Atmospheric Composition Mission (GACM), require 1 to 4 meter aperture, submillimeter-wavelength, primary reflector (mirror) segments.  Astigmatic surface errors in a composite primary reflector and inconsistent radius of curvature in composite reflector segments limit application of composites to instruments. This project proposes to improve upon state-of-the-art passive reflector surface accuracy by characterizing the behavior and properties of actuated, graphite composite reflector laminates and panels that are suitable for space and earth science instruments.  Surface error in composite primary reflectors and inconsistent radius of curvature in composite reflector segments currently limit application of composites to submillimeter wavelength primary mirrors. The goal is to minimize surface error including ROC error.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The capabilities proposed in this SBIR would be relevant to a variety of Space and Earth science missions currently in various stages of formulation.  The nearest term targets for insertion of the reflector technology are the CCAT and SMLS missions.  Mission study groups at JPL, Cornell, GSFC, and LaRC (LIDAR) are the most likely customers in this area.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Government:	Renewable energy interests have indicated a desire to field an ever growing number of large solar concentrators.  The maturing of the materials, process, and design competencies would position DR Technologies to capture additional work in this area.  Key customers in this area are at the Department of Energy and possibly DoD.<BR>Commercial:	Large, accurate, thermally stable reflectors may be needed for broadband wireless spacecraft. The increasing need to provide internet capabilities to remote locations for commercial applications has lead several service providers and spacecraft manufacturers to consider constellations of spacecraft to meet this need. Lightweight, large-aperture, thermally stable reflectors with micron level tolerances will be needed to meet the ever growing needs for traffic capacity per spacecraft. This program could provide enabling technology for these commercial spacecraft systems.<BR><BR>

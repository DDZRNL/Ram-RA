		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensors have been successfully demonstrated and implemented capabilities to detect and measure wake vortices in and around the terminal area.   Although LIDAR systems have been used to measure wake vortex strength and position in NASA and FAA measurement campaigns and too little is known about their accuracy in quantifying location and strength in different regimes. Field data analysis suggests that strength may be commonly overestimated compared to theoretical models, but no study has been conducted to determine the validity and accuracy of the sensing techniques to determine these estimates.   Additionally, these uncertainties cannot be determined since no other remote sensing system has been verified to accurately measure and characterize the wake vortices.  A risk with no quantitative assessment is that it may negatively impact the separation standards.<BR><BR>Aerospace Innovations, LLC proposes to design and develop a physics-based Monte Carlo LIDAR Simulation and Visualization (LiSiVi) Tool to provide NASA and industry researchers the ability to accurately model the performance of LIDAR based wake vortex sensing systems.  The significance of this innovation is that it combines the advancement of knowledge in the wake vortex modeling research and the laser technology areas.  <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The potential NASA commercial application exists in aeronautics and sensors research.  LIDAR sensors are being considered for remote detection of wake vortices in the National Airspace System both in the terminal area and en route.  NASA Langley researchers could use this tool in their current work in the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate Integrated Intelligent Flight Deck Project to evaluate and assess current and candidate LIDAR systems for their ability to accurately measure wake vortices.  No simulation tool is commercially available to provide the comprehensive modeling and analysis capabilities that LIDAR Simulation and Visualization Tool will be able to provide.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		As laser technology advances, companies interested in developing LIDAR sensors for wake vortex, turbulence, and other atmospheric phenomena could use LiSiVi Tool to help conduct parametric studies for the design of their LIDAR sensor system. The application of this simulation extends beyond wake vortex detection and measurement to other atmospheric phenomena.  The simulation will be designed to incorporate measurement other atmospheric targets such as winds, turbulent kinetic energy, turbulence, and clouds.  Commercial application of LiSiVi exists and will be considered in the definition of the requirements for the design.

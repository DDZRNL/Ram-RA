		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed project will develop and deliver a software system that integrates tools required for a complete analysis of loss-of-control incidents. The system will include a graphical user interface that provides easy access to symbolic and numerical computing tools that support aircraft modeling, nonlinear dynamic analysis and control analysis; sophisticated data base management; and visualization. We also propose and will implement an innovative methodology and associated computer tools for analysis and control synthesis in the context of upset prevention and recovery for unimpaired and impaired aircraft. Our approach will address: aerodynamic modeling of aircraft operating outside of the normal flight envelope, multi-mode operation of aircraft, automated assembly of analytical and simulation models  including real time models, analytical methods and tools for identifying conditions for departure from controlled flight and identification of 'safe' operating states, and analytical methods and tools for identifying the set of recoverable states and associated recovery strategies. The goal is to provide easy to use, verifiable design software to improve commercial flight safety.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposal will significantly advance NASA's Aviation Safety Programs technical goals of developing on-board flight envelope investigation for unimpaired and impaired aircraft alike. In particular, the technology proposed is closely linked to Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control project's goal of "Stability, maneuverability and safe landings in presence of adverse conditions". The proposed technology will go a long way in making not just commercial aircraft safer but it has the potential to improve the understanding of flight dynamics and control including that required for space shuttle safety. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary users of the proposed tools will be commercial aircraft manufacturers where air transport must provide improved capabilities to enhance passenger safety and mission performance, and commercial airline operators and manufactures where improving safety is an increasing imperative as air passenger miles expand. The secondary market is the Department of Defense agencies. We expect that the secondary market may be the first adopter of proposed technology. The proposed research addresses the need to reduce accidents caused by loss-of-control in flight, the leading cause that accounted for 59% of the fatal transport aircraft accidents in the past ten years.

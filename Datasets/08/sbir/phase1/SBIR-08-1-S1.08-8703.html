		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this SBIR Phase I effort, Los Gatos Research (LGR) proposes to develop a highly-accurate, lightweight, low-power gas analyzer for quantification of water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4) aboard miniature unmanned aerial vehicles (mini-UAVs).  This analyzer, which will exploit LGR's patented Off-Axis ICOS technology, will be the first sensor capable of meeting the stringent weight, power, and environmental requirements for miniature UAV deployments.  Such deployments are critically important to NASA's Earth Science Division, because they enable more efficient and cost effective Earth observation measurements.  These measurements complement current satellite observations by providing higher horizontal resolution and vertical profiling, enabling better quantification of carbon sources and sinks.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA Earth Science Division is primarily concerned with studying how the global environment is changing and how such changes effect human civilization.  The majority of these observations involve using satellite data to make measurements of key atmospheric species on the planetary scale.  In order to verify and complement this data with better accuracy, temporal resolution, and spatial profiles, NASA seeks to develop innovative in situ sensors for these important gases.  Moreover, in an effort to make such deployments more numerous, efficient, and cost-effective, these analyzers need to be highly-accurate and deployable on miniature unmanned aerial vehicles (mini-UAVs) and other small aircraft.  The objective of this SBIR program is to develop and deliver a atmospheric gas analyzer that is suitable for such platforms.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Besides its application to NASA, a compact, ultrasensitive gas analyzer also has significant commercial application.  Through a series of strategic partnerships, LGR is developing a suite of analytical sensors to measure trace gases for industrial process control monitoring and petrochemical applications.  The proposed work is essential in making these instruments more compact, rugged, and cost competitive, and will thus enlarge the potential market size significantly.

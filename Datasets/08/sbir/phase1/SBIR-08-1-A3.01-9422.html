		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Innovation Laboratory, Inc. builds a control system which controls the topology of an air traffic flow network and the network flow properties which enables Air Traffic Management (ATM) to adapt to hazardous weather constraints and provide high capacity flows in the National Airspace System (NAS). The Network Flow Organizer automatically adjusts the flows of air traffic with respect to weather hazards and Special Use Airspace (SUA) constraints and allows for parallel flows along the network (a 2-times (2x) to 3-times (3x) increase in today's flow rates) without conflicts at intersection points.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		For NASA, the proposed software product offers a R&D capability that enables NASA researchers to investigate future NextGen concepts.  Used in conjunction with a NAS-wide simulator like FACET or ACES, our software can be used to study Dynamic Airsapce Configuration (DAC) and Traffic Flow Management (TFM) NextGen concepts.  DAC adjustments in the NAS can potentially maximize capacity in highly constrained hazardous weather regions given our recommended network flow design that is adaptable to moving weather constraints and provides high capacity parallel flows of traffic where needed. In the process of dynamically defining airspace regions for controllers, the Network Flow Organizer can establish the tube network that handles the majority of traffic in the NAS.  TFM researchers will want to study the efficiency of a tube network in delivering safe and efficient travel for the largest city pair markets in the NAS.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed software has application to military systems as well.  In wartime, the constraints are very dynamic and automated airspace usage planning is required to support the pilot and the mission.  The airspace may be constrained by weather, but also by hostile threats, both moving and stationary.  With minor modifications, our solution approach for estimating the avenues of approach and for estimates of total troop movement flow rates.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced Scientific Concepts Inc. (ASC) is a small business, which has developed a number of 3D flash LADAR systems.  Flash Ladar sensors are 3D video systems that return range and intensity information for each pixel in real time, and is functionally equivalent to 16000 range finders on one chip.  Actual data collected, at the JPL mars yard, using ASC's compact Flash Ladar system demonstrated in a previous NASA phase I SBIR effort confirm that the ASC Flash LADAR Video Camera (FLVC) system can meet the requirements for Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL).   The FLVC's small size, low power and very fast range data frame rate (30Hz) make the sensor ideal for EDL missions. <BR>	Flash Ladar is ideal for determining real-time spacecraft trajectory, speed, orientation, and range to the planet surface, as well as evaluating potential hazards at the landing site.  Sloped ground, craters, rocks and surface composition are among the potential hazards.  The "framing camera" nature, of Flash LADAR systems, makes them well suited as hazard avoidance sensors for EDL.  <BR>	An existing Phase two effort is fabricating a compact FLVC for delivery to NASA for field testing, however the system is not hardened.  A proposed Phase 2 effort would produce a space qualified sensor engine which can be integrated with the system being delivered to NASA.  The sensor engine is the break-though enabling technology for the FLVC.  This proposed effort will develop techniques to improve the sensors measurement accuracy.  ASC will develop improved calibration techniques, improved sensor non-uniformity and improved on-board real time automatic range correction.  This will target range resolutions of better than 1cm and range absolute accuracy better than 3cm.  The Phase 2 effort would deliver to NASA a commercial based system with the enhancements developed during Phase 1<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This sensor will increase the success of NASA operations such as:<BR>	Mars Landed Exploration <BR>	Exploration of Moons (ALHAT, Jupiter Icy Moons) <BR>	Asteroid and Comet Rendezvous and Sample Return <BR>	ISS Rendezvous and Docking <BR>	Space Situational Awareness <BR>	Rock Abundance and Distribution Maps <BR>	Topographical Mapping <BR>	Rover Mobility and Navigation <BR>NASA Langley Research Center has purchased two of ASC's existing FLVC systems for performing laboratory, field, and airborne test and evaluation of this technology for use on the ALHAT program.  On system has been deployed for EDL helicopter experiments and has shown excellent results.   ASC has developed unit cells that show 10x increase in detection threshold sensitivity (which implies 10X lower laser power requirements for a given return signal to noise ratio).  <BR>

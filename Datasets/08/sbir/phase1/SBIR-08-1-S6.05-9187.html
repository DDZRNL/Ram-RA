		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to investigate the feasibility and value of the "Software as<BR>a Service" paradigm in facilitating access to Earth Science numerical<BR>models. We envision providing prototype Web-based access to NASA<BR>scientific models (GEOS-5, WRF) and their results, via industry-standard<BR>service interfaces (OGC's Web Coverage Service, Web Map Service,<BR>OPeNDAP) implemented by open-source software tools such as MapServer and<BR>THREDDS. These services would allow declarative access to pre-computed<BR>model outputs, on-demand (asynchronous or synchronous) model runs, and<BR>user-customizable model workflows. These services would use the MAP<BR>Mobile Environment Workflow tool and associated templates to encapsulate<BR>details of the model software and the computing environment in which it<BR>runs.<BR><BR>Providing these modeling capabilities as a service, through<BR>well-defined, widely-supported Web interfaces, would facilitate<BR>loosely-coupled collaborative work among different computing facilities<BR>and different disciplines; and it would broaden access to modeling<BR>beyond those already "in the know" or qualified to login to a NASA<BR>computing resource. We will conduct the study in stages, beginning with<BR>Web access to pre-stored model results, followed by on-demand model runs<BR>and culminating in service-based workflow customization.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This project aims to provide standard Web service interfaces to NASA's<BR>Earth Science models, for use by fellow scientists, decision-makers, and<BR>many others. By opening access to its model and computing resources,<BR>NASA meets its obligations to serve broader interests (including<BR>academic and other agency partners), and grows the number of users and<BR>uses of NASA models, thus enhancing the impact and value of these<BR>models, and strengthening continued support for high-end computing and<BR>modeling. By facilitating access to numerical models through standard,<BR>well-known services, NASA also provides a fertile environment in which<BR>many different entities [rather than a handful of people "in the know"]<BR>can compete to develop software tools for validation, further analysis,<BR>or societal applications. Standard Web interfaces give commercial<BR>entities "a leg up," decreasing the time they require to build<BR>applications that use models and their outputs. And broader competition,<BR>within a standards-based "level playing field," is likely to increase<BR>the diversity and quality of software choices available to NASA for use<BR>with its models.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA Earth system models and modeling infrastructure were designed to<BR>meet specific needs of modelers, and to support fairly esoteric<BR>scientific interests. However, easier access to these models may make<BR>them usable outside of the traditional NASA earth science community, in<BR>"what if" scenarios and forecasts supporting operational and policy<BR>decisions on various time scales. This is likely to attract new users<BR>and uses of NASA models and model outputs, in such diverse fields as<BR>aviation, weather and climate, agriculture, environmental and ecosystem<BR>management, energy / utility industries, real estate, and many others<BR>that could benefit from improved access to predictive modeling for<BR>decision-making, planning, and management. Much as the wide availability<BR>of satellite data in the 1980s, and of digital Census data in the 1990s,<BR>spawned a market for repackaging, customizing, and mining public data<BR>for use in a variety of settings, easier and broader model access is<BR>likely to grow the market for targeted software applications that can<BR>harness these models for myriad practical applications.<BR>

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

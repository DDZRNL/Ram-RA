		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		By drastically reducing the physical footprint of a mass spectrometer to the size of a beverage can, Ceramitron could set a new performance/price standard in the miniaturized MS market.  To do this, we propose eliminating the turbomolecular and roughing pumps in favor two chemical sorption pumps (a non-evaporable getter (NEG) and an ion pump), both integrated into the spectrometer's self-contained vacuum enclosure.  <BR><BR>Ceramitron's patented double-focusing 90<SUP>o</SUP> magnetic-sector unit comprises three printed circuit boards, sandwiched together to form a vacuum-tight enclosure containing a dual-filament EI source, ion slits, a photo- lithographically-deposited energy analyzer, lenses and I/O pins, continuous-dynode electron multiplier and the sorption pumps.<BR><BR>Target parameters: 200 daltons mass range, 200 resolving power, 5x10-5 Amps/Torr sensitivity, <2kg total weight, <10 watts power consumption.  <BR><BR>Sample pressure through a pulsed-gas inlet, with flow restrictor, is ~1E-5 Torr.  Internal pumps maintain ~1E-6 Torr with no in-flow.  Units will be optimized for harsh operating environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A lightweight, low-cost universal chemical/gas analyzer based on Ceramitron's novel MS sensor technology deployed in unmanned aerial, surface and underwater platforms could significantly enhance NASA's Earth Science research capabilities.  With a mass range of 200 daltons, Ceramitron's MS microsensor can characterize complex gas mixtures and may be especially useful for spatial/temporal mapping of the atmosphere by detecting greenhouse gases, industrial chemicals and aerosols that impact climate and weather conditions.  
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to target applications in NASA's Earth science research, a successful Phase II implementation could address a host of commercial, military and medical applications for such a universal, multigas sensor of essentially the same design.  These include early fire detection in public buildings, battlefield standoff detectors, breath analyzers, chemical process control and monitoring, atmospheric GHG characterization, and others.

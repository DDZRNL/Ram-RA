		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address the NASA/ARC need for wireless networking technologies for small launch vehicles, Broadata Communications, Inc. proposes to develop a new Small Space Platform Internet Protocol (SSP-IP) Stack with Space-Enhanced TCP and devices to achieve high performance networking, despite typical space link problems and footprint constraints. BCI's approach incorporates advanced Space IP network measurements and their application in small embeddedable TCP. Our SSP-IP stack offers Internet-based protocols that provide seamless network command and control continuity between terrestrial and space-based platforms as well as networked operations of distributed ground stations. NASA will benefit from our SSP-IP by increasing simplicity of seamless network transmission and lowering cost. In Phase I BCI will demonstrate the feasibility of using SSP TCP to reliably transmit space imagery from a Nanosat launching vehicle by building, testing and integrating with hardware a preliminary version, which will demonstrate a TRL-level 3 by the end of Phase I. In Phase II, BCI plans to develop a fully functional prototype and demonstrate the low complexity and embeddability to NASA's platform with high performance. The demonstrated results will offer NASA capabilities to use our reliable SSP TCP in future ground and spacecraft operations, increasing efficiency and saving money.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are many potential NASA applications for BCI's SSP IP & TCP. As an enabler of Space Internet and TCP-based reliable communications for a NanoSat Launch Vehicle and for other small satellite launching vehicles and resource- and footprint-constrained space networked spacecrafts, the SSP IP & TCP can greatly improve communications for small spacecraft. It increases flexibility, decreases cost, and provides continuity between Earth and space networks. Our technology can be also applied for the International Space Station or the Moon and Mars Initiative. It will help astronauts, increasing their efficiency and success through seamless communications. The SSP IP stack will also provide sensor or embedded devices with IP capabilities, allowing NASA to offer the emerging products to private enterprise. Our SSP IP & TCP will not only save money, but it will also make space travel more effective and efficient.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The SSP IP & TCP is also directly applicable to commercial network applications that can benefit from wireless enhanced TCP performance, especially in devices that are resource constrained. Major private markets include cell phones and wireless packet networks for public IP access. Potential applications include wireless Internet access networks, performance management of wireless technology, and commercial sensor applications. The SSP IP & TCP is also applicable to the ubiquitous Bluetooth, including Scatternets. These are large Bluetooth networks with applications in sensor networks and other multi-hop, ad-hoc scenarios. The marketing possibilities for commercial opportunities of the SSP IP & TCP in the private sector seem infinite.

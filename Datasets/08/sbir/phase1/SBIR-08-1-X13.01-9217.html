		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		QEL proposes to construct a tissue equivalent microdosimeter using a solid state tissue equivalent detector (SSTED).  The Phase I study will produce the working SSTEDs and the Phase II will provide a viable completed microdosimeter.<BR><BR>An organic semiconductor device based on QEL's novel design is described.  The expected electrical properties of the device both in the quiescent state and under exposure are calculated.  The fabrication process is described in detail and the supporting electronics are defined as well.<BR><BR>A complete set of tests that will determine the feasibilty of the SSTEDs is defined.  The first test will determine if the detectors' response matches the expected response based on detector geometry.  The subsequent tests will determine the sensitivity, calibration factors, and tissues equivalence of the fabricated devices.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Phase II deliverable will be a solid state tissue equivalent microdosimeter.  The primary application for these types of devices is the measurement of human exposure to ionizing radiation.  There are a number of NASA applications where humans may be exposed to such radiation including, but not limited to: space flight, high altitude aviation, and space station visits.  In all of these cases a simple, small solid state monitoring device would be ideal.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are many occupations where humans are potentially exposed to ionizing radiation.  The industries where workers may be exposed include but are not limited to: nuclear medicine, radiology, radiation-therapy, weapons production, nuclear power production, mining, high energy and synchrotron radiation experiments/applications, and air transporation.  In all of these industries, a simple solid state tissue equivalent detector could play an important role in the radiation safety procedures.<BR><BR>In addition radiation monitoring is commonly required for medical patients undergoing a variety of procedures.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has expressed a requirement for advanced Smart Sensors to support new systems for harsh environments.  Power systems are an integral component of virtually any electronic or electromechanical system and thus are an excellent application for non-intrusive power system state-of-health and IVHM-enabled sensing.  Ridgetop will provide a non-intrusive, eigenvalue-based,  IEEE P1451-compatible, power system health sensor.  The sensor connects to the power source, as a "black box", by means of a current pickup loop, and load changes produce a characteristic response that contains the intrinsic eigenvalues.  Variations in the eigenvalues from nominal are correlated with internal component degradation or aging, and reveal the overall state-of-health of the power supply.  By P1451 enabling the Smart Sensor, interfacing to Integrated Vehicle Health Monitoring (IVHM) systems is fully supported and adoption of this technology will be much more rapid.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Virtually any spacecraft system, including the Constellation family, have power systems that are complex and conditioned through switch-mode converters. In addition, more actuator applications employ Electromechanical Actuators (EMAs) which have power converters such as H-Bridge stages. These power systems are critical to the proper functioning of the larger systems and overall mission success.   The ability to utilize a Smart Sensor to assess the state-of-health is a very powerful tool for diagnostics, and the remaining useful life (RUL) prognostics stemming from this sensor are useful when linked to NASA's IVHM systems.  By having accurate and timely indications of power systems' integrity, mitigation of faults and load shedding schemes can be supported.  This capability, in turn, can help assure NASA's mission success.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Ridgetop has found significant interest in this technology from the DoD and commercial automotive firms in wide-ranging applications of power system prognostics. The specific opportunities include weapons systems such as the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), the Army's Future Combat System (FCS) and the new Virginia Class Submarine.  Within the commercial sector, the automotive firms are including increasing levels of power electronics within the vehicle that would benefit from improved visibility of performance.  The applications include hybrid vehicles that reduce our dependence on foreign oil.

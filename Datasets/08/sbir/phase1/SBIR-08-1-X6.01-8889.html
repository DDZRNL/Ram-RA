		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Thermacore Inc. proposes an innovative titanium heat pipe thermal plane for passive thermal control of individual cells within a fuel cell stack. The proposed technology eliminates actively pumped liquid coolant loops, which improves system efficiency, reliability, safety, simplicity, life cycle as well as saves weight and volume.  Although the main purpose for this technology is thermal management of fuel cells for space applications, the same technology can be applied for electronics cooling: heat spreaders and heat sinks, where thin design is required.  The proposed titanium heat pipe thermal plane will be reliable passive heat transfer device with the following parameters:<BR>bulk density: 			under 3 grams per cubic centimeter,<BR>thickness:			less than 0.050 inches,<BR>effective thermal conductivity:	in excess of 2,000 W/(m K),<BR>electrical resistivity:		less than 0.2 ohms-cm,<BR>operation against gravity:	4 inches<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The targeted area for the proposed titanium heat pipe thermal plane application is thermal management of advanced primary fuel cell and regenerative fuel cell energy storage systems.  Other areas where the proposed titanium heat pipe thermal plane can be utilized are:<BR>-	on-board electronics cooling,<BR>-	heat spreading for in-flight sprain/strain therapeutic treatment devices,<BR>-	isothermal enclosures.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are many potential non-NASA applications for the proposed titanium heat pipe thermal plane.  Among them: <BR>-	thermal management of fuel cells for automotive industry,<BR>-	DARPA Thermal Ground Plane program,<BR>-	High Energy Laser (HEL) cooling,<BR>-	Avionics cooling,<BR>-	1-U server cooling,<BR>-	Blade server cooling,<BR>-	medical equipment thermal control,<BR>-	thermal control of the phase-change energy storage units<BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		While conventional injection seeding sources (such as DFB diode lasers and rare-earth doped solid-state microchip lasers) are available at 1.5 microns, these sources typically lack the ultra-narrow (<50 kHz), ultra-stable output spectrum required for use in applications such as Doppler shift measurements of the tropospheric winds.  Furthermore, similar sources which operate at 2.0 microns (a preferred wavelength for space-based atmospheric measurements) are simply unavailable.  To fill this need, nLight proposes the parallel development of 1.5 and 2.0 micron injection seeding sources based on our well-established, wavelength-scalable, industry-leading InP semiconductor laser design.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA commercial applications include:<BR>1.  Ultra-narrow linewidth LIDAR injection-seeding sources for Doppler shift measurements of the tropospheric winds.<BR>2.  Narrow-linewidth eyesafe pump sources for 3D LIDAR imaging for autonomous precision landing including hazard detection and avoidance<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential Non-NASA commercial applications include narrow-linewidth eyesafe pump sources for:<BR>1.  Military  Infrared countermeasures, eyesafe rangefinders, eysafe 3D LIDAR imaging for surveillance, and unmanned autonomous ground and airborne vehicles<BR>2.  Medical  Tissue bonding, dentistry<BR>

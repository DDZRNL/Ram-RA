		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Wake vortices are a critical constraint to aircraft separation and therefore airportal throughput, which is already at or near capacity at many major airports in the NAS.  Improvements to current methods of spacing aircraft could significantly increase airportal capacity, but there is currently limited awareness of wake encounters and information with which to assess spacing in real-time or to design new spacing schemes.  AeroTech proposes to improve situational awareness of wake vortices and enhance the prediction of wake vortex transport and decay by developing an In Situ Wake Vortex Encounter Detection and Reporting System (VEDARS).  The VEDARS will quantitatively detect wake encounters using flight data; downlink encounter reports in real-time to enhance ATC awareness and enable assessment of spacing schemes; and collect and report meteorological parameters from aircraft for use in wake transport and decay predictions.  Additionally, the VEDARS software can process historical flight data to identify prior wake encounters and assess spacing for a given weather day at an airportal.  Phase I will develop and test the VEDARS methodology and algorithms, and perform a feasibility assessment.  By the end of Phase II, the VEDARS will have been both ground and flight tested, and will be enhancing wake awareness.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		When the goals of the proposed R/R&D are met, the In Situ Wake Vortex Encounter Detection and Reporting System (VEDARS) will directly support NASA's NextGen-Airportal project goal to realize an airportal environment that will achieve the highest possible throughput and operational efficiency, while balancing safety and environmental requirements.  VEDARS will support the Safe and Efficient Surface Operations and Coordinated Arrival and Departure Operations Management (CADOM) focus areas by enhancing researchers' awareness of wake encounters; supporting the assessment and optimization of aircraft separation schemes; providing data that assists in the characterization of wake transport and decay; and providing a capability for simulations that can be used to assess airportal operations and procedures within various weather conditions and airfield layouts.  The VEDARS will also support NASA's research efforts under the JPDO in NextGen Super Density Arrival/Departure Operations and Trajectory-Based Operations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		AeroTech's In Situ Wake Vortex Encounter Detection and Reporting System (VEDARS) will provide benefits to both research efforts and real-time situational awareness of wake vortices.  The VEDARS will enable the FAA Wake Vortex Program and other commercial researchers to assess historical spacing schemes through identification of wake encounters from historical flight data, and develop new techniques for various airfield configurations.  Real-time implementation of the VEDARS on aircraft and within wake vortex spacing systems will enhance controller's awareness of wake encounters and their decision making regarding the current separation distances.  Additionally, the meteorological information provided can be incorporated into wake transport and decay predictions to assess real-time safety issues for parallel runway operations.  Finally, data from the VEDARS can be used by commercial organizations to develop and validate the performance of wake vortex detection systems.

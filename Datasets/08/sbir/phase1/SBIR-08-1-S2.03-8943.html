		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Precision deployable 50 meter-class occulter elements are an enabling technology for a promising new class of space-based observotory for exoplatentary study. The New Worlds Observer mission currently under development is a prime example of such an application. The development of a reliable deployment architecture which provides an occulter with 10,000:1 dimensional stability is required to reduce the risk of this mission to an acceptable level. SpaceDev proposes the development of an occulter deployment system based on their Jackscrew boom technology. A "hybrid" hoop and petal deployment architecture which leverages the reliability and structural efficiency of the Jackscrew system offers a promising solution to this challenge. The proposed effort  would:<BR><BR> 1. Determine the feasibility of a proposed Jackscrew boom hoop system which meets the packaging, deployment and deployed performance requirements for the New Worlds Observer mission. <BR> 2. Develop integrated petal deployment and support architectures which leverage the structural support and deployment actuation offered by the proposed hoop system.<BR> 3. Develop dimensional stability analyses of the integrated occulter system in the flight environment to establish critical design margins.<BR> 4. Develop a thorough plan for a subsequent Phase 2 program to build a scale model of the integrated occulter system and demonstrate key functional features in collaboration with the New Worlds Observer team. <BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed Jackscrew hoop structure and integrated occulter system is directly motivated by, and applicable to, NASA's Origins science objectives. The deployable occulter for the New Worlds Observer mission is a critical element of this candidate Flagship mission. Successful development of a reliable and high performance occulter system would substantially reduce the risk of the overall mission. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Jackscrew hoop architecture has been identified as a promising element of other spacecraft payloads including RF antenna reflectors and solar concentrators for large scale power generation. The design knowledge developed in the proposed Phase 1 effort would increase SpaceDev's ability to pursue these commercial opportunities.

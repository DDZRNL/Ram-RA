		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		he objective of this proposal is to research, design and develop an automated real-time targeting and guidance (ARTGUID) software for precision lunar landing and descent. The software tool will be reliable, extensible, scalable and verifiable based on the complex mission-driven requirements on the Altair Lunar Lander and other landers for NASA's future exploration missions. It will provide an integrated real-time targeting, guidance, navigation and control (TGNC) capability to perform autonomous vehicle-centered operations to accomplish mission objectives. The algorithms provide a fuel-optimal powered descent and precision landing at any desirable site on the Moon. The method of technical approach is based on the revalidation, operational assessment and qualitative improvement of all Apollo-era programs. The real-time targeting and guidance operations are performed on all phases of the descent trajectory by employing exact closed-form solutions for constant thrust arcs on braking phase.  Development of the real-time TGNC capability represents an innovative approach in advancing the state-of-the-art autonomous landing GNC technology. The preliminary development of the advanced targeting algorithms has demonstrated the reliability, functionality and likelihood of success of the proposed software by re-constructing the Apollo 11 and 12 post-flight lunar-descent trajectories and guidance performances.

		<BR>
		The proposed design of the high-fidelity automated real-time targeting and guidance software and the resulting capabilities for the landing missions to the Moon will contribute<BR><BR>- to the NASA human space exploration by extending and enhancing the existing capabilities of autonomous spacecraft, and by providing precision landing on any celestial body, including automatic re-designation of landing site, terrain mapping from high altitudes, terrain and hazard relative navigation, topographic data analysis, etc.;<BR><BR>- to the progress in the NASA Lunar return program as it is a new real-time targeting and guidance (TGNC) system, which provides precision landing and extends the capabilities of the hazard avoidance technology (ALHAT) applicable to the Moon.<BR><BR>The proposed investigation of constant thrust solutions and high-fidelity software development on real-time targeting and guidance would enrich the NASA science environment. <BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		It is known that the high-fidelity automated real-time targeting and guidance software and the resulting capabilities of TGNC for the landing missions to the Moon and other celestial gravitational bodies are under active development at the research centers of the European Space Agency and other commercial organizations associated with space exploration and related business. In the commercial market of software and advanced technologies, such as state-of-the-art autonomous guidance technology or real-time targeting technology, Emergent will be able to provide engineering analysis and architecture design services to spacecraft manufacturers and service organizations in the development of TGNC and related software.  In addition, Emergent will be able to sell documentation, consulting, and software maintenance and development services to users of the proposed software.

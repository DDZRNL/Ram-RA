		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The early lunar network communications involves the use of a variety of communication channels and networks such as IEEE 802.16, Ka-Band and S-Band satellite data-links. The sophisticated environment casts a major challenge to provide a reliable network communications supporting the performance of lunar missions. In addition, the delivery of a higher Quality of Service (QoS) is not only stifled by the network segmentation but also greatly influenced by the potential data-link disruption. AGNC proposes the Reconfigurable Robust Routing for Mobile Outreach Network (R3MOON) implemented on its existing Service Oriented P2P Middleware. By adopting effective cross-layered network management strategies and routing algorithms in the underlying middleware, R3MOON greatly mitigates many network concerns and transforms the lunar communications from the maintenance of lower level data-link to the performance of higher level applications.<BR>Phase I is devoted to the R3MOON design validation and early prototype. Phase II will result in development of a fully functional prototype.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Reconfigurable Robust Routing for Mobile Outreach Network will directly support NASA's early phase lunar network communications requirements. The proposed technology is not only available to support the lunar surface activities but is also viable for NASA's future planetary exploration activities where the presence of the mobile ad-hoc network is required.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed R3MOON technology can be accommodated for many mobile applications occurred not just in space application but also on a variety of MANET application where an infrastructure network is not practical. The use of data storage buffer to reconcile the link disruption allows R3MOON to be further migrated to wider military and civilian markets. For example, the Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is expected to carry a major commercial opportunity in the near future. Accompanying the middleware supported multimedia subscription service, an exponential growth on the content delivery for vehicle oriented market demands can be easily fulfilled by the proposed technology.

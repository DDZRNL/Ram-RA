		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Focusing on a reduced-dimension problem of a hypersonic orbital/lunar reentry capsule, an algorithm will be built which combines the stochastic Monte Carlo method for treatment of radiation transport in optically thin to moderate domains, with a single-term modified differential approximation (MP1) for use in optically thick domains.  This numerical method will be verified against a known benchmark case before application to the reentry problem.  The bandwise and cumulative distribution function (CDF) methods will be combined within the Monte Carlo framework, creating an efficient, dual-hybrid radiation transport algorithm.  A detailed plan for the generation of the full algorithm will be developed, with a focus on parallelization and compatibility with existing commercial transport software.  This plan will include thorough testing and validation stages.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed work offers a means to efficiently calculate thermal radiation transport in a broad range of NASA and defense technologies.  Specifically, the program can be applied for accurate, efficient prediction of radiant heat transfer during manned spacecraft launch and reentry, as well as solar energy utilization and solar flux predictions for ground and space-based instrumentation or habitats.  The proposed algorithm would be coupled to existing NASA CFD/thermal simulation codes for source term application in the energy equation.  Compatibility and parallelization will exploit NASA's existing software and hardware resources, providing a powerful radiation transport capability.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The combined stochastic and diffusion-based algorithm will be modularly compatible with existing commercial codes, allowing wide access to accurate thermal radiation predictions within research, academic, and design communities.  Other defense applications include thermal radiation characterization from rocket nozzles/plumes, combustion chambers, and nuclear explosions.  Commercial space launch organizations will have access to state-of-the-art thermal calculation capability, as well as design firms supporting the nascent space tourism industry.  Ground-based applications for efficient radiation transport predictions are numerous, and include metal forming, lithography, curing, and many other high-temperature manufacturing processes.

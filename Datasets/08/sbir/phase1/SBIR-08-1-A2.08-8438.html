		<BR>
		M4 Engineering proposes to implement physics-based, multidisciplinary analysis and optimization objects that will be integrated into a Python, open-source framework and used in a wide variety of simulations.  The integrated objects will perform discipline-specific analysis across multiple flight regimes at varying levels of fidelity.  The process will also deliver system-level, multi-objective optimization.  Addressing physics-based, system-level objectives that span more than one discipline will have profound effects on improving decision-making abilities during the conceptual design phase when evaluating advanced technological concepts.  In the proposed effort, existing capabilities will be leveraged to create a high fidelity, physics based, multidisciplinary analysis and optimization (MDAO) system.  This proposed work will compliment M4 Engineering's expertise in developing modeling and simulation toolsets that solve relevant subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic demonstration applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The goal of this SBIR project is to tie directly into the current efforts coming from the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD).  Specifically, NASA Glenn Research Center has a long-term goal (ALPHA) of developing an open-source Python framework by 2012.   Integrating existing discipline-specific and common object modules into GRC's framework gives users a baseline set of modules available for immediate use in constructing and solving MDAO problems.  This open-source framework with ready-to-use objects will help create an unbounded development platform that establishes commonality (Python language) without restrictions (open-source) and allows versatility as modules and objects are available for use as required per configuration. <BR><BR>It is also expected that this technology will be directly applicable to the research projects planned in the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD).  The multidisciplinary nature of the technology makes it an ideal candidate for use any time a very high performance vehicle is designed, where interactions between components and disciplines is important.  Examples include future high efficiency subsonic aircraft, quiet supersonic aircraft, high-altitude, long-endurance aircraft, hypersonic aircraft, and next-generation launch vehicles (either airbreathing or rocket powered).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		M4 Engineering has discovered that developing the technology components and integrated MDAO processes such as those proposed in this Phase I has significant impact in our capturing related commercial work.  Getting M4 modules into NASA's open-source framework increases the commercialization potential for those M4 modules and other associated M4 products.  The applications developed in Phase I and transitioning to Phases II and III will not only serve as demonstrations of M4's capability, but will also provide exposure of the technology to the technical leadership of future development efforts, giving excellent chances of technology transition to these programs.<BR><BR>M4 Engineering is participating in the NASA Glenn Transition Assistance Program.  Through this program, M4 Engineering is increasing its potential to infuse its technology into the marketplace by learning how to transition projects to Phase III awards.  The modules implemented in this proposal will be candidates for moving from Technology Research and Development to Technology Development and Demonstration and then on to System Development.  Commercial Products, Services, and Systems are derived from projects, which reach the System Development stage.  M4 is receiving the background and training to satisfy NASA's objective of moving SBIR funded R&D towards products available to NASA and the free market.

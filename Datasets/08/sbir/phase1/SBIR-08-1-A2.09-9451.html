		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Reduction of noise is critical to the public acceptance and mission suitability of rotorcraft.  Accurate prediction of rotorcraft noise is directly related to the ability to predict the highly complicated interaction between the aerodynamic surfaces and their wakes, and while current numerical tools can, in principle, model the complete rotorcraft, they are severely hampered by modeling assumptions or numerical formulation.  Consequently, commonly used tools fail to adequately predict the load distribution, and hence noise, of arbitrarily shaped rotors and fuselages.  The proposed effort directly supports NASA's mission of assisting the development of advanced rotorcraft by developing an innovative physics-based multidisciplinary tool for predicting rotorcraft aeroacoustics.  This tool, consisting of a fully coupled FUN3D CFD code, VorTran-M module and acoustic propagation model, will be able to address interactional aeroacoustics problems unique to rotorcraft, capturing rotor-fuselage interactions that lead to both structural vibration and undesirable interactional acoustics.  This effort will build upon recent work addressing critical issues such as numerical diffusion, grid generation, turbulence modeling and rotorcraft noise prediction and reduction at CDI, GIT and elsewhere.  The hybrid code will achieve TRL=4 during Phase I and TRL=7-8 by the end of Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed effort directly supports NASA's Subsonic Rotary Wing Fundamental Aeronautics Program goals by leveraging emerging research into first-principles multidisciplinary technologies for simulating advanced rotorcraft configurations.  This system will incorporate validated NASA design and analysis tools with CDI's novel VorTran-M low diffusion CFD wake module and an acoustic propagation model to create a hybrid system for the development and aerodynamic/aeroacoustic evaluation of manned and unmanned rotorcraft.  A critically important result of this effort would be cost savings associated with the reduction in resources required to setup (i.e. grid generation) and perform adequate aeroacoustic predictions, as well as the ability of NASA rotorcraft design practitioners to exploit the large amount of NASA research into aerodynamic design and optimization that has previously been exclusive to the fixed-wing community.  Moreover, this system will also support interest within NASA in vorticity dominated flows, such as bluff body (i.e. unsteady vortex shedding from the shuttle and other rockets when sitting on the launch pad), aircraft in landing configurations and wake vortex hazards.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A successful SBIR effort would produce a fully-validated physics-based multidisciplinary tool for rotorcraft performance and external noise analysis that directly addresses the failings of current methods.  This tool could significantly diminish the cost and risk of new designs by reducing the need to perform tests and modifications (i.e. the evolution of the AH-64 empennage from T-tail to cruciform configuration) to ensure both mission suitability and public acceptance.  Thus beyond direct commercial gain to CDI, the tool will provide a large indirect commercial benefit to the government and to the rotorcraft community at large.  While CDI cannot market FUN3D directly, significant commercialization is anticipated from licensing the VorTran-M module to rotorcraft manufacturers and government branches involved in rotorcraft development/support.  Further interest would come from organizations that routinely use CFD to analyze vortex-dominated flows such as meteorology, submarine and ship wakes, building and vehicle aerodynamics.  Moreover, the wind turbine community could us this methodology to optimize turbine performance and acoustical signature.

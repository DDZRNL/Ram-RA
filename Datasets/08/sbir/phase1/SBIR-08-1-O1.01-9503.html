		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Long burst error mitigation is an enabling technology for the use of Ka band for high rate commercial and government users.  Multiple NASA, government, and commercial programs plan to use the Ka-band due to its large capacity and flexible scheduling relative to other bands such as S, X, and Ku.  Current digital communications systems have become increasingly adept at managing degraded channel conditions using robust FEC codes and strategies such as adaptive or variable coding and modulation (ACM/VCM).  These strategies do not adequately address long burst error conditions on the order of 100,000 symbols.  Existing FEC codes of up to 16,000 symbols are inadequate.  New methods to address this fast fade or burst error condition must be considered. In phase 1, we identify solutions to address long burst errors within the power and size constraints of a satellite application.  In Phase 2, we modify an existing platform to demonstrate performance under real-world conditions and study the interaction of these mitigation methods with higher layer protocols.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are a number of NASA applications either already operating at or targeted for Ka-band.  These include the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) system, which is a GEO/ground link, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which could demonstrate the viability of Ka-band for deep space missions, and a variety of remote sensing satellites.  Virtually any application that uses X- or Ku-band could take advantage of the increased bandwidth and simplified frequency coordination of the Ka-band using the techniques evaluated here.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		An emerging need for Ka-band solutions also exists in other government agencies and the private sector.  Within the DoD and NRO a large range of imaging satellites and airborne platforms require high-bandwidth.  Commercially, demand for remote sensing and imaging have constantly increased data rates.  A robust Ka-band solution would be attractive in numerous applications.

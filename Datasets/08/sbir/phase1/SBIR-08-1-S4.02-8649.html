		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal is for the development of a highly extensible and user-configurable software application for end-to-end mission simulation and design. We will leverage the plug-and-play architecture of our existing  simulation, visualization and command software, developing new capabilities for data fusion, operations planning, plan validation, and adjustable automation. The core application, VisualCommander, has been developed over the last 4 years under SBIR and IR&D funding as a revolutionary way of providing integrated design and simulation from mission conception through  mission operations. The software design of VisualCommander (VC) has been driven by the goals of extensibility, re-use of functionality, and user-configurability. As such, it serves as an ideal foundation upon which to build additional in-depth functions that are valuable for this purpose. VisualCommander is designed to integrate legacy engineering software with user-generated design and simulation tools into a single, user-friendly environment. It automates the flow of data between analysis, design, and simulation applications with minimal user manipulation. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Phase 1 product would be attractive to NASA mission developers as it would speed early development of mission and spacecraft design; it would provide easy access to many industry standard tools; and it would provide a multi-user, cross-discipline environment to enable design collaboration through several stages of development. The tool would be particularly valuable to NASA centers that need to develop preliminary plans for future missions. <BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This end-to-end mission design and analysis tool is applicable to a wide range of NASA, military and civilian applications. For example, the DoD has a major effort in the area of responsive space with the goal of reducing the time needed to fly a spacecraft. This product would be ideal for this type of application. The underlying value of the tool is that it will provide an organized interface for connecting many different parts of a project. For NASA, Air Force, ESA, and other space-faring organizations, the application realm is spacecraft and mission design, simulation and analysis. However, the core functionality that bridges multiple software tools into a single environment has a broad scope of potential applications. Further development beyond Phase II could adapt the tool to address additional technology areas with a need for multi-phase design integration, such as civil engineering, automotive design, and robotics.<BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		DNet has been actively pursuing strategies for shortening the software development portion of the satellite development life-cycle for some time. We recognized upon analyzing the constituents of the traditional process that a disproportionate fraction of time is spent working with software that falls under one of two categories - developed from scratch to suit the needs of a new mission, or recycling "heritage code" that subsequently requires extensive rework to achieve compatibility with a new system. The development segment devoted to software may never be truly compressed to zero, but significant measures can be taken to streamline the process. Code reusability has the potential to offer tangible savings. DNet is leveraging AFRL and NRL data standards to develop Application Programming Interfaces (API) that allow code modules to be ported to new systems with no modification of the application-level code and minimal modification of the subservient layers that facilitate compatibility with lower-level system facilities and transport layers. This API will facilitate the creation of a satellite system from modular applications that can be combined in such a way as to provide support for a wide range of missions and be completely reusable as the physical composition of the satellite is changed.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The standard Application Programming Interfaces and supporting tools developed through the course of this research have great utility to NASA for supporting the SBIRSat (e.g. Ames Research Center Small Satellite) program, which seeks more effective methods for constructing mission capability more rapidly and with lower cost. We would expect that the SBIRSat program is merely an opening for more widespread implementation of these standards, which could ultimately flow beyond the SBIRSat technology tracking into subsequent missions and eventually into larger programs.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We already have significant heritage in the development of these software standards and tools for our military customers, AFRL and NRL. The utility of the offered software classes and supporting tools are unique to spacecraft development, but there are ample opportunities in the commercial space area for this work to be embraced and extended by the larger aerospace community. The Space Plug&Play Avionics (SPA) standards are likely to be accepted by the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) program office, which will likely levy some portion of the standards on providers for the tactical mission series for which SPA was originally intended.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Access to space for Small Satellites is enabled by the use of excess launch capacity on  existing launch vehicles.  A range of sizes, form factors and masses need to be accommodated. An integration process that minimizes programmatic/technical risk to the primary, allows "late flow" integration and predictable cost/schedule for the secondary enables regular and cost-effective access. The integration process proceeds smoothly when the right adapters accommodates the secondary in a seamless way.  Design_Net has developed and flown a RideShare Adapter (RSA) for FALCON class vehicles that meets these requirements. We are currently working with United Launch Alliance (ULA) for a broader class of rideshare accommodations, upgrades to capability of the ESPA and development of interfaces that allow late access.  Based on this experience Design_Net will continue, via this SBIR, to develop appropriate adapters for other types of secondary payloads on other launch vehicles.  Phase 1 will see preliminary design of another adapter for intermediate size small sats (larger than "cubesats" but smaller than ESPA) for a selected launch vehicle.  During Phase 2 we will develop and qualify the selected adapter design to TRL 8.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA centers have different uses for Small Satellite Rideshare.  KSC is interested in flying P-POD class missions for education and technology; Ames desires to fly P-PODs for biological purposes and some potential Lunar missions; JPL has a number of technologies waiting for a ride. Adapters which enable NASA to make better use of its Launch Vehicle inventory and efficient use of lift mass will move some of the technology experiments from TRL 5 to TRL 8 and greatly assist the agency in buying down risk on its larger missions as well as flying the small ones for a predictable price.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Design_Net Engineering LLC and our sister company SpaceAccess Technology are working with a customer base of over 50 commercial and university class payloads.  Our first technology rideshare flew on a Falcon 1 in August of 2008.  With the ride hardware, the right integration flow, and for the appropriate price point, a business can indeed be developed around this principle.  We are bringing primary customers and LV providers into the process early, and developing fixed and affordable cost points, with regular flight opportunities.  We currently have a backlog of around a dozen funded customers waiting for opportunity and believe this will grow significantly with additional adapters.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

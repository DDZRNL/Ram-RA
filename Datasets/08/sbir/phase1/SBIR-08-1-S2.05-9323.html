		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR program will identify and address the primary technical issues that limit the current precision of replicated CFRP optics.  These issues must be resolved to bring this capability to the sub-micron range of precision required by the next generation of flight and ground submillimeter and far infrared projects.  Were these issues resolved, this capability would provide reduced cost and risk and improved areal density, thermal stability, and stiffness to the large sub-micron optics required by the next generation of flight and ground submillimeter and far infrared projects.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The capabilities proposed in this SBIR would be relevant to a variety of Space and Earth science missions currently in various stages of formulation.  The nearest term target is for insertion of the reflector technology in the SMLS, CCAT, and possibly SAFIR missions.  Mission study groups at JPL, GSFC, and LaRC are the most likely customers in this area.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Other Gov't: DoD interests have indicated a desire to field an ever-growing number of 'long-wavelength' instruments on UAV platforms.  Though these are typically no larger than 1m class instruments, the maturing of the core materials, process, and design competencies would position DR Technologies to capture additional DoD work in this area.  Key customers in this area are at KAFB in Albuquerque, NM.<BR>Commercial:  Large, accurate, thermally stable reflectors may be needed for broadband wireless spacecraft. The increasing need to provide internet capabilities to remote locations for commercial applications has lead several service providers and spacecraft manufacturers to consider constellations of spacecraft to meet this need. Lightweight, large-aperture, thermally stable reflectors with sub-micron level tolerances will be needed to meet the ever growing needs for traffic capacity per spacecraft. This program could provide enabling technology for these commercial spacecraft systems.  DR Technologies has good contacts within each of the Primes where these opportunities will likely emerge.<BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		 This Phase I SBIR will demonstrate the feasibility of a process to create multi-layer thin-film optics for the far-infrared/sub-millimeter wave spectral region.  The process will create alternating sub-wavelength layers of window and air with high index contrast.  The process proven in Phase I will be applied to Phase II commercial prototypes including mirrors with reflectivity exceeding 99.99%, design tunable band-pass and band-blocking filters, anti-reflection optics, and scanning Fabry-Perot spectrometers with simultaneous unprecedented high resolution and broad free spectral range at 100 micron wavelengths. Such spectroscopic component technology can be immediately integrated into a number of future NASA missions in Earth and planetary science, astronomy, and astrophysics, as well as having dual use and large potential markets in defense, security, and biomedicine. <BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Sensor improvements to meet the sensing needs of future Earth science, planetary science, and astronomy & astrophysics missions. The far-infrared spectra of galactic sources are used to determine atomic and molecular abundances, temperatures and electron densities [7], and high resolution is needed in the study of molecular line shapes, which are important for kinematic studies  Far-infrared spectra are useful to measure abundance of atmospheric gases such as H20, O3, CO, and N2O [4, 8].  Even non-polar atmospheric molecules such as N2, O2, and CO2 can be detected at submillimeter wavelengths due to weak transient dipole moments induced by collisions [4].  Other minor atmospheric constituents such as HNO3, NO2, HCl, HF, and OH may be detected also [4].<BR>The array of market opportunities within NASA for these components, and more broadly in the defense and biomedical communities, make the subject technology a very attractive business opportunity.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		SECURITY:  The ability of THz imaging to see through luggage walls, envelopes, and clothing  and simultaneously to run a "fingerprint" spectrum on complex molecules (drugs, explosives, weaponry) it senses  makes rapid development of the proposed THz optical technology very desirable.<BR>MEDICINE:  THz can image skin cancer clearly, when ordinary photography reveals nothing, and can replace dental -rays... while delivering a spectral analysis of the image.<BR>MILITARY APPLICATIONS:  The military obviously has all the security-control problems of the commercial market.  Two additional problems are of military importance:  mine clearing and remote detection of improvised explosive devices.  THz imaging can penetrate through dry soil and show buried metallic and nonmetallic objects<BR>

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

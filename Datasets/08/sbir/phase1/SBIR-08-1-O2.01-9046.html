		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Prioria (Gainesville, FL) and its partners Aerial Products (Deland, FL) and Meridian Systems LLC (Titusville, FL) propose to develop a revolutionary new type of system which is both modular and standardized, and which can effectively interface with existing sensors such as range radar and acoustic intrusion detectors.  The system for launch surveillance/intrusion detection is based on a network of uncooled long wavelength infrared (LWIR) imagers with associated Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors and magnetic compass heading indicators, integrated into a small  package which can be deployed on small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), balloons or blimps, and fixed towers.  Infrared imagers are chosen for their day/night and all-weather capability and because recent advances in uncooled technology has allowed the price of these sensors to become low enough for fielding a relatively large number of imagers in a cost effective manner.<BR>	These LWIR sensors and integrated instrumentation will provide for the remote detection, recognition, and identification of persons and objects that have intruded into areas of the range that must be cleared in order to conduct safe launch operations. In order to achieve accurate identification, the time and position of potential intrusions will be recorded in a "track file" for each detection incidence.  Data fusion techniques will fuse tracks from various sensors into a single track when possible, and objects will be tracked with multi-target tracking techniques as necessary. This will require the use of encrypted communication, so track data and associated intruder imagery from individual sensors can be combined at a centralized control station as a fused track file. In the cases where intrusions are deemed security risks, further action can be undertaken, such as deployment of a small UAV to the intrusion site for real time observation, while range control and security evaluate the situation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Prioria and its partners will provide a low cost, rapidly deployable, multi-platform sensor surveillance network to remotely monitor controlled areas and detect intruding entities. The network defines a perimeter and provides surveillance capability for a controlled area, which may consist of land, sea, and/or near-ground air. The system consists of an interconnected autonomous sensor network of fixed towers, static balloons, and mobile UAVs. <BR>The primary NASA application for this system is for range monitoring and access control during launch and landing operations. Intruders are targeted and tracked by the sensor network, and target tracking data is provided to a ground control station.  A human operator will determine the appropriate course of action for tracked targets.  The proposed sensor network improves security of the range by automating target detection within the controlled area. Operational costs are minimized by using low cost, small size, low power system components and by limiting human interaction to reported target tracking data. <BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Both the proposed system in entirety and the constituent innovations have non-NASA commercialization potential.  The largest potential customer is the U.S. Government, and the individual innovations produced in this proposal can give Prioria and partners a significant competitive advantage with this customer.  In light of the intense competition in the UAV market, the importance of this competitive advantage cannot be understated.<BR>A list of non-NASA commercialization opportunities and more details are provided in Sect. 10.2.

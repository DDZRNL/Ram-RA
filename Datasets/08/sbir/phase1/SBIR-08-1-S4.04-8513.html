		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Space Micro proposes to build upon our existing space processing and hardening technologies and products e.g (Proton 200K), to research and develop reusable software for plug and play (PnP) for intelligent avionics and payload processing. This will leverage both AFRL and Space Micro R&D to meet NASA's expanding reusable software needs.<BR><BR>At the end of Phase 1 we will have demonstrated, both by analysis and limited lab testing of prototype PnP software, the technical feasibility.(TRL=3).<BR><BR>In Phase 2 we will develop an engineering models of an avionics incorporating PnP reusable software, and demonstrate electrically and also in relevant ground-based test bed at NASA or AFRL.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Virtually all NASA space programs have a demand for this proposed technology and product. NASA applications range from space shuttle, space station, earth sensing missions e.g. (EOS), and deep space missions. NASA programs/missions that will benefit include lunar landers and orbiters, Mars missions, solar system exploration e.g. (Titan, Juno, Europa, comet nucleus return, New Discovery and Living with a Star (LWS). New programs including Ares, the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and Commercial Orbiter Transportation Service (COTS) would benefit.   Products evolving from this SBIR will be enabling for future programs such as Dawn, Aquarius, Kepler, Ocean Vector Winds, and space interferometry.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Intelligent reusable PnP software will support DoD AFRL and Operationally responsive Space (ORS) initiatives including the TacSat family of satellites.<BR><BR>This technology may also benefit commercial space platforms, both LEO and GEO telecommunication satellites, such as Intelsat, Direct TV, XM radio, Lockheed's A2100, and Boeing's HS-601.<BR><BR>Civil earth sensing applications such as weather/metrology applications e.g. (NOAA) can also benefit. <BR><BR>This technology and products will also address emerging MDA radiation threats. These programs include MKV THAAD, AEGIS, and GMD for Blocks 2012 and beyond. With the new challenge of atmospheric neutrons to MDA High altitude airship (HAA) programs and NASA or Air Force UAV programs, this R&D will be a timely solution. <BR><BR><BR>

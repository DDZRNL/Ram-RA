		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Spaceflight adaptations include muscle atrophy, decreased bone mineral density and reduced aerobic capacity making effective resistance exercise countermeasure hardware necessary for safe and successful space exploration.  Real-time control is applied to an electric servo-motor to provide resistance and aerobic exercise in a lightweight, compact, and reconfigurable design with self-contained power generation.  The technical objectives of the system design are that it be easily configured and stowed, and require minimal power to operate including a pedal generator to supply electricity. The hardware is instrumented to document exercise sessions and provide whole body axial loading and individual joint resistive loading that simulates free weights with eccentric overloading.  The loads are adjustable in 2.5 kg increments to maintain muscle strength and bone density, and aerobic exercise is provided with pedal attachments.  The Phase 1 work plan includes initial prototype design, fabrication, and demonstration.  The portable design can provide resistance and aerobic exercise in virtually any aspect of spaceflight (extended use on ISS, short-term lunar sortie missions, and future Mars exploration).  The system also has application for in-home neuromuscular rehabilitation and controlled resistance exercise.<BR>

		<BR>
		The proposed exercise countermeasure could be used in virtually any aspect of spaceflight (extended use on the International Space Station, short-term lunar sortie missions, and future Mars exploration) because of its compact size and portability.  Moreover, the self-contained power generation capability provides not only aerobic exercise, but could also serve as an emergency or auxiliary power source.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The expected significance of the development of this device is that it has the potential to significantly advance the discovery of neuromuscular rehabilitation because it can adapt the level of resistance based on biomechanical feedback. Such a device could have very broad commercial appeal for athletes, aging populations requiring safe resistance exercise, and rehabilitation for patients with neuromuscular disorders such as stroke, Parkinson's Disease, or spinal cord injury. Therefore, the proposed research and development program will develop a device that could be incorporated into exercise and rehabilitation programs benefiting society at large. <BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address the NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) need for space suit displays and processing cores, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Conformal Light Augmented Single Substrate Head-Mounted Display (CLASS-HMD) for extravehicular activities (EVA), based on radiation-hardened COTS electronic components and a low-profile compact see-through head-mounted display (HMD) design.  This approach incorporates compact conformal holographic projection optics instead of bulky lens system, which enables us to meet NASA EVA helmet-mounted display requirements for greater acceptance by astronauts, thus increasing their situational awareness during EVA.  In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of a space suit HMD system through system design, fabrication, and testing of key components of the system, and analysis of the performance in meeting NASA HMD requirements, as well as for commercial applications.  A preliminary proof-of-concept prototype system will be developed, which will demonstrate TRL-4 by the end of Phase I.  In Phase II, POC plans to develop a fully functional prototype and demonstrate a space suit HMD system.  The results demonstrated will offer NASA capabilities to reduce workload on astronauts performing EVA tasks on the lunar surface.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The CLASS-HMD technology will provide new capabilities for astronauts during EVA in a radiation-hardened see-through display that allows them to monitor the conditions around them.  This will allow astronauts to be more productive and take on less risk.  Applications include space walks, harsh-environment training, and navigation during Martian dust storms.  
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We anticipate widespread appeal of the CLASS-HMD technology for such applications as gaming HMDs, flight simulators, and other immersive display systems, including medical and CAD/CAE 3D image displays, and virtual-reality displays for endoscopy/laparoscopy, and such environmentally risky professions as firefighting. Another potential commercial application for the CLASS-HMD system will be for the pilots of future private-sector space-tourism spacecraft.

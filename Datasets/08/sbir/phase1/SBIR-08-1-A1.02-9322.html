		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The goal of the project is demonstration of the feasibility of Friction Stir Weld (FSW) assessment by novel Nonlinear Time Reversal Acoustic (TRA) method. Time reversal acoustic focusing provides the means to concentrate sound energy at any point in a material, inducing elastic nonlinear effects in the focal area. The level on nonlinearity depends on crack and defect presence and measurements of nonlinear effects in TRA focused wave are the basis of the proposed Nonlinear TRA NDE method.  This method is especially sensitive to detection of kissing bond that is difficult to detect by other methods. The experimental setups for measurements of local nonlinearity in FSW will be developed and results of the measurements will be compared with the standard weld NDE methods including dye penetrant, radiographic and ultrasonic inspection.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The suggested work will lead to a simple, cost-effective technology and instrumentation for assessment of Friction Stir Weld (FSW).  The developed method will be primary orientated to NASA needs and can be used for FSW control in production of Space Shuttle's gigantic External Tank. The developed method can be used by other airspace companies including: Boeing Delta II and Delta IV Expendable Launch Vehicles and the SpaceX Falcon 1 rocket as for another NASA application.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed novel technology will have broad civilian applications for the quality control of Friction Stir Weld (FSW) and other kinds of welds. Friction welding is cost-effective method of joining highly dissimilar materials and geometries; it is a versatile process that had been successfully used in many industries. By assessment of the FSW quality, the life expectancy of the pars will be extended, replacement costs lowered and downtime reduced, higher production volume and increased capacity will be possible.<BR>Consumer based applications of the proposed method for FSW include as light and heavy automotive, electrical, chemical and civil engineering; pump, agricultural and construction equipment; electric motors; drilling, marine and printing industries. FSW produced components include air bag canisters, axle cases and tubes, drive shafts, drill pipes, tunneling rods, electrical connectors, hydraulic piston rods and cylinders, pump shafts, swivel pins, track rollers and turbo chargers. Materials which can be friction welded include nickel alloys, low and medium carbon, micro alloyed, case hardened, heat and corrosion resistant, nitriding and carburising steels, and titanium. <BR>Defense industry applications of the proposed method for FSW include assessment of armor plating for amphibious assault ships, and welding the wings and fuselage panels of the new Eclipse 500 aircraft from Eclipse Aviation. <BR>

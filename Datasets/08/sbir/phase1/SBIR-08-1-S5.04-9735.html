		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To-date, the realization of high-performance liquid bipropellant rocket engines in the micro-scale has largely been hindered by the inability to obtain "on-board" pressurization through a light-weight and low-complexity pump. Ventions seeks to fulfill this critical need by proposing the development of a low-risk and low-cost pump that can be either be integral to the thrust chamber, or inserted in a modular manner with existing system components to provide significant performance improvements for Mars Ascent Vehicles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed pump concept overcomes a key challenge of providing on-board pressurization for high-performance rocket engines, especially in the micro-scale. Hence, upon eventual integration with complete propulsion systems (thrust chamber, valves / tanks, etc.), it serves as critically-enabling technology for a new generation liquid bipropellant rocket engines in the 50-100lbf thrust class, with T/W ratios of 150-200, and an Isp of ~330 sec. These engines may batch-fabricated in a cost-effective manner and modularly stacked to cover a wide range of NASA applications, including MARS sample return missions, nanosat launch vehicles, lunar ascent / descent missions (precursor rovers, cargo, etc.), and Near-Earth-Object missions (sample return, drill reaction for sample implantation, etc.).<BR><BR>Additionally, the proposed pump may itself be scaled-up to provide cost and simplicity benefits to existing missions utilizing conventional turbopumps. <BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications for high-performance micro-rocket engines enabled by the proposed pump technology are likely to include commercial / military launch vehicles for low-cost and on-demand access to space for a variety of micro / small satellite payloads, upper stage propulsion for orbit insertion of commercial satellites, and apogee kick motors for orbit circularization of commercial satellites, etc.<BR><BR>Additionally, the pump itself is expected to have non-aerospace applications in industrial pumping settings, and small-scale, high-pressure liquid pumps, etc. <BR><BR>

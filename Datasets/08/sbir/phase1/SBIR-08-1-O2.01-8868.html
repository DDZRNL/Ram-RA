		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This topic is designed by NASA lead agency Ames Research Center to address technologies that would enable a safer and more reliable space transportation capability.  NASA is seeking innovative technologies including sensors and communication which expedite launch range clearance.  Needed is equipment that will provide real time situation awareness for safe range operation from processing to launch and recovery.  Proposed herein is a very small, low cost, high resolution, dual-mode lightweight sensor for remote detection, recognition, and identification of persons and objects that have intruded into areas of the identified range.  The dual-mode sensor combines high resolution millimeter radar with high resolution electro-optical sensor.  The proposed sensor is low cost and compact, meeting size, weight, power, and stability requirements for a variety of platforms, including unmanned vehicles, buoys, and high altitude air ships.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The initial uses for NASA include application to all platforms where automatic recognition of intrusions into the launch range is required, whether due to unmanned operations, or for efficiency in launch operations.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The dual mode surveillance object sensor system may be commercialized for use in defense and government surveillance applications, including (1) Detect vehicle and human movement in a military remote or urban environment, (2) Detect vehicle and human movement in border security or law enforcement activity, (3) Detect security violations (weapon detection) at portals to secure facilities, (4) Detect high value targets for terminal guidance of precision weapons (5) Automotive Collision Warning, and (6) Robotics Autonomous Operations.<BR>

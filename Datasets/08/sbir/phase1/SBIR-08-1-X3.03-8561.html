		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Zybek Advanced Products has proven the ability to produce industrial quantities of lunar simulant materials, including glass, agglutinate and melt breccias.  These are critical components in the NU-LHT-series and OB1 lunar simulants.  The feed stock for this simulant is a mining industry by-product.  The feedstock contains many contaminates, may not always be available, and can be inconsistent.  <BR><BR>Although the standard lunar simulant produced from the mineral industry byproduct feedstock is useful for some applications, many projects require a simulant with a higher fidelity.   This project provides the means to produce individual components that are not available from terrestrial sources.  These components can be mixed in different proportions to determine the effect on a particular process.  <BR><BR>The basic theory of the innovation is to mix known industrial ingredients, bring to molten temperatures, allow time for full reaction (in molten state), and then control the cooling rate to cause re-crystallization.  These components are readily available and can be processed at multi-ton rates in the plasma melter. <BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Applications inside of NASA include:  Oxygen Production, testing of mechanical equipment, bio-medical research, specific beneficiation of lunar materials, development of database of spectrometry data from NASA space equipment, testing excavation and drilling equipment, and connector mating tests. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Contractors and researchers for other Space Agencies, and University Researchers.  Also, the strong potential exists for using this material production means as a medium for producing nanophase elements that cannot be exposed to Oxygen (e.g., Fe0).  This has been demonstrated in the production of iron-bearing agglutinate.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

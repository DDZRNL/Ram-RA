		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Our goal is to develop a social networking site with novel, specially designed feature sets to enable simultaneous remote collaboration and sharing of large data sets among scientists.  This site, called Sci-Share, will include not only the standard features found on popular consumer oriented social networking sites such as Facebook and Myspace but also a number of powerful tools  to extend its functionality to a science collaboration site.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is a data centric organization and accessing and sharing of data among scientists remains a challenge. Virtual observatory is a promising technology for making accessible data access from various missions and instruments through a web browser.  Sci-Share provides a complimentary solution to Virtual Observatories by enabling distributed collaboration and sharing of downloaded and/or processed data among scientists.  This will, in turn, increase science returns from NASA missions.  Sci-Share also enables better utilization of NASA's HPCC resources by providing an easy and central mechanism to access and share large files on user's space or those saved on mass storage.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We expect strong marketing opportunities for Sci-Share within the federal government, scientific organizations, and commercial sector.   The creation of online communities generates "traffic" among targeted audience with obvious marketing potential in delivery of ads and products.  The interactive video piece alone can be a source of revenue.  Other possibilities include licensing agreement with other social networking platform providers that could offer Sci-Share's unique technology and feature list as ad on to their standard package. Although our initial target is the scientific domain, Sci-Share's set of tools is expected to be of great interest to all social networking sites.  For example, email remains the primary means of electronic communication today with 97+ billion emails sent globally every day (IDC).  Sci-Share's email utility addresses this general market by providing an easy mechanism to "email" large files by simply dragging and dropping files from the desktop to Sci-Share.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

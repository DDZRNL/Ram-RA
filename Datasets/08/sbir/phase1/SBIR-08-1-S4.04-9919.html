		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase I proposal responds to the Solicitation requirements by scoping the effort involved in developing a common software executive and aligned library of reusable support modules in parallel with a facilitating reuse infrastructure.  Rather than focusing on libraries and other failed strategies, the contractor proposes to use the modern architectural concepts of service-oriented architectures, persistence and predictive computing to build a real-time executive for flight systems in a standards-based and platform-independent manner.  The reuse infrastructure being built in parallel consists of a framework and related toolset that makes it easy for engineers to identify and retrieve reusable assets that provide proven value.  The contractor will develop specifications for the common software executive and library of reusable support modules during Phase I.  The infrastructure will be prototyped and used for a Phase I demonstration.  A market survey will be conducted as part of the effort to scope the commercialization prospects and develop an initial business plan that will be used to interest potential pilot projects in partnering for a Phase II effort.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The common software executive and library of reusable support modules being specified by this effort have direct applicability across NASA in aeronautical, science, space and exploration missions.  Because the common executive software and associated library will be built using modern architectural concepts, it will be portable across platforms and operate on different processors.  As such, it could be used to mechanize on-board software systems in small satellites, science instruments/experiments and commercial applications like robotics.  The facilitating reuse infrastructure being built in parallel represents a product that can be used by just about anyone to make reuse determinations and findings.  The organizational framework and tools being constructed provide engineers with a way to put reuse to work in government, commercial and academic environments.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The common software executive and library of reusable support modules has applicability in real-time systems such as those developed for defense, manufacturing, space, software production and telecommunications.  The facilitating reuse infrastructure that we are developing in parallel consisting of our framework and toolkit seems to have broader applicability because it can be used by anyone to identify and retrieve reusable assets that fit their needs.   Because reuse benefits are desired across industries, immediate insertion into defense, manufacturing, space, software production and telecommunications firms is envisioned especially seeing that the infrastructure needed to facilitate this will be available to help with the insertion of the technology.

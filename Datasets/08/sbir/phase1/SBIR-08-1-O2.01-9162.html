		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		United States spaceports carry out the impressive task of launching and recovering spacecrafts and payloads which represent extremely unique and expensive assets. The successful deployment, recovery, and operation of these assets are essential to our scientific discovery, economic prosperity, and national security. Range surveillance is a significant factor in enabling safe, reliable, and cost effective operations.  Our ranges encompass large ocean regions that are not under the exclusive control of the spaceport. As such, these areas must be cleared in preparation for launch and reentry operations to ensure overall safety to the public as well as the space transportation system itself.  Emergent Space Technologies, Inc. (Emergent) proposes to research a integrated marine autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) range surveillance (MARS) system to enhance spaceport situational awareness. The surveillance payload includes an array of optical, infrared, and RF sensors and onboard software to facilitate measurement infusion and analysis. The surveillance payload provides state estimates including position, velocity, and heading for marine assets.  State measurements are relayed to the range control personnel to aid in operational decision making.  The MARS system is intended to increase range availability and safety while decreasing operational costs. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The MARS system is initially being developed to support NASA range surveillance and intrusion monitoring activities for spacecraft launch and recovery operations. MARS is intended to augment existing surveillance operations in the range's marine corridor which is expansive, expensive to monitor, and prone to incursion by commercial and recreational boats. The MARS system is intended to support Commercial Orbital Transportation Services and sounding rocket launches at the Goddard Space Flight Center's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia and Constellation program launches at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The technology might also be deployed on land-based stations to monitor launch, processing, and recovery facilities.   When paired with appropriate sensors, the MARS system will also support autonomous in situ oceanographic and atmospheric data collection and transmission for NASA Earth science applications including satellite calibration and validation, physical oceanography (temperature, winds, salinity, current, CO2), harmful algal bloom monitoring, and hurricane/storm research.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Emergent's MARS system has the potential to support a wide array of non-NASA government and commercial autonomous marine surveillance and in situ data collection applications.  Application domains include natural and man-made disaster response, energy, environmental, homeland security, law enforcement, military, public health and safety, transportation, and weather forecasting. Regardless of application domain, the MARS systems offers the potential to decrease operational costs, decrease human workloads, reduce human exposure to hazardous environments, increase situational awareness, enable extended duration observations, and customize temporal and spatial surveillance and monitoring scales. State and local governments tasked with conducting increased surveillance and environmental monitoring activities on increasingly limited budgets are expected to benefit from the MARS system which will ultimately enables more effective use of employees and resources.

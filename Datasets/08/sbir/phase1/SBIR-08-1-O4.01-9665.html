		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address NASA's need for L1 C/A-based navigation with better anti-spoofing ability and higher accuracy, Broadata Communications, Inc. (BCI) proposes to develop a new Navigation Robustness and Accuracy Improvement (NRAI) system, based on BCI's innovative noise nulling and observable combiner technology. BCI's novel approach incorporates the innovations of the highly successful multiple-antenna detection technique and the optimized fast quad diversity combiner technique, enabling BCI to meet NASA's requirements for reliability, safety, and high accuracy by effectively nullifying the interference noise from GPS receiver data and eliminating errors and ambiguities in observables. The NRAI system offers a 4-6 dB SNR improvement factor over current techniques and increases the accuracy of L1 C/A navigation to less than 1 m and 1 cm/s, which directly fulfills NASA's requirement of anti-spoofing ability and high accuracy. In Phase I BCI will demonstrate the feasibility of the NRAI system by building and testing a preliminary prototype, which will demonstrate TRL-level 3-4 by the end of Phase I. In Phase II, BCI plans to develop a fully functional prototype and demonstrate the anti-spoofing and high-accuracy navigation performance of NRAI. The demonstrated results will offer NASA capabilities of accurate and reliable navigation using L1 C/A code.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		As NASA attempts to deliver a better product for less money, and as it attempts to partner with private industry in order to increase its efficiency and make money, the importance of a versatile metric tracking system for launch vehicles becomes even more important. An important benefit of BCI's NRAI system is that it can be embedded in any GPS receiving system; our NRAI system can improve accuracy for most NASA navigation applications that require Range Safety and high accuracy. For example, BCI's NRAI system can be used for high-accuracy antenna pointing, docking maneuvers, and attitude determination. Most NASA navigation systems will greatly benefit from the development of BCI's high-accuracy NRAI system by enhancing the anti-spoofing capability and positioning accuracy of L1 C/A code-based navigation. With BCI's NRAI system, NASA can provide more efficient services at a lower cost.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A desirable benefit of BCI's NRAI system is its ease in transitioning to private industry. The NRAI system, because it is independent of any particular GPS receiver design, can provide benefits to many private businesses, especially those industries involving ships and automobiles. Aircraft navigation, commercial automobile systems, such as those that enable safe, semi-autonomous driving, and ship navigation can all benefit greatly from the advances of the NRAI system. More accurate positioning and measuring of speed in many different types of settings can help to streamline products in these industries, saving consumers much time and money. In addition, robotic navigation can use the measurement and positioning accuracy of BCI's NRAI. The NRAI system can also benefit such governmental entities as Homeland Security. With the ever-increasing demand for better and more precise technologies in automobiles, ships, aircraft, and robots, the possibilities for commercialization of BCI's NRAI seem endless.

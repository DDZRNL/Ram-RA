		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In support of NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, NanoSonic would optimize our moisture-resistant aerospace adhesives with in-situ corrosion mitigating surface treatments to improve aviation safety by reducing durability related hazards on subsonic commercial aircraft.  NanoSonic specializes in the production of advanced, non-commodity resins as adhesive, sealant, and novel coupling agents.  One aspect of our synthetic method involves the systematic replacement of nonpolar groups along well defined polymer backbones with sidechain chemical moieties capable of complexing with metals, hence significantly increasing adhesion to metal or composites relative to nonpolar resins.  Synthetically engineered hybrid copolymers allow the inherently hydrophobic backbone to mitigate moisture ingress, while the tailored sidechain moieties offer adhesion orders of magnitude greater than unmodified commodity resins.  NanoSonic also tailors the number and type of crosslinking sites available to minimize CTE, while maximizing the mechanical properties and cohesive strength to prevent catastrophic disbonding from aircraft adherend. The specialty adhesives are available in 1-55 gallon drum quantities.  Down-selected adhesives and coupling agents shall be tested under harsh thermal (-90ºF to 800ºF) and environmental conditions and in a wind tunnel (subsonic, Mach <1) along-side state-of-the-art structural aerospace adhesives to increase the TRL from 4 to 6 during Phase I.

		<BR>
		NanoSonic's high performance polar, yet hydrophobic adhesives would result in advanced aerospace adhesives and surface treatments with increased durability to minimize subsonic aircraft aging and durability related hazards with a TRL of 6 upon completion of the Phase I program.  NanoSonic's polar resins are synthetically engineered to offer stronger adhesion over commercial aircraft adhesives, and the hydrophobic backbone allows for superior moisture resistance and corrosion mitigation.  The down-selected polymers would also serve as adhesives or sealants with solvent resistant against jet fuel, sea water and harsh aircraft solvents.  The adhesives offered will be delivered in volumes up to 55 gallon drums and are roll-to-roll compatible for repair appliqué.  TRL 9 would be reached via successful flight testing and platform integration of the adhesives onto commercial subsonic, supersonic and near-space aircraft such as 787 Dreamliner, V-22, AH-1, UH-60 F/A-18, JSF, HAA and ISIS.  <BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NanoSonic's hydrophobic yet polar hybrid adhesives and coupling agents shall offer excellent adhesion, moisture and corrosion resistance over a wide service temperature range of -90<SUP>o</SUP>C to > 350<SUP>o</SUP>C.  While typical epoxies offer good adhesion, the proposed copolymers offered herein are synthetically engineered to provide service over a wider thermal range with enhanced solvent resistance (sea water, jet fuel and solvents) and weatherability against UV and ozone.  The backbone allows for cryogenic compliance, while the novel copolymer design offers inherently higher thermal stability relative to commodity structural adhesives.  During Phase I, accelerated ageing studies will be carried out to verify peel and lap shear adhesion of > 10,000 psi up to 1,000 hours.  Additional thermomechanical studies shall be carried out under cryogenic and elevated temperatures (-65ºF to 285ºF) for supersonic simulations and after soaking metal-to-appliqué peel specimens in boiling water and heated solvents.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A surface-mounted instrumentation system for measuring rotor blade motions on rotorcraft, for use both in flight and in wind tunnel testing, is proposed for development.  The technology builds upon previous Navy- and NASA-sponsored SBIR work in the design of a system for measuring rotor blade motion and loads, by combining several separate measurement technologies into a single instrumentation unit.  The device may be applied onto the underside of any rotor system, and has a sufficiently small weight and form factor to minimize any impact on either blade aerodynamic or inertial properties.  Data transfer to and from the unit is performed using optical telemetry, and power for the system is provided from self-contained conformal batteries.  A novel feature of the new approach is the dual-use nature of the telemetry link to provide additional blade position measurements.  These features eliminate the need for specialized rotor hub hardware for blade angle measurement or sliprings for power or data exchange, thus enabling its use on a wide range of rotor systems of interest to NASA and commercial customers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The instrumentation system to be developed here would significantly enhance the capabilities of NASA researchers to improve rotorcraft aeromechanical modeling and prediction tools by providing much-needed high-quality data on rotor blade motion during rotorcraft testing.  These data would be used to validate analyses of distributed aerodynamic and aeroelastic loads on rotor systems both in-flight and in wind tunnel test environments.  The additional detail available from these datasets would improve physical understanding of the complicated aeromechanical interactions present in rotor system response, thereby leading to the development of better design tools for characterizing the rotor's behavior.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA commercial applications for this measurement system include supporting rotorcraft flight test operations, functioning as a condition monitoring system for rotor motion limit checking, and aiding routine maintenance for rotor blade vibration reduction through enhanced blade tracking.  Future applications could include rotor state measurement for enhanced rotorcraft flight control feedback functions.

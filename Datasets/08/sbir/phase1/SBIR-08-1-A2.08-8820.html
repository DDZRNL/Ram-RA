		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal defines innovative aerodynamic concepts and technology goals aimed at vehicle efficiency for future subsonic aircraft in the 2020  2030 timeframe.  Noise, emissions and fuel burn are all vehicle efficiency concerns which can be addressed by aerodynamic concepts either on the component, subsystem, or aircraft design system level.  In line with the NASA, an assumption is made that by 2025, higher air traffic demand (2-3 times the 2004 level) will require a significant increase in airport throughput, improved air traffic control procedures, and a significant decrease in noise.<BR><BR>Empirical Systems Aerospace (ESAero) has a design and analysis team to address high risk/high pay-off technologies on the aircraft aerodynamics concept level and airframe/propulsion integration to dramatically reduce noise, pollution, and fuel burn in the 2020-2030 timeframe.  The key technology for these breakthroughs is the use of an advanced cryogenically-cooled electric propulsion system installed in advanced unconventional aircraft configurations.  An important feature of this study is to understand and evaluate the impact of this propulsion system on the design and aerodynamic performance of the total aircraft.  In addition, ESAero will examine the applicability of STOL performance to potential improvements in airport throughput using multiple configuration and aerodynamic performance concepts.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This research could provide the NASA with cutting edge airplane configurations incorporating unique aerodynamic concepts and a propulsion system which could drastically increase efficiency over SOTA aircraft.  The vehicles and propulsion concepts proposed here are directly applicable to NASA's current SSFW directives and a complement to its current activities in the SBIR and NRA arenas.  NASA is looking for improved sub-sonic transport aerodynamics and noise improvements, of which the results of this proposal can meet in the near-term.  As new airplanes generally take almost a decade for production, the propulsion system proposed here can be available much earlier than that.  Electric distributed propulsion systems are available now, and with the addition of cryo, can be available in as early as 5 to 7 years.  The cryo-electric distributed propulsion system can be adapted to 737NGs which are available today and will likely still be available as an N+1.5 aircraft in 2015.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Various non-NASA commercial applications exist for the proposed technologies.  Currently, the C-130 replacement, the EAGL C-5 replacement, and the Joint Future Theater Lift are three major military tactical airlift vehicles being considered.  From the proposed research, both the aerodynamically efficient concepts and the propulsion system are applicable to these on-going military mission studies.  In addition, the research is applicable to the rapidly growing UAV industry.  Resulting UAVs from the propulsion study would be smaller and more efficient than current fuel powered aircraft.  The noise of the proposed propulsion system and aerodynamic concepts would also be less than that of current generation UAVs.  A large UAS such as the Global Hawk can benefit greatly from the proposed propulsion system as an increase of efficiency will lead to longer loiter times for the BAMS mission and longer range flights for Air Force Reconnaissance missions.

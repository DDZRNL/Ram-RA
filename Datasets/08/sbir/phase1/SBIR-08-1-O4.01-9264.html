		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		MARK Resources proposes to develop a method for combining a set of distributed FRPAs into a network that provides high GPS anti-jam/interference capability.  Like a CRPA, the number of jammers that the proposed system can suppress is one less than the number of elements.  In contrast to a CRPA, the individual elements of the proposed system need not be precisely located relative to one another.  The proposed system is compatible with any GPS antennas and receiver hardware, operates on the C/A code, and has a small processing load.<BR>The suppression of the jammers and interference creates slightly delayed copies of the code from each satellite.  Because the delays are known and small, any degradation in the accuracy of derived antenna positions (relative to that without jamming and interference) should also be small, without any consequence on range safety.  The proposed program will quantify the accuracy achievable in individual position measurements, and the utility of combining the measured positions of multiple antennas for purposes of antenna pointing, docking maneuvers, and attitude determination.<BR>In order to transition the proposed technology to NASA, the DoD, and commercial markets, we plan to team with The Boeing Company in Phase II and beyond.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
			The principal NASA application of the proposed technology is making GPS metric tracking for the Constellation Program's Ares launch vehicles robust to interference with and jamming of the GPS signals.  Effective GPS metric tracking is a crucial component in the success of NASA's autonomous flight safety system and its space-based range demonstration and certification project. <BR>	Besides the Ares launch vehicles, the same range safety technology applies directly to the United Launch Alliance Atlas V and Delta IV launch vehicles, and to the SpaceX Falcon 1 launch vehicle.  Through the use of position measurements at multiple locations on the launch vehicle, the technology may also apply to antenna pointing, docking maneuvers, and attitude determination.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
			The most likely non-NASA customer is the Department of Defense.  The most direct application is for range safety in the Common Range Integrated Instrumentation System (CRIIS).  However, other DoD applications constitute much larger markets.  Platforms that are small or unusually shaped are especially promising candidates.  These include Small Diameter Bomb and its variants; A-160 Humming Bird helicopter, High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) aircraft; and Scan Eagle UAV.<BR>Many nonmilitary missions could be enabled by a UAV that could safely fly autonomously in civilian airspace.  Extensive efforts are already underway to develop guidance and collision avoidance sensors to enable autonomous UAV flight in civilian airspace.  Effective guidance depends on the availability of GPS signals.  Cost and weight considerations preclude use of a CRPA.  Hence, without the proposed approach, the UAV would be extremely vulnerable to being blinded by an inexpensive jammer or by inadvertent interference.<BR>

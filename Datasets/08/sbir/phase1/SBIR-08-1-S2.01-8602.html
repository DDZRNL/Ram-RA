		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A method is propsed to develop a sensor fusion process for blending GPS/IMU/EO data for fault tolerant rendezvous and docking of spacecraft.  The methodology takes advantage of analytic redundancy between the GPS and EO sensor technology.  Using advanced fault detection, identification, and reconfiguration (FDIR) technology, the method will guarantee navigation functionality in the presence of failures in either the GPS or the EO sytsem guaranteeing safety of operations in the safety critical docking operation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This system has applications to a variety of formation flight technologies including providing high precision relative position, velocity, and attitude information between multiple vehicles reliably and with high integrity.  The system is most applicable to any situation in which two vehicles are attempting to dock while in space. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This system has applications to space craft, communication satellites, and military applications requiring precision formation flight.  It is also applicable to other precision and high integrity applications such as automated aerial refueling and automated landing.  
		<P>
		<P>
		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

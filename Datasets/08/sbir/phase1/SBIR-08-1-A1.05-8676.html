		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		eSky will develop specific crew state metrics based on the timeliness, tempo and accuracy of pilot inputs required by the H-mode Flight Control System (HFCS).  Specific scenarios will be developed which define required inputs by the pilot and metrics of timeliness, tempo and accuracy will be developed for each required input.  An existing HFCS simulator will be enhanced to support the full scenarios and crew state metric capture.  Human subject testing will validate the stability of the metrics in normal situations and the responsiveness of the metrics to crew state degradation due to high workload.  Strategies for continuous real-time function allocation to crew and automation will be developed.  At the end of phase 1 crew state monitoring metrics will be at TRL 4/5.  In phase 2 we will incorporate these metrics and strategies into the HFCS simulator and evaluate the usability and validity of these metrics and strategies using both workload and hypoxia as means of controlled crew state degradation.  At the end of phase 2 metric-based function reallocation will be implemented in a collaborative flight control system ready for incorporation into a full motion simulator at TRL 5.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Crew state monitoring through performance-based metrics will be applicable to any manned flight, whether of aircraft or spacecraft.  The metrics could be used for simple crew monitoring or embedded in a collaborative flight control system that bases assignment of specific functionality to crew or automation on the measured crew functional state.  Specific applications include:<BR>1.	Orion crew monitoring on space flight missions <BR>2.	Space shuttle crew monitoring<BR>3.	Crew monitoring on any NASA aircraft<BR>4.	Enhancement of any Flight Management System on any NASA aircraft.<BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Over-the-horizon communications and information networks are beginning to produce sustainable capabilities for Earth science operations using advanced unpiloted vehicles.  There is a growing need for affordable desktop access to globally deployable data acquisition and data processing sensor-web networks on board these airborne platforms.  Central to meeting this need is further miniaturizing on-board computing, data acquisition, and satellite network communication equipment.  With current technology, the associated on-board components weigh several pounds.  We propose to reduce the weight to mere ounces while also lowering cost and power consumption.  This will greatly expand the deployment of this technology to new-generation ultra-small unmanned air vehicles, other space and weight-constrained airborne systems, and a wide range of terrestrial applications. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA vision for a Global Test Range (GTR) will be greatly enhanced through the significant miniaturization and portability of the Suborbital Telepresence and REVEAL technology.  This will open up its utility and lower its cost to enable deployment on a wider range of unmanned air vehicle (UAV) and other remotely deployable sensor web platforms.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The flagship non-NASA commercial application will be micro-UAV over-the horizon control and communication for military, homeland security, and law enforcement surveillance.  Other commercial applications include remote environmental sensing by science researchers as an extension and enhancement to the activities of the Open Source DataTurbine community.<BR>Extremely miniaturized data acquisition and recording equipment with wireless satellite network connectivity will have a broad range of benefits and commercial applications for both land and airborne vehicular-borne recording systems for remote sensing such as surveillance and security.<BR>

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

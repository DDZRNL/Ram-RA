		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Recent advances in airport surface surveillance and other sensor, automation, and data sharing technologies now allow the consideration of a significant change in the control paradigm for aircraft and vehicles on the airport surface. Through the use of airport surface surveillance displays, and other computer information systems, it is conceptually possible to provide ATC services without the ATC tower. This Virtual Tower concept has been identified as a primary component of the Joint Planning and Development Office operational concept for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). Remote video surveillance of the airfield is likely to play a key role in any such Virtual Tower implementation. However, significant research on computer vision and video surveillance capabilities to support the Virtual Tower concept must first be addressed. These video surveillance capabilities will also provide information to support flight and airport status monitoring. Mosaic ATM proposes to research and develop image processing algorithms to integrate video and airport surface surveillance data to enable NASA researchers to conduct detailed evaluation of fundamental issues associated with the Virtual Tower concept.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This proposed effort will provide a design and initial prototype of the Future Airportal Research Environment. This environment will be available for use by NASA to support the study of future airport ATC operational concepts. The completion of the project objectives and tasks will allow major advances in NASA's research capability, and will be a catalyst for even greater steps in NASA's airportal research program. Through this research, critical enhancements for the prediction of flight push-back times will be researched and prototyped. The deployment of such capabilities would provide significant benefit to the Traffic Flow Management system in reducing demand uncertainty and enabling better planning. The integration of the computer vision capabilities into an advanced ATC Tower automation system will provide additional required data to support SMS operation that is not available through other means. For example, if an aircraft pushes back from its gate without turning on its transponder or ADS-B system, it will be 'invisible' to airport surface multi-lateration systems without some other means of detection. Optical recognition and tracking is a much more cost-effective means of such recognition and tracking than existing airport surface radar equipment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary non-government commercialization of this technology that we will pursue is as a product for airlines and airports to use to monitor the operation on the airport surface. By using this surveillance capability, improved planning and operations can be conducted on the airport surface.<BR><BR>In addition to the aviation market, Mosaic ATM is already pursuing other markets and business opportunities for the computer vision technology. Key market areas that Mosaic ATM has identified for pursuit include security and education. Our approach to each of these markets is to use the future airportal concept prototype that will be developed in this effort with a focus on the aviation sector, as a demonstration capability and test-bed for applications to other markets.<BR>The computer vision processing for integration of video and surveillance data can be directly extended to numerous security surveillance applications including building, airport, border, battlefield, and other security surveillance needs. Through the use of the virtual tower concept and extended video surveillance, security personnel will be able to perform their monitoring tasks more efficiently and effectively.<BR>

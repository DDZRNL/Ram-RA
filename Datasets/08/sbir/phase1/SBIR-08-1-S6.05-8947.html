		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In typical, multi-organizational networking environments, it is difficult to define and maintain a uniform authentication scheme that provides users with easy access to required information while maintaining the security and integrity of the underlying information.  This proposal offers a unique and innovative architecture for doing so through the utilization of a Proxy Service Listener (PSL) and the implementation of a customized Domain Name Service (DNS) server.  The PSL provides a centralized authentication function that acts as a credentialing authority for all network services, thereby enabling a single sign-on mechanism for all services/servers operating within the framework.  This allows the implementation of a centralized access control infrastructure; yet, each service has the option to determine the access controls for its clients.<BR><BR>Conforming to the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) paradigm, the proposed solution has multiple benefits.  It provides the means for NASA to offer a uniform access methodology to its large number of distributed end users.  The proposed solution also provides protection against Denial of Service (DOS) attacks and an effective means for comprehensively monitoring usage of shared networking resources for security auditing and accounting purposes.  It can be used to manage connections between services/applications just as effectively as between end users and applications/services.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal should have broad relevance to NASA, given the large number of end users involved in its various research and operational activities; its complex and distributed organizational structure; and its need to collaborate with other, outside organizations.  The solution should be particularly useful to the NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and all its four (4) divisions.  For the Planetary Science and Astrophysics divisions, this proposal should provide effective and easy access to very large volumes of data collected over time from earth and space based systems, to a large number of researchers within NASA and outside.  Similarly, for the Earth Sciences and Heliophysics divisions, this proposal should assist in their more "real-time" efforts to engage a wide range of experts in the analysis of weather changes and the short-term impact of solar activity on our atmosphere.  Fundamentally, the proposed solution will bring together the diverse, and widely dispersed, community of NASA researchers, each with varying requirements for network access.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The total potential market for the solution in this proposal is very large.  The solution could fall in the generic categories of "middleware", "business process management", "business integration software solutions", "Software-as-a-Service" (SaaS).  <BR>Specifically, the proposed solution is relevant to the following key markets:<BR><BR>· Scientific Research:  Uniform, secure access to large quantities of data distributed across multiple datasets and dispersed geographically.<BR><BR>· Homeland Security:  Secure, rapid, effective access to large number of distributed data-sources for individual specific and instance specific screening information.<BR><BR>· Law Enforcement:  Reliable, secure exchange of criminal records between law enforcement agencies.<BR><BR>· Healthcare:  Reliable, secure exchange of patient information between physicians, hospitals, insurance companies, other service providers.<BR><BR>· Financial:  Secure, effective access to, and exchange of, sensitive financial information between financial institutions and individuals, and between financial institutions.<BR><BR>· Procurement/Supplier Management:  Secure, effective management of a large number of partners for large organizations and government agencies like Department of Defense (DOD).<BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A fiber-based fixed-array laser transmitter can be combined with a fiber-arrayed detector to create the next-generation NASA array LIDAR systems. High speed optical fiber multiplexers allow array LIDAR systems to efficiently share the same laser source. Boston Applied Technologies, Inc. (BATi) propose to develop an electrically switched, OptoCeramic<SUP>REG</SUP> based switch/multiplexer for 200micron core multimode fiber. OptoCeramic<SUP>REG</SUP> is the state-of-art electro optic material with high electro-optic coefficient, fast response speed and low loss. The innovative optical designs direct the laser into one of many possible output fibers. The main features of proposed high speed fiber multiplexer include ultra-high switching speed, low insertion loss, low power consumption, high power handling capability, compact packaging and scalability.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed switching technology can provide laser imaging with a shaped field of view for an enhanced lidar return signal and image resolution. The solid-state structure, ultra-fast speed, and high power handling will make the device suitable for working with the high power fiber lasers in the next generation space systems and instruments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to the application for NASA LIDAR system, the proposed high speed optical switches will have advantages in the fiber optic communications, remote sensing and bio-medical imaging systems. In addition, the proposed switch will be useful for all-fiber optical link and high power lasers.

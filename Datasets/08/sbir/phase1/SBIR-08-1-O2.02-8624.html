		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The on-ground and Distributed Rocket Engine Testing Health Monitoring System (DiRETHMS) provides a system architecture and software tools for performing diagnostics and prognostics for supporting NASA's Integrated System Health Management (ISHM) capability for rocket engine testing and ground operations. DiRETHMS architecture consists of a hierarchical, modular, scalable, and flexible system structure for performing ISHM. A core version of the system will be demonstrated during the Phase I effort by performing diagnostics of auxiliary components in rocket engines. The building blocks of the DiRETHMS are: (a) Advanced Embedded Smart Sensors (AESS); (b) Health Monitoring Nodes (HMN), (c) Health Manager Unit (HMaU), and (d) Application Server with Man Machine Interface Man Machine Interface (AS-MMI). DiRETHMS architecture will provide a logic organization for embedding diagnostics at the following levels: (1) smart sensors based on UNCU; ( (3) Robust monitoring/diagnosis subsystem; and (4) system level Prognosis.  The significant innovations of this project are: (1) Capability to provide the user with an integrated awareness about the condition of every element in the system, (2) Very flexible architecture of smart sensors that comply with state of the art standards for easy integration and customization, (3) System configuration for support root-cause analysis, and (4) Object-Oriented Bayesian Network for Uncertain Inference.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The DiRETHMS system (and subsystems) will directly support NASA's Integrated System Health Management (ISHM). It can be used for a wide range of NASA's space transportation propulsion systems for performing rocket engine testing (ground operations). Examples of application areas include: NASA's Space Shuttle Propulsion system, International Space Station, and Launch Vehicle development among others.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		On-ground maintenance processes in commercial and military aircraft. DiRETHMS can be customized for a wide range of machinery application areas (such as industrial and maritime). Examples of specific applications are turbines and machinery.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The EVA digital radio imposes tight constraints on power consumption, latency, throughput, form factor, <BR>reconfigurability, single event upset and fault tolerance, and security. This requires a complete rethink on<BR>the digital radio architecture. We propose such an architecture called CHANDRA that exploits a cycle-by-cycle reconfigurable FPGA that is based on state-of-the-art double-gate CMOS and nano RAM technology. In order<BR>to make the FPGA, and hence CHANDRA, ultra-low power, we will investigate various FinFET implementations,<BR>3D architectures, and dynamic power/QoS management techniques. This will be aided by the presence of<BR>nano RAMs, such as NRAMS, MRAMs, PCMs and embedded DRAMS, for on-chip configuration and data storage.<BR>The FPGA will be implemented with the currently used chip fabrication technology: photo-lithography.<BR>We propose to map novel non-GPS relative location-aware algorithm based on a hybrid distributed localization concept, multimode protocol functioning for voice (VoIP), video, data transmission, and run digital radio applications starting from the simulation level to relevant environment demonstration towards providing the miniaturized EVA Digital Radio.

		<BR>
		EVA digital radio for lunar outpost surface operations under stringent requirements in terms of power efficiency, performance, form factor, adaptivity, fault tolerance, security and built-in navigation capability with a novel non-GPS relative location-aware algorithm based on a hybrid distributed localization concept facilitating multimode <BR>protocol functioning for voice (VoIP), video, 3D and High definition data transmission with QoS-aware packet-level power management for digital radio applications on an optimized, ultra-low power and miniaturized digital radio.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Novel ultra-low power architectures and platforms for bandwidth intensive applications such as voice-over IP (VoIP), video, data transmission, High Definition TV with optimized digital radio  applications for the commercial Communications Industry and other Govt. agencies such as DoD and DHS for their mission critical operations as a light weight, high performance digital radio. The upcoming 4G industry in the Wireless Communications domain will have a significant need for such a Digital Radio that we propose under the name CHANDRA (Compact, Hi-performance and Agile Nano Digital Radio)

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed innovative insulation would greatly enhance the usability of, and reduce the inherent losses associated with, cryogenic fuel delivery and storage apparatus. The proposed insulation has been tested to yield a thermal conductivity value of 0.019w/mK @ one inch format @ an areal density <1pcf. In addition, the ability of the proposed insulation to remain highly flexible at extreme cryogenic temperatures for extended periods of time is unique. Testing done by KSC on early forms of this material proved its ability to remain flexible in continuous cryogenic applications in outside environments.  However, degradation of the foam was observed over extended periods. In this Phase I, GFT proposes to test the hypothesis that it can significantly improve the earlier material's long-term durability through altered synthesis and imidization processes.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications include insulating flexible earthbound and in-flight cryogenic transfer lines, cryogenic pumps, earthbound cryogenic storage tanks and vessels, in-flight fuel tanks, flexible in-flight deployed arrays, and insulation for modular deployed structures. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications include thermal and acoustic insulation for DOD and commercial aerospace and marine entities; thermal-acoustic deadener for the automotive industry; flame resistant acoustic foam for the entertainment industry; acoustic and flame resistant ceiling tiles for building construction; cryogenic insulation for the LNG and Hydrogen production and transport industries; and home attic and wall insulation once the product matures in its lifecycle.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal seeks to investigate the use of a novel high strength nanostructured metal (Nanovate<SUP>TM</SUP>) as a thin structural reinforcing shell on ultra-lightweight carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) propellant and cryogenic storage tanks.  In the proposed project, Integran seeks to address the intrinsic deficiencies of CFRP by applying nanometal to the inside liner of the CFRP cryogenic storage tanks to provide a high strength pressure barrier with excellent mechanical performance and damage tolerance at cryogenic temperatures, thereby enabling the use of CFRP for cryogenic storage tanks.  In addition, the nanometal liner will also provide increased surface durability, wear resistance and specific strength/stiffness of the CFRP substructure at cryogenic, ambient and elevated temperatures (temperatures at which conventional composites begin to soften).  The high strength of the nanostructured material will allow a thin structural reinforcing coating, thus maintaining the overall lightweight nature of the component.  The successful execution of this project will provide a proof-of-concept demonstration as well as baseline mechanical property data for nanometal/composite hybrid structures at a range of temperatures, thereby allowing engineering designers to incorporate the use of these structures into advanced engineering components, including cryogenic storage tanks.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology has application within NASA for use with cryogenic storage tanks, composite overwrapped pressure vessels, satellite propellant tanks.  The proposed Nanometal/Composite hybrid structures also have applicability to where composite structures require enhanced functionality such as: wear resistance, reflectivity, EMI shielding, hardness, damage resistance, material compatibility.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology also has applicability to more conventional pressure vessels such as fireman's air tank or gas storage cylinders.  While fiber reinforced plastics composites have incredible strength to weight characteristics, there are many potential applications which would benefit from a hard nanostructured metallic coating for wear resistance, reflectivity, EMI shielding, hardness, damage resistance, material compatibility.  Additional markets which may benefit from the use of a nanometal/FRP composite include: sporting goods, defense, automotive, consumer goods and electronics.

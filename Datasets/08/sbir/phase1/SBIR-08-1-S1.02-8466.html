		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The NRC Decadal Survey recommended the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission to address terrestrial fresh water hydrology and physical oceanography science questions. The proposed effort will develop a low-cost, Ka-band, multi-temporal baseline radar sensor designed to fly on high altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (Global Hawk) and acquire phenomenology (i.e. temporal, coherence, near-nadir scattering cross-section and vegetation attenuation) measurements in support of the SWOT mission. To realize this sensor, innovations in the sensor design, transceiver digital receiver and antenna are required. The Phase I will result in a system design for these subsystems that can be realized in a Phase II effort. During the Phase I, analytic studies and modeling will be performed to demonstrate feasibility and to perform the necessary tradeoffs.   Leveraging a high altitude, FPGA-based digital receiver system developed by RSS and its development system, the digital receiver capabilities will be extended and initial laboratory testing performed. The Phase II effort will realize a prototype of this sensor.At the end of the Phase I, a technology readiness level of 3 will be achieved.

		<BR>
		The NRC Decadal Survey recommended the SWOT mission for 2015. RSS proposes to develop a multi-temporal baseline, near-nadir Ka-band sensor (KaSPAR) that will gather critical data for SWOT mission design and planning over specific science targets.  In particular, the KaSPAR's measurements would help characterize cross section and decorrelation of near nadir Ka-band observations of water bodies in low wind conditions and the effects of vegetation cover as a function of type and density on near nadir surface cross section measurements of water bodies. As such, RSS will target NASA and JPL as potential customers for this instrument. The KaSPAR could also serve as the basis for developing low-cost calibration/validation sensors for the SWOT mission. Once again, NASA would be the intended customer for such an instrument.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The KaSPAR system could serve as the basis to develop a Ka-band radar interferometer for mapping topology of water bodies. Being able to deploy such a sensor for the Global Hawk or other high altitude aircraft would enable rapid deployment of the sensor to any area within the continental United States in the event of significant flooding. Such information would be invaluable to NOAA and FEMA. Currently, NOAA is actively pursuing activities to develop a Global Hawk weather reconnaissance program to address these needs associated with severe weather. RSS will pursue these programs within NOAA as potential customers.

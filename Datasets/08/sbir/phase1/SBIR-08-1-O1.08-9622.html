		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Innovative network architecture, protocols, and algorithms are proposed for both lunar surface networks and orbit access networks. Firstly, an overlaying architecture is proposed to seamlessly integrate lunar surface networks and orbit access networks. Secondly, for lunar surface networks, a network architecture based on hybrid mesh networking technologies is developed to support both fixed and mobile nodes on the lunar surface. It supports autonomous network coverage extension via ad hoc networking capability. Link adaptation algorithms provide automatic link configuration and ensure constant high link quality in a dynamic harsh environment. To support QoS of heterogeneous traffic types, a QoS oriented MAC protocol with scalable throughput performance is proposed. A hybrid routing protocol is also proposed to enhance routing efficiency and dramatically improve the reliability of ad hoc networking. Thirdly, for orbit access networks, a dynamic delay and disruption-tolerant networking (DTN) routing protocol is designed by integrating DTN and mobile ad hoc network (MANET) reactive routing. It is disruption tolerant and capable of supporting intermittent links. Finally, beacon based communications serve as the remedy to handle the emergent situation where neither lunar surface network nor orbit access is available.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technologies can support lunar exploration and will be used to provide lunar surface networking and robust orbit access networks. Similar application scenario can be found even in Earth environment, where the surface network will be on the Earth surface and the orbit access will be from Earth to its satellite. The same technologies can be applied to the explorations of other stars like Mars and also to any deep-space communication networks. They will become critical building blocks of Inter-Planetary Internet. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The same technologies can be adapted to DoD applications. For example, a communication network formed by both planes and ground battling units is similar to the integrated system of lunar surface networks and orbit access. <BR>On the non-government market, the most promising application areas will be IEEE 802.11 mesh networks, IEEE 802.16 mesh networks, and their integrated systems. The technologies will draw tremendous attentions from service providers, chipset companies, and networking software companies. The hierarchical architecture and routing protocol for IEEE 802.11 and 802.16 mesh networks will provide viable solutions for service providers to deploy cost-effective and reliable wireless mesh networks. The dynamic DTN routing protocol will also find good applications in system integration between satellite communications and wireless mesh networks.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Radiation shielding is an enabling technology required for extended manned missions to the Moon, Mars and the planets beyond. Multifunctional structural must protect crew in a spacecraft, crew exploration vehicle, landers, rover, or habitat from Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR), Solar Energy Particles (SEP) and micrometeroid impact and at the same time keep both the weight of the structure and the cost of fabricating the structure to a minimum. Materials Modification, Inc. (MMI) proposes to develop and evaluate a series of versatile, novel, multifunctional hybrid structural composites comprised of a high hydrogen epoxy matrix

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		These new lightweight, high performance composites have three key functions: (1) protect astronaut crews from hazardous long-term GCR and SEP space radiation; (2) help fabricate space structural components such as crew exploration vehicles, landers, rovers, habitats, ISS applications, planetary fly-bys and rovers, and any space structural item requiring radiation shielding; and (3) provide protection against impact of meteoroid and space debris. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Applications will focus on commercial aircraft structure and interiors, satellites, wind turbine blades, and ballistic protection for law enforcement officers.  Companies building satellites for commercial communication applications as well as DoD organizations building critical space satellites may be potential customers since these our new materials may be useful in mitigating not only cosmic radiation but also solar radiation so destructive to satellites.

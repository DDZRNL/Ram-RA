		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Effective methods are needed to control pervasive Lunar Dust within spacecraft and surface habitations. Once inside, airborne transmission is the primary mode of dispersion. Inhalation of this fine powder may pose a serious health risk.  Lunar dust may cause degradation of materials, interfere with proper operation of instrumentation & controls, and may prevent formation of adequate seals. To solve this problem, we propose the development of a fully regenerable hypogravity compatible filtration system for removal of Lunar Dust from air, suitable for deployment within the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) and Lunar Outpost (LO). Using microgravity and hypogravity compatible Gradient Magnetically Assisted Filtration/Fluidization Bed (GMAFB) technology, we will develop a fully regenerable Airborne Lunar Dust Filtration System. The system will minimize Equivalent System Mass (ESM) by the elimination of expendables.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA application will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of NASA's return to the moon. The Regenerable Airborne Lunar Dust Filter will be suitable for near term use in the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM), and may later be used in a permanently manned Lunar Outpost.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications include a host of industrial filtration processes which recover value-added materials or which are plagued by excessive particulate loads and therefore require frequent filter change-out. For recovery of value-added materials, the innovation can facilitate recovery of airborne and waterborne particles and then easily produce concentrates of recovered particles.  This application will directly benefit the bio-pharmaceutical industry for recovery of therapeutic agents produced in expanded bed bioreactors, and the mineral processing industry, particularly in hydrometallurgical methods for recovery of gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc, where small incremental increases in overall metal recovery percentages can translate into millions of dollars of increased profit over the life of a particular recovery operation.  The innovation also offers a means of effective treatment of industrial process streams bearing excessive particle loads. A dual filter system offers flexibility in process design and execution, as one filter loads while the other regenerates.

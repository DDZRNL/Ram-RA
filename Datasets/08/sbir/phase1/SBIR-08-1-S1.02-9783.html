		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase-I SBIR proposal proposes for the first time ever, the use of a new class of materials - Gallium Nitride-on-diamond - in the manufacture of very high power, high-temperature, Ka-band solid-state MMICs. In this particular Phase-I, the first ever 34-38GHz GaN-on-Diamond FETs will be demonstrated, exhibiting a record 5-10 W/mm at record efficiency and temperature levels.  Arrays of these FETs will be used to form 10KWatt Power Amplifiers (PA) MMICs in Phase-II.  Polycrystalline free standing CVD diamond  nature's most efficient thermal conductor  enables nearly perfect heat extraction from a "hot" device (Thermal conductivities of GaAs, Si, and SiC are 35W/m/K, 150W/m/K and 390W/m/K respectively; diamond ranges from 1200-2000 W/m/K depending on quality). In the proposed scheme, the device's active epitaxial layers are removed from their original host substrate and transferred to a specially treated low-cost CVD diamond substrate using a proprietary low-cost manufacturable scheme.  The active junction rests just 20-nm from diamond.  The semiconductor-on-diamond technology proposed here may be applied to GaAs, SiC, SiGe, etc. at up to 8" in wafer diameter.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		2-10KW Ka-band (34-36GHz) solid-state Power Amplifiers for use in the manufacture radar equipment.  Radar may be used in SWOT, GLISTIN, clouds and precipitation studies
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		GaN-on-Diamond Power Amplifiers may be used for Base-stations (3G and WiMax).  Also, GaN-on-Diamond wafers ay be used for blue/white LEDs (displays), and Laser Diodes (storage, DVD, litho).

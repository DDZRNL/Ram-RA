		<BR>
		For this project Superior Graphite Co. (Chicago, IL, USA), the leading worldwide industrial carbon manufacturer and the only large scale battery grade graphitic carbon producer in the USA, will develop, explore the properties of, and demonstrate the enhanced capabilities of novel nanostructured SiLix-C anodes, capable of retaining high capacity at a rapid 2 hour discharge rate and at 0oC when used in Li-ion batteries. We have already demonstrated advanced anode materials with the specific capacity of 600 mAh/g, minimal irreversible capacity losses and stable performance. We are confident that by the developing and applying a variety of novel nano-materials technologies, fine-tuning the properties of composite particles at the nanoscale, optimizing the composition of the anodes, and choosing appropriate electrolytes we will be able to revolutionize Li-ion battery technology. In order to achieve such a breakthrough in power characteristics of Li-ion batteries, the team will develop new nanostructured SiLix-C anode materials with dramatically improved capacity and stable cycling performance.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High power Li-ion batteries capable of efficiently operate at low temperature and providing high energy density are needed to power landers, rovers, and extravehicular activities. Development of the proposed anode materials will contribute to the development of such batteries.  
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Power Source for Hybrid Electrical and Electrical Vehicles. High power Li-ion batteries with high specific energy are considered to be the most attractive candidates for new generation of hybrid and electrical engines as well as mobile power tools. <BR>   <BR>Batteries for Electronics. Consumer devices such as laptops, PDAs, smart cell phones, digital cameras, radios, portable DVD players and others are getting more sophisticated and require advanced Li-ion batteries, which can provide more power for longer time while being smaller in size and lighter in weight. <BR><BR>Batteries for Army Missions and Expeditions in Cold Weather. Due to the expected combination of high energy and power densities the developed Li-ion batteries will decrease the weight burden for the soldiers on a mission or travelers to remote and cold locations. <BR>

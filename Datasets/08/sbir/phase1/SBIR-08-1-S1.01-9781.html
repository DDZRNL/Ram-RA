		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA needs high stability laser source of 1W output power for Lidar applications. Princeton Optronics has developed ultra-stable, narrow linewidth diode pumped solid state lasers using stable packaging and high performance locker. We have also developed high power Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) semiconductor laser sources. We propose to develop a high reliability master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) type of source with VCSEL as a master oscillator and a semiconductor optical amplifier to obtain a power level of 1W CW. We would use our laser welded packaging technology to develop a rugged package which could be space qualified. By the end of the SBIR program we plan to develop a CW laser source in MOPA configuration for phase modulation and the packaged unit can be space qualified.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High stability lasers have applications for LIDAR by NASA.  The semiconductor lasers will be low cost and can be used for many other NASA applications including ranging, wavefront analysis, wind speed measurement, surface topography, atmospheric composition analysis and communications. They can be used for remote sensing for entry descent and landing of spacecrafts.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A high stability laser will have a significant market for LIDAR, RF photonics and sensor applications. The users will be military, NASA, homeland security, cable television distribution and oil exploration industry. The total market for ultrastable lasers is currently at tens of millions of dollars. Princeton Optronics will commercialize the product very soon after development.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

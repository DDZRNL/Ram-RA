		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Future space exploration missions present significant new challenges to crew health care capabilities, particularly in the efficient utilization of on-board oxygen resources.  The International Space Station and future exploration vehicles require a light weight, compact, portable oxygen concentrator technology (OCT) that can provide medical grade oxygen from the ambient cabin air.  Current OCTs are heavy, bulky, have a narrow operating temperature range (ambient to 40 degrees C), and require 15 to 30 minutes start-up time to reach their full operating capacity.  Lynntech's proposed electrochemical OCT solves these issues by operating the OCT with a cathode-air vapor feed, unlike conventional electrochemical OCTs which require a liquid water feed.  This is possible due to the use of in-house developed proprietary nanocomposite proton exchange membrane and oxygen reduction/evolution catalyst technologies.  Cathode-air vapor feed operation eliminates the need for a bulky on-board water supply, significantly reduces the complexity of the balance-of-plant, and greatly increases the system efficiency.  Lynntech's OCT will be a quarter the size and weight of conventional OCTs, be capable of instant start-up, and have an operating temperature range of 10 degrees C to 110 degrees C.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Lynntech's lightweight, portable electrochemical oxygen concentrator technology has the potential to provide a compact, robust, on-demand/continuous oxygen concentrating device. Providing lightweight compact oxygen concentrator devices will have applications for NASA, ISS and future exploration vehicles supporting long duration missions that require improved medical capabilities and enhanced on-board resource utilization, particularly oxygen delivery. This technology will enable both ambient pressure operating devices (for portable applications) and pressurized (up to 3000 psia) oxygen concentrator devices (for stationary applications).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A lightweight, portable and/or mobile, oxygen concentrator, and one, in particular, that is capable of delivering minimum 60% humidified oxygen gas at pressures of 5 psi and above, would find many applications in the health services industry.  It is estimated that 2 to 4 million cardiopulmonary patients in the U.S. require supplementary oxygen; approximately 500,000 of which require continuous oxygen therapy. Current means to supply oxygen include compressed oxygen cylinders (heavy and expensive); liquid oxygen (cryogenic and expensive); and molecular sieve-bed oxygen concentrators that use molecular sieve technology. Weight, size, power, and cost requirements for current commercially available oxygen concentrators have been the major hurdles for gaining the market acceptance, thus limited availability to those in need of oxygen therapy. With Lynntech's advanced electrochemical oxygen concentrator technology, this need can be satisfied very easily to improve the quality of lifestyle of those in need of a portable, compact oxygen generator.

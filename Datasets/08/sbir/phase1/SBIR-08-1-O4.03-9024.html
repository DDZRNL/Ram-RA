		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To support extended lunar operations, precision localization and route mapping is required for planetary EVA, manned rovers and lunar surface mobility units.  A process called multilateration is proposed coupled with the use of an IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP).  This protocol was created specifically to address timecode inaccuracies across distributed nodes on a non-deterministic network like Ethernet.  Multilateration is a method widely used for air traffic control.  The innovation is the establishment of a fault tolerant, field scalable, high precision navigation system that can and support the size, weight, and power (SWaP) goals by applying mature technologies to provide an innovative navigation infrastructure while naturally supporting data and voice communications on the same network.  Such a system provides a precise and reliable navigation backbone and establishes a core infrastructure for long term occupation.   Selected key components of the system as defined in the Phase I period will be functionally validated through use of existing Sensis products to validate predicted performance and demonstrate a TRL level 4 is achieved and the end of Phase I.   An end-to-end demonstration would follow at the end of the Phase II period to achieve a TRL level 6.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Technology developed as part of this SBIR will have several NASA applications many of which could later be privatized or sold commercially.  Our products will be used primarily in planetary habitation, exploration, and mining but also have applications in down range tracking systems for lunar, terrestrial, or Mars launch and reentry.  We expect NASA to use our products for initial development of a lunar base and support exploration and mining activities on the moon.  Later these same devices may be used to perform these functions with only minor modification during future planetary exploration.  Progeny's goal is to make the design flexible and built off solid proven technologies wherever possible.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed approach will have other military and commercial terrestrial applications.  Modernization of aging international LORAN infrastructure with a lower power more accurate digital solution stands out as a key cross-promotion for this system.  There is strong domestic and international support for retaining and modernizing the LORAN infrastructure as a backup to GPS.<BR><BR>Modernization of domestic and foreign air traffic control systems with a highly precise and reliable air traffic and runway monitoring system is also a very large opportunity for this technology.  The integration of the IEEE1588 time standard with the Sensis MDS product is expected to improve the accuracy and useful range of the system.  Given precise known coordinates of the nodes in the MDS network, the principal error source is time synchronization.

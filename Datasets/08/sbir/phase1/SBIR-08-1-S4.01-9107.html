		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Based on successful space testing onboard the Midstar1 satellite, Eclipse Electrochromics have been identified by a number of organizations as well as NASA as a high interest technology. For nanosats, the critical design challenge is achieving autonomous control of the EclipseVEDs<SUP>TM</SUP> for spacecraft thermal self regulation without the need for human intervention.  To achieve this goal, Eclipse proposes in Phase I to employ EclipseVED<SUP>TM</SUP> technology and demonstrate automated control systems capable of in-flight thermal regulation of a cubesat or other small satellite. Phase I will include the construction of a single small satellite panel for in-house testing and principally work on the hardware and software required for autonomous regulation.  In Phase II, Eclipse will build a complete multi-panel cubesat and work with Marshall Space Center to lab test a completely functional prototype.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The electrochromic technology and its control systems suggested in the present proposal possess a wide range of  applications relative to the needs of the Agency in satellite, spacecraft and component thermal control, space communications, chemical and biological monitoring of environmental control and  life support systems, and in optical processing of information. The EclipseVED<SUP>TM</SUP> developed by Eclipse Energy Systems, Inc. works as a voltage-controlled variable emissivity device to modify the thermal budget of satellites, spacecraft and space-based systems such as antenna networks, inflatable reflectors and habitable structures.  
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Beyond the use as nanosat systems and the immense market for small space platforms for experiments in the commercial market, the EclipseVED<SUP>TM</SUP> will be sold as an alternative to thermal control louvers prevalent in mid-size to large satellite systems comprising a $15M to $20M market. Typical louver systems add considerable mass to satellites (4kg/m2) in comparison to that associated with an IR ECD (15g/ m2). The use of EclipseVED<SUP>TM</SUP>'s to reduce thermal distortion in space-based antenna networks, reflectors, high altitude airships and habitable structures will reach a market estimated at $60M per annum. The EclipseVED<SUP>TM</SUP> will find application in infrared beam steering for space-based communications, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometers and infrared spatial light modulators for image processing.  <BR><BR><BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Exploration of planetary surfaces will require a communication architecture that supports operational capabilities in which fixed and mobile assets on the planetary surface can communicate seamlessly and securely.  Aeronix understands the issues and believes that it can leverage it knowledge and expertise in its military IEEE-802.16 products towards a space qualified solution. Aeronix is currently developing two technologies that will be directly leveraged.<BR><BR> A 5.8GHz 802.16 based radio developed military wireless communication terrestrial applications.  The radio is designed to support 20 nodes providing 40Mbps using omni-directional antennas.  This is a fully reconfigurable product employing a DSP to configure re-configurable FPGA logic.<BR> The development of a smaller 2.4GHz 802.16 based radio for UAV applications.  Aeronix is currently in fabricating evaluation units that are approximately 10"3 intended video and audio applications.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		IEEE 802.16 (i.e. WiMax) is an industry-lead standard that is being targeted broadly for metropolitan area networks and last mile applications with extended range and high-speed data requirements. Aeronix is investing in 802.16 PHY and MAC intellectual property to address markets such as DoD, NASA, and commercial. Award of this SBIR will extend the capabilities.<BR><BR>Commercial applications include applications that require Aeronix extended Doppler and rotor craft communication capabilities. Examples include air-to-ground commercial wireless LAN's (such as airto-ground Internet access) and ground-to-ground high speed mobile applications (automobiles).  Traditional 802.16 last mile applications are also a market for Aeronix intellectual property and products. <BR><BR>DoD applications include air-to ground and ground-to-ground tactical communications and last mile information distribution (voice, video, and data).<BR><BR>As a means of rapidly bring products to market in volume, Aeronix leverages its expertise and designs to a commercialization partner with strong product manufacturing, support, and product sales capabilities.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA Non-Commercial applications include spaced-based wireless networks, lunar-based wireless networks, and Mars-based wireless networks. Usage models include point-to-multipoint and Mesh networks for communication between base stations, mobile rovers, mobile humans, and sensors.  Equipments supported via this SBIR include base station access points, subscriber stations, wireless bridges, and wireless NICs for radiation environments.<BR><BR>NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.<BR>

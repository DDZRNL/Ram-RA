		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Broadband fan noise  closely tied to turbulent flow on and around the fan blades  represents a key challenge to the noise reduction community due to the interaction of a highly turbulent flow field with complex, moving geometries. Prediction and high-fidelity simulation of fan noise demands a fundamental innovation in CFD methods due to moving geometries and accuracy requirements. The objective this work is to develop a flexible approach to handling multiple, overset grids for use in simulations of turbomachinery. In Phase 1 we will develop an innovative computational software tool for efficiently managing multiple, overlapping structured meshes in relative motion. This application will be used concurrently with a compressible Navier-Stokes solver and is an enabling technology in enabling high-fidelity simulations of turbulent flows in complex, moving geometries. Phase 1 will demonstrate software feasibility using a simplified model of the NASA Glenn Source Diagnostic Test (SDT) fan at realistic take-off conditions. We propose a simulation that includes a moving "rotor" blade row adjacent to a static blade row. Tailored post-processing of simulation results will provide information on the turbulent flow  and implied turbulent noise sources  including unsteady blade surface pressures, acoustic modes, and overall radiated noise. In Phase 2 we focus primarily on broadband turbulent noise sources of modern turbofan engines. By utilizing a realistic NASA SDT fan geometry and take-off flow conditions, we will use our new tools to simulate real-world systems and commercialize our software product.

		A new simulation technology will be available for prediction of turbofan noise, a key issue in the design of all modern civilianand some militaryaircraft. As reflected in the rapidly burgeoning number of airport regulations related to noise, aircraft must be quiet to be operated in populated areas and municipalities and must also be sufficiently quiet to sell in the multi-billion-dollar international market. <BR>NASA applications<BR> New simulation technology available for prediction of turbofan noise<BR> Analytical and consulting services to identify noise mechanisms and predict noise levels in novel designs<BR><BR>

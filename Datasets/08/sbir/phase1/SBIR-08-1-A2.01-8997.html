		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Future hypersonic vehicles will utilize thermal protection system (TPS) designs and propulsion system components that are capable of experiencing high temperatures within oxidative environments during their operation.  These TPS and propulsion system components will include high temperature ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), such as C/SiC and SiC/SiC.  Both hot structure control surfaces and hot wall propulsion system components are two examples of CMCs for which prototype parts have thus far been fabricated and subjected to mechanical performance and/or durability testing.  <BR><BR>Mechanical and thermal performance of these CMC components will benefit from low part count, integrally fabricated designs.  In integrally fabricated designs, the reinforcement preforms have included 3D woven construction.  The advantages of these designs include the elimination of the need for post-fabrication mechanical attachment as well as the higher interlaminar properties offered by the through thickness paths of the fibers within the 3D preform architectures. <BR><BR>The specific innovations MR&D is proposing in this Phase I SBIR program are the following: 1)Extend the capabilities of an existing MR&D 3D preform design code to include material property calculations; 2)Automatically link the MR&D 3D preform design code to provide 3D solid model images of the 3D preform designs using the TexGen  imaging freeware code, and  3)Calibrate the completed code specifically for 3D CMC materials through fabrication, imaging and mechanical property measurements.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology developed here will directly support the design of existing and future NASA space exploration vehicles utilizing CMC materials as hot structure control surfaces and hot wall propulsion system components.   Proposed CMC TPS elements, ranging from thick leading edges to doubly-curved acreage TPS panels, to hot structure control surfaces, will all benefit from the proposed program, if successful.  Hot structure propulsion system components, such as turbojet transition ducts, will also benefit from the proposed effort.  Additionally, the preform design and CMC property prediction code developed in the Phase I program, if successful, may support the development of any hot structure materials used on the Crew Exploration Vehicle and subsequent airframes required for the Mission to Mars.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology proposed in the Phase I program will also be of direct interest to the Department of Defense (DOD) to support the development of CMC scramjets, hypersonic missiles, and maneuvering reentry bodies.  The results are also expected to be of direct interest to programs including the USAF Common Aero Vehicle, and the DARPA Hypersonic Cruise Vehicle.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Developing the self-heated carbon foam tooling technology will not only benefit NASA's current and future missions but will also have significant implications in the commercial aerospace and large boat building industries.  As Boeing is pioneering use of composites in commercial airplane manufacturing, other large airplanes will follow suit, and cost reductions will be critical in these applications.  Demonstrating that large scale composite structures can be produced with OOA technologies, such as carbon foam tooling, Touchstone anticipates that commercial aerospace as well as DoD and commercial shipbuilding will adopt the technology.  At the end of the Phase 2 effort, Touchstone and its prime contractor partners will have demonstrated a large-scale carbon foam self-heated tool and complementary fiber/resin systems that will be applicable to a wide range of non-NASA applications.

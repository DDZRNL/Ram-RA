		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Ongoing work in unconventional air-vehicles, i.e. deformable mold-lines and bio-mimetics, is beginning to provide the insight necessary to exploit performance benefits associated with unsteady flow phenomena.  However, the current generation of conceptual design/analysis tools, based on empirical and heuristic models, is incapable of analyzing advanced concepts with confidence, and a new approach, which exploits recent and ongoing developments in unsteady aeromechanics, is needed.  The proposed effort addresses these shortcomings by developing a hierarchical system of validated variable-fidelity physics-based aeromechanical tools for designing, analyzing and evaluating advanced concepts that employ aerodynamic shape change and other unsteady phenomena.  This suite of state-of-the-art tools will be integrated as a design and analysis system which can rapidly and reliably perform "virtual expeditions" through the design space.  In addition, validated subcomponents, ranging from real-time free-wake analyses and fully-coupled non-linear fluid-structure interaction tools to highly efficient CFD solvers with automated grid generation, will be made available as retrofittable modules for current tools.  The capability to design and evaluate advanced concepts offered by this system directly addresses the long-term aircraft systems development goals of prospective users in both government and industry.  The software will achieve TRL=4 during Phase I and TRL=7-8 by the end of Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed effort directly supports the long-term aircraft systems design and analysis goals of NASA's Fundamental Aeronautics Program by developing a state-of-the-art variable-fidelity physics-based design and analysis system that will encompass validated numerical models for the development and evaluation of advanced conventional and unconventional air-vehicle concepts that exploit aerodynamic shape change and other unsteady flow phenomena for lift, propulsion and noise reduction.  Moreover, unlike the current generation of conceptual design tools, this suite will not rely on linear/empirical techniques or heuristic models and thus will not be constrained by airframe configuration.  Consequently, the proposed system will be able to support current air-vehicle design and evaluation tasks already underway in NASA, as well as future unconventional air-vehicle development efforts under the Fundamental Aeronautics Program.  Additional NASA applications will be made available by the leveraging of emerging research into multidisciplinary technologies for systems level design and optimization.  For example, recent NASA sponsored work developed unsteady flow-control devices to enhance the performance of current generation aircraft; the physics-based nature of the tools proposed here will make them ideal for further developing and optimizing such devices for various applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A successful Phase I/II effort will produce a suite of commercial products for the design, analysis and evaluation of advanced conventional and unconventional air-vehicle concepts that exploit aerodynamic shape change and other non-linear unsteady flow phenomena for lift, propulsion and noise reduction.  This suite would include a complete state-of-the-art variable-fidelity physics-based stand-alone design and analysis system and a set of modular aero-structural analyses that can be coupled to contemporary multidisciplinary aircraft synthesis tools.  Significant commercialization opportunities are anticipated from licensing the new modeling tools and components, as both stand-alone software and retrofittable modules, to major air-vehicle manufacturers and other branches of the government involved in air platform development and support.  In addition, because of the physics based nature of these tools, this suite will be able to support to design and development of emerging technologies such as unsteady flow control devices under development to enhance the performance of current generation air-vehicles.

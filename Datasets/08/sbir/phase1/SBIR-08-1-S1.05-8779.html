		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase I SBIR program is directed toward the development of a novel low-voltage (~10V) AlGaN-based multi-quantum well (MQW) avalanche photodiode (APD) on low-cost substrates.  The high-gain, high-speed and low-noise operation of the proposed device allow the replacement of bulkier and more fragile photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) for many UV photon-counting and imaging applications.  In particular, reduction in size and weight in addition to improvements in reliability and ruggedness compared to PMTs, make this technology very suitable for some of the NASA's planned space missions as well as other civilian and defense applications that require high-sensitivity, solar-blind UV detection.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High performance optical sensors are essentials part of the enabling technology for future space-borne astronomy and planetary missions. The proposed low-voltage, high-gain and low-noise APDs can be a rugged and compact replacement for PMT tubes in many of these applications. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Fabrication of low-cost UV detectors and imaging arrays is very important for many applications including optical communications, medical imaging, polymer curing, air and water purification, and chemical/biological hazard detection.

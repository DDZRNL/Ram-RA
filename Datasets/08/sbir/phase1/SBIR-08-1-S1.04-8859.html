		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address the NASA Earth Science Division need for spatial filter arrays for amplitude and wavefront control, Luminit proposes to develop a novel polarization-preserving Integrated Spatial Filter Array (iSFA) comprising 36 x 36 waveguides and two microlens arrays in a hexagonal configuration. Each waveguide acts as a polarization maintaining single-mode fiber and is precisely mapped to a pair of input/output lenslets. The 36 x 36 waveguides have identical fast and slow polarization axes and can be mass-fabricated to reduce cost and enhance placement accuracy, uniformity, throughput and reliability. The iSFA will be hermetically packaged in a 1 cubic inch box to withstand high radiation and temperature extremes in space. In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of iSFA, which will reduce the development risk of a Phase II 36 x 36 prototype iSFA.  The demonstrated results will offer NASA enhanced nulling coronagraph imaging for detection of planets beyond our solar system with the Terrestrial Planet Finder.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed iSFA will enable deep null with enhanced placement accuracy, uniformity, throughput and reliability.  Monolithic integration and hermetically sealed packaging will make the device suitable for NASA applications including amplitude and wavefront control for Terrestrial Planet Finder and Stellar Imager.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Since it can provide precise amplitude and wavefront control, the iSFA has wide potential non-NASA applications in areas such as free-space optical communications, laser satellite communications, remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and LADAR imager sensors.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

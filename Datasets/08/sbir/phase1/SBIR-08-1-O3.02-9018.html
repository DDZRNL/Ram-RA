		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Astronauts suffer from poor dexterity of their hands due to the clumsy<BR>spacesuit gloves during Extravehicular Activity (EVA) operations and<BR>NASA has had a widely recognized but unmet need for novel human machine<BR>interface technologies to facilitate data entry, communications, and<BR>robots or intelligent systems control. In this proposed Phase I research,<BR>WeVoice, Inc., plans to design, to begin the implementation of, and to<BR>evaluate a speech human interface system. Loud noise and strong<BR>reverberation inside spacesuits make automatic speech recognition (ASR)<BR>for such an interface a very challenging problem. WeVoice proprietary<BR>microphone array signal processing algorithms for speech acquisition<BR>will be taken advantage of. Pros and cons of beamforming vs.<BR>multichannel noise reduction for ASR will be assessed and<BR>recommendations for the best front-end technique will be established.<BR>Using two ASR programs (one based on HTK and the other in C/C++)<BR>that were previously developed at WeVoice, Inc., a number of robust<BR>methods (ranging from feature transformation and normalization to<BR>environmental adaptation) will be validated. In addition, the<BR>feasibility of using throat vibration microphones will be explored.<BR>The Phase I research is also concerned with the compromise of<BR>ASR accuracy and system complexity. A comparative study will be<BR>undertaken between two system implementation structures,<BR>namely wearable and distributed systems. This effort<BR>will form a foundation for prototype design to be<BR>conducted in Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A practical speech human interface will find a number of potential NASA commercial applications:<BR>1. Astronaut data entry systems<BR>2. Spacesuit integrated intelligient systems<BR>3. In-helmet voice communication
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		1. Speech-driven intelligient systems used in military and other noisy environments.<BR>2. Information and computer systems used by disabled persons or people with poor manual dexterity.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The primary purpose of this proposal is to develop and demonstrate a new technology for manufacturing an ultra-low-cost precision optical telescope mirror which can be scaled up for use in very large UV/optical and/or infrared telescopes.<BR>The Phase 1 deliverable will be a 0.25 meter precision mirror. Its optical performance assessment and all data on the processing and properties of its substrate material will be determined.<BR>The unique manufacturing processes employed allow for integration of mirror and support features, significantly increasing both cost reduction and quality improvement potential.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal will demonstrate prototype manufacturing of a precision mirror in the 0.25 to 0.5 meter class, with a specific scale up roadmap to 1 to 2+ meter class system which can be rated for space flight. <BR>Material behavior, processing parameters, optical performance, and mounting techniques will be demonstrated.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology is extensible to commercial telescope optics, as well as telecomm and military optics (eg. lasers). A Phase 2 and Phase 3 outline addresses partnering with key materials suppliers, and key customers in both commercial & miltary market spaces. The size of this market space was determined to be $3.74 B in 2000 [14].

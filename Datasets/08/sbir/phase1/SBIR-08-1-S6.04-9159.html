		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Virtual Globe (VG) systems such as Google Earth, NASA World Winds and Microsoft Virtual Earth provide captivating animated 3D visualizations and support user queries for information at a point. NASA MSFC's VG-based Real Time Mission Monitor (RTMM) enhances management and tracking of field experiment missions. The National Weather Service's RIDGE service uses VG to disseminate radar and support decision assistance. Simpson Weather Associate's Doppler Wind Lidar uses VG technology provided by WxAnalyst to manage field experiment instrumentation and data acquisition in flight.<BR><BR>WxAnalyst has recently prototyped the WxAzygy<SUP>TM</SUP> Interface to couple external applications with Google Earth (GE). Such user applications are inherently unlimited, and can embrace Geographic Information System (GIS) by inclusion of licensed GIS or the OGC GeoTools open source. Full GIS coupling through a transparent and overlaid interface would provide a standard means for complex user operations in the VG environment. The independence of this interface decouples external functions from the VG, can provide security/privacy where needed, and could potentially encourage VG evolution. Our vision for GIS-VG coupling involves the concept of a "focus object" which is mutually shared by the VG and Interface. This focus object is described in GE by KML 2.2. GE interaction is currently supported through an Application Programmer Interface (API) downloaded with each installation.  The GE API could become the basis for a standard and be potentially extended. Possible capabilities in situ with VG include spatial data selection and cross referencing, comparison and cross-correlation of simultaneous and collocated data objects with disparate geometries, and interaction with data servers to acquire, load and subset data "on the fly".  This type of new technology will enable greater utilization of extremely large, complicated, and highly distributed datasets on all spatial scales over large geographic areas.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		1) The WxAzygy Interface supports GIS operations on NASA satellite datasets in a distributed online environment using VG for visualization (e.g. EOS, TRMM, CALIPSO), and encourages use of NASA datasets. Provides support for dataset browsing. Good front end functions for data selection and subsetting prior to downloading.  Provides data analysis capability in situ during browsing.<BR><BR>2) As addition to MSFC's RTMM, proposed interface will add GIS functionality important for cross comparison and analysis of data in situ during field experiments, which can impact experiment strategy and conduct.  Provides GIS functionality in support of Calibration and Validation of satellite programs such as NPP/NPOESS and GOES-R.<BR><BR>3) This product encourages use of NASA VG technologies such as ARC's NASA World Winds.  Provides online access to GIS functions, and therefore brings GIS concepts and functionality to the K-12 environment.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		1) Development and evolution of a standard for VG API.<BR><BR>2) Commercial software component for home and professional use in coordination with a Virtual Globe (VG) of choice, on any compute platform or operating system.<BR><BR>3) Optimization of in situ mobile data acquisition (e.g. airborne Doppler Wind Lidar for fire management in complex terrain); conduct of field data acquisition missions with time-sensitive phenomena or independent correlative measurements/platforms.<BR><BR>4) Encapsulation and delivery of third-party applications to the VG online environment.<BR><BR>5) Delivery of GIS functionality to portable platforms including the hand-held technologies.<BR>

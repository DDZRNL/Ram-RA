		<BR>
		Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) proposes to develop a silicon whisker and carbon nanofiber composite anode for lithium ion batteries on a Phase I program.  This anode provides high capacity, high power, and improved cycle life at a competitive cost.  Silicon is low cost and has a theoretical capacity of 4200 mAh/g but it has a limited cycle life.  The nanocomposite design provides a synergistic improvement in reversible capacity and electrochemical cycling as a result of the unique silicon architecture and structural reinforcement provided by the nanofibers.  In the Phase I program, PSI will demonstrate a technology readiness level of 3 with an anode capacity of greater than 1000 mAh/g for over 100 cycles (100% depth-of-discharge) using 2 mAh cells.  These performance goals will result in an overall battery energy density of greater than 300 Wh/kg.  In the Phase II program, PSI will increase cell size to 2500 mAh and optimize cell design to further improve cycle life.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Energy storage with improved weight and volume performance are required for various NASA applications which are both orbital and planetary surface.  Flight elements of the Exploration Vision initially include the Orion and ARES crew and launch vehicles, respectively. For lunar capability, additional elements include the Lunar Lander or Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM), robotic missions, and surface systems. Surface systems include human habitats, Extravehicular Activities (EVA), science measurements, and the utilization of in situ resources. This lithium-ion battery system has the capability to provide an energy density of greater than 300 Wh/kg with a 5-year calendar year service life.  The battery system contains no toxic materials and lends itself to being human rated for Exploration missions.  These mission applications include portable power for landers, rovers, and astronaut equipment; storage systems for crew exploration vehicles and spacecraft; and stationary energy storage applications such as base power or peaking power applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Rechargeable lithium ion batteries have rapidly become the primary choice to power the next generation hybrid electric vehicles.  These battery packs require large volumes of low cost anode materials that provide higher charge and rate capability than graphite anodes.  This proposal will utilize carbon nanofiber stabilized silicon whisker as active materials that will provide unmatchable capacity and rate capability.  Success in the proposed Phase I research will result in a novel silicon whisker composite anode that can be readily incorporated in lithium ion batteries. The scalable synthesis process would allow the anode to be produced at a sufficiently low cost to allow incorporation in the targeted electric vehicle and bulk energy storage markets.

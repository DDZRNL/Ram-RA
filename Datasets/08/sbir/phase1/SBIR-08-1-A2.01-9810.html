		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		MATECH GSM (MG) proposes 1) to demonstrate a low-cost innovative Hi-Temp Si-doped in-situ BN fiber coating process for advanced ceramic matrix composites in order to eliminate performance barriers that prevent practical use of advanced future NASA aircraft by performing interfacial coating on single fiber tows and fiber preforms that are applicable to the shape and structural requirements of advanced SiC/SiC super- and hyper-sonic components, and 2) to examine and model environmental durability of the fiber coating constituent in various hot-section CMC components. <BR>The CVI coating process is costly and yields a porous non-uniform BN structure due to the low temperatures needed for diffusion and infiltration of the gaseous precursors. MG has discovered a faster, more economical and more versatile process for fiber interface coating formation, reactive-transformation-process (RTP), where the interface coating is formed from the ceramic fiber itself, a new innovative in-situ Si-doped BN-based fiber coating that is more stable during fabrication and service of Si-based CMC. The formation of an in-situ BN surface layer creates a more environmentally durable fiber surface not only because a more oxidation-resistant BN is formed, but also because this layer provides a physical barrier between contacting all single fibers with oxidation-prone SiC surface layers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Future NASA's high-speed super- and hyper-sonic aircraft propulsion / power components, where low-noise, low-emission, high efficiency, and low-weight are crucial requirements. The versatility of this concept makes all high temperature advanced CMC relevant to a variety of hot section propulsion-engine and airframe-control components exposed to high-temperature salt/fog-containing oxidizing environments including combustion liner, HPT vanes/blades, HPT shrouds, hypersonic vehicle guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) components.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A wide rage of aerospace and defense applications that require low-cost material possessing, high temperature oxidation stability, high temperature moisture resistance, high strength, and low mass. These applications include many propulsion and power generating components with the advanced CMC such as hot gas generators, hot gas valves and components, and heat exchangers. Non-defense related uses include industrial high-temperature heat-treatment damage-tolerant furnace heating-element and insulation materials.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		FAA NextGencontrollers can employ the ADS-B datalink to send aircraft flight plans guiding the around traffic conflicts that the on-board system hasn't seen or hasn't resolved quickly by ATC standards. The emergency function that has 2 features; 1, if the on-board system detects an anomaly it will initiate a priority message and datastream to report a potential safety problem to NextGen ATC controllers; 2 in event of rapid airspace congestion issues ATC can use such a priority datalink to re-route the aircraft. This emergency route to the nearest suitable airport will avoid traffic, restricted airspace, weather and terrain.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Phase III goals are to provide a unique safety systems evaluatein for NASA's NextGen Airspace technology development database.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Phase III goals are the development of enormously productive, FAA certifiable, precise, highly automatable, and attractive ADSB-ADS-B-ER.  MUNRO will commercial exploit the LWB process with its MISATS industry partners. There is no other market focused product development effort that has the potential to provide such systems for NextGen.

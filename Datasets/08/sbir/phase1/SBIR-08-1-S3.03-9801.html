		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA requires development of advanced rechargeable electrochemical battery systems for lithium ion batteries to support orbiting spacecraft and planetary missions.  Giner, Inc. proposes to use its proprietary electrolytes to store and deliver power over a 20 year life operating life in geosynchronous (GEO) spacecraft and a 7 year operating life for low-earth-orbiting (LEO).  The exceptional stability of these electrolytes will support the need for the 40,000 charge/discharge cycle requirement.  The electrolyte composition will be optimized to meet the need for planetary missions with power requirements down to -80oC.  Phase I work will evaluate the conductivity and phase behavior of these electrolytes and their performance at low temperatures.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Tai-Yang Research Company (TYRC) of Tallahassee, Florida proposes to build hybrid high-temperature superconducting current leads for space applications, including compact adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR) systems for sensor cooling.  The current leads will be configured to meet NASA mission requirements for a low heat leak in a package optimized for electrical currents up to 10 A.  The novel, proprietary construction by TYRC consists of a tough, flexible cold end section and a high critical temperature warm end section.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The potential commercial application for NASA is for compact, space-based cryogenics, including sensor-cooling adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR) systems.  NASA systems requiring low-temperature electrical current feeds with a low heat leak will be enhanced by incorporating the hybrid high-temperature superconducting current leads proposed.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential commercial applications outside of NASA may be for compact cryogenic systems for magneto-optical imaging (MOI), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Mossbauer spectroscopy, and gyrotron amplifiers.<BR>

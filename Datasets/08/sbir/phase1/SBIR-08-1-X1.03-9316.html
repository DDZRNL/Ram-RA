		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Traditional radiation hardened by process (RHBP) and radiation hardened by design (RHBD) techniques have seen success in mitigating the effects of radiation induced corruption, but are often cumbersome, slow and expensive.  Current RHBP hardening techniques include foundry processing methods which take place at the manufacturing level such as the use of radiation resistant device packaging, radiation doping, and one-time programmable architectures.  To date, RHBP approaches are often unavailable, prohibitively expensive, or too far behind the state of the art for many designers, forcing them to investigate RHBD techniques.  RHBD design methods attempt to mitigate the effects of radiation by integrating principles of redundancy, error correction, and self-testing at multiple levels of the design, including the physical layout of a system function, the programming of the device, and the software running on the device.  Traditional RHBD methods are often flawed when implemented on modern FPGA devices due to unique device architectures and supporting vendor CAD tools.  Luna Innovations Incorporated proposes to develop susceptibility metrics and innovative RHBD methods to minimize the vulnerabilities of reprogrammable FPGAs in radiation prone environments.  Luna will combine these developments into Luna PAR, a software program that optimizes designs for radiation hardening.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Any NASA program or mission with space based platforms would be improved by adding more effective, efficient and less expensive radiation hardened techniques created through the successful completion of this program and any subsequent products and services generated from this research.  The creation of susceptibility metrics will also aid in the evaluation of past and future designs for radiation tolerance.  Susceptibility metrics can also be used to guide and enhance existing FPGA implementation tools.  Luna PAR will integrate with existing tools to enhance radiation hardening in FPGA designs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Successful research and development efforts will generate additional market interest and sales within the DoD marketplace in any space based applications / platforms.  Similarly, any space system manufacturer or commercial industry that relies on space based systems (telecommunications, broadcast television, satellite radio, navigation systems, weather, etc.) would also realize cost reductions through better efficiencies in any value added features provided by Luna Innovations

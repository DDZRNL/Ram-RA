		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A new high capacity rechargeable Li battery anode based on Li metal alloys protected by carbon nanoshells will be developed.  A reversible Li-ion capacity exceeding 600 mAh/g or nearly twice that obtainable with graphite anodes is expected.  Coupled with our advanced polymer electrolyte and high voltage cathode, we expect a fully developed battery to have a specific energy of >150 Wh/Kg, and energy density of >300 Wh/l and the capability to produce >1000 deep charge/discharge cycles and thus makes it very desirable for space power applications of NASA. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Principal NASA applications will include power sources for landers, rovers, deep space probes, satellites and extravehicular activities. Coupled with a suitable electrolyte and cathode, Li-ion cells based on this anode will be adaptable for space exploration-related applications, in moon and other planetary habitats, requiring high specific energy rechargeable batteries with unique attributes such as non-flammability and sub-ambient temperature operation.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The new anodes will result in high performance Li-ion batteries suitable for electric vehicle propulsion and for use in portable consumer products such as cellular phones, portable power tools, cameras and laptop computers.

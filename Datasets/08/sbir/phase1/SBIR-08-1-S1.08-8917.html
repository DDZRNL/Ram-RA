		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A novel design for an in situ atmospheric sensor for CO2 and trace gases is proposed.  The sensor, named AirCore, provides the advantages of existing in situ sensors (e.g. high resolution) but eliminates possible biases in analysis that often originate from imperfect measurement condition.  The AirCore provides a significant savings in cost and weight while increasing the capabilities of existing in situ sensors.  The AirCore system consists of the AirCore gas sampler and the support system to accomplish its high altitude (nominally 70,000 ft.) mission.   This support system includes the sensor launch and recovery components.  The AirCore can be launched and recovered by a crew of two which reduces the operational cost of the system.   
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology can be used for validating satellite data and providing data for weighting functions used for satellite-based remote sensors.  It can also be used to provide an inexpensive alternative for atmospheric sampling when high altitude data is required (nominally 70,000 ft).
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology can be used to support federal, state, and academic projects in airborne measurements, including climate modeling and earth/environmental science.  The system can also be used for pollution monitoring and as ground truth/verification for carbon credt trading, which is an emerging enterprise.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

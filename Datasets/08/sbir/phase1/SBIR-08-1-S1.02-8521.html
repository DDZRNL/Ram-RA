		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Remote Sensing Solutions will evaluate the critical parameters and generate a design approach for a portable, all-weather multi-wavelength antenna system suitable for supporting GPM ground validation and for use in other NASA cloud and precipitation research programs. The antenna system will have a number of unique characteristics including high gain (approximately 1 deg half-power beam width) and matched antenna beam shapes. The antenna will support multiple frequencies used for cloud and precipitation sensing. The basic design will provide Ku-band (14 GHz) and Ka-band (35 GHz) channels that can support a variety of polarization and absorption-based rain retrieval algorithms. An additional 95 GHz channel will be considered to augment the cloud-sensing capabilities of the antenna and to allow particle sizing in clouds. The antenna will have extremely high cross-polarization isolation suitable for identifying ice cloud particle habit.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology is directly relevant to satellite validation work that NASA will conduct for the Global Precipitation Mission (GPM). The antenna is a key element for developing a ground validation radar that will provide high quality data to support multiple algorithms that derive precipitation rate from polarization and differential absorption measurements. Radars such as DPR can be adapted to work in conjunction with the antenna to provide a complete precipitation sensing system for GPM and other NASA and non-NASA research programs.<BR><BR>Although the CloudSat mission will end before deployment of this technology proposed future cloud research missions would also benefit from the proposed activity as the ultra-low cross-polarization characteristic of the antenna will allow improved discrimination of cloud and precipitation phase (ice/snow). CloudSat can measure precipitation and there is strong interest in further developing sensors that can measure both clouds and precipitation.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology developed will benefit the greater weather research community by allowing weather radar systems to more precisely quantify precipitation. This will allow improvements algorithms used in space-borne and in long range ground-based cloud and weather radars. <BR><BR>Participation in programs such as GPM will provide worldwide exposure for the antenna technology that is proposed, which will provide RSS with an opportunity to market a standard product to the global weather research community.<BR><BR>Adapting the technology to other radar wavelengths in future efforts will also allow RSS to market to the operational weather research community using long and medium range weather radars.<BR>

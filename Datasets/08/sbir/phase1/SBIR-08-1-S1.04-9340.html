		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		SETI proposes to develop GaN and Si based multicolor FIR/THz cameras with detector elements and readout, signal processing electronics integrated on a single chip. <BR><BR>The active detector elements will be submicron gated channels with 2 dimensional electron gas (2DEG). The devices with gated 2DEG (commonly known as field-effect transistors) respond to the incoming FIR radiation due to the rectification of radiation induced oscillations of electron density (electron plasma). Phase I of the project will be devoted to the development, design, and characterization of the single pixel, consisting of an array of field-effect transistors, targeting at responsivity increase of 100 times, and demonstrating the technical feasibility of 10^10 cm Hz^0.5/W detectivity.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We develop detectors for far infrared (FIR) range which provides information on emissions from cold dust, molecular clouds, and contains the cold space background, usually referred to as the relict radiation (2.783 ± 0.025 K). The specific signatures in the FIR spectral range provide the information on temperature, pressure and velocities of the gases involved; in other word, the essential information, valuable for modern theories of star and galaxies formation and evolution. Our plasma wave approach will provide superior advantages over commercial FIR/THz cameras on cost, speed, resolution, and sensitivity performance.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Our proposed FIR camera is also suitable for study of upper Earth atmosphere, such as mapping the famous ozone holes. The potential applications of the THz waves (radiation with the wave lengths from 1 mm to 10 &#956;m) also include detection and identification of harmful biological and chemical agents, explosives, biomedical imaging, defectoscopy, and Earth atmosphere exploration.

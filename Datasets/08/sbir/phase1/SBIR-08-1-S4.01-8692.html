		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		As minimum cost will be required for a dedicated NanoSat Launch Vehicle, a series and parallel staged, highly modular vehicle architecture is proposed for design exploration.  The principal advantage of a modular architecture on this size vehicle is a single propulsion development at a relatively small scale which drastically shortens development timelines and cost.  A candidate launch vehicle could use 7 modules for the first stage, 4 for the second, 2 for the third, and 1 for the fourth.  Whittinghill Aerospace proposes to investigate many modular designs for 3, 4, and 5 stage vehicles of different (solid, liquid, and hybrid) propellant types.  Structural, aerodynamic, propulsion, and control configurations of vehicles will be optimized and "flown" with a trajectory tool to evaluate performance.  After trades and analyses are completed and designs ranked, the resulting optimum module size will then be built and tested at an anticipated 1 to 3Klb thrust level.  At the conclusion of Phase 1, the technology will be ready for flight development and will be at a TRL level of 5.  At the end of Phase 2, a full-scale, 2-stage sub-orbital modular vehicle will have flown.

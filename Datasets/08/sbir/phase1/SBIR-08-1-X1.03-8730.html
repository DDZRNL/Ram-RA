		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase I SBIR proposal seeks funding to develop a radiation-hardened circuit architecture to achieve SEU and SEL immunity by using delay-insensitive asynchronous logic, and to demonstrate its feasibility, effectiveness, and efficiency. Further, early studies reveal that an operational temperature range of 2K to 400K will be highly feasible. Delay-insensitive asynchronous logic removes the concept of a global clock by incorporating handshaking protocols to control the circuit. The handshaking protocols allows for flexible timing requirements, high power efficiency, and low noise/emission generation. The flexible timing nature of delay-insensitive logic makes this type of circuits an excellent candidate for mitigating radiation effects in digital electronics. Compared to the existing radiation-hardening techniques, the proposed solution has several substantial benefits including cost efficiency, SEU/SEL immunity without weak points, and the ability to retain data during power cycling while mitigating SEL. In addition, significantly improved supply voltage variation sustainability and security against power-based side-channel attacks can also be achieved.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Early applications for the proposed technology are limited to space and defense electronics in which detrimental ionizing radiation environment effects must be mitigated and/or in which broad, low temperature operation is required, e.g. 2K - 400K.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		However, once mature and due to the low cost nature of processing that may be utilized to fabricate the device, commercial applications are more feasible, especially those involving harsher terrestrial environments,e.g. defense, homeland security, etc.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose the development and space qualification of a high reliability frequency-stabilized CW laser source at 1064 nm wavelength region to satisfy the requirements of this SBIR subtopic opportunity.   Our recommended approach is based on extensive experience developing and using single frequency laser source in the near infrared, both for NASA, DoD and aerospace/commercial applications. Our technical approach built on emerging technology spawned by the telecom industry, which has reached it maturity level such that space qualification of the propose laser can be undertaken.  NASA requires proposed laser source for various missions under planning, including LISA, ICESat, LIST, etc.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has been planning many space missions, in which a space-qualifiable high reliability frequency-stabilized CW laser source will play an important role. These missions include LISA (Laser Interferometric Space Antenna), ICESat (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite), LIST (Doppler Wind Lidar, Lidar for Surface Topography) ASCENDS (Earth and planetary atmospheric composition) and upgraded GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiments), terrestrial and space-based distributed aperture telescopes, interferometric instruments such as SIM and TFP (Space Interferometer Mission and Terrestrial Planet Finder) and general space-based metrology.  All of these missions require laser sources with space qualification, high reliability, frequency stabilized having wavelengths in the region between 1.06 micron and 1.5 micron.  Several near-term missions also require single frequency seed or local oscillator laser source with MHz linewidth, the requirement the proposed laser source can meet.  These missions include global Doppler winds lidar and coherent sensing of atmospheric constituents such as CO2 and water vapor.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential commercial applications include:  1) Laboratory use of frequency-stabilized lasers; 2) Developmental work on the future flight systems; 3) Ground based telescope with adaptive optics; 4) Interferometry; 5) Spectroscopy instrumentation and science requiring an absolute wavelength standard; 6) Dye laser replacement scientific lasers; 7) injection seed laser requiring ultra-stable frequency stability.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

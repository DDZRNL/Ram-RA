		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A feasibility analysis of adding a second modality to pilot/Air Traffic Control (ATC) communications. The real time availability of text in Air Traffic Control ground systems and pilot displays promises improvements in the safety and efficiency of pilot/ATC communication. The improvements would be especially applicable in high density/high workload environments such as low altitude terminal operations(<10,000ft) and airport ground operations.<BR><BR>The phase 1 evaluation consists of the design of a conceptual systems model of the human-technology interface, an assessment of independent variables that affect information processing skills and a test of dual modality communications to show the impact of a second modality on task performance.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Safety statistics show that 1 runway incursion or close call occurs each day in the US alone. In addition, air traffic volume is reaching a saturation point putting a strain on the system and its users. Long lines on the tarmac, wasted fuel and increasing congestion that threaten safety and efficiency.<BR>The technology addressed in this proposal will fill a gap in the Trajectory Based Operations by providing a system and method for unambiguous communication between pilots and Air Traffic Controllers in high density environments. For pilots who don't speak English as their first language this will enhance safety and efficiency of communication by significantly improving understanding.Radio frequency congestion will be reduced for all ATC end users by simplifying or significantly reducing the need for readbacks.  
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Personal, business, combat and industrial applications where the voice/audio signal is affected or compromised by factors such as noise, multiple rapid transmissions by multiple speakers on one radio frequency or by the psycho cognitive limitations of the receivers of such information.<BR>For example, this application could be applied in medivac where the high noise environments of helicopter cabins makes it difficult for the reception and transmission of auditory transmissions.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

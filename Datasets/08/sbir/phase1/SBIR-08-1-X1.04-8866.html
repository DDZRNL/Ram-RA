		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Qualtech Systems Inc. (QSI) proposes to develop a well defined process for integration of distributed diagnostic schemes. The process includes a set of guidelines to build component diagnostic models/schemes that will undergo integration and an automated/semi-automated tool that will assess the diagnostic efficacy of the integrated scheme so as to suggest modification/redesign of the component diagnostic schemes. Parametric and functional dependencies will be the prime criteria in devising the integration process, while measures of diagnosability (e.g., ambiguity, fault masking, etc) will determine the modification/redesign directives.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology proposed for development in this Phase I effort will result in novel diagnostic, prognostic, degradation and power capability evaluation techniques. In addition, it will develop a process of automated recovery and power availability-based reactive mission planning. The diagnostic, prognostic, and degradation analysis techniques are expected to be integrated into QSI's TEAMS product suite. TEAMS is currently used in NASA Constellation program for early design decisions related to testability and maintainability, as well as for developing solutions for diagnostics, fault isolation and guided maintenance of fielded systems. The reactive mission planner software will be provided by NASA; we would incorporate the capabilities into TEAMS-RDS (remote diagnostic server) to communicate with such software directly. This will enhance TEAMS product suit's compatibility with third party software products.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Industries and agencies who use complex reschedulable mission plans (such as automotive industry) will also be targeted for commercialization of this product. NASA's current vision to enhance the level of autonomy for vehicle health management and reactive mission planning makes the proposed effort worthy of funding from several branches within it. Among the other agencies, DoD and Air-force and Navy are the most potential customer for the resulting technologies. Large scale military systems (systems of systems) such as NORAD, Space Command ground segments, the Joint Strike Fighter fleet, the Navy shipboard platforms, Submarine Commands and ballistic missile defense (BMD) systems, can be potential areas to field the reactive planning technology. The product is expected to be of commercial value to the manufacturers of DoD and military's remotely guided weapons and reconnaissance systems.

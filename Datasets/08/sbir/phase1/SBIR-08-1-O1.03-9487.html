		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Space Micro proposes to build upon our existing space microelectronics and hardening technologies and products, to research and develop a novel rad hard/tolerant RF filter device, which is capable of long life in space. This will leverage emerging commercial semiconductor technology used in an innovative configuration to meet NASA's expanding communications needs.<BR><BR>At the end of Phase 1 we will have demonstrated, both by analysis and limited lab testing of a prototype device, the technical feasibility.(TRL=3).<BR><BR>In Phase 2 we will develop an engineering models of this RF device, and demonstrate electrically and also in relevant ground-based radiation simulators (Proton, heavy ion)- TRL=5-6 at end of Phase 2, and ready to launch as a standard Space Micro space IC product.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA Applications<BR><BR>Virtually all NASA space programs have a demand for this proposed technology and product. NASA applications range from space shuttle, space station, earth sensing missions e.g. (EOS), and deep space missions. NASA programs/missions that will benefit include lunar landers and orbiters, Mars missions, solar system exploration e.g. (Titan, Juno, Europa, comet nucleus return, New Discovery and Living with a Star (LWS). New programs including Ares, the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and Commercial Orbiter Transportation Service (COTS) would benefit.   Products evolving from this SBIR will be enabling for future programs such as Dawn, Aquarius, Kepler, Ocean Vector Winds, and space interferometry.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology may benefit commercial space platforms, both LEO and GEO telecommunication satellites, such as Intelsat, Direct TV, XM radio, Lockheed's A2100, and Boeing's HS-601.<BR><BR>Civil earth sensing applications such as weather/metrology applications e.g. (NOAA) can also benefit. <BR><BR>This technology and products will also address emerging MDA RF communications subsystems with radiation threats. These programs include MKV THAAD, AEGIS, and GMD for Blocks 2012 and beyond. With the new challenge of atmospheric neutrons to MDA High altitude airship (HAA) programs and NASA or Air Force UAV programs, this R&D will be a timely solution. <BR><BR>Other military applications may include strategic missiles (Trident and AF upgrades), as well as many DoD tactical weapon programs with nuclear survival levels.<BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal is for the development of an innovative compact, high power, and extremely reliable 1.26 micron Ho-doped single frequency fiber laser. The proposed single frequency fiber laser consists of Raman pump laser and single frequency 1.26-micron fiber laser, which will be constructed by using Ho3+-doped fluoride glass fiber. A Raman fiber laser is used as a resonant pump laser source for Ho3+-doped fiber laser.  High gain per unit length can be achieved in Ho3+-doped fluoride glass fiber due to the strong resonant pump.  This type of fiber based seed laser is needed for remote sensing of O  and O -N  for measuring atmospheric pressure.  The single frequency 1.26-micron fiber laser with high-speed frequency modulation capability and electronic control, which will be developed in Phase II as part of the seed laser, can be used to build coherent laser radar to perform instant measurement.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This innovative fiber based single frequency laser can be used to generate high energy pulsed 1.26 micron lasers, which are generally used for LIDAR applications in NASA, especially for the oxygen remote sensing.  The single frequency 1.26-micron fiber laser with high-speed frequency modulation capability, which will be developed in this SBIR project as part of the seed laser, is needed for NASA's space exploration program.  The single frequency fiber laser is needed to build coherent laser radar to perform instant measurement of velocity and concentration of oxygen and other gases.  Such a fiber laser and seed laser are inherently offers much higher resolution compared to currently existing Raman fiber laser. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are several potential non-NASA commercial applications. The 1.26 micron seed laser can be used for commercial coherent LIDAR, remote sensing for environment monitor, and non-linear frequency conversion.

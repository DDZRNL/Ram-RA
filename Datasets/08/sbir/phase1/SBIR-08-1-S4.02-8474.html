		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA Low-Cost Small Spacecraft Program is focused on the technologies, subsystems, methodologies, and mission concepts for space missions which lower the over-all cost for scientific exploration.  We propose to support these effort through building a "simulation-of-simulations" software suite that allows (a) development of a standard small satellite architecture framework, (b) capture of all available subsystems simulations or engineering models that provide design and functionality documentation for small satellite architectural elements, (c) supports full small satellite systems physical and functional simulations of simulations against mission profile descriptions using the captured subsystem sub-simulation elements, and (d) support mission planning and analysis trade-studies that change subsystem and system parameters, supports inclusion and exclusion of alternative subsystem elements, and supports mission effectiveness parameter evaluation and display (including cost optimization or optimization a particular performance factors).<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology will be directly applicable to reducing the cost and increasing the quality of design and development of new small satellites and space vehicles. Furthermore, it can be used to test system upgrades and modifications on other space systems.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The SSAL and VSIL technologies are directly applicable to the Army's ongoing systems development.  In particular, it can be used to make the ground vehicle building/designing process more efficient.  The technology can be used to create simulations for accessing the reliability of new technology or modifying existing technology on Army vehicles.  Additionally, it is directly applicable to improving the quality of the design and the cost to implement new military vehicles such as all of the new FCS vehicles.  We believe that the Navy and Air Force have similar needs that we need to explore further.<BR>We will market the tool directly to the contractors who are working on the new vehicle programs.  For example, we will attempt to work with General Dynamics on the Stryker program, Northrop Grumman on the DD(X) program, etc. Cybernet is an approved vendor for these companies and has done previous work with them.  We will leverage this relationship to improve the chances for successfully commercializing the technology.<BR>

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

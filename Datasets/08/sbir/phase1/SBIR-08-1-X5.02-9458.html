		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The lunar surface is to a large extent covered with a dust layer several meters thick.  Known as lunar regolith, it poses a hazard in the form of dust clouds being generated by all forms of gas expansions in the high vacuum environment of the lunar surface.  This is especially pronounced during spacecraft operations.  Instruments placed on the moon by the Apollo mission showed marked degradation due to damage from dust released during the lander's takeoff.  Since there is no air movement to remove the dust after it is deposited, it is essential that dust is not displaced during everyday operations of a permanent lunar installation.<BR><BR>Adherent Technologies, Inc. (ATI) has over the last decade developed a number of specialty UV curing resins for NASA applications in space.  ATI is proposing to develop a resin and dispenser system to coat large areas of lunar surface around landing pads and atmosphere locks with a thin, dust-stabilizing coating.  The coating will be UV stable and elastic enough to weather the temperature extremes of a lunar day and night cycle.  Special emphasis will be given to a low outgassing, solvent-free system that does not contaminate the lunar atmosphere.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Dust mitigation is a major requirement for the successful operation of a lunar base or even to deploy instruments on short-term missions close to the take-off site.  The novel new technology proposed here will enable NASA to quickly establish a dust-free zone without contaminating the atmosphere around the application site.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		On earth, dust is commonly fought using non-permanent means like water or oil sprays.  There are several applications however that require long-term dust stabilization.  This is especially true for mine tailings from toxic metal operations like uranium and lead mining.  The resins developed under this program can be used with little modification to cover large areas with a coating stable to weather and sunlight degradation at a very reasonable cost.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

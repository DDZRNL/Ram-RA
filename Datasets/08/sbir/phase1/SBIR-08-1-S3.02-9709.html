		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Loop heat pipes are commonly used for heat rejection radiators above a few hundred watts. The LHP condener tubing is embedded in composite panels which are manually deployed. By making the LHP condenser tubing out of shape memory alloy tubing, the radiator becomes self deploying and self contained. It will passively deploy when the payload components begin producing significant heat. This not only eliminates the deployment mechanisms and controls, but also provides more flexible stowing arrangement for the radiators. Very small satellites and spacecraft can now have deployable radiators.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Essentially all small spacecraft can benefit from the proposed technology, which would save mass, money, and complexity.  NASA's Small Spacecraft Division estimates that scheduled Air Force's EELV launches over the next five years could use the EELV Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA)to make 13,500 kg of excess lift capacity launces. <BR>The self deploying LHP radiator is especially beneficial for very small formation-flying missions.

		Essentially all small spacecraft can benefit from the proposed technology, which would save mass, money, and complexity.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

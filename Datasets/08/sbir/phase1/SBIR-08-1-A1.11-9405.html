		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Health management of composite airframe components is essential for safety and reliability of future aircrafts. It reduces the risk of catastrophic failures and reduces operating costs. Luna Innovations proposes to develop a revolutionary airframe health management system on the basis of an all-fiber optic ultrasonic structural health monitoring system (SHM) and accurate prognostics algorithms. The key component of SHM system is a highly multiplexible transducer generating ultrasonic waves in the predefined locations of the optical fiber. Using such a technique, 10s of transducers and 1000s of sensors can be placed on the optical fiber embedded or surface-mounted to the airframe component thereby providing unmatched multiplexing capability. Origination and propagation of defects will be retrieved with high spatial resolution thus providing a basis for an accurate estimation of a component's Remaining Useful Life. During the Phase I, efforts will focus on demonstrating feasibility of an efficient ultrasound generation with the proposed fiber optic transducer and selecting appropriate prognostics algorithms. In Phase II, sensors, transducers will continue to be refined and will undergo extensive testing and validation. By the end of Phase II, the proposed health management system will reach TRL 5. In Phase III, Luna will commercialize the developed system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Due to the unique benefits (high accuracy, lightweight, cost-effectiveness, EMI-immunity and harsh-environment compatibility) over competing technologies, the proposed airframe health management system is expected to find a number of NASA applications. Besides the health management of composite and metallic airframe components, the proposed system is expected to find applications in structural health monitoring and health management of aircraft engine, fuselage and other parts. This is due to a proven harsh environment compatibility of the proposed sensors and a predicted harsh environment compatibility of the proposed actuators. In each of these applications the proposed health management system is expected to provide a significant impact on important characteristics such as safety, reliability of the structural components, and minimization of maintenance/replacement cost. This, in turn, will cause a significant impact on the cost, safety and reliability of future NASA missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to NASA applications, the  proposed all-fiber optic ultrasonic sensing system (the heart of proposed health management system) can be potentially applied to such fields as health monitoring and management of structural components including naval vehicles, civil structures (buildings and bridges), power plants (wind turbines, stuck liners). However, the most promising market for the proposed system is believed to be the structural health monitoring and management of military airframe and engine components.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		InnoSense LLC (ISL) proposes to develop a miniaturized, multi-analyte sensor for near real-time monitoring of analytes in the spacecraft environment. The proposed innovations will build on ISL's past NASA SBIR project to develop an oxygen sensor for aircraft fuel tanks and DOE funded project to develop a carbon dioxide sensor for unattended remote deployment. In this project ISL will incorporate the disparate sensors on a single chip and develop a space-worthy sensor array. Through iterative development, ISL will expand capabilities of the system to monitor chemical, microbial and particulate content in the spacecraft environment. The proposed Phase I studies will demonstrate the sensor array approach by detecting oxygen, carbon dioxide and moisture simultaneously at the low parts per million (ppm) levels with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of at least 3. A prototype sensor array system will be constructed and field-tested during Phase II. To assure success of this project, InnoSense LLC has assembled an engineering team with a cumulative 80 person-years of experience in developing commercially viable optical sensor systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA vision calls for safe, affordable human missions beyond Earth orbit to Moon, Mars, and through the Solar System. To support the transport of small crewed missions to the moon with capabilities to extend this to outer space, monitoring and controlling of the life-support process needs to be performed by devices having attributes such as: (a) high accuracy and precision, (b) reduced size and weight, (c) long operational life, (d) reliable performance, (e) minimal maintenance requirement, and (f) in-line operational ability. Hazardous trace gases within the space-craft crew habitat pose risks to human health during long duration missions. Therefore, the proposed sensor technology provides NASA with a low-cost, robust, real-time monitoring format for protecting both the crew and spacecraft.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The multi-analyte capabilities of the device make it very attractive for applications ranging from environmental monitoring to process control.  The study by Frost & Sullivan on World Gas Sensors, Detectors and Analyzers Market reveals that these markets earned revenues of over $1 billion in 2005 and estimates this to exceed $1.4 billion in 2012 (Source: Frost and Sullivan Report MC1377591, August 31, 2006). Pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, fermentation monitoring, cell culturing, and tissue culturing represent some important applications. Upon repackaging, the device will have applications in a variety of civilian emergency response and occupational environment monitoring or related research facilities.  Examples include: firefighting, hazardous material response, hazardous material workers, industrial safety workers (e.g., coal miners, steel workers, etc.), and industrial confined space monitoring associated with many occupations (e.g., industrial chemical manufacturing).

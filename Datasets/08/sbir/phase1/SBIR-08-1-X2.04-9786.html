		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A microsensor cell with interdigitated micron-size three electrode structure cell of thin film platinum sensing and counter electrodes and platinum pseudo or silver quasi reference electrodes deposited on silicon dioxide over silicon will be fabricated. A unique thin film composite polymer membrane electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and wide voltage window and hydrophobic property will be prepared and characterized and coated on the electrodes of the cell. The prototype sensor will be assembled in a suitable container covered with thin film PTFE membrane and feasibility demonstrated for sensing oxygen, water vapor and carbon dioxide.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The light weight, low power and low cost solid state microsensors with potential capability for self calibration have applications for monitoring oxygen, water vapor and carbon dioxide and trace contaminant gases and vapors for Spacecraft Cabin Environmental Monitoring and Control system.  They have the capability for detecting trace contaminant toxic gases and vapors.  They will be highly useful to NASA for future human Exploration missions as well as Space Station and Space Shuttle. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Long life and low cost sensors with multi-gas/vapor sensing capability have potential application for detecting toxic vapors at the Department of Energy Hazard Waste Sites and EPA applications for toxic gases. These sensors have the potential for use in monitoring toxic and polluting gases such as SO2, NOx and CO2 at power plants and industrial boilers using fossil fuels. They find use detecting CO and volatile organic compounds(VOCs)for Indoor Air Quality monitoring homes and buildings.

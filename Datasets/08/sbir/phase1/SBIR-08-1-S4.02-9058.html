		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		As NASA designs and develops the next generation of scientific and space exploration vehicles and missions, there is a growing need for a robust, flexible, and easy-to-use software framework that NASA engineers can use to rapidly analyze, design, simulate, and evaluate competing vehicle and mission concepts. This need is particularly acute for small satellite design missions (such as Low-Cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies Missions) and other missions with small budgets and cost margins. In this project, Phoenix Integration will develop a software framework for flexibly meeting these needs. Working within the framework, NASA engineers will be able to flexibly assemble mission simulation models by choosing components from a custom library of reusable analysis modules. Once the system models are created, the framework will be capable of automatically executing these models, seamlessly transferring data from analysis to analysis as required. Mechanisms will be provided in the user interface that will allow engineers to archive important models, designs, data, and meta-data in an "Analysis Library" during the design process. This Analysis Library will be fully indexed and searchable, and will serve as a central information repository for facilitating communication and collaboration between team members, preserving important models, data, and knowledge for future reuse, and helping to capture design knowledge and document the decision making process.<BR><BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology will help to lower the barriers to entry for small spacecraft missions by streamlining the mission design process and facilitating model and data reuse. This, in turn, will help to lower the overall costs and risks of scientific exploration. The proposed technology will complement many different design paradigms, including the JPL "Team X" collaborative design process. The need for a software framework for tool integration, automation, and simulation data management extends beyond the NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD), and also encompasses other important NASA activities. For example, the framework will also benefit engineers in the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) as they develop the next generation of space vehicles and systems. Engineers in the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) will benefit from the proposed toolset as they design next generation subsonic, supersonic, hypersonic, and rotary wing air vehicles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The SBIR technology will benefit any organization involved in the design of complex engineering systems or products. The need for better model integration, execution, and engineering data management tools is recognized not only by NASA but also by aerospace and defense organizations such as the DoD, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and GE as well as automotive and heavy machinery organizations such as General Motors, Ford, Caterpillar, and Dresser Rand. Driven by the pressure to shorten time to market, all of these organizations are increasingly utilizing modeling and simulation earlier in the design process. The proposed SBIR technology will benefit all of these organizations by helping them to reduce design time, improve product performance and quality, and better utilize the large volumes of engineering data that they generate.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		FAA predicts that air traffic will double or even triple by 2025 and unless solutions that enable improvements in the use of airspace can be developed and implemented, significant airspace congestion will occur.  Advancements in aircraft capabilities via new technologies can enable aircraft to operate more efficiently in the NAS and to operate safely in areas previously restricted.  AeroTech proposes to enhance ATM simulations and the assessment of Performance Based Operations (PBO) by developing an Autonomous Aircraft Decision Making Model for Weather Hazard Avoidance based on the aircraft's weather hazard detection capabilities, ATC constraints, FAA regulations, and operator policies.  The model will provide autonomous guidance for aircraft in ATM simulations such as FACET and ACES.  PBO and traffic flow schemes can be assessed for any scenario by varying the detection capabilities of simulation aircraft, regulations, and/or policies, and examining deviation decisions, flight paths, safety impacts, and NAS throughput.  Phase I will develop and test the Model's methodology and algorithms, and perform a proof of concept study.  By the end of Phase II, the Model will have been implemented and tested in ATM simulations, and will enable researchers to improve NAS operations through new traffic flow techniques based on PBO.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		When the goals of the proposed R/R&D are met, the Autonomous Aircraft Decision Making Model for Weather Hazard Avoidance will be supportive of NASA's NextGen-Airspace program's goal to develop methodologies and techniques to minimize or solve the demand/capacity imbalance problem in the NextGen future.  The proposed Model will support level 1 and 2 research areas in Traffic Flow Management (TFM), Separation Assurance, Performance Based Services, and System-Level Simulation Tools by improving the autonomous decision making capabilities of simulation aircraft, enabling the exploration of Performance Based Operations (PBO) based on aircraft weather detection capabilities, enabling the assessment of 4-D weather cube information for PBO, and enabling the development and testing of new TFM techniques that maximize airspace usage through PBO.  The Autonomous Aircraft Decision Making Model will also enhance NASA's Aviation Systems Division simulation tools and efforts in Modeling and Simulation, Tactical ATM, and Strategic ATM.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		AeroTech's Autonomous Aircraft Decision Making Model for Weather Hazard Avoidance will provide benefits to ATM research efforts and as a technology cost-benefit analysis tool.  The proposed Model will provide the FAA, the Joint Planning and Development Office, higher educational institutions, and commercial research organizations a tool to examine NextGen capacity and throughput issues due to aircraft system capabilities and Performance Based Operations policies.  Understanding the benefits of PBO will enable the development of techniques to safely maximize airspace usage.  Aircraft operators and system developers can use the proposed Model in simulations to analyze the cost-benefits (operational efficiency and safety) of specific aircraft weather hazard detection systems and weather hazard information dissemination systems to support purchase decisions and development decisions respectively.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The objective of this Phase I project is to demonstrate InGaN materials are appropriate for high operating temperature single junction solar cells. Single junction InGaN test devices with bandgaps between 2.0 and 1.75 eV could provide power conversion in the 15-20% range while offering increased resistance to radiation damage. In this project, we will theoretically and experimentally optimize the doping profiles of p- and n-InGaN for high operating temperatures, fabricate test structures base on p-n junctions, and test the preliminary devices under concentrated sunlight and at temperatures from 100ºC to 250ºC. At the end of the Phase I, the technology will be at TRL 3.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Although solar cells are used on many NASA platforms for power generation, IMS envisions the cells developed in this project would be especially beneficial to missions near the sun and those in high radiation environments. Therefore, the missions Solar Orbiter, Solar Sentinels, and Solar Probe Plus in the Living with a Star Program (LWS) could benefit from this technology. The photovoltaic panels in these missions will be exposed to much larger AM0 solar fluxes than typical near-Earth satellites  approximately 25 suns for the Orbiter, 16 suns for the Sentinels, and 16-250 suns (510 peak) for the Probe Plus.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The high temperature stability of these materials will benefit operation under high concentrations in terrestrial DoD applications,. The large commercial terrestrial market could benefit from the hybridization of InGaN materials to existing solar cell technology to significantly increase cell efficiency without relying on highly toxic compounds. In addition, further development of this technology to even lower bandgap materials for space applications could be of importance to DoD and commercial satellite manufacturers due to the extended lifetimes of satellite solar cell arrays arising from increased radiation hardness.

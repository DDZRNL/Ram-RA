		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose a concentrated photovoltaic electric power system for lunar operations called C-Lite Lunar.   The novel technology produces a near-term solar array system that provides substantially improved performance in terms of high specific power (>600 W/kg BOL, 10X lighter than rigid arrays), lightweight, high deployed stiffness (5X stiffer than rigid arrays), high deployed strength, compact stowage volume (>1,000 kW/m3 BOL, 30X more compact stowage than rigid arrays), affordability, and rapid commercial readiness.  The proposed effort will provide a disruptively positive performance impact to the end-user, and allow for the rapid insertion of this mission-enabling technology for future applications.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		C-Lite Lunar Power System is primarily focused on the needs of lunar base missions.  Future Mars base missions will also benefit from experience gained on the moon.<BR><BR>The broader technology developed for the C-Lite Lunar Power System is widely applicable to most future NASA missions as a direct replacement for existing photovoltaic systems.  <BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		C-Lite Lunar Power technology is also widely applicable to all non-NASA missions, including DoD and commercial missions, as a direct replacement for current state-of-the-art.  The total solar array system market is estimated at $500M to $750M annually.  C-Lite Lunar Power technology has the potential to ultimately replace many existing solar arrays.  The compelling performance benefits of the proposed technology such as: Ultra-lightweight (10X lighter than rigid arrays), high deployed stiffness (5X stiffer than rigid arrays), high deployed strength, compact stowage volume (30X more compact stowage than rigid arrays), affordability, and rapid commercial readiness, will be mission-enabling for many applications.  Applicable missions include: LEO DoD surveillance, reconnaissance, communications and other critical payload/equipment satellites, LEO commercial mapping and critical payload/equipment satellites, MEO DoD satellites, GEO commercial communications and critical payload/equipment satellites, and GEO DoD communications and payload/equipment satellites.

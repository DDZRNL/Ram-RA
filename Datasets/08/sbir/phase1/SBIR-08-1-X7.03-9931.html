		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A directly immersible cryogenic MEMS pressure sensor will be developed.  Each silicon die will contain  a vacuum-reference and a tent-like membrane.  Offsetting thermal effects allow the device to operate over a wide temperature range.  Using a patented, proven design the device is capable of continuous low-power operation and provides accuracies as low as 0.002 % of reading.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications include: <BR>Tank leak detectors inside the vacuum/MLI space.<BR>Transfer line pressure sensors with no trapped volume, eliminating problems with vent/purge operations.<BR>PVT-based mass gauging systems requiring high accuracy.<BR><BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA commercial applications include process industries such as foods, chemical, and semiconductors; superconductor research; high-volume gas delivery systems such as LN2; and biological research applications such as cryopreservation and cryobiology.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Energid Technologies proposes to create a tool for simulation-based verification of lunar excavator designs.  Energid will combine the best of 1) automatic control system generation from computer aided design (CAD) models, 2) rapid validation of complex mechanism designs, and 3) detailed simulation models of the lunar environment, including regolith, dust, temperature, remote supervision, and communication latency to create a system of high value to NASA.  Energid has previously developed unique algorithms for controlling and simulating complex robotic mechanisms automatically from just a CAD description.  These algorithms will be leveraged to create a system to quickly test excavation systems by generating optimal control algorithms for use in studies.  Energid has also developed high-fidelity real-time physics-based simulation algorithms that include models of internal forces and the forces produced when a mechanism interacts with the outside world.   This existing capability will be combined with an innovative organization for simulation algorithms, new regolith simulation methods, and a unique control and study architecture to make a powerful tool with the potential to transform the way NASA verifies and compares excavator designs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The excavator validation tool will have application to all of NASA's future lunar missions.  It will reduce cost and improve schedule in these efforts.  Following completion of Phase II--to some degree, even upon completion of Phase I--the software will be ready for use by NASA, and Energid will partner with larger NASA contractors to commercialize the capability through contracts.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Outside of NASA, Energid will offer the software firstly to the construction and mining industries.  We receive contacts and needs from representatives of these industries, and the new capability developed under this project is needed.  Beyond the construction and mining industries, Energid will provide the software components developed under this effort as a software toolkit that can be licensed across all industries.  Potential customers will purchase the toolkit as software libraries and header files.  By linking these libraries into their code, developers will have full access to all the capability provided by the toolkit.  The new capability will allow developers to leverage our simulation and remote-control technologies into new applications.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

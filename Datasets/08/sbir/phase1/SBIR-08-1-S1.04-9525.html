		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Leveraging on recent breakthroughs in broadband photonic devices and components for RF and microwave applications, SML proposes a new type of broadband microwave spectrometer with performance and affordability that were not attainable before.  The photonic microwave spectrometer overcomes the constrains associated with microwave electronics, linearly and simultaneously offering 6-18 GHz (potentially up to 100 GHz) bandwidth, high resolution of sub-hundred MHz, and huge numbers of channels (hundreds to 1024 channels). The devices and components used in the proposed novel spectrometer are commercial off-the-shelf. Our miniature low cost design is well suited for the spectrum monitor and sensor requirement for a wide range of NASA, military and commercial applications.  Our unconventional flight qualifiable approach eliminates the need for frequency down-converter, moving components, local oscillator, and has intrinsically temperature independent operation.  In Phase I, SML will test an evaluation prototype to demonstrate the proposed novel RF/microwave spectrometer based on high performance components and build a system model to simulate and verify spectrometer's design and performance.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications:<BR>Microwave remote sensing is a powerful tool to monitor ocean water, snow and ice cover, soil moisture and atmospheric trace constituents such as ozone, CO, HCN, NO, SO2, etc. The proposed microwave spectrometer is a key component in microwave remote sensing.  With proposed microwave spectrometer provides enough resolution in a broad spectrum for astronomers to accurately measure Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		DoD Applications:<BR>A true real-time broadband spectrometer is a powerful tool to monitor the communication channel, which will greatly improve military communication quality. Meanwhile, the proposed spectrometer can be applied in reconnaissance of military communication and radar signal in the battlefield.<BR> <BR>Commercial Applications:<BR>This spectrometer can also be applied in commercial wireless communication and satellite communication to realize dynamic management and distribution of communication channel. Meanwhile, the spectrometer is a popular instrument in microwave electronics, astronomy, biology, physics and remote sensing of the earth and ocean. The largest market application for next-generation of the spectrometer is in the wireless communication industry and advanced Internet system. The proposed spectrometer makes it possible for real-time monitor of communication and dynamic distribution of signal channel frequency.  The communication pipes, which will serve as the foundation for the new economy, must be in place and maintained to handle the tremendous and increasing data flow that is being generated.  We are in the early stages of the largest transformation of the communication infrastructure in history - the shift to fiber and photonics from copper and electronics.<BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The integrated design centers currently in place at the Goddard and Ames research institutions are highly productive infrastructures, allowing a group of domain specialists to rally for intense, focused intervals of time around a mission concept, refining a design in spiral fashion using a palette of trusted in-house and commercial engineering analysis tools. This approach can be significantly streamlined if a standard data exchange mechanism is established between the elements of the toolchain and a centralized function is included to govern the initiation and management of design projects. DNet has developed the Mission and Satellite Design Tool (MSDT) for AFRL, which is the starting point for the creation of tactical satellites. MSDT will accept objectives for a mission and distill them to a spacecraft configuration, drawing from a database of support devices and modular software. MSDT also coordinates the assessment of that satellite configuration, interacting with traditional analysis tools to perform domain analysis and return measures of performance which can be compared to the original objectives. DNet proposes to enhance the current framework capability to be compatible with NASA's preferred analysis tools and provide a springboard for the development of the SBIRSat and subsequent missions based on its supporting technologies.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There is obvious application to NASA in the upgrade of capability in the current integrated mission design centers. A new infrastructure, potentially built upon the same analysis tools that have been trusted at the centers for many years, will have the benefit of streamlining the process so that better management of archiving of studies can be accomplished in less time with fewer technical personnel. The most significant MSDT contribution would be the ability to derive an initial satellite configuration to mission needs very rapidly, saving valuable time up front so that more effort can be devoted to refining the design.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We already have significant heritage in the development of MSDT for our military customers, the Air Force Research Laboratories (AFRL), and the Naval Research Laboratories (NRL). Any institution, commercial or government, that designs and build spacecraft could benefit from the process-oriented capabilities that MSDT provides. AFRL uses MSDT as a part of a highly integrated process flow that facilitates rapid design and assembly from modular hardware and software components. Any design challenge exhibiting strong coupling between engineering process domains would benefit from the framework that MSDT provides.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

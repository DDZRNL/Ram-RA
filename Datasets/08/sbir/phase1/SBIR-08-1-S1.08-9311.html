		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Physical Sciences Inc. proposes to develop a compact, rugged, rapid-response, autonomous sensor for in-situ monitoring of ambient O3 from UAVs.  Our innovation is to combine newly available UV light emitting diodes (LEDs) with miniaturized, low power, high sensitivity signal detection electronics to create a next generation, UAV-class, photometer for O3.   The advent of UV LEDs enables the development of a very compact and highly sensitive monitor for ambient O3.  An LED-based sensor has many advantages over currently available technologies and is highly suitable for deployment in UAVs.  The Phase I program will demonstrate the feasibility of a breadboard sensor and create a detailed conceptual plan for a fieldable prototype.  The TRL at the end of Phase I will be level 4.  The Phase II program will fabricate a prototype that can be field demonstrated on an aircraft.  The TRL at the end of Phase II will be level 6.  Successful completion of Phases I and II will result in a rigorously validated prototype sensor that can monitor ambient O3 with high speed and precision.  The sensor architecture can be easily modified to measure other species.  Using new mid-IR LEDs, the photometer can monitor trace gases such as CO2 and CO.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The miniature (UV and mid-IR) LED-based sensor will serve as a platform for a suite of compact and low cost gas sensors that can measure a variety of species ranging from ozone, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxide that are important for many atmospheric science missions.  This sensor platform will provide a compact, low power consumption, low cost tool that is particularly suited for deployment on small aircraft such as UAVs, balloons, or even kites.  As an example, a miniature payload consisting of a carbon dioxide photometer and an ozone photometer would be well suited to measuring profiles of CO2 from a UAV for satellite measurement calibration and validation, such as the upcoming Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) mission.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The miniature (UV and mid-IR) LED-based sensor will serve as a platform for a suite of compact and low cost gas sensors that can address a variety of applications ranging from atmospheric research tools to carbon sequestration monitoring and verification, biomedical diagnostics (specifically breath analysis and operating room health monitoring), home or mobile toxic gas alarms, smart HVAC control, and as a total hydrocarbon sensor for environmental and process control applications.  PSI anticipates working with several strategic marketing partners to address the range of potential commercial applications.

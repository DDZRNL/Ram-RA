		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Intelligent Automation Inc, (IAI) is currently developing a software defined radio (SDR) platform that can adaptively switch between different modes of operation for communication, by modifying both transmit waveforms and receive signal-processing tasks on the fly.  High-speed analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters along with modern FPGAs and fast digital signal processors allow for maximum flexibility in digital radio design.  The proposed software reconfigurable radio implementation technique and the system design will leverage IAI's vast experience in SDR, RF hardware design, signal processing and system level firmware design. <BR><BR>Key innovations of the proposed effort are<BR>	Reconfigurable digital transceiver/ waveform synthesizer design using high speed FPGA. <BR>	Multi-mode radio functionality and scalable architecture.<BR>	Soft-processor based controller and flexible user control to enable on the fly radio configuration.<BR>	Cognitive capabilities like Adaptive modulation and Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) <BR>	Complex modulation and bandwidth efficient waveform implementation capability
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Some NASA related commercial applications would be<BR><BR>	Configurable telemetry and ranging radios<BR>	Lab based software radio test-bed<BR>	Extra Vehicular (EVA) radios for space applications
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology is built upon the software defined radio expertise of IAI. The most promising commercial applications outside of NASA are:<BR><BR>	Arbitrary wideband waveform synthesizer<BR>	Reconfigurable software radio with multi-mode capabilities<BR>	Cognitive radios

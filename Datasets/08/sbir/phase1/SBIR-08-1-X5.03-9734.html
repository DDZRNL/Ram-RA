		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced EVA suits for space exploration will need a portable life support system (PLSS) that is compact, lightweight, and highly reliable.  A key component is a blower that circulates air through the space suit ventilation loop.  We propose to develop an innovative air blower that can meet the challenging requirements for circulating ventilation air in an EVA suit using a reliable system that consumes little power.  In Phase I we will prove the feasibility of our approach by producing a conceptual design for the blower and building and demonstrating a proof-of-concept blower.  In Phase II we will optimize the blower and motor designs to achieve small size and maximum efficiency while meeting requirements and constraints for operation in exploration space suits.  We will demonstrate lifetime and reliability of critical components and deliver a prototype blower that can be used in system tests of advanced portable life support systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The ventilation fan is a critical technology need for the Constellation Space Suit System (CSSS), since the exploration PLSS design calls for a separate ventilation fan instead of a combined fan/pump/water separator like the one used in the current shuttle extravehicular mobility unit.  The blower that we develop will meet the requirements for circulating ventilation air in the CSSS.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The head/flow requirements for the space suit ventilation blower are very similar to the requirements for personal cooling systems based on filtered air ventilation needed for terrestrial applications.  The military needs these blowers to provide a lightweight cooling and ventilation system for soldiers and marines wearing body armor or chem/bio protective gear in hot environments.  Civilian applications include portable ventilation systems for HAZMAT teams and nuclear or chemical plant workers.

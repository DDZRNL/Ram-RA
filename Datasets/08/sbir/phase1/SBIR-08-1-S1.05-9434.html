		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Gravity wave detection using space-based long-baseline laser interferometric sensors imposes stringent noise requirements on the system components, including the large area photoreceiver front ends.  The proposed innovation utilizes dual depletion region technology to produce a large area (1mm diameter) 2x2 quad p-i-n InGaAs photodiode array having ~2.1pF capacitance per quadrant.  The small capacitance of the quad photodiode array is leveraged in combination with a low-noise JFET-input operational amplifier to manufacture ultra-low noise quad photoreceiver array.  Each element (quadrant) of the photoreceiver array will have an input equivalent current noise <2pA/sq.rt. Hz in a frequency range of 2 to 20MHz.  This will enable shot noise dominated performance at an optical local oscillator power of ~100mW per quadrant.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The dual-depletion region technology allows high speed photodiode operation in conjunction with good noise performance.  Consequently, the low-noise large area photoreceivers can be used for following free-space (ground-based, airborne, and space-based) commercial applications, such as:<BR><BR>1)  Free space communication links;<BR>2)  Airport wind monitoring;<BR>3)  Airline clear air turbulence sensing for improved passenger safety and route optimization for improved fuel efficiency; and<BR>4)  Wind profiling for potential wind farm sites.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Cryogenic fluid transfer components using single crystal piezoelectric actuators are proposed to enable low thermal mass, minimal heat leak, low power consumption and fast response for cryogenic fluid transfer and handling systems to support NASA Lunar Lander, Ground Operations, Ares, and Lunar Surface Systems programs. Single crystal piezoelectrics are attractive because they exhibit 3 to 5 times the strain as conventional piezoelectric ceramics, have very low strain hysteresis, and retain excellent piezoelectric performance at cryogenic temperatures. Low voltage, low profile, highly efficient single crystal piezoelectric actuators including stack actuators, unimorph/bimorph benders and flextensional actuators will be designed, fabricated and characterized at temperature of 20 K -300 K. A fluid valve incorporating  single crystal actuators will be prototyped for flow control experiments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Cryogenic fluid transfer and handling systems to support NASA Lunar Lander, Ground Operations, Ares, and Lunar Surface Systems programs. High precision deformable mirrors in coronagraphic instruments, interferometric telescopes, and space-based observatories.  ORIGINS missions SUVO, SAFIR, and Planet Imager, Earth Science applications, such as LIDAR systems as well as Coastal Ocean Imaging systems will all benefit from this technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Adaptive optics for high energy laser, active vibration control and structure morphing, RF communication tuning, bio-medical manipulators, cryogenic microscopy, photonic tooling, micro/nanofabrication and nanoassembly, etc.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase 1 proposal addresses the 2008 NASA SBIR Research Topic S6.04 Data Management - Storage, Mining and Visualization (GSFC).  The subtopic we address is Distributed Data Management and Access: Dynamically configurable high speed access to data distributed and shared over wide area high speed network environments.  We propose a novel offload engine NIC that scales at n x 10Gbps increments through 100Gbps full-duplex.  Globus GridFTP is the de facto standard in projects requiring secure, robust, high-speed bulk data transport.  Splintered TCP and UDP is recognized by NASA to be a new offload technology developed by our group in previous research.  We derive novel extension mechanisms which will combine these technologies for use by GridFTP, bandwidth management resources, and host cpu acceleration.  The result will be wire-rate encrypted GridFTP data transfer through offload for splintering, encryption, and compression.  Successful completion of this Phase 1 project will prove feasibility of our innovation through hardware architectural models, system on chip core IP, ultra high-speed logic simulations, and GridFTP module specifications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		 Our system accommodates network bandwidth needs for host offload engines used within NASA Science Data Centers, Cluster, and Grid computing applications scaled to 100 Gbps. Our novel offload engine NIC will be used for access to distributed and shared data applications including:<BR>a.  Very large file transfers between NASA clusters and other federal entities or universities.  Such collaboration is referenced in our proposal, and totals tens to hundreds of TB of computed data.<BR>b.  12 Gigapop's distributed over  Maryland, DC, and Virginia.  As referenced in our proposal, this infrastructure needs upgrades to accommodate new optical 10 - 40 Gbps links. <BR>c.  n x 10 Gbps capabilities through 100 Gbps for I2NET.<BR>d.  National Lambda Rail (NLR) applications with 10 Gigabit Ethernet per wavelength.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Successful completion of this project, through Phase 3, would allow us to provide an offload engine NIC product suitable for the commercial sector Grid computing market. The resulting system-on-chip intellectual property (core IP) could be marketed to offload engine manufacturers. The IP would save existing offload engine firms design time, design cost, and provide excellent time-to-market. Additional customers would include motherboard and systems manufacturers that require offload engine NIC's or system-on-chips for their motherboards. IP distribution channels and sales could also be through system-on-chip providers. Laboratories and Defense firms requiring ultra high-speed network transfers, cluster, and grid computing offload engines could also benefit from NASA's investment in our innovation.

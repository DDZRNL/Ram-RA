		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Procedures are the accepted means of commanding spacecraft. Procedures<BR>encode the operational knowledge of a system as derived from system<BR>experts, testing, training and experience.  NASA has tens of thousands<BR>of procedures for Space Shuttle and the International Space Station,<BR>which are used daily by both flight controllers and crew.  It is<BR>expected that the new Constellation vehicles, including Orion, Altair<BR>and Lunar habitats, will have thousands of procedures to ensure safe<BR>operation.  Currently procedures are executed manually using standard<BR>command and control displays.  We are proposing a new paradigm whereby<BR>procedures interact closely with the next generation telemetry and<BR>command displays being developed for NASA and with a procedure<BR>assistant that can automatically dispatch commands and evaluate<BR>telemetry under tight supervision of the operator. The procedure<BR>assistant will consist of an interactive procedure display, a<BR>procedure assistant executive, a set of procedure support services and<BR>an editor for modifying existing procedures or building simple new<BR>procedures.  In our paradigm rocedures will be just like any other<BR>component of an integrated suite of mission control tools. This will<BR>greatly enhance the efficiency of flight controllers and reduce<BR>training costs associated with having a separate set of tools for<BR>procedures.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is currently designing the next generation of mission control<BR>software and displays.  This new software will begin rolling out in<BR>the next several years.  This makes for perfect timing to infuse new<BR>procedure technology into NASA mission operations.  We will work with<BR>NASA JSC Mission Operations Directorate (MOD) personnel such as Alan<BR>Crocker to ensure that our SBIR technology meets NASA's needs.  Our<BR>goal is for our software to be a piece of a larger delivery of new<BR>mission control software and displays into Mission Control Center<BR>(MCC).
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		All complex systems, such as nuclear power<BR>plants, oil refineries and petrochemical plants, use procedures as the<BR>core of their operations.  Just like current NASA operations, these<BR>procedures are often on paper and are manual.  Given the hundreds of<BR>nuclear power plants in the US alone and many more overseas and the<BR>thousands of oil refineries and petrochemical plants the potential<BR>market for software and services that move these industries from paper<BR>to electronic procedures is enormous.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

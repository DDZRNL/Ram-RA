		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Polymeric composite materials that are currently utilized in aircraft structures are susceptible to significant damage from lightning strikes.  Enhanced electrical and thermal conductivity in these polymeric composites could eliminate this damage.  The addition of this multifunctional capability to composites will result in lower manufacturing costs and weight reductions in future aircraft since the addition of coatings, conductive mesh, or expanded foil materials can be eliminated.  A combined materials and engineering approach will be utilized to accomplish this objective by modifying a high performance composite system with a combination of conductive nano and micron size filler materials.  The large difference between the two filler sizes will create a stratified composite structure that consists of the conductive micron size particles residing in the interlayer region of the composite with the nanomaterials dispersed evenly throughout the matrix and in the fiber tows.  Using this approach, these composites will have the same or better balance of mechanical properties as current state-of-the-art composite systems but also have the added functionality of a conductive interlayer and network to eliminate damage from lightning strikes.  The Technology Readiness Level will be between 3 and 4 after the Phase 1 program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The successful completion of the Phase 1 and 2 research programs will enable the development of lower weight and low cost composite structures that traditionally require lightning strike protection from secondary applications of conductive materials.  All four of the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Programs would benefit from this technology including Subsonic Fixed Wing, Subsonic Rotary Wing, Supersonic, and Hypersonic programs.  Specific composite applications that would benefit from this technology include primary and secondary aircraft structures, such as fuselage sections, aircraft control surfaces, leading edges, fixed panels, and fairings.  In addition, propeller blades, turbine blades, and engine core cowl applications may benefit from this technology.  Other applications may be found in missile and rocket components that would benefit from enhanced electrical and thermal conductivity.  Also, applications that involve EMI shielding and electrostatic discharge could benefit from this technology.  
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Next generation commercial, military, and civil aircraft, as well as helicopters can benefit from this technology to reduce weight and costs from the elimination of added lightning strike protection to composite structures.  Since the lightning strike protection is built into the composite, better reliability and reduced maintenance will be observed over that of conductive paints, meshes or foils.  This technology provides enhanced conductivity in every ply, not just on the surface plies.  In addition to lightning strike applications, this technology may find use in composite structures that could benefit from better heat dissipation or heat transfer.  Military ships, aircraft, missiles, and rockets may benefit from this added multifunctionality.  Also, enhanced electrical conductivity and those applications requiring EMI shielding and electrostatic discharge could benefit from this technology.

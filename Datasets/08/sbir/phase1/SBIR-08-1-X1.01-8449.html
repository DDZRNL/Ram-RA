		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Problem:<BR><BR>Ensuring that command execution scripts do not deviate from Standard<BR>Operating Procedures (SOPs) is time-consuming, costly, and<BR>error-prone.  Deviations can be inefficient or hazardous.<BR><BR>Solution:<BR><BR>We propose to design and develop SAFE-P, an interactive tool to ensure<BR>conformance between command scripts and procedures, or guide users to<BR>clarify their rationale for deviations.  Using semantic differencing<BR>and formal verification of bisimulation relations, SAFE-P will ensure<BR>that the scripts comply with SOPs and will highlight differences for<BR>the operators, so that they can double-check their work and confirm<BR>any deviations from standard procedures.<BR><BR>SAFE-P's design will begin with relatively simple syntactic mechanisms<BR>to find differences between command sequences and textual procedures<BR>that can be applied directly to current flight control practices,<BR>including the use of SOPs captured in simple XML or PDF files and<BR>command scripts in ThinLayer.  To reduce false error detection and<BR>assess the criticality of differences, we will incorporate knowledge<BR>of the space platform's architecture.<BR><BR>For future missions, we will extend SAFE-P to richer languages (PRL,<BR>PLEXIL, SCL) and employ more complex verification of<BR>program-equivalence relationships (bisimulation) to ensure conformance<BR>between scripts and procedures.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed SAFE-P tool will be applicable to a wide variety of NASA<BR>missions including ISS, Shuttle, and Constellation operations.  For<BR>manned and unmanned spacecraft operations, SAFE-P will bridge a<BR>critical gap in NASA's safety procedures, preventing the possibility<BR>of inadvertent commands that do not conform to standard operating<BR>procedures and that could lead to dangerous or even catastrophic<BR>consequences.<BR><BR>SAFE-P fits directly within NASA's Automation for Operations (A4O)<BR>system concept, helping support significant reductions in operations<BR>costs and increases in operational efficiency while maintaining or<BR>improving system safety.  The SAFE-P tool will be designed to<BR>integrate with NASA's Procedure Integrated Development Environment<BR>(PRIDE), seamlessly supporting efficient development of future<BR>executable procedures and scripts.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		<BR>Large-scale industrial control systems, in particular oil refineries,<BR>paper mills, and food processing plants, also maintain a large library<BR>of standard operating procedures which have been developed by system<BR>designers and installers.  These must be adapted on a daily basis to<BR>the specific system configuration and product targets for manual or<BR>automatic execution.  The SAFE-P technology will be directly<BR>applicable to ensuring that industrial plants' daily operating plans<BR>and scripts conform to the standard operating procedures.<BR><BR>SAFE-P technology may also be applied when manually-operated<BR>industrial control systems are being transitioned to more automated<BR>control systems, to verify that newly-written executable control<BR>scripts conform to legacy manual (textual) operating procedures.<BR>

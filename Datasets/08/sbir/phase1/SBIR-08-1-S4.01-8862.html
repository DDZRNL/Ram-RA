		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Busek Co. Inc. proposes to develop/design an integrated propulsion, power, ACS, and separation module for secondary ESPA payloads. The standardized secondary payload orbit maneuvering system (OMS) will have; 1) 200 W or 600 W Hall effect thruster system for primary propulsion, 2) Xe cold gas thrusters for propulsive ACS, 3) solar array, batteries and power conditioning with steady state power of ¡Ö230/680W and 4) an integral structure that supports the payload and a LightBand separation mechanism for the ESPA ring.<BR> <BR>The proposed system architecture is based upon an EELV Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA).  Because the ESPA OMS has power, avionics, and propulsion, it is a free flying spacecraft capable of delivering payloads to disparate altitudes and inclinations.  In Phase I, Busek will design an OMS to meet NASA mission needs including deploying large numbers of micro satellites and CubeSats.  Preliminary analysis suggests the each secondary OMS can provide 780 m/sec delta velocity to a 125 kg payload.  A key Phase I activity will be a prototypical orbital deployers adapter for clusters of CubeSat.  With this adapter, the system could deliver large numbers of CubeSats to discrete, pre-defined orbits.  Phase II products will include a clustering adapter ready to fly in 2010, along with the OMS propulsion system.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed system can distribute secondary payloads among different predefined orbits.   The proposed system will increase the number and value of flight opportunities for NASA and University researchers by more than an order of magnitude.  Adapting the P-POD system for Cubesats to the OMS it could deliver CubeSats, a 125 kg payload, or a mix thereof to widely disparate orbits and destinations.  NASA Ames estimates there is an estimated 13,500 kilograms of excess lift capacity for ESPA payloads available between now and 2013.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are at least 3 upcoming Air Force ESPA class S/C (15  secondary payload rideshare opportunities) currently scheduled.  Each EELV launch provides an opportunity for the secondary payload OMS and associated launch space to be purchased or procured. <BR> <BR>For the military, this capability will produce launch opportunities and missions of interest to customers such as MDA, DoD, NRO, and industry users.<BR> <BR>For commercial users, a successful demonstration will greatly increase the utility of ESPA-derived launch opportunities and will increase demand of ESPA secondary payload OMS within the commercial industry.  Commercial users may also wish to adopt the CubeSat architecture to conduct on-orb experiments.<BR>

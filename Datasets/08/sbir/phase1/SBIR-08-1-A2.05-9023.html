		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Flow control is critical to the effective operation of space vehicles where high velocities must be achieved with minimum power consumption.  Recent studies at Princeton have demonstrated the utility of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuators for aerodynamic control.  Nanosecond pulse sustained DC driven DBDs are predicted to have much higher flow velocities than conventional control systems. Our initial work in the area discovered that these devices produce charge build-up on pulse sustained DC driven DBDs which has hindered the realization of this prediction.  If the charge build-up can be minimized, the DC driven DBDs have the potential for higher flow control efficiency than previously attainable with either AC or DC driven DBDs in laboratory experiments.  The proposed research will develop integrated surface structures that simultaneously optimize the DBD performance to take advantage of the pulse or RF sustained DC bias approach while suppressing the surface charge build up.  This success of this project will be critical for the development of a practical DBD actuator that can be implemented as a control device.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Important vehicle applications for transient operation of DBD devices include the enhancement of wing lift performance and reduction of stall probability during maneuvers, stall margin increase for high angle-of-attack slow flight (landing), enhanced performance of engine inlets under non-cruise conditions, initiation of transition from laminar to turbulent flow, and recovery from spin and other separation-related undesirable aerodynamic phenomena.  If separation control can be accomplished with little penalty in power, then operation can be continuous.  In such cases, contoured engine inlets may be designed with greater turning angles, higher lift may be achievable for in-flight operation, transition initiation or delay may be possible, and new methods for enhancement or suppression of shock induced separation may become practical.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Improved DBD technique with higher flow velocities than conventional control systems would be advantageous in many non-NASA commercial applications.  For example, this technique could be utilized in civil aviation where drag reduction plays a crucial role in designing new high performance airplanes. Application of the improved DBD technology in turbine blades will attract the commercial sector to design high efficiency turbines.  Other commercial applications of DBDs are as a source of ozone production and in medical applications where the weakly ionized plasma can be used to heal wounds.  DBD medical applications can find wide markets especially in military and defense industries.  DBD as an ultraviolet source of radiation could also be useful for disinfection and water cleaning.

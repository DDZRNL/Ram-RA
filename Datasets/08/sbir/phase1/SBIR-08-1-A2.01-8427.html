		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		As the use of composite materials on commercial airlines grows the technology of the composites must grow with it. Presently the efficiency gained by the utilization of core materials on composite structures can not be implemented into commercial aviation primary structures due to the poor impact performance of commercially available core materials. Patz Materials and Technologies proposes to develop a new multifunctional composite core material for airframe primary structures. The new composite core material will combine high impact performance with low weight, high acoustical absorption and high mechanical strength to greatly improve the structural efficiency of future commercial airframes.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The cost per weight of material placed into space is astronomical. The creation of stronger lighter core materials could significantly reduce the weight of a structure, sub structure and even the launch vehicle enabling higher payload capacities less fuel consumed and less overall cost to produce the structure.

		Commercial and Military Aerospace: <BR>Increasing the strength of core material will lend itself to the application of cored fuselages. <BR><BR>Transportation Industry: <BR>Lowering the weight of a ground transportation vehicle such as a "big rig" trailer or even a commercial automobile would reduce fuel consumption and increase efficiency. <BR><BR>Marine: <BR>Both commercial and military naval vessels have the same efficiency versus weight problem that plagues the other transportation industries reducing the weight of naval vehicles could  <BR>

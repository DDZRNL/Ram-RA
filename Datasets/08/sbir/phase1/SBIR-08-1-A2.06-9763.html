		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A consistent and accurate Hybrid gaskinetic BGK and DSMC method, valid in the full Knudsen number (Kn) range, is proposed as a 3D tool to handle hypersonic aerothermodynamics from continuum to thermochemical nonequilibrium and ionized/plasma flows. By domain-decomposition, the proposed method will provide adjoint but automated sub-domain solutions by solving the gaskinetic BGK method of Xu (BGKX) and DSMC in their respective low and high Knudsen regimes, therein the BGKX and DSMC solvers have been proven comparatively efficient for thermo-chemical nonequilibrium flows with accurate heat rate prediction.   The proposed approach is considered  an advancement in rarefied gasdynamic methodology in that: BGKX is efficient for near continuum flows, say 0 <Kn <0.1, and its extension to the Burnett order of Kn~0.5  has been assured; BGKX /DSMC share compatible gaskinetic fluxes, hence a consistent and simpler  flux reconstruction and numerically more stable scheme than that of hybrid Navier-Stokes/DSMC approach; and BGKX/DSMC can more suitably handle nonequilibrium/chemical reacting flow than the Direct Boltzmann Equation (DBE) approach. Phase I will construct 2D hybrid method, and validate its pressure/heat rate solutions with that of DSMC in full Knudsen range. Phase II will fully develop its 3D and aerothermodynamic capabilities for thermochemical nonequilibrium flows.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The developed hybrid BGKX/DSMC solver can be used for hypersonic applications from continuum to rarefied flow regimes for thermochemical nonequilibrium effects up to ionization/plasma flows. This solver can generate accurate aerodynamic forces and heat rates. Typical applications are for launch vehicles in space access, aerobrakes, entry command module and ballutes in atmospheric entry; plume flows in chemical engines or rockets pertinent to space maneuver and Lunar/Martian landing problems. Civilian dual-use applications include micro flows and micro heat transfer, such as those inside Micro- or Nano- Electro-Mechanical Systems, MEMS/NEMS; vacuum chambers.  Examples include the heat flow rate prediction of microchips inside a vacuum packaged enclosure, gas flows through micro-thrusters, gas phase chemical sensors, lab-on-a-chip. Potential customers include the Air Force, DoD, NASA and private sectors using the solver for hypersonic vehicle design/analysis. Civil applications will provide design/analysis methods for MEMs, vacuum facility and biomedical equipments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential Non-NASA Commercial Applications Non NASA applications are supported by non-aerospace domains and private industry for rarefied gas flows applications with a wide range of Kn number and Mach number. Examples of such examples include hypersonic flows around missiles; aerosol effects on weather prediction; materials processing inside vacuum chamber, especially for the semi-conductor industry; air purification with tools made of fine fibers, such as masks; rarefied gas flows associated with MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS), such as various gas sensors. ZONA will extend the proposed BGKX/DSMC method, and package them into a commercial software. Potential customers include DoD, Department of Homeland security, chemical and civil engineering firms, vacuum industry, semiconductor industry, etc.

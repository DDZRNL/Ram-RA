		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed project is an antenna array whose beam is controlled digitally. The Phase 1 effort will assess the method needed to achieve the gain, bandwidth, and pattern (3 dB beam-width and scan field of view). This is based on the level of curvature and interference/geometry of the vehicle on which it is to be mounted. <BR><BR>Phase 1 focuses on the fabrication and testing of one element and a sub-array of four elements on a similar surface such as a metallic or dielectric with some degree of curvature. Phase 1 also uses the LMS algorithm to adaptively perform beam shifting and correction for phase shift. <BR><BR>Phase 2 will increase the number of elements in the array and allow for scanning in both planes. Also, Phase 2 will consider more complicated geometry as required to deliver a functioning antenna array mounted to the space vehicle.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA application most suited to communicate with is the Tracking and Data Satellite System TDRSS. The beam-forming allows for high data rates with fewer errors that would allow the transfer of high bandwidth imagery to collection stations. Also small vehicles in space that require monitoring or telemetry could benefit greatly from a low cost digital beam-forming array.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The need for mobile communications with high altitude aircraft base stations has emerged in the commercial airline industry. Also, the need to communicate with remote parts of the world requires mobile satellite and mobile high-altitude platform (HAP) communications, where the beam-formers on platforms point the beams to the specific cells on the ground for communications, therefore, requiring the sharp beams and low Side Lobe Levels to avoid inter-cell interference.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

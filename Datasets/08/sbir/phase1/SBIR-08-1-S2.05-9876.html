		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this SBIR, we propose a new type of laser interferometer engine for in-situ large optics inspection and metrology and supporting system platform. The proposed FPGA signal processing concept together with new generation high-speed CMOS image sensor enables high speed (> 1m/sec) and real-time continuous surface profiling with minimum local memory. This transforms the currently available laser interferometer into a sub-nanometer precision instrument with only minor modification while providing easy scalability for large optic surface testing and measurement capability simultaneously.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Due to its scalability and sub-nanometer spatial precision, the proposed technology has the potential to provide the technology foundation for the manufacturing of new astrophysics telescopes and their subsystems which can range from X-ray to millimeter waves, and even gravity waves, regardless of the target optics size. This new method adds an extra dimension in optical interferometers, which traditionally use a single image-frame-based phase mapping, by utilizing the time-domain phase synchronous mapping method. In addition, this can be done without significant modifications in the mechano-optical hardware design of existing optical or other types of interferometers. As a result, the product of this SBIR could be immediately applicable in enhancing many of NASA's projects including Earth science.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are countless of applications that need affordable metrology tool, which can be applied on from micro to large size object with high dynamic measurement range and suprior SNR. Such examples are: Metrology and inspection for LCD and Plasma display glass sheet, Semiconductor wafer metrology and process monitoring, Data storage metrology (HDD disk flatness, metrology tool for DVD/CD optics and mold), Fiber optic gyroscope, Film thickness measurement, MEMS (Metrology and process monitoring), Optical coherent tomography, Laser Doppler vibration sensor.<BR>

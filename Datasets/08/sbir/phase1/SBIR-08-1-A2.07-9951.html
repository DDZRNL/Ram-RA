		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Global Aerospace Corporation proposes to develop a hypersonic control modeling and simulation tool for hypersonic aeroassist vehicles. Our control and simulation testbed will be focused on the particularly important problem of a lifting, towed ballute for planetary aerocapture.  The importance of this technology innovation is in the understanding it can provide NASA on the control of hypersonic vehicles, in particular, of lifting towed ballutes.  Lift control of a towed ballute will enable the use of smaller and lighter-weight ballutes for planetary orbit capture, which will make ballutes more attractive and feasible for missions to planets such as Neptune where high heating rates require extremely large ballutes for ballistic capture.  The application of the comprehensive tool, to be developed in later phases, will be extensive including, but not limited to, control studies for entry and descent, aerocapture, and aero-gravity-assist with a range of hypersonic aeroassist systems (e.g. rigid and deployable aeroshells, waveriders, etc.).  This proposal responds directly to the request in subtopic A2 to "leverage the foundational research to develop technologies and analytical tools focused on discipline-based solutions." In addition, in the hypersonic focus arena, we are responding directly to the interest in "system dynamic models incorporating the essential coupled dynamic elements with varying fidelity for control design, analysis and evaluation" and "simulation test beds for evaluating hypersonic concept vehicle control."

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary applications for the proposed control modeling and simulation tool will be for carrying out trade studies to evaluate control and technology options and concept studies of planetary orbit capture missions that utilize controlled lifting towed ballutes. The technology from this effort may have additional applications for the study of controlled lifting towed ballutes for return of injection stages, NASA Exploration missions to the Moon and Mars, and robotic Space Science missions to all planets and moons that have substantial atmospheres.<BR><BR>The applications of the comprehensive tool, to be developed in later phases, will be extensive.  This tool could be used by NASA to design and assess the performance of control concepts for hypersonic vehicles used in crewed exploration vehicles and stages for the Moon and Mars and unmanned planetary exploration systems including entry, descent and landing, aerocapture, and aero-gravity-assist systems.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology from this effort will have additional commercial applications outside of NASA.  This tool could be used by prime spacecraft system and vehicle developers, in early lifting towed ballute design trade studies, to assess their performance as a function of control schemes and uncertainties. The comprehensive tool, to be developed in later phases, could be applied by industry to the full range of aeroassist problems, including entry and descent, aerocapture and aero-gravity-assist, to study the performance of control schemes as a function of aerodynamic and environmental uncertainties.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to implement novel physics mining algorithms with analytical capabilities to derive diagnostic and prognostic numerical models from multi-source observational data.  These techniques yield higher-resolution measures than ever before of environmental parameters by fusing synoptic imagery and time-series measurements. These techniques are general and relevant to observational data, including raster, vector and scalar, and can be applied in all earth and environmental science domains.  Because they can be highly automated and are parallel, they scale to large spatial domains and are well-suited to change and gap detection.  This makes it possible to analyze spatial and temporal gaps in information and facilitates within-mission re-planning to optimize the allocation of observational resources.<BR>As a demonstration project, we have selected a standard climatological metric and will show that we can generate an analogue of this metric by using our method. In particular, we will use the MineTool algorithms to derive an analogue for Palmer's Drought Severity Index.  We will compute this index for a region of the western United States using a set of archival terrestrial products (e.g., Landsat, AVHRR, Aqua/Terra) and a set of weather and climate products (e.g., NOAA satellites, federal, state, local hydrological time-series).   Then, using the same dataset, we will produce a physics-based model from the MineTool analysis of the data.

		<BR>
		MineTool's automation and parallelization features mean that it will be possible, for example, to run continuous monitoring and data assimilation operations for important environmental indices, with great socio-economic significance, in a 24/7 mode.  The drought index is only one example and one can imagine a variety of others including atmospheric CO2 which is not typically measured by AQMDs (Air Quaity Management Districts) but is destined to become an important index of regulatory important and value in carbon-trading.  We envision a continuous operation where on-going receipt of current data can be woven into a cumulative geo-spatial fabric of observations to reveal gaps and anomalies along the temporal dimension.  This information can be used to support mission re-planning and new mission design as well as establishing a long-term baseline record for environmental monitoring.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Satellite observations have been integrated with ground-based observational data for decades but MineTool will extend the user base for these data more deeply and broadly than ever before.  MineTool promises to simplify the application of satellite observations to broad class of important social and economic problems by providing a tool that can be used to build locally-meaningful parametric models for resource management, planning, as well as research and education. MineTool provides a platform for a broad range of data and users and to do it in a scalable way that exploits the expanding computational resources available throughout society. For example, each farm community could have its model specifically for its crops and its conditions, each urban area could have its model accounting for its coastal or inland location, traffic patterns, and population distribution.  In the process we will create a demand for NASA products by a larger population of users.

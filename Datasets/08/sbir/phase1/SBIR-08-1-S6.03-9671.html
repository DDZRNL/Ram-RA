		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Satellite observations of the Earth often contain excessive noise<BR>and extensive data voids.<BR>Aerosol measurements, for instance,<BR>are obscured and contaminated by clouds,<BR>possible only on the sunlit side of the globe,<BR>and difficult over bright land areas.<BR>We propose to explore new filtering and data assimilation<BR>techniques for satellite derived aerosol optical depth<BR>based on the directional spherical wavelet transform.<BR>Initially we will focus specifically on aerosol measurements<BR>from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)<BR>instruments flying on the Terra and Aqua satellites.<BR>In Phase I we will prototype a spherical wavelet filter and<BR>assess its ability to smooth aerosol fields and interpolate<BR>into data voids.<BR>The smoothed fields will be tested against<BR>surface network observations of aerosol optical depth.<BR>Further, we will build an interface<BR>to the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART)<BR>coupled to the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) 4.<BR>Phase II will employ the wavelet filter and assimilation system<BR>to produce aerosol datasets for application in Earth radiation<BR>budget observations and atmospheric correction methods.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In collaboration with the Atmospheric Chemistry Division of the<BR>National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR),<BR>Phase II will produce an enhanced daily global aerosol dataset <BR>that will be provided to the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System<BR>(CERES) project as an input to the<BR>the Surface and Atmosphere Radiation Budget (SARB) subsystem.<BR>This dataset will be based on the assimilation of<BR>the MODIS Collection 5 Level 2 Aerosol Product,<BR>and span the time period starting with the launch of Terra,<BR>year 2000 - present.<BR><BR>This work will be continued for the next generation instruments<BR>that will replace MODIS and CERES;<BR>respectively, the Visible-Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite<BR>(VIIRS) and the Earth Radiation Budget Sensor (ERBS),<BR>which will fly on the tri-agency National Polar Operational<BR>Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) and<BR>the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) satellite,<BR>currently designated for launch in 2010.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The smooth daily aerosol fields will benefit atmospheric correction<BR>procedures for land surface and ocean spectral imaging.<BR>In particular, in Phase II we will build<BR>an improved atmospheric correction package for<BR>the Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI) geospatial software system.<BR>The ENVI package will incorporate aerosol fields<BR>based on filtered MODIS and VIIRS optical depth retrievals.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's vision for an "intelligent engine" will be realized with the development of a truly distributed control system and reliable smart transducer node components; however a significant hurdle in its realization is the reliability of these components when subjected to the harsh operating environment throughout the engine.  In this Phase I award, Impact Technologies, in collaboration with GE Aviation, will develop a fault-tolerant smart transducer node through a Distributed Engine Control Simulator (DECSim) design tool that will utilize a commercial of-the-shelf (COTS) open-system communications standard and will interface with the C-MAPSS engine model.  In Phase I, Impact will successfully develop: i) the DECSim utility, ii) the smart node self-validation and cross-validation capabilities, iii) the overall distributed control architecture, and iv) the firmware code that will reside on hardware.  At the end of the Phase I program, Impact will demonstrate the functionality of a candidate DEC smart node in hardware within the DECSim framework.  The final smart node technology will alleviate the severe system-level limitations of current centralized architectures that include a large weight imposition, limited design flexibility, and life cycle cost burdens associated with certification and obsolescence management.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed fault-tolerant smart node technology and the DECSim software will enable the development of distributed aircraft propulsion control systems and flight control avionic systems, which is well-aligned with the Fundamental Aeronautics program mission.  The final transducer hardware device will be integrated with DEC hardware prototype tests for inclusion in NASA DEC demonstrators.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Aside from safety-critical aircraft propulsion applications, the array of applications for distributed smart transducers is vast.  The interest in fault-tolerant distributed control systems and fault-tolerant smart transducer node technologies spans across many industries, particularly the automotive and manufacturing systems areas.  Ground-based and marine gas turbines also stand to benefit from the proposed distributed control technology.

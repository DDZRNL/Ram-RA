		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Deployable Space Systems (DSS), in partnership with ATK Space and EMCORE, will focus the proposed SBIR program on the coupling of ultra-thin 33% BOL efficient multijunction solar cell flexible blanket technologies (EMCORE's IMM cell integrated to an advanced flexible blanket), to an ultra-lightweight elastically self-deployed roll-out solar array (ROSA) structural platform to produce a near-term and low-risk solar array system that provides revolutionary performance in terms of high specific power (>546 W/kg BOL), lightweight, high deployed stiffness, high deployed strength, compact stowage volume (>57 kW/m3 BOL), reliability, affordability, and rapid commercial readiness.  The high-performance of an optimized ROSA solar array system with IMM technology represents incredible improvements over current state-of-the-art.  The significance of the proposed effort will provide a revolutionary and positive performance impact to the end-user, and allow for the rapid insertion of this mission-enabling technology for future applications.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The ROSA solar array technology with IMM PV is widely applicable to all future NASA Space Science, Earth Science, and Exploration Initiative missions as a direct replacement to current-state-of-the-art.  The total solar array system market is estimated at $500M to $750M annually.  DSS's ROSA technology has the potential to ultimately replace existing solar arrays currently used and become the industry workhorse.  The compelling performance benefits of ROSA; Extremely-lightweight (8.4X lighter than rigid arrays), high deployed stiffness (5X stiffer than rigid arrays), high deployed strength, compact stowage volume (10X more compact stowage than rigid arrays), reliability, affordability, and rapid commercial readiness, will elevate ROSA's status as mission-enabling for many applications.  Applicable missions include all NASA LEO, GEO, planetary or celestial-body Lander, planetary orbiter, and/or Deep Space applications.  DSS's proposed program plan, which includes collaboration and technology infusion support from ATK Space, will allow rapid commercialization of the innovative ROSA technology.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The ROSA solar array technology with IMM PV is also widely applicable to all future non-NASA missions (including DoD and commercial missions), and is a direct replacement to current-state-of-the-art.  Applicable missions include: LEO surveillance, reconnaissance, communications and other critical payload/equipment satellites, LEO commercial mapping and critical payload/equipment satellites, MEO satellites, GEO commercial communications and critical payload/equipment satellites, and GEO DoD communications and payload/equipment satellites.

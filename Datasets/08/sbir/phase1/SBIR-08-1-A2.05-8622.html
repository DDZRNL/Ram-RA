		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed work aims at developing techniques that will address the current limitations of Cartesian-based Navier-Stokes CFD schemes by exploring three promising methods of implementing improved wall boundary conditions. The three methods are based on: (1) the diamond stencil approach of Delanaye et al., (2) the extrapolation boundary condition work by Marshall and Ruffin, and (3) the Material Point Method developed by Advanced Dynamics. The knowledge gained from prototype implementations of these schemes will lead to the development of an efficient viscous modeling algorithm suitable to general Cartesian CFD codes at the end of Phase I. Phase II will integrate this algorithm into a large-scale Cartesian CFD code in consultation with NASA technical representative. Phase III will commercialize the resulting techniques to be developed in Phases I and II and demonstrate their applicability to a wide range of problems.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The direct application of the SBIR effort to NASA represents a prime opportunity for further product development and enhancement of efficient and accurate treatment of viscous boundary conditions for Cartesian-grid-based Navier-stokes CFD schemes, and represents a considerable potential revenue stream in engineering support, plus further technology acquisition.  
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Various DoD components likely to have an interest in the technology include Air Force, Navy and Army.  Non-military applications represent another opportunity for sales. The development of viscous modeling methodologies and algorithms for Cartesian-based solvers should be of interest to a wide range of aerospace and ocean applications. Potential clients include Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, General Electric, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Textron, and others.   In addition, corresponding companies in Europe and Asia represent a very large potential market for the resulting methodologies and algorithms.<BR>

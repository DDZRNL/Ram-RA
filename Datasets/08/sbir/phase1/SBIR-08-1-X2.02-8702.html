		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed work herein focuses on waste subsystems with emphasis on odor control associated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The development of efficient odor removal systems for use inside lunar mission architectures is one of NASA's critical needs (Topic X2.03). Because of the limited space and resources in both exploration vehicles and non-moving habitats, it is important for a treatment system to be compact, lightweight, and robust, and have low energy and material input requirements with the ultimate focus on reducing equivalent systems mass (ESM). Professors at the University of Florida have developed a novel, robust, and highly effective Silica-Titania Composite (STC) capable of adsorbing and oxidizing VOCs to harmless byproducts. The technology has been licensed by Sol-gel Solutions, LLC. In preparation for the design and fabrication of a prototype for validation in a relevant environment during a Phase II study, the evaluation and optimization of two potential configurations employing the STC is proposed. One configuration would employ continuous UV irradiation, and the other would employ intermittent UV. The ultimate goal is to determine which configuration results in a lower Equivalent Systems Mass (ESM).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		After successful completion of the proposed Phase I study, all the information required for design and fabrication of a prototype that can be validated in the space environment will have been acquired. The initial NASA application of focus is odor removal from waste subsystems in lunar architectures. This includes moving and stationary structures. However, the two proposed system configurations would be well suited for other NASA applications related to environmental control and life support, including, for example, air revitalization in spacecraft ventilation and thermal control systems. With some minor reconfiguration an STC system may also be used as a post-processor to NASA's existing water recovery systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The STC technology is applicable to several non-NASA applications. For example, the technology can be used to remove VOCs from indoor air in commercial buildings, homes, hospitals, and schools. It may also be used by the military for air purification in submarines and aircraft. The technology is currently being developed for use in commercial aircraft cabin air purification. Significant work has been done in the development of the technology for methanol removal from gaseous exhaust at pulp and paper mills. Furthermore, the STC technology has been commercialized for mercury removal from caustic exhaust at a chlor-alkali facility, and a pilot-scale study is scheduled for mercury removal from coal-fired power plant flue gas.

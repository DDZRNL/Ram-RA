		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Active Signal Technologies and its subcontractor Moog propose to develop a high-frequency actuator driven valve intended to achieve TRL 6 by the end of Phase II. This active control component will be capable of modulating fuel flow at multiple injection locations with minimum fuel pressure drop and thus enable critical improvements in aerospace vehicle turbine engine combustion dynamics, notably mitigation of thermo-acoustic instabilities. These instabilities have impeded development of advanced lean-burning combustors for reduction of NOx emissions and improvements in combustion efficiency. While passive approaches to control combustion instability have been successful on particular new engine designs, the ultimate solution is active combustion control where the greatest challenges are the bandwidth (1 kHz) and system temperature requirements. The Phase-I goal is to demonstrate that these are achievable by designing and building a proof-of-principle system complete with high-frequency, high-temperature actuator and valve. Active Signal has selected Terfenol as the most suitable actuator material and will apply 25 plus years of actuator, valve and pump experience to meet the goals. The system will be tested against pressure and flow requirements to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach before fabricating a prototype suitable for the GRC test stand in Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA interest in this field is generic to the extent that it can cover ramjets air breathing jet engines rocket motors, etc.  Each has a similar challenge but the categories contained within engines with combustors will vary to the extent that they may well require unique control systems with actuator needs proper to each.  For instance, force and displacement requirements generated by pressure and flow requirements will imply actuator subsystemsthe focus of this proposalthat are unique.  This may well extend to frequency control  and temperature requirements that will vary, having implications for the designer.  At the same time, size, weight, and cost constraints will remain a significant factor set that a successful actuator designer teamed with a controls group can implement across a broad line of applications to build a business base with NASA.  Teamed with Moog, it is this approach that Active  Signal will pursue with NASA.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Active Signal will team with Moog for the principal part of its Non-NASA applications given the fact that Moog is active in the turbine fuel control markets for both aero (military and commercial) and ground based turbine applications. There are numerous factors now driving the need for substantial advances in turbine engine technology to minimize emissions, suppress instabilities associated with lean-burning fuel efficient combustion, eliminate local hot spots and decrease noise. Clearly, Moog will have to see a path to market for the application of Active Combustion Control to make it part of their product line, but with the successful completion of both the proof of principle phase of this effort as well as the Phase II more realistic demonstration, we have been told that this can be an attractive product both directly in the aircraft applications as well as spin offs in the similar, while more cost constrained automobile market.

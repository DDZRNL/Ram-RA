		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		For the future spaceport and long-term storage of liquid hydrogen NASA requires cryocoolers that can provide cooling power in the range of 20 watts at 20 K. The  closed-cycle cooling alternatives currently available for such applications are not well suited to the  requirements. In many cases reliability is low and vibration high. In other cases coolers are too massive  and inefficient. This proposal describes a two-stage pulse tube cryocooler that combines several innovative  design features. The proposed pulse tube will be light-weight, efficient, reliable, vibration free, and easy to  integrate with cryogenic dewars.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Missions to moon and Mars that involve the in-situ manufacture of propellant will require the capability to store hydrogen for long periods of time. To accomplish this, a cryocooler mounted on the storage vessel  that is capable of sub-cooling the liquid, intercepting parasitic heat leaks, and re-liquefying hydrogen vapor  will be required. The proposed two-stage pulse-tube cooler is ideally suited to such applications. For  missions that will involve transportation or in-situ liquefaction of liquid cryogens such as hydrogen and  oxygen, the proposed two-stage pulse-tube cooler is again ideally suited. The presence of two stages  allows cooling at two temperatures. The proposed cooler is easily modified to liquefy hydrogen at the low  temperature stage, and oxygen, for example, at the higher temperature stage.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A market of about $100 million/year currently exists for G-M cooler-based cryopumps for sputtering systems used in the semiconductor industry. Sputtering systems normally have several cryopumps per unit with each cryopump costing $20-25,000. We forecast that the more reliable pulse tube cooler would cost about the same as current G-M units and will be less expensive to maintain due to the lack of oil and  rubbing surfaces.  Other cooling applications include: superconducting magnets for MRI systems, superconducting magnets for power generation and energy storage, liquefaction of industrial gases and radio astronomy.

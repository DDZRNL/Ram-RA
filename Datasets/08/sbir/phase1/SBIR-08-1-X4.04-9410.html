		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Traditional structural health monitoring (SHM) methods have been limited due to the implied infrastructure, including wires for power and communication from each sensor to data acquisition units.  Presently, Metis Design Corporation (MDC) has demonstrated the patented technique of point-of-measurement datalogging.  During the proposed research, MDC will further exploit this SHM architecture to satisfy NASA mission specifications.  This work focuses on a Boeing Proprietary technology that allows cable-free transfer of electrical signals.  To date, this technology has been demonstrated to successfully power and transfer data from analog sensor arrays.  During Phase I, MDC will work with Boeing to demonstrate this technology for a digital sensor bus.  The first task will aim to modify the existing sensor hardware to be physically compatible with such a bus.  The second task will investigate attachment mechanisms that will provide the necessary electrical connections while not sacrificing strength or structural coupling for wave propagation.  The third task will seek to design an impedance matching circuit for the sensor-bus to support multiple sensors for both power and data on the same CAN-style bus. The final task will piece each of these components together to demonstrate damage detection and localization on a composite plate supplied by Boeing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Once this product is completed through Phase I and II SBIR research, it will be ready for deployment within several NASA applications.  Of direct immediate relevance would be crew exploration vehicles (CEV's) that replace the shuttle orbiter.  This technology could also be implemented as part of other reusable launch systems for quick turn-around times, expendable launch systems for pre-launch go/no-go decisions, and the international space station to detect impacts or other damage.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There will be many commercial applications for this technology beyond NASA.  First would likely be for DoD Aerospace applications such as Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELV) and Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLV).  Next would be ageing fixed and rotary-wing aircraft retro-fit, followed by new fixed and rotary-wing aircraft integration. Unmanned vehicles (UAV and UCAV) would so have a need for this technology.  Commercial aviation would have similar needs.  Outside of DoD there are other commercial applications such as naval vessels (ships, submarines, carriers), ground vehicles (cars, trucks, tanks) and civil infrastructure (bridges, tunnels, buildings).

<p><strong>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </strong>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200   words)<BR>
  The program focuses on turbulence modeling enhancements for predicting   high-speed rocket base flows. A key component of the effort is the collection of   high-fidelity data for supporting turbulence model validation and calibration.   Base flow configurations of interest to NASA Marshal will also be investigated   using improved modeling tools. Experiments for supersonic rocket base flows will   be performed in the new 12&Acirc;&rdquo;X12&Acirc;&rdquo; tunnel, at the National Center for Physical   Acoustics (NCPA), utilizing high-quality base flow models, provided by the US   Army. Measurements will include Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) for turbulent   statistics, supplemented by Schlieren, Raman spectroscopy and Rayleigh   scattering. Complimentary Large Eddy Simulations (LES) will provide additional   turbulence statistics that are not readily/reliably measured. The data will   support enhancements to the CRAFT Tech unified k-epsilon turbulence model. The   impact of employing a variable turbulent Prandtl and Schmidt number methodology,   based on a two-equation scalar variance framework, will be considered for   reacting and non-reacting base flows. The effort will lead to extended   validation of enhanced turbulence modeling tools, increased reliability of base   drag &amp; heat flux predictions and fills a major gap at NASA by improving upon   base region simulation capabilities required for launcher design aerothermal   predictions.   
<p><strong>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </strong>( Limit 1500 characters,   approximately 150 words) <BR>
  The proposed effort is directly supportive of   NASA&Acirc;&rsquo;s activities related to the design. testing and flight certification of   future generations of space vehicles, e.g. Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV), Heavy   Launch Vehicle (HLV), etc. Specifically, to accurately develop thermal   protection systems (TPS) and establish base heat shield requirements will   require a basic understanding of the physical mechanisms governing radiative and   convective heat transfer resulting from the plume aerothermal environments. The   proposed simulation tool, that will be well-validated against test-data, will   play a crucial role in supporting production-oriented analysis relevant to   design optimization, definition of test procedures, supporting launch   requirements and test data interpretation.  
<p><strong>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </strong>( Limit 1500 characters,   approximately 150 words)<BR>
  The base flow modeling capability development is   directly applicable to major DoD initiatives of current relevance. Specifically,   it supports missile plume signature characterization of tactical/strategic   systems as related to Missile Defense Agency (MDA) requirements for Boost Phase   Intercept (BPI) and threat detection via signature spike (&Acirc;&ldquo;launch flash&Acirc;&rdquo;)   during missile engine ignition. The simulation tools are directly applicable to   the development of commercial launch vehicles, and supporting analysis related   to design of thermal protection systems (TPS). The simulation software will be   licensed to prime vendors and supporting organizations engaged in development of   commercial launchers, missiles and interceptors, propulsion systems for space   applications e.g. Boeing/Rocketdyne, Pratt &amp; Whitney, Northrop Grumman,   Lockheed, Raytheon, etc.

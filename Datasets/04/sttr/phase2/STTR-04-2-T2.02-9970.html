<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The need for aerodynamics-based efficiency enhancements for air vehicles is presented. The results of the Phase I investigation of concepts for morphing aircraft are discussed. Morphing enables the aircraft to optimize its configuration for various flight regimes. This translates to benefits in range, endurance, manueuvering and speed characteristics of the air vehicle. Using simulations, live testing, and benchtop hardware development, the feasibility of the concepts was established in Phase I. In Phase II, key additions to the design, such as trailing edge flaps, and an intelligent, sense-and-adapt method to achieve continuous aerodynamic optimization flight testing will be integrated. Wind tunnel testing and flight testing will be performed to refine and finalize the designs.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
These innovations can be applied to several NASA subsonic aircraft, including manned and unmanned platforms. Some of the work here can be extended to gust alleviation for high altitude UAVs as well. This STTR effort complements other work underway at NASA in the areas of adaptive aircraft, morphing aircraft configurations, robust controls, intelligent/distributed vehicle health monitoring, and intelligent aircraft.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Several federal agencies are using (or planning to use) large unmanned aircraft for civilian (science mission) and homeland security roles. Also, military groups are planning to use high altitude long endurance UAVs for reconnaissance and sensor platform missions. Morphing enables such aircraft to optimize their configuration for various flight regimes. This translates to benefits in range, endurance, manueuvering, handling, and speed characteristics of the air vehicle.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
HyPerComp Engineering, Inc. (HEI) proposes to continue the characterization of the cryogenic evaluation of irradiated composite materials for use in composite overwrap pressure vessels COPVs.  The intent of the proposed effort is to study the constituent raw composite material properties that result from radiation exposure and tested at cryogenic temperatures. 
<br>
<br>HEI and Mississippi  State University (MSU) have recently completed a Phase I STTR (contract #NNM05AA61C) through NASA/MSFC.  The intent of this effort is to further the development of that key building block technology for lightweight composite structures suitable for cryogenic fuel storage or human in-space habitats.  This effort will incorporate and expand previous work by the participants in the cryogenic performance of composite materials exposed to radiation environments.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA applications for the technologies we have explored with this STTR would be lightweight composite structures that could be used for reliable and safe cryogenic propellant (ie. fuel depots) storage, radiation resistant/shielding human habitat structures, and robust structures and tankage capable of withstanding micrometeroid and space debris impacts while also being radiation robust.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The commercial COPV industry is always looking for improvements in performance (ie. weight) and safety.  There has been some significant discussion on the usage of cryogenic COPVs for efficient gaseous fuel storage, particularly with regard to the transportation of large volumes of gaseous fuels such as CNG.  The improvement in environmental robustness of cryogenic capable lightweight COPVs will be noticed by the commercial industry and this technology will be incorporated into specialized applications.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Luna proposes to continue development on a high-speed fiber optic sensor and readout system for cryogenic temperature measurements in liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogen (LH2).  This work will be based on the solid proof of feasibility completed during the Phase I STTR project and will result in 1) extremely high-speed, minimally-intrusive fiber optic temperature sensors for cryogenic and high-temperature applications and 2) an industrially robust, turn-key fiber optic readout system capable of servicing numerous sensor types, addressing a broad range of needs within NASA.  The sensors and system developed here will be specifically designed to meet NASA Stennis needs for facility and test article health-monitoring.  Additionally, the basic readout system could be extended to include rotary and linear position for valve position feedback, which supports NASAs stated need for smart system components such as control valves, regulators, and relief valves that provide real-time, closed-loop control, component configuration, automated operation, and component health.  Lunas research subcontractor, Virginia Tech, will develop new and improved methods to accurately model the transient interaction between cryogenic fluid flow and immersed sensors that predict the dynamic load on the sensors, frequency spectrum, heat transfer, and effect on the flow field as part of this effort.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The cryogenic temperature sensors proposed for this project will find application in the following NASA applications, all of which will further develop Mans Exploration of Space: NASA development of the next generation re-usable launch vehicle, NASA R&D of higher performance, lower cost engine technologies for the Presidents initiative to reach the Moon, Mars and beyond, NASA research on low cost and safer engine technologies for the commercialization of Space, NASA and DOD research in SCRAM jet propulsion technology, and NASA and DOD research in advanced air-breathing and hybrid propulsion systems such as for the Orbital Space Plane (OSP).<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Luna has worked extensively with major aerospace manufacturers, and has identified several applications that could benefit from the proposed technology.  The cryogenic temperature sensors proposed for this project will find application in the following non-NASA applications: Development of lower cost and safer engine technologies for the commercialization of space, Commercial rocket engine testing and operation, Control of LOX systems for industrial smelting operations, and Industrial monitoring and control of harsh chemical production such as  mild to heavy oxidizers, bases and acids.

<p><strong>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </strong>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200   words)<BR>
  Space exploration is a unique challenge with many difficulties in its   implementation. With a goal of the return of man to the moon and travel to Mars,   the stage has been set for the expansion of human knowledge beyond   comprehension. Traveling to the moon and Mars, however, will require new and   innovative technologies. Key to this will be system health management (SHM). For   any given system of the myriad that will be required for space missions, a way   of safely and efficiently managing the system health will be required. These   goals are the motivation behind the proposed Phase II effort.   
<p><strong>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </strong>( Limit 1500 characters,   approximately 150 words) <BR>
  The proposed technologies will prove useful to a   wide variety of NASA applications. A complete unified SHM approach will provide   safety and efficiency to many system level applications. Demonstration on a   power subsystem will provide many offshoot technologies with commercial   applications such as the battery impedance monitoring technique developed in   Phase I (patent pending).   
<p><strong>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </strong>( Limit 1500 characters,   approximately 150 words)<BR>
  Potential Non-NASA commercial applications exist in   many different sectors. QSI's diagnostic tools are currently being used in   military and commercial applications on three continents. Enhancements to the   QSI toolset will be of great value to current customers and open the door for   new sales. The application of the battery monitoring and prognostics technology   is very promising for such market sectors as electric/hybrid-electric vehicles,   consumer electronics (laptops, cell phones, etc...), residential and commercial   power generation and storage technology (e.g. home solar power generation   units), etc...

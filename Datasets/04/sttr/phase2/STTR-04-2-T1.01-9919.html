<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Proposal Title:
<br>	Aerospace Systems Monitor
<br>PHASE 1 Technical Abstract:
<br>This Phase II STTR project will continue development and commercialization of the Aerospace System Monitor (ASM). This technology transforms the power distribution network in a spacecraft or aircraft into a multiple-use service, providing not only power distribution but also a diagnostic monitoring capability and system health monitoring based on observations of the way in which loads draw power from the distribution service. Careful measurements are made power transients and this data is used to assess system functioning and identify potential faults and failures. In the Phase II project,  development will continue on the ASM software and on power line sensors to obtain data in ground testing and in flight.  ASM will be applied to reaction wheels and momentum wheels.  A test bed will be built and we will demonstrate the ability to verify correct operation and identify faults and flaws in prototype and operational reaction wheels.   Phase III will continue this work and apply it further to reaction wheels and to other systems and components in ground testing and in flight.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The Aerospace System Monitor is a new, inexpensive, lightweight and non-space consuming method to measure system operation and system health. It will be a new method to obtain this information on satellite systems and provide a new source and type of data. It also represents another "string" of data for manned and high value unmanned systems which require multiple sources of sensor data.   It will be useful in ground testing and in flight and will also be useful in manned spacecraft and in aircraft.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
This Non-intrusive electrical monitoring technology (NEMO)  will also have applications in military and commercial automotive vehicles,  in ships and boats and for monitoring of HVAC and other electrical systems in buildings and facilities.

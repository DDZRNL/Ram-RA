<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Coatings for bearings and seals are an enabling technology for contamination-free fuel cell compressors for aerospace or aircraft applications.  Since the feasibility of using the novel H-DLC films developed by the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and the KorolonTM coating technology developed by MiTi® for application to fuel cell propulsion compressor bearings was demonstrated in Phase I studies, we propose to further evaluate the performance of the selected coating systems in realistic environments in Phase II.  These coatings will be applied to both thrust and journal foil bearings for evaluation in component bearing tests in realistic environments; and if funding and time permit, followed by implementation and evaluation of the coated bearings in a fuel cell compressor/expander at MiTi®.  Environmental testing could include testing of the bearings under a variety of humidity, ambient air pressure and debris ingestion to fully assess reliability and durability of the coating system. MiTi® will attempt to define approaches that will allow for accelerated testing of the coatings. Phase II will also investigate the application processes to ensure that the coatings (both the ANL H-DLC films and the MiTi® KorolonTM coatings) may be commercialized.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The primary focus of the proposed program will be on bearing compressors for Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Applications include electrical power for space shuttle orbiter, future Moon and Mars surface and transportation power, International Space Station emergency power and/or energy storage, reusable launch vehicle power, and various portable power applications. Other applications are personal power for extravehicular activity suit applications, and auxiliary power units and primary power in airplanes and uninhabited air vehicles. Aerospace applications include high-altitude, long duration environmental observation aircraft such as Helios and other electrically powered aircraft.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Fuel cells offer many benefits for automotive transportation and power generation, including the prime power source in busses, cars, trucks, auxiliary power units for large highway trucks, utility power stations and small power units for laptop computers.  Small military electrically powered UAVs will also benefit.  Each requires an efficient compressor system capable of providing contaminant free air.  The technology will also have application as an air cycle machine for cabin cooling and pressurization of the newly developed small business class/microjet aircraft.

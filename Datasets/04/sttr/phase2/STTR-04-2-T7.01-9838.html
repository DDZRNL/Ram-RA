<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
We intend to perform a Demonstration Certification of a COTS automotive engine, including and focusing on what is likely to be one of the most challenging aspects of the FAA Engine Certification, the FAA approval of a COTS automotive Engine Control Unit (ECU). 
<br>The COTS automotive based ECU is the most technically challenging system due, not only to the design and manufacturing processes employed in the mass production of the ECU, but because of the criticality of the ECU in the functions it performs on the COTS engine, and the criticality of the ECU when it is integrated within the aircraft system, for the safety of flight.
<br>
<br>In addition the COTS automotive ECU contains complex electronic hardware and software, and employs mass production processes, with advanced manufacturing technologies and packaging techniques, which are not currently employed in the production of commercial aviation flight critical digital electronic systems today.
<br>
<br>We are confident that the approach taken for the Demonstration Certification of the COTS engine, and the COTS ECU, can then be leveraged into achieving FAA approval of not only all other aspects of the propulsion system, but also into the aircraft flight control systems, including the flight deck electronics, displays, communication and navigation systems.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The results of this Phase 2 activity will show that compliance with the FAA regulations can be demonstrated when employing mass produced automotive COTS systems and technologies, and when using non-Government standards, including the industry Consensus Standards such as IEEE, EIA / JEDEC, RTCA, SAE, TS-16949.
<br>
<br>As a result of the successful demonstration of COTS systems and technologies in flight critical applications, the next generation of small aircraft for both military and commercial applications, including Unmanned Air Systems and Personal Air Vehicles, can be enabled to be safe, affordable and Certifiable with the FAA.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
It is our belief that the introduction of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) systems and technologies into the aviation industry for flight critical applications, will help create the renaissance for the Small Aircraft industry. However, it must first be demonstrated to the FAA, that these COTS systems are safe and airworthy for flight critical applications. 
<br>
<br>This Phase 2 activity intends to demonstrate that the COTS automotive Engine and ECU can achieve Certification in accordance with the FAA regulations, and that these COTS systems are safe, airworthy and Certifiable.
<br>
<br>As a result, it will be our goal to solicit the appropriate suppliers of COTS systems; including suppliers of COTS automotive engines, and suppliers of electronic systems within the existing aviation supplier base, as well as outside this base, and especially those suppliers who have demonstrated the ability to produce high quality and high reliability electronic systems in mass production for the automotive industry.
<br>Given the success of these endeavors we will attempt to form collaborative relationships that will enable the production of the FAA Certfied COTS technologies, leading to the proliferation of affordable COTS systems for flight critical applications in future small aircraft.

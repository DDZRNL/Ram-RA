<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Space Micro will extend our Phase I R&D to develop a family of miniature, active space radiation dosimeters/particle counters, with a focus on biological/manned dose levels. A single board design will support both manned level and space electronics level dosimetry needs. This is enabled by the density and features of commercial high density silicon semiconductor memory devices, coupled with innovative patented programming algorithms.
<br>We plan to augment this core dosimeter technology with other emerging novel miniature radiation detectors to enhance single particle detection, including heavy ions and secondary neutrons.
<br>A flight dosimeter will be delivered to NASA for flight demo on ISS or other platform.
<br>Space Micro will then commercialize for both NASA markets (manned and electronics grade levels) with a standard product offering through our established marketing channels. 
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA applications include both human and life sciences/biological programs. This dosimeter directly supports ISS, NASA's Mission to the moon, Mars, and beyond, by monitoring astronaut radiation dosage real time during long duration missions. New specific programs include CEV and Robotic Lunar Exploration Program (RLEP)
<br>
<br>In addition, Space Micro will develop a derivative product targeting the higher radiation levels seen in unmanned missions. In these programs the electronics and materials are impacted by the space radiation.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Non-NASA applications include detectors and dosimeters for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). US and NATO ground military forces also could benefit.
<br>
<br>Planned commercial space tourism ventures will need stringent passemger monitoring.
<br>
<br>Commercial and DoD space programs such as imaging, weather and telecommuncations satellites will be benefit and be future customers for this standard product.

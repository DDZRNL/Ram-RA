<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The use of multidisciplinary analysis (MDA) techniques for combustion device environment prediction, including complex fluid mixing phenomena, is now becoming possible as numerical algorithms and high performance computing clusters become more powerful.  Parallel solution methodologies and distributed memory architectures are currently available, yet the challenge of bringing highly sophisticated MDA research algorithms into a fast-paced NASA engineering environment still remains.  In particular, continued improvements in current analysis tools and further validation of physical models are still needed to develop practical MDA capabilities.  The product of our proposed Phase II effort will be an to compute turbulent, chemically reacting flows with coupled structural heating.  Our unique approach, employing solution-based mesh refinement algorithms for generalized unstructured meshes, will provide NASA with the critical capability to solve fluid/structure interaction problems in a collaborative engineering environment.  The developed software will be capable of generating both performance and multi-dimensional environments for rocket engine combustion devices.  More specifically, it will support accurate and timely design analyses for all Exploration Vision propulsion systems combustion devices and will offer NASA a significantly improved, commercially viable analysis tool.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
This technology will provide NASA with an enhanced multi-disciplinary analysis capability for the prediction of chemically reacting flows in combustion devices with transient conjugate heat transfer and solution-based mesh refinement.  Potential enhancements to the proposed MDA tools include solid propellant burning with particle tracking, rotating reference frames for steady state turbomachinery analyses, more complex real fluids models, improved low Mach number performance, and extended model validation.  The proposed methodology for the analysis of complex fluid/structure interaction problems is also well suited for extensions to additional multi-physics capabilities of commercial interest to NASA.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The growing trend toward collaborative and multi-disciplinary engineering is opening significant new markets as more complex problems can be addressed using advanced computational techniques.  The ability to easily analyze multi-disciplinary problems in a timely manner will allow industry to speed development of new products and streamline testing.  Further enhancements to the CHEM MDA system, such as extensions to real fluids and two phase flow models, will find application in the aerospace, automotive, electronics cooling, and environmental industries.  The basic architecture of the software will remain the same while new plug-in physical models can be developed to address niche markets.

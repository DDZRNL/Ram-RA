		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This STTR Phase I project will establish the feasibility of an innovative manufacturing process to fabricate a range of unique hafnium/silicon based carbide composites and material systems that cannot be processed using conventional techniques. These materials are expected to have a host of unique mechanical and thermal characteristics making them highly suitable for ultrahigh temperature aerospace and commercial applications. The manufacturing technique offers a viable, low-cost, environmentally friendly, and highly flexible processing technology that can also be used to generate various material forms (fiber reinforced and graded structures) and complex, net-shape components. In addition to the primary feasibility tasks, the Phase I effort will also quantify mechanical and thermal properties, and oxidation resistance characteristics of the processed materials, as functions of composition and microstructure. This will serve to guide the identification of specific applications for the fabricated materials. Phase II activities will expand the initial effort to demonstrate the use of these materials for structural elements by refining the processing technique, developing other material systems, and fabricating structural components that incorporate graded and fiber-reinforced morphologies. In conjunction with the STTR effort, we will pursue a commercialization plan that involves specific collaborations with commercial partners and end-users.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Our novel ultrahigh temperature materials offer the potential to meet high-performance goals at significantly lower weight, while simultaneously improving safety by operating with a higher margin between design temperature and material upper use temperature. These materials are expected to have broad impact on a host of applications within NASA's Next Generation Launch Technology (NGLT) Program. Aerospace applications include rocket propulsion components, single stage-to-orbit vehicles and hypersonic leading edges. Our flexible fabrication technique could also be adapted for processing solid nuclear fuels and in-core materials for Prometheus and land-based nuclear programs.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Commercial applications of our materials are in the power generation, transportation and process industries. These materials could be used to improve the performance of air-breathing engines, resulting in lower emission and higher cycles efficiency. Other applications include high-speed machine tools, high temperature furnaces, and process equipment for molten metal processing.

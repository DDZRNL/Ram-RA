		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed R&D is to develop a wireless data networking capability.  A prototype capability will result from the Phase 1 and 2 contracts.  The Versatile Wireless Data Net (VWDN) employs an 802.11x wireless protocol for a network of sensor, recording, and monitoring nodes.   The concept combines extensive computational capability with a family of transducers in self-contained packages with an electrical and environmental immunity.  Plug-in transducers include microphones, extensometers, toxic gas, pressure sensors, explosive gas, strain gauges (both resistance and fiber-optical), load cells, electromagnetic flux, pyrometers, and accelerometers; many will be MEMS devices.  The net enables coordinated, efficient transmission of measurement signals; self test metrics, and environmental metrics to a recording computer.  This computer also performs data display and network control for operator intervention to set network functional priorities and implement appropriate responses to monitoring trouble messages.  An existing ABT wireless nodal prototype and workstation computer will be used as the basis for the developing the full network capability, that will primarily use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) MEMS transducers.  After the concept is sufficiently defined, Phase 1 tasks will include a simulation to demonstrate proof of concept.  <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The VWDN is expected to have substantial value.  For NASA the network can be installed in rocket test and launch facilities to monitor operations of propellant and gas transport and storage systems.  These benefits can be extended to other Government and contractor operations with dispersed engineering facilities for energy, chemical, fuel, food, water, waste processing
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Commercially, the VWDEN capability to autonomously sense, measure, evaluate and transmit useful decision making data meets a numerous functional needs, particularly in the energy sector.  The wireless networking of a variety of operating metrics enables the network application to many uses in oil and gas distribution, water purification, food processing, and waste management operations.  Insightful use of the network will enable these industries to improve continuity of operations, reduce risk of unscheduled and damaging disruptions, reduce manpower required to obtain the vital data for timely adjust to system operations and maintenance, and extend useful life of the assets.

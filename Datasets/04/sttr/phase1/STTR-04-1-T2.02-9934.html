		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Fiber optic sensors are rapidly emerging to replace conventional electrical-based sensor instrumentation in specific applications where small size, low mass, multiplexing capability, and high temperature resistance is a requirement. The advantages offered by state-of-the-art fiber optic sensors are particularly important for flight testing applications where the extremely low-profile geometry of a hair-thin Fiber optic sensor permits precise measurements of pressure, temperature and skin friction with minimal intrusion into the flow field. Luna innovations propose the design of a miniaturized, co-located temperature, pressure and skin friction sensor for point distributed transonic flow measurements during aircraft testing. Luna will also work on demodulation hardware and algorithms to improve output accuracy and reliability in a flight environment. During Phase I, Luna proposes to leverage previous experience in the development of combined pressure, temperature and skin friction sensors previously developed and investigate the feasibility of miniaturizing and ruggedizing these transducer assemblies to make an integrated sensor package that is simple to install, cost effective and is compatible with the harsh aircraft environment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The sensor package will enable NASA engineers to accurately measure multiple, co-located environmental and aerodynamic parameters during flight test applications. A spatial distribution of the sensor package over the test area will enable surface mapping of the measurands which, when correlated to flight events, will facilitate determination and correction of undesirable performance characteristics. The high accuracy data obtained will enable improvement of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) flow simulation codes leading to further reduce test times and overall cost savings.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		In addition to NASA's need for a high-performance integrated sensor for flight test applications, there is a large commercial market for such devices for wind tunnel test applications, sub-sea flowline design and analysis, transportation system design, development and operation. The technology can also be used in commercial jet engines, automobile engines and in power generation and monitoring systems for nuclear and full-cell technologies. Government agencies such as the Air Force, DARPA, Navy and the DOE are potential end users of the miniaturized, integrated sensor.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Future NASA space exploration missions will use nanometer-scale electronic technologies which call for a shift in how radiation effects in such devices and materials are viewed. The energy deposition by ionizing particles (so called single event effects) can no longer be treated as an average deposition (linear energy transfer, LET). Nano-scale electronic device responses are strongly related to the microstructure of the radiation event. This requires a much more detailed physics-based modeling approach. It is also important to convert such results into engineering models used in device and circuit designs. Hence, the proposed innovation: detailed high-energy-physics-based simulations of radiation events efficiently coupled with advanced device response computations. The innovative Technology Transfer: interface specification and implementation to allow smooth, automated integration between Vanderbilt University high-energy particle advanced computations and CFDRC Device Simulator, and to enable statistically meaningful runs on a massively parallel supercomputing cluster. Significance for NASA:  the impact of such radiation events has implications for nano-scale devices operating in space exploration environments. The new approach to understanding the single-event response of semiconductor materials, devices, and circuits is necessary for reliable engineering models used for early design assessment, radiation hardening, and to reduce the amount of radiation testing cost and time.

		The proposed advanced single-event models, which better reflect the true deep-space environment of exploration missions, will lead to development of new tools that will help NASA to:<BR>(a)	better understand and predict response of nano-devices and novel materials to space radiation environment, particularly high atomic number and energy particles (HZE particles) and energetic protons;<BR>(b)	assess technologies, devices, and materials of new electronic systems;<BR>(c)	better evaluate the radiation response at early design stage; <BR>(d)	develop and assess radiation hardening techniques for exploration electronics;<BR>(e)	set requirements for hardening and testing;  reduce the amount of testing cost and time.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The new, more accurate radiation-effects models, integrated with automated simulation tools, will enable better understanding and analysis of radiation-response of novel nano-materials and nano-devices for advanced aerospace electronic circuits and systems. The modeling and design tools will provide reduction in cost and time-to-market through significantly reduced experimental R&D, design cycle, and laboratory testing time and cost. The new models will impact the Radiation Hardening of airborne and terrestrial electronics for defense applications (Air Force, Navy, Missile Defense Agency) and commercial applications (satellites, aircrafts).

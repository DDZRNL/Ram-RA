		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Biofilms are ubiquitous in the environment.  Few surfaces resist biofilm formation, most promote it.  Biofilm formation poses problems in water systems as they can clog pipes and pores, block filters, reduce heat transfer, and in general restrict flow.  Their metabolic products can aid corrosion, even of stainless steel.  In potable water systems, both their metabolic products and the bacteria or fungi themselves directly pose a health hazard.  A space environment appears to be a particularly favorable one for biofilm formation.  Cell cultures have shown far higher rates of growth in low-gravity environments.  Space radiation seems to accelerate microbial growth and foster their mutation.  Within a closed environment with many non-replaceable resources, prevention of biofilm formation is paramount.  To meet this need, Agave BioSystems and the Universities Space Research Association, propose to develop carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and other nanostructures for the prevention of biofilm growth.  In this Phase I, we propose to demonstrate that the use of nanostructured materials can prevent or inhibit growth of biofilms due to geometry effects and that they can also be functionalized with a biocide.

		On long-term space missions, waste water and recovery systems will be integral to closed loop life support.  Air and water revitalization and recovery systems are susceptible to many microbes within each of these categories.  Disinfection is neither complete nor applicable to all systems.  Immediate needs include the condensing heat exchanger, both for its functional importance and health impact, and the water system currently in use on ISS.  In these system and future systems, antibacterial surfaces could sufficiently contribute so as to reduce if not eliminate the need for such high levels of disinfectants.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Microbial biofilms on surfaces cost the nation billions of dollars yearly in equipment damage, product contamination, energy losses and medical infections. Conventional methods of killing bacteria (such as antibiotics, and disinfection) are often ineffective with biofilm bacteria. The huge doses of antimicrobials required to rid systems of biofilm bacteria are environmentally undesirable (biocides and environmental antimicrobials cost $1.2 Billion per year) and medically impractical (since what it would take to kill the biofilm bacteria would also kill the patient!). So new strategies based on a better understanding of how bacteria attach, grow and detach are urgently needed by many industries.

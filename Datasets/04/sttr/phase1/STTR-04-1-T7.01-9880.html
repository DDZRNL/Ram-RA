		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The innovation is a low aspect ratio all-lifting configuration for personal air vehicles. This configuration uses an architecture fundamentally different from conventional aircraft to achieve large reductions in cost and improvements in safety. The concept features an integrated all-lifting body that performs the functions of the wing, tail and fuselage of a conventional light airplane with a single, simple structure.<BR>  <BR>The integrated lifting body has an aspect ratio between approximately 1.0 and 2.5, and is deep enough to contain the crew and payload without a conventional fuselage.<BR>  <BR>A further innovation is the use of a faceted shape composed of flat panels. The faceting greatly simplifies the manufacture of the major parts of the airframe, further reducing cost.  <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Structural design technology for low-cost PAV airframes.<BR><BR>PAV research aircraft:  A low aspect ratio all-lifting research aircraft would demonstrate technologies and a configuration that would dramatically reduce the cost of  personal aircraft, and improve safety significantly over current-generation configurations<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Personal Air Vehicle: The configuration and structural concepts from this research could be used to develop an aircraft for owner-operated personal transportation that would be safer and lower-cost that current generation general aviation airplanes.<BR><BR>Light Sport airplane: The light weight and low wing loading of the low aspect ratio all-lifting configuration are well suited to meeting the requirements of the recently enacted "Light Sport Aircraft" regulations.<BR><BR>Utility Aircraft: The configuration offers the combination of large internal volume and short takeoff and landing distances.

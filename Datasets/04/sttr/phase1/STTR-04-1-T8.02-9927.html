		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The innovation is the systematic "building-block" validation of CFD/turbulence models employing a GUI driven CFD code (RPFM) and existing as well as new data sets to be generated in this proposed program. Unified ke and algebraic stress (EASM) turbulence models, shown to adequately simulate fundamental high-speed jet data sets and now being validated with PIV data sets in a NASA Glenn program, will be used. These jet turbulence models will be improved to provide agreement with base region data for cold air data sets. Hot jet base region data sets are not readily to evaluate Prandtl number models affecting base heating. Inadequacies pose major issues with regard to analyzing base regions of rocket motors. A key innovation is to obtain high speed, hot jet base region data sets in the new, U.Miss/Oxford 12" quiet tunnel facility using advanced diagnostic techniques, extending the hot, supersonic jet data of Seiner. In Phase I, consistent modeling of cold flow base region data will be achieved, and, the hot jet base region problem will be initiated. This innovation fills a major gap at NASA improving upon base region simulation capabilities required for launcher design aerothermal predictions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed effort is directly supportive of NASA's activities related to the design. testing and flight certification of future generations of space vehicles. Specifically, to accurately develop thermal protection systems and establish base heat shield requirements will require a basic understanding of the physical mechanisms governing radiative and convective heat transfer resulting from the plume aerothermal environments. The proposed simulation tool, that will be well-validated against test-data, will play a crucial role in supporting production-oriented analysis relevant to design optimization, definition of test procedures, supporting launch requirements and test data interpretation

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The base flow modeling capability development is directly applicable to major DoD initiatives of current relevance. Specifically, it supports missile plume signature characterization of tactical/strategic systems as related to Missile Defense Agency (MDA) requirements for Boost Phase Intercept (BPI) and threat detection via signature spike ("launch flash") during missile engine ignition. The simulation tools are directly applicable to the development of commercial launch vehicles. The simulation software will be licensed to prime vendors and supporting organizations engaged in development of commercial launchers, missiles and interceptors, propulsion systems for space applications e.g. Boeing/Rocketdyne, Pratt & Whitney, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed, Raytheon, etc.

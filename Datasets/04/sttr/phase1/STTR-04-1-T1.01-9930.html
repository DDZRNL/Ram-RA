		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		In order to meet the challenges of space exploration, knowledge of the current and future health of mission critical systems is essential. Qualtech Systems, Inc. in cooperation with Montana Tech of the University of Montana proposes to develop an intelligent self evolving prognostic fusion solution. The proposed solution intelligently combines multiple subsystem health assessments to form an overall system health assessment. Additionally, the solution performs optimal system configuration based upon the health assessment. <BR><BR>Design of the individual prognostic solutions for subsystem health assessment also utilizes fusion methods. The approach combines both model based and data driven techniques to provide optimal health assessment. The prognostic solution self evolves over time to cover the life of the subsystem.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed solution offers intelligent prognostic health assessment capabilities for mission critical systems. The solution works to support the NASA "system of systems" approach. Important systems such as spacecraft, space stations, lunar and planetary bases, etc? will benefit from the proposed technology with increased reliability and safety. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed technology will have wide applications beyond NASA. Such complex systems as commercial and military aircraft, ground transportation, communications systems, power generation systems, computer systems, etc... could all benefit tremendously from the proposed technology.

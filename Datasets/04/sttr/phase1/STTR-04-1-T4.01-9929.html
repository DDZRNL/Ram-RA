		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The STTR Phase I proposal aims to develop innovative device concepts and fabrication techniques that enable the construction of high-performance uncooled long-wave infrared (LWIR, 8-12?Ym) photodetectors. LWIR photodetectors are of great importance in real-time acquisition of radiation characteristics of the Earth and its environments for understanding and predicting the Earth's climate and potential hazards. Quantum dot infrared photodetector (QDIP) technology offers an excellent choice for LWIR sensing due to its superior performance, including high temporal resolution (<1 ?Ys) and low noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD <10mK). However, existing QDIP technology requires cryogenic cooling to reduce dark current, which substantially increases size, weight and power consumption. Because of this, the proposed research aims to develop innovative device concepts and fabrication techniques that can substantially reduce dark current, thus allow the construction of uncooled QDIPs. The uncooled QDIP technology enables high-performance LWIR detecting on a chip with significantly reduced payload. It is highly desired in many Earth science applications. The Phase I work will perform feasibility investigation of the proposed device concept, optimize quantum dots growth and annealing techniques and produce a preliminary design for a prototype system that can be built and demonstrated in Phase II with a NASA supplied platform.

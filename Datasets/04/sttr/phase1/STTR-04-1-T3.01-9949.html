		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		TRS Technologies, Inc. in collaboration with The Pennsylvania State University propose to develop new families of high temperature piezoelectric materials for adaptive engine control.  The identification, synthesis and characterization of these new materials will enable the design of new high temperature piezoelectric active flow control actuators that may enable dramatic increases in the efficiency of revolutionary alternative propulsion system concepts or the concept designs themselves.  Specifically, the objective of the program is to identify materials for high authority (d33 ? 400 pC/N) piezoelectric actuators for fuel flow control in gas turbine engines.  The high strain, high force actuators will be operational in the range of 600?1200<SUP>o</SUP>F with 1 to 10 kHz capabilities.  This will be achieved by synthesizing new piezoelectric in both textured ceramic and single crystal form.  The focus will be to use cost effectives methods to produce either textured microstructures or single crystal materials that lend themselves to domain engineering for enhanced piezoelectric performance at elevated temperatures.

		The identification, synthesis and characterization of these new materials will enable the design of new high temperature piezoelectric active flow control actuators that may enable dramatic increases in the efficiency of revolutionary alternative propulsion system concepts or the concept designs themselves.  Specifically, the objective of the program is to identify materials for high authority piezoelectric actuators for fuel flow control in gas turbine engines.  Other NASA applications of interest include high temperature accelerometers, sensors, and vibration sensors.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		There is a broad range of applications that can be greatly improved through use of the textured ceramic and converted ceramic technology discussed in this proposal.  Accelerometers and vibration sensors require a high degree of property stability with temperature and there are many industrial and aerospace applications that require increased operating temperature.  Also, there are a broad variety of actuator and sensor applications, particularly in the area of smart structures (vibration control, structure morphing) for aircraft, watercraft, and automotive applications that could benefit from increased operational temperature and/or improved temperature stability.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed effort is concerned with the development of a novel optimization scheme and computer software for the effective design of advanced aerospace vehicles. Since such vehicles are characterized by unprecedented levels of areo-structural-controls-propulsion interactions, a multidisciplinary simulation is essential for their effective design. This can be accomplished by employing the common finite element method for the structures and also fluids and propulsion simulations. A typical multidisciplinary optimization scheme will involve structural design for minimum weight with aerodynamic data such as drag and wing platform as design variable subject to constraints like flutter and structural strength. Emphasis will be placed on the choice and calculation of suitable gradient of objective function as well as the constraints to guarantee global optimal solution. Novel numerical schemes will also be developed for efficient, cost effective solution of large complex practical problems such as current and future flight vehicles. In Phase I, the basic numerical schemes for the optimum design will be establish along with a pilot code to verify these techniques. Also developed will be a general turbulence package for any typical FE CFD software. In Phase II, a complete software will be developed and checked out for the simulation of complex practical problems.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		A Web-based Airborne Remote Sensing Telemetry Server (WARSTS) is proposed to integrate UAV telemetry and web-technology into an innovative communication, command, control, and computer-network (C4) system for operational UAV remote sensing. WARSTS integrates two innovative subsystems: the Tracking Antenna Radio Link (TARL) and the Web-based Application Support System (WASS). TARL serves as the sensor gateway to WASS. It links a remotely deployed airborne sensor platform and ground control equipment by a high-speed peer-to-peer Wi-Fi link. TARL monitors airborne instruments and UAV operation status continuously while performing selective imaging data transmission. WASS processes the structured UAV platform position/attitude and imaging data and makes them visualizable through an integrated web-enabled application package in realtime. WARSTS features the following capabilities: (1) a realtime sensor fusion algorithm that combines inertial, GPS, magnetometer, and other sensor input to deliver precision airborne platform state vectors at a rate greater than 50 Hz; (2) a set of visualization tools that automatically generate the mapping area mosaic of the remote sensing UAV along with its 3D flight through animation; (3) human-UAV instrument interactive control; (4) hotspot realtime hyperspectral/multispectral data download; and finally (5) a fully featured web-based connectivity solution that speeds up information delivery.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The final WARSTS product deliverable to NASA is a suite of innovative web-enabled telemetric instrument control, data acquisition, and application support tools with a portable tracking antenna system for UAV Remote Sensing. WARSTS will be initially implemented to support NASA GSFC's Airborne VNIR and SWIR Imaging Spectrometer (AVSIS) and/or other UAV hyperspectral/multispectral instruments. The C4 enabled WARSTS will not only support sophisticated operations required for deployment of these instruments but also speed up data processing and information delivery. These are valuable to NASA UAV remote sensing commercial applications including satellite calibration and new application development. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The commercial product combines a suite of innovative communication, command, control, and computer-network (C4) capabilities in an integrated system for operational manned and unmanned aerial vehicle, blimp, and balloon remote sensing. With real-time interactive remote sensing platform monitor and control, data downlink, and data processing, distribution, and visualization through the web-enabled information-processing pipeline, rapid and lower-cost delivery of remote-sensing/GIS solutions becomes feasible. The potential commercial market of WARSTS includes homeland security, forestry and park services, precision agriculture, crop growing status monitoring, disaster response and management, surface pollution detection, land-use surveys, and environmental monitoring, design, and management for urban planning.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This Phase I STTR project will demonstrate the Aerospace System Monitor (ASM).  This technology transforms the power distribution network in a spacecraft or aircraft into a multiple-use service, providing not only power distribution but also a diagnostic monitoring capability based on observations of the way in which loads draw power from the distribution service.  Careful measurements are made power transients and this data is used to assess system functioning and identify potential faults and failures.   In Phase I, ASM measurements will be made on spacecraft components like attitude thruster control valves and a power switching array.  An integrated circuit will be constructed with several components running on a single power supply to demonstrate analysis of several components simultaneously.  In Phase II, ASM measurements will be made on actual spacecraft.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The Aerospace System Monitor is a new, inexpensive, lightweight and non-space consuming method to measure system operation and system health.   It will be a new method to obtain this information on satellite systems and provide a new source and type of data.   It also represents another "string" of data for manned and high value unmanned systems which require multiple sources of sensor data.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This technology can monitor system health and identify potential problems and failures in ground venicles and in ships.  It also can improve monitor energy consuming equipment in buildings and improve energy efficiency, equipment usage and user comfort.

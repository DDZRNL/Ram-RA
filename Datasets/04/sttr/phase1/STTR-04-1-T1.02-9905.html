		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Space Micro and Clemson University have teamed for a miniature, ultra low power, space radiation dosimeter. We project this unit, "MicroRad", to be 50X smaller than the existing solution. Our ability to capitalize on COTS semiconductor devices and processes enable extremely accurate measurements at low cost. Space Micro Inc. adds their space rad hard computing to provide data logging and reporting of radiation levels. Our innovation is to utilize a normally negative response of modern microelectronics to space radiation to enable measurement of impinging particles. It is our understanding of the radiation effects physics, combined with space electronics computing and hardware which will make this R&D successful.<BR>In Phase we demonstrate technical feasibility with a lab breadboard dosimeter and device level radiation test results. We also evaluate advanced microelectronics packaging techniques (3-D stacking) to even further miniaturize in Phase II.<BR>At the end of Phase II we have developed and tested flight model dosimeter including ground-based radiation qualification. Use of space radiation dosimeters has been severely limited due to the size, power, cost of limited custom products; it is our mission to provide a commercially viable standard dosimeter for widespread application to new NASA long duration exploration and science missions.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Many NASA space programs will benefit from some level of on-board radiation doimetry. Our innovative dosimeter allows leveraging commercial IC processes and will enable increased performance at dramatically smaller size and lower costs. Applications range from space shuttle, space station, earth sensing missions e.g. (EOS), and deep space missions. NASA programs or missions which will benefit include Mars surveyor missions, solar system exploration e.g.(Titan, Europa, comet nucleus return, JIMO, New Discovery and Living with a Star (LWS). Products evolving from this SBIR will enable improved performance/weight on future programs such as Dawn, Aquarius, Kepler, Ocean Vector Winds, and space interferometry.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		A miniature, accurate space radiation dosimeter is a key component for any commercial system in a radiation environment. These applications include commercial space platforms, both LEO and GEO. Telecommunication satellites, such as Intelsat and earth sensing applications e.g. (NOAA) may use a dosimeter for both platform and payloads. Terrestial commercial applications include nuclear power plants (near core) and research accelerators e.g. (Fermi Labs). Military applications for rad hard lower cost miniature computing include strategic satellites (MILSATCOM and GPS upgrades), strategic missiles (Trident and AF upgrades), as well as many tactical weapon programs such as MDA THAAD and MKV with nuclear survival levels.

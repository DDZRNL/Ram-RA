		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The SSC needs a hydrogen temperature sensor that can provide high accuracy, fast response and can be operated on a superheated hydrogen (SHH2) environment. This will help prepare the SSC testing facility to support the new NASA mission for US space exploration as proposed by the President in January 2004.  Here, we propose to develop an innovative, non-intrusive temperature sensor based on Spontaneous Raman Scattering (SRS). SRS has been known for years as a relatively simple analytical method. The goal of the proposed effort is to demonstrate a SRS sensor, which is able to provide millisecond sampling time for temperature measurements in SSH2. During Phase I, a SRS system based on a 0.5 spectrometer and ICCD detector will be used to find the best hydrogen bands for the temperature measurement. The fast response PMTube - based SRS system will then be designed for selected spectral lines. Experimental parameters will be evaluated to achieve optimum response time and sensitivity for this application. The study from Phase I will provide the necessary information to design a phase II prototype unit to achieve millisecond response time and better sensitivity in a compact package. In Phase II, the prototype SRS system will be developed and tested at the SSC and will be delivered to NASA/SSC for their evaluation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		A Raman based sensor can provide an on-line, real-time temperature measurement with millisecond response time which is needed by NASA/SSC for testing superheated H2 as part of a system for deep space exploration. This sensor can also be used for real-time temperature profile measurements during hydrogen-based engine testing.  In addition, this sensor can be used as a hydrogen leak detector

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The uses of a Raman sensor to measure superheat H2 temperatures has several other applications. This sensor, or a modified version, can also be used for hydrogen fuel technology, the generation of liquefied gases, gasification plants, various chemical industrial processes, and biomedical research.  The sensor based on Raman spectroscopy developed for this proposal can be readily modified to measure the temperature in certain high temperature industrial furnaces. This hydrogen sensor can measure both low and high temperatures for gas or liquid phase. It can be used for combustion diagnostic and also as a hydrogen leak detector at facilities that produce and handle hydrogen.

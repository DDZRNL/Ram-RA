		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The pace and cost of developing an engine system for future explorations is strongly influenced by the inadequacies of design tools and the supporting databases. The inability to predict the internal operating environments of a combustion chamber during the design process necessitates design iterations during the development process.  NASA and the Department of Defense are working to increase the fidelity and accuracy of the tools used during the design process to define these internal operating environments. Key to the development of advanced analysis tools is appropriate validation data of adequate fidelity. The goal of this STTR is to develop a comprehensive hot-fire liquid-rocket engine test database that is appropriate for the validation of advanced two and three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models and the anchoring of lower-fidelity analytical design tools. The initial focus will be to generate high-quality data on wall heat flux, axial energy release and exit-plane species concentration distribution.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		These data are needed by NASA, their engine contractors and model developers to evaluate, validate and improve analysis tools, especially computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models.  The data generated by this STTR is at relevant rocket engine operating conditions.  The injector and chamber concepts offer simple geometry and clean boundary conditions.  The parametric film cooling and injector performance data generated as part of the Phase II effort will be invaluable during the development of booster, upper stage and in-space engines. NASA has initiatives to improve CFD tool prediction reliability and robustness.  These data will directly support improvements in Simulation Readiness Level.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Film cooling is an essential component in all engine designs, even those that employ regenerative cooling jackets, as it enables management of the gas-side thermal environment.  The USAF Upper Stage Engine Technology (USET) program is focused on tool development and validation.  This data will have a direct impact on the USET program.  The DoD plume phenomenology community is intensely interested in film cooling effectiveness, exit plane measurements and their relationship to engine operating characteristics.  The high fidelity data collected in this program is useful for the validation of CFD codes that include chemical reaction.

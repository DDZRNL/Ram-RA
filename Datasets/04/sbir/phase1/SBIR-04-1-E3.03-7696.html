		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The availability of remotely sensed data has been improving with each new high-resolution satellite obtaining operational capability in orbit. However, the ability of commercial and government entities to efficiently share or sell this  data has not kept pace. The proposed GeoSpatial data distribution system will exploit recent improvements in advanced computing environments and processing algorithms  to provide on demand products with a "no minimum purchase" requirement. <BR><BR>The inability of data providers to efficiently create and disseminate small foot prints or even on-demand data products has been a limiting factor in expanding the use of remotely sensed data.  Creating a system that can efficiently distribute data or products in small foot prints will greatly improve the economic viability of the entire industry. <BR><BR>Providing a customer initiated order system will make ordering up remotely sensed data as easy as creating a Web-based profile and interactively selecting and downloading the raw-data of choice or choosing and executing the real-time development of a data product. Pay by the square kilometer with no minimums. Use of the advanced functions provide unprecedented functionality to create a new, customer defined data product.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The prototype application will allow NASA to distribute data internally and to the public utilizing a fully automated distribution system. Providing data in requested geographic extent, projection, datum, or as a processed data product will create an entirely new set of data users. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The ability or inability to utilize remotely sensed data most often rests with the affordability of the data. The operational costs associated with sub-setting and delivering data are extensive, resulting in the extensive geographic extents required to make a commercial profit. The ability to automatically disseminate data in a user defined geographic extent will greatly increase the potential sales of all data vendors. This methodology can be applied to photography as well as satellite data. Building this hands-off data ordering and dissemination system will revolutionize the methods by which raster data is currently managed and sold.<BR><BR>

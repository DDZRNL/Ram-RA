		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This proposal is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of a Decentralized Control based SiC Parallel DC-DC Converter Unit (DDCU) with targeted application for NASA's International Space Station Program and Satellite Power Systems. The proposed DDCU has three key features: a) "true" redundancy for parallel DC-DC converter based on a novel concept developed at the University of Illinois at Chicago, b) a novel nonlinear hybrid controller that achieves enhanced robustness and wider stability margin and yet achieves interleaving to reduce output current ripple, and c) SiC based power stage yielding higher breakdown voltage, temperature-sustenance, and radiation-hardness capabilities for the DDCU leading also to higher power density as compared with Si based power stage.<BR><BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		MMIC technology provides the technology base to reduce the size and weight of microwave and millimeter wave (MMW) equipment on board airborne and space-based platforms.  Signal sources at MMW frequencies, however, have not been available in MMIC form widely.  Hittite has developed a family of MMIC products to implement complete phase-locked synthesizers in using MMIC and mixed-signal ICs and demonstrated miniaturized frequency synthesizers representing size reduction of several orders of magnitude without sacrificing performance.  Based on recent success in demonstration of critical MMICs and ICs, Hittite proposes to apply its novel MMIC concept to design MMW signal sources for application in earth monitoring sensors.  Two different synthesizer architecture, one direct and one indirect, are proposed as candidate approaches.  In both cases, frequency synthesis will take place at about 1/8 of the output frequency and then translated up to the final output with a fixed tone. The proposed approach relies on components operating at lower frequencies for better phase noise performance, and the method is applicable to generation of higher frequencies. The proposed program will lead to a family of novel miniaturized MMIC products for commercial communications.

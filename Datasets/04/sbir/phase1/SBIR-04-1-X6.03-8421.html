		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Visidyne proposes to investigate an active optical 3D imaging LADAR as the sensor for an automated Landing Hazard Avoidance system for spacecraft landing on the Moon or Mars.  Specifically, the LADAR utilizes low cost and electrically efficient laser diode illumination and a unique focal plane array detector concept that may be implemented in CCD or CMOS technology to provide high resolution, wide-field images of terrain relief at high frame rates.  High slopes, boulders or other obstructions at the landing site present a significant risk to the safe arrival of robotic supply craft or crewed vehicles.  This sensor will provide range images for extraction of topographical information required for the landing guidance system to manage vehicle descent to avoid dangerous locations within the landing zone.  Approach rate to the surface (range rate) will also be supplied to the landing guidance system.  Phase I will demonstrate the capabilities of the system through modeling and analysis and result in a design for a prototype sensor that may be realized under a Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Rapid and precise 3-Dimensional imaging has far reaching applications within NASA.  In addition to the proposed Landing Hazard Avoidance sensor, potential NASA uses include: automated rendezvous and docking such as International Space Station re-supply or Mars Sample Return missions; Hubble Space Telescope repair mission; and other future planetary rendezvous scenarios. It will also enhance the safety of other proximity operations in space by providing high-speed inputs for collision avoidance and close approach inspection maneuvers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The DoD has interests much in common to those of NASA, but also include homing sensors for smart munitions and interceptors, terrain following (Air Force) and recognition of camouflaged or otherwise concealed targets (DARPA).<BR>Obstacle avoidance systems (primarily to detect wires in the flight path) for helicopters and light aircraft are a potentially large commercial market. At short range and appropriately small range accuracy the techniques could provide enhanced machine vision for assembly and inspection.  <BR>

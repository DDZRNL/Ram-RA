		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S)is the leading chemical agent causing human fatalities following inhalation exposures.  The overall aim of this project is to develop and produce an inexpensive, highly selective and sensitive solid-state chemical micro-sensor with low power consumption that is suitable for rapid detection of very low-level (ppb) concentration of H2S in ambient air.<BR>The technology principle used to develop the micro-sensor is based on the knowledge that H2S is adsorbed into gold at an operating temperature range.  By using a gold thin-film, and MEMS technology, we will produce a micro-sensor with the following specifications 1 mm x 1 mm micro-sensor, 3 seconds response and recovery time, 10 mW power consumption, and detection in the ppb range.<BR>Phase I will investigate the feasibility of the design, fabrication, testing, and validation of the micro-sensor in collaboration with researchers from the Integrated Nanosystems Research Facility at the University of California Irvine.<BR>During Phase II, the innovative solid-state micro-sensor will be integrated in a miniaturized battery powered wireless instrument for applications in biomass fouling detection.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The H2S micro-sensor can be integrated with other chemical micro-sensors to form an intelligent multi-gas sensors.<BR>The design of a micro-miniature H2S monitor, that is wireless, and with very low power consumption, can be used in the following application areas:<BR>Environmental monitoring and control for human life support.<BR>Environmental control of spacecraft cabin atmosphere.<BR>Monitoring of biomass production for planetary missions.<BR>Biomass fouling detection

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		H2S is generated by bacteria in the mouth, and it is the cause of bad breath. An inexpensive, highly sensitive H2S detector, can help people with their oral hygiene, since they cannot smell their own bad breath.<BR>A low cost H2S monitor for environmental and industrial applications.<BR>A miniature H2S detector can be used as an H2S cartridge filter end of life indicator for respirators.<BR>Atmospheric H2S monitoring with weather balloons.

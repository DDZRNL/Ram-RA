		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		NASA is committed to measuring clouds on a global scale and will soon launch CloudSat, which will carry the first space borne cloud-profiling radar (CPR). Operating at 94 GHz, the CPR will conduct a 2 year global survey of cloud properties, collecting quantitative information on cloud-layer thickness, base and top altitudes, cloud optical thickness, and cloud water and ice contents. A follow-on mission is envisioned that will fly a low-mass cross-track scanning antenna. This will provide future missions with much improved spatial coverage for comparison with numeric models and reduced time between subsequent measurements over the same region.<BR> <BR>This proposed Phase I effort will investigate the required innovations to design and build a novel airborne prototype W-band (94 GHz) cross-track scanning antenna and wideband radar system. The proposed antenna will utilize a low-mass offset reflector and a frequency-scanned line-feed to achieve for the first time at W-band a cross track scan width of approximately 60 degrees. This design will lead to a prototype scanning radar system that can be flown on high-altitude platforms such as the NASA ER-2, WB-57 and Proteus. The prototype antenna will be compatible with existing space-qualified transmitters and can be scaled for space flight.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed electronically scanning W-band antenna and airborne scanning cloud radar will support various NASA research efforts by facilitating three-dimensional cloud radar coverage over a much larger domain than can be measured with existing nadir-pointing cloud radars. These data can be combined with those colleted simultaneously by scanning radiometric instruments to facilitate cloud microphysical retrievals over a large domain. Once proven these measurements can ultimately be collected on a global scale by flying the scanning radar on the next generation cloud sensing satellite.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed antenna system can be adapted for a variety of uses. Coupled with a high power transmitter and sensitive receiver it is an ideal tool for quantifying cloud properties. Such high performance radar has obvious applications for high-resolution tracking and target detection. The lightweight-scanning antenna feed may also be used in conjunction with inexpensive low power transmitters for high-resolution object detection over short distances such as in vehicle collision avoidance systems.  RSS plans to aggressively pursue these opportunities

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This proposed work will develop a new method and mechanism for generating wing stroke motion of any shape and orientation.  The mechanism will provide power, lift and flight control to small aircraft in a single integrated unit.  The key innovation is the means by which wing motion is generated without the use any complex mechanical components.  Wing motion of any shape and orientation can be generated with this mechanism.  The arrangement of wings is such that the mechanism is mechanically balanced and exerts no net torque or force on the aircraft.  This method is applicable to small UAVs (uninhabited aerial vehicles) and will provide them with a simple and reliable means of producing power, lift and flight control.  The versatility of this mechanism is expected to provide UAVs with high maneuverability.  This method will be most valuable for UAVs that are used as planetary aircraft as well as for general surveillance and reconnaissance.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This simple mechanism and electronics will result in long-term reliability, low manufacturing cost and a scalable design.  Its mechanically balanced operation will provide a UAV platform which is capable of producing very stable and steady flight.  This feature will be valuable for all applications including aerial imaging.  Small-scale UAV designs will lead to a product that has low mass, volume, and power consumption.  All of these features are of great value for use as planetary aircraft.  This mechanism will also be a valuable research tool for flight testing UAV wings and studying the aerodynamics of insect flight.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Terrestrial markets for small UAV may become extensive.  Military markets include surveillance, reconnaissance, positioning and targeting applications.  Surveillance and reconnaissance applications extend to non-military markets including law enforcement.  Private markets include a wide range of possibilities such as aerial access, inspection, and imaging of locations that are inaccessible to personnel within power plants, chemical plants, manufacturing facilities and other complex structures.  The benefits that are provided by a small, maneuverable UAV could be of great value to a variety of manufacturing industries which use large and complex facilities.

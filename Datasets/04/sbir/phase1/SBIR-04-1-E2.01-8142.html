		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		NASA requires innovative guidance, navigation and control (GN&C) technology that addresses the high performance, reliability, power and volume requirements of future Earth Science (ES) missions. Specifically, ES architectures will include platforms of varying size and complexity in a number of mission trajectories and orbits. Novel approaches for autonomous control of large fleets of spacecraft, rockets, balloons and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are desired. Special interest is apportioned to augmenting and providing alternatives to GN&C, relative range and attitude determination during close formation, and proximity operations using video image processing technology. Broadata Communications, Inc. (BCI) proposes a novel vision-based attitude determination and relative range GN&C system called Guiding Stars, Sun and Light (GSSL). It is based on an innovative, real-time, video image, point distance set based, recognition technology that works well with the problem at hand.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed technology is designed for spacecraft attitude determination, relative ranging and on-board GPS validation. Due to its interoperable design it has a wide commercialization potential. Other direct NASA applications include instrument pointing and and stabilization, the Microsat attitude determination problem, spin and three-axis stabilization in Microsats, miniature spacecrafts, orbit determination, formation flying, pointing control and GN&C for stratospheric balloons, autonomous navigation of UAVs, and groups of UAVs. The video and imaging based recognition technology presented can further be used off-line in a non-real-time fashion. As such, it can perform post-processing of available imaging and image/video querying based on content. The location of the camera of the image and/or image content can be automatically determined and queried. Queries using specific Guides can be performed allowing for scientific, learning, and entertainment applications that promote NASA missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Non-NASA commercial applications include both the technology's real-time and non-real-time capabilities. The former includes, GN&C automated systems toys, robotics and advertising, security, mapping, or photography blimps. The latter includes, content based image search and warehousing, high volume automated location or timing recognition in photography used by real estate agencies, filming scouting, state attractions (e.g., find pictures and photos that contained the Twin Towers on the Internet), police investigations based on video/image/camera location, etc.

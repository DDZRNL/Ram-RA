		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		AI Signal Research, Inc. proposes to develop a Non-Intrusive Vibration Measurement System (NI-VMS) for turbopumps which will provide effective on-board/off-board fault detection diagnostic capabilities without relying on any intrusive installation of once per revolution (1/Rev) tachometer key phasor measurement.  Many vibration signature analysis techniques use a key phasor signal to identify and detect critical vibration characteristics and fault signatures.  However, in many operational environments (e.g., SSME HPOTP), the tachometer measurement is not available usually due to its intrusive installation requirement or safety consideration.  For this situation, many powerful diagnostic analyses cannot be performed.  With our system, we over come this problem by utilizing a novel signal analysis technique called Pseudo Key Phasor (PKP) to reconstruct an equivalent 1/Rev PKP signal directly from a non-intrusive vibration measurement.  The resulting PKP signal enables the use of effective signature analysis to enhance diagnostic capabilities.  The applicable innovation is attributed to to effectively achieve non-intrusive health monitoring and diagnosis without intrusive tachometer installation.  This technology will enhance incipient fault detection capability, reducing catastrophic engine failure risks and improve reliability of NASA's advanced propulsion systems.  Phase I objectives are to demonstrate the feasibility and relative benefits of NI-VMS non-intrusive monitoring capabilities.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		A low-cost non-intrusive engine vibration monitoring system has excellent application potential for NASA commercial applications.  NASA and other Federal Agency transport aircraft are usually not instrumented with a 1/rev tachometer.  Implementing an effective non-intrusive health monitoring system in the Government aircraft will be beneficial by reducing the risks of catastrophic hardware losses and down time.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		A low-cost non-intrusive engine vibration monitoring system has strong Non-NASA commercial application.  The commercial transportation and power generation industries will benefit from its availability as will the manufacturing sector where production lines frequently rely on critical, active machinery.  In particular, many commercial aircraft engines are not instrumented with a 1/rev tachometer.  Implementing an effective non-intrusive health monitoring system in these commercial transport aircraft fleets will reduce the risks of catastrophic hardware losses and down time.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Work done at Water Resources Center, University of Minnesota has demonstrated the feasibility of performing regional assessment of lake water quality using Landsat imagery.   Microtel LLC is proposing to tune algorithms available from this research to process imagery collected by NASA Advanced Land Imager (ALI) to generate water quality mappings (secchi depth transparency and chlorophyll a) of the Chesapeake Bay.  Extensive ground truth measurements collected routinely and specifically during satellite overflights by Maryland DNR will be utilized to verify results.  This proposal is innovative because it will determine the suitability of NASA earth science data for managers concerned with stewardship of the earth's inland water resources.  This proposal is significant because it will develop innovative technology that allow the routine use of NASA Earth science results in automated water quality decision support tools.  This proposal addresses solicitation subtopic E4.01 "Innovative Tools and Techniques Supporting the Practical Uses of Earth Science Observations".  Accurate and timely water quality maps of the Chesapeake Bay will provide a valuable source of information for water management and policy decision makers.<BR><BR> <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Use of satellite imagery to routinely perform Chesapeake Bay water quality monitoring:<BR>? demonstrate the application of satellite imagery to assess critical problems (ie, water quality)<BR>? might provide practical insight into user needs in future NASA remote sensing satellites<BR>? could broaden the customer base for ALI imagery<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Generation of spatially intensive Chesapeake Bay water quality maps has the following applications :<BR>? assist in water quality monitoring required by the 2000 Chesapeake Bay Agreement<BR>? alert water resource managers to areas of concern<BR>? identify point and non-point pollution sources<BR>? measure the success of filtering by oysters at oyster restoration sites<BR>? provide valuable information on Submerged Aquatic Vegation (SAV) habitat and greatly bolster efforts in large scale SAV restoration<BR>? could be tuned for other water environments.<BR>

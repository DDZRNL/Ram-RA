		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		      Cornerstone Research Group, Inc. (CRG), has developed sandwich core composite material (SynLam(TM)) and related fabrication technology to address the drawbacks of conventional materials and fabrication processes for space-based mirrors.  The resulting technologies will directly address NASA's requirement for advanced, low-cost, high quality large optics fabrication processes for building imaging systems that support the Space Science Enterprise's Structure and Evolution of the Universe Theme.  Extending recent CRG advancements in syntactic composites by tailoring the material system to cryogenic applications, the new material will achieve a balance of mass, structural, thermal, and optical properties that dramatically advances the state-of-the-art for space-based mirrors.  The new material will also enable mirror fabrication techniques that are significantly faster and cheaper than current practice.  Currently available syntactic materials show the potential of this class of composite for application in lightweight mirrors.  Integrated development of the new material and new process technology will yield synergy in advancing the state-of-the-art in both areas.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		      Supporting NASA's Space Science Enterprise, this project's technologies directly address requirements for large-aperture lightweight cryogenic optics materials and manufacturing technology for Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization (CMB-Pol), Single Aperture Far-IR (SAFIR) and Sub-millimeter Probe of the Evolution of Cosmic Structure (SPECS) optics systems.  This project's technologies offer dramatically reduced areal density, thermal stability at low temperatures, tougher and stronger mirror substrate material, and reduced mirror fabrication cost and time.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		      This project's technologies developed for NASA systems would directly apply to systems operated by other government and commercial enterprises.<BR>Government systems that would derive the same benefits would include but not be limited to Space-based imaging systems operated by the Department of Defense.<BR>This technology's attributes for imaging mirrors should yield a high potential for private sector commercialization for high-end research observatories and consumer-level telescopes or Space-based imaging systems. Ball Aerospace and Technologies has documented their interest in this commercialization opportunity (see letter of support on page 21).<BR>

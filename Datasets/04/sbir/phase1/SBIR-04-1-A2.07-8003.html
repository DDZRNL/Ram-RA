		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		In this SBIR project, a new Morphing Flight Control Surface (MFCS) will be developed.  The distinction of the research effort is that the SenAnTech team will employ our innovative High Deformable Mechanism (HDM) to develop MFCS.  The utilization of energy is the important concern to accomplish this research goal. Energy is chosen because it provides a mechanism where all concepts can be represented and judged in a consistent fashion.  Ultimately, this research will provide a novel methodology for predicting the type, placement, and operation of actuators and sensors for aerial vehicles that incorporate large-scale shape changing for the improved flight performances.  The MFCS will consist of hardware, software and processing units.  The actuators, sensors, wiring, signal conditioning and, associated electronics will be selected as required.  Modern systems technology like controllability and observability of the system will be examined for the optimal actuator and sensor placements. Also, shaped or digitized electrode technology will be applied to measure the spatial energy distribution of the deformable wing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The new proposed Morphing Flight Control Surface (MFCS) can be used in future morphing control surfaces for NASA's experimental flight vehicles (manned or unmanned).  This innovative system will assist to achieve the precision control, robust stability and future multi-mission capabilities including the ability to loiter (reconnaissance) and then dash (move quickly to another point).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The direct result of this research will be a valuable asset to defense industry in the support of future multi-mission flight vehicles.  Since mission adaptive air vehicles are presently being pursued by every major defense contractor, including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Boeing, the research proposed in this document will have lasting benefits to the aerospace industries as well.

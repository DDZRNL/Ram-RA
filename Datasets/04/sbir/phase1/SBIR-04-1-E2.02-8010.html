		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		NASA requires protocols and architectures that will allow reduced levels of mission funding, shorter mission development schedules, and facilitate high availability of flight electronic components. The administration is strategically moving towards Internet based architectures and technologies. Internet protocols, however, are not designed for space communications and must be seamlessly adapted to support the characteristics of this environment.  We are proposing the development of a Universal Space IP Transparent Proxy that leverages an innovative modular architecture to achieve accurate network monitoring and measurement as a means to effectively deal with design and performance problems of IP protocols in space environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The USIT system, once deployed, will allow NASA to plan missions with reduced levels of funding through the use of technology developed for common widespread Internet. It is not only applicable to Command and Data Handling for ES missions, but generically supports IP use in NASA missions. Besides near-earth, space, and deep space communications, it is directly applicable to general purpose satellite communications, specifically networks that are characterized by "Long Fat Pipes" (LFNs) or narrow bandwidth, long propagation, RF telecommunications systems. It can be used to direct the use or Error Control and Compression in an on/off board system.  Due to its support for reproducible experimentation it has direct commercialization potential as a sophisticated emulation platform for NASA research and development.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Many non-NASA applications and markets exist that have similar characteristics and requirements for USIT. Potential applications include wireless Internet access networks, especially satellite, Internet Service Provider performance management of backup links (that usually employ wireless technology), Mobile Enterprise Networking (for example, construction and real-estate industry), packet cellular networks, etc. The modularity of the USIT design allows the product to enhance performance in different types of access networks including 802.11, fiber optics, Ethernet, Bluetooth Scatternets, etc. The USIT system can also be used as a tool for research and development in universities and companies.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This Small Business Innovation Research proposal offers to develop the most accurate, comprehensive and efficient finite element models to date for simulation of the material deposition processes; especially the electron beam freeform fabrication process.  Phase I will deal with the basic thermal and mechanical (stress and distortion) models.  A new scheme to model material deposition will be attempted; its feasibility will be tested on multi-pass deposits.  A commercial finite element analysis code, ABAQUS, will be used to which a new capability for prediction of morphology will be added.  During Phase II, several other key modeling issues such as the prediction of grain size, study of the effect of convection in the melt pool, parametric study, experimental validation, simulation of a demonstration part, and on-line process control will be addressed.  These models will be applicable to ground-based as well as space-based systems.  They will assist in understanding the effects of the various process parameters (e.g., power, feed rate, traverse speed and gravity) on variables defining the product quality; e.g., interlayer fusion, morphology, grain size, stresses and distortion.  The models will also be applicable to laser, TIG and other metal deposition processes.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The availability of the proposed modeling technology will play a crucial role in the success of several NASA programs.  NASA has identified many applications of the electron beam deposition process ranging from near to far term; e.g., on-orbit construction of space structures on the order of tens of meters to a kilometer in size, development of a small multifunctional system to manufacture space parts during long-duration human exploration missions, and the development of a miniaturized automated system for structural health monitoring and repair.  It can be used with titanium, nickel, aluminum, steels and other materials of interest to NASA.   
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		In addition to the EBF3 process, the proposed technology will play a crucial role in the development of laser metal deposition processes.  These two emerging processes are being actively developed for many non-NASA applications primarily for the manufacture of near net shape aircraft engine and frame parts made of advanced materials; as well as for the repair, refurbishment and modification of parts.  These processes are also of considerable interest to the automotive industry.  The proposed modeling technology is applicable to TIG, and autogenous as well as nonautogenous welding processes also.

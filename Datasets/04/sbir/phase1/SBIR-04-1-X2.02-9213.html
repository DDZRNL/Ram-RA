		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This SBIR Phase 1 project shall investigate concept radiator fins that incorporate novel carbon materials for improved performance of segmented high temperature space radiator systems based on heat pipes with attached radiator fins. The novel carbon materials apply to improvements in several critical features: thermal emissivity, in-plane conductivity, fin stiffness, fin/pipe thermal interface, and lightweight shielding against micrometeorites.  <BR>Phase 1 will obtain system requirements from a prime contractor for nuclear space power, and assess the potential benefits compared with current baseline materials. A small carbon radiator fin component will be fabricated and integrated with a relevant pipe to demonstrate the materials concepts.  <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Lightweight carbon radiator fins have primary application to future high temperature space nuclear power systems. Lightweight shielding for human and robotic mission is a potential spin-off of this development. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Lightweight carbon radiator fins can also save weight and increase performance of spacecraft operating at lower temperatures. High conductance vacuum interfacing (for vacuum materials processing) is a potential commercial spin-off of this development.

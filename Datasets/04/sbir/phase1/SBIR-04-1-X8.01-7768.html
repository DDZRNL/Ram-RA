		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The I-Logix team proposes development of the Service Oriented Spacecraft Modeling Environment (SOSME) to allow faster and more effective spacecraft system design using a model based design process.  The SOSME consists of several innovations:<BR>1.	Service-Oriented Architecture for Spacecraft System Modeling (SOASSM).    <BR>2.	General-Purpose Spacecraft Reference Model (GPSRM) implementing the SOASSM.<BR>3.	Requirements-Driven Model Customization Application (RDMCA) to aid in customizing the GPSRM to reflect a specific spacecraft system design.  <BR>4.	Mission Scenario Generation Application (MSGA) to aid in capturing mission scenarios and execute models developed using the SOASSM against the mission scenarios.  <BR><BR>The significance of these innovations is that they will:<BR>1.	Enable and facilitate a model based system design process for spacecraft systems.<BR>2.	Enable rapid development of spacecraft system models in support of Trade Studies.<BR>3.	Enable more effective and accurate trade studies by executing models against mission scenarios while capturing quantitative measures of performance.<BR>4.	Provide graphical and executable artifacts for use in project and peer reviews.<BR>5.	Enable system level validation against mission scenarios throughout the design process.<BR>6.	Facilitate the integration of detailed design models by providing standard interfaces for spacecraft services.<BR>7.	Facilitate Simulation Based Acquisition.<BR>8.	Enable Model Based Contracting.

		One of today's biggest challenges in designing a spacecraft is ensuring the design spacecraft will meet the requirements of a mission with maximum effectiveness while reducing the "time-to-space" and minimizing cost.  The situation is compounded by the fact that mission requirements continue to grow in scope and complexity, and are subject to frequent change.  Meeting this challenge is difficult with current spacecraft design and manufacturing processes.  The innovations in this proposal address these challenge in:<BR>Designing a System.<BR>Selecting among Competing Systems Designs.<BR>System Assembly Integration and Test.<BR>Training System Operators.<BR>Launching a System.<BR>Operating a System.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed  innovations are most valuable in the design of systems where many groups are involved in the deployment of the system, and where constraints and safety concerns do not allow for flawed systems to be developed and then repaired after they are in service.  These innovations are especially useful where the system has some level of autonomy.  The specifics of the innovations proposed here can be extended and customized to apply to the following:<BR>Unmanned Combat Systems.<BR>Warfighter Systems.<BR>Intelligent Automotive Systems.<BR>Intelligent Home Automation Systems.<BR>Home Patient Monitoring Systems.<BR>Disaster Management Systems.<BR>Telecommunications Systems.<BR>Ocean Exploration Systems.

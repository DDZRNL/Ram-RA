		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Lithium (Li) ion batteries are among the most promising power sources for many civilian, military and space applications due to their high power and high energy densities.  However, current state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries are not suited for operation in deep-space environments including high radiation and an extremely wide operation temperature regime (-100&#730;C to 400&#730;C), due to utilization of thermally and electrochemically unstable organic electrolytes.<BR>TPL proposes to develop an all-ceramic, high performance Li-ion battery for deep-space power systems via a novel cell configuration, micro-fiber cells (MFCs), that ensures successful utilization of ceramic materials for all battery components.  The superior properties of the proposed MFC-based Li-ion batteries will be achieved via formation and processing of functional graphite fibers that facilitate interfacial contacts and practical utilization of ceramic electrolytes.<BR>In Phase I, TPL will fabricate the proposed MFCs via a solution approach and process the MFCs into rechargeable batteries having a wide operation temperature window, excellent radiation resistance, and a high specific energy.  The functional fibers will be structurally characterized and MFC-based batteries will be electrochemically evaluated in the temperature regime.  The concept of MFCs will be demonstrated.  TPL has extensive experience in Li-ion battery chemistries and technologies.  TPL's technical and management teams are well positioned to move this technology into the market.<BR>

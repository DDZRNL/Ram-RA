		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		MMCC is proposing herewith a hybrid structured mirror that combines the advantages of SiC membrane and magnesium graphite composite.  The significance of magnesium graphite composite is that it can be produced with quasi-isotropic properties and closely matched CTE down to cryogenic temperatures.  In the proposed hybrid mirror, SiC membranes are used as the front and back faces of the mirror and an egg crate structure made of magnesium graphite composite is sandwiched between the SiC membranes.  The proposed hybrid mirror structure is expected to have high specific stiffness, good thermal stability, be light weight, and producable at moderate cost.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Steven Winter Associates, Inc. (SWA) proposes to develop a nation-wide informal technology education program that integrates math, science, engineering and technology (STEM) through its Think Tek Learning Lab.  The goal of the Lab is three-pronged: providing an after-school enrichment program for teens; arousing interest in math and science; and achieving outreach for NASA commercial technologies.  The Lab will serve middle/high school students through after-school and Saturday classes, summer institutes, and school visits.  The focus of this informal technology learning laboratory includes hands-on experimentation and exploration, design and construction, and interaction with a variety of technologies, scientists, and learning materials.  The Lab will be a living NASA outreach spin-off with experiments that showcase real-life NASA commercial technologies.   The project will support NASA's efforts to publicize the positive ripple effects that the space funding generates on the domestic front.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed Think Tek Learning Lab will significantly reinforce NASA's efforts on STEM education.  In addition, the Lab will serve as a living NASA outreach spin-off that highlights the importance of space funding on day-to-day commercial and consumer technologies.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		While informal education is a multi-billion dollar industry in the U.S., there are several successful nation-wide companies in the field of education.  Examples include KAPLAN, Huntington Learning Center, Sylvan Learning Center and Kumon.  There is no nation-wide education company with a focus on hands-on STEM education.  That presented SWA with an opportunity to develop Think Tek .  SWA will develop a pilot program in Asheville, NC, modularize it and market it throughout the country.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		NASA's Advanced Extravehicular Activity (EVA) program requires the need for materials that can protect astronauts and spacecrafts from ionizing radiations such as low and high energy X-rays.  Currently, lead and lead-based material are used to fabricate shields not only for X-rays but for other types of radiation as well. Lead is heavy and toxic. In this Phase I project, MMI proposes to develop a polymer composite that utilizes a nanocrystalline heavy metal salt for radiation shielding.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The composite developed will be suitable for incorporation in protective clothing and gear for astronauts during NASA's missions such as the Advanced Extravehicular Activity (EVA) program, as well as radiation shields for large space structures such as space stations, orbiters, landers, rovers and habitats and enclosures that house X-ray detectors and sensors.  
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The polymer composite can be used to fabricate medical gowns that can be worn instead of the heavy lead shields that are used during routine medical X-ray examination.  The material can also be used to fabricate lab coats and other protective gear for personnel working with radioactive materials.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I proposal seeks to develop a low cost, robust, highly precise and accurate CO2 monitoring system. This system will employ a novel mid-infrared laser source, which will be demonstrated during Phase I and integrated into a bench-scale laboratory instrument to perform CO2 concentration measurements.  The results of these tests will demonstrate the precision and accuracy of the approach, and will be used to determine specifications for the Phase II instrument.  The Phase I research will identify COTS sources for the system subcomponents of the Phase II prototype, which can potentially modified for the detection of other target species such as CO2 isotopes, methane, and CO.  Commercial systems based on the Phase II prototype will be refined and marketed during Phase III.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		NASA's Fundamental Biology Program seeks to improve our understanding of gravitational effects on plants and animals.  The success of this proposal will directly impact this effort by providing compact fieldable CO2 analyzers with the requisite precision and accuracy to aid this effort.  Additionally, NASA's Earth Science Enterprise has taken a lead role in understanding Earth's atmospheric dynamics.  In particular, to better understand climate change and global warming, a more detailed knowledge of carbon exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere is required.   The success of this effort will directly impact this area as well.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The worldwide market for low cost, high precision CO2 monitors is quite large due to the need to monitor greenhouse gas emissions and enforce world-wide emissions standards.  Other commercial arenas for the technology include trace gas monitoring, pollution monitoring, and industrial process monitoring.

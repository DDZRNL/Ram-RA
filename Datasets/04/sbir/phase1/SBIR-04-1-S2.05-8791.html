		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		LW Microsystems proposes to develop a compact, low-cost image stabilization system suitable for use with a wide range of focal-plane imaging systems in remote sensing and other space-based applications.  The system would be used in conjunction with integrated rotation sensors/gyroscopes to deflect light to counteract the effects of vibrations.   This approach has the advantage over both image processing software and conventional gimbal-based approaches in being able to stabilize the image to higher frequencies without compromising on image size, resolution or speed.   The mass-produced low-cost devices at the core of the system along with the post-assembly electronic tuning of the stabilization module also enable significant cost advantages over other stabilization approaches.  <BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Image stabilization for IR, visible, and UV satellite or aircraft based imaging systems used in remote sensing/earth imaging, non-ground based telescopes where the image panning functions would be especially useful and structure/vehicle/equipment monitoring in extreme vibration environments.

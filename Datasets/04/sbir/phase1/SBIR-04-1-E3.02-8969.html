		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		SplashNote Systems is proposing to develop a more effective and innovative approach to project collaboration in distributed teams.  The proposed system uniquely gives a non-technical user the ability to configure and structure ? within minutes ? the information context for team action as well as the functionality of the interaction.  A key innovation is an intuitive Design Builder, which allows users to assemble a project page via drag-and-drop commands.  Another key innovation is a transformation grammar, which converts semantic-based instructions into machine codes.  <BR><BR>The resulting technology is especially well suited to the operational requirements of NASA.  A web-based architecture allows distributed teams to collaborate from anywhere with Internet access.  The project portal design enables everyone on the team to share the same contextual information, and to take action based on the latest information.  Importantly, the ease with which the project interface can be defined allows each project to be quickly customized to the specific interactive demands of that project.  <BR><BR>Phase I will focus on developing the design of the system, showing its feasibility, and researching the system's usability for NASA.  Phase II will perform the engineering development of the system, and will result in a field-installable prototype ready for trials at NASA.  <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This project collaboration portal system is especially well suited to the conditions of project team operations at NASA, where teams are often widespread and projects are typically information intensive.  Examples of potential applications can be found from the most esoteric scientific projects (e.g., collaboratory) to interplanetary mission planning to the most mundane daily administrative tasks (e.g., inventory collection, budget analysis).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This system is especially valuable for dispersed groups that need to act within an information context.  Examples can be found in many team-based, information-intensive industries, such as consulting, legal, accounting, and finance.  Other examples include enterprises that require tight coordination with suppliers or customers (e.g., automobile, aircraft).  Applications can also be found in government entities, such as branches of Defense, which often need to gather or share time-critical information and data in a structured format across several agencies.  This system would be invaluable in such situations as coordination of supplies and logistics, resource allocation, and mission planning.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		In response to the NASA need for a free-standing immersive virtual scene display system interfaced with an exercise treadmill to mimic terrestrial exercise experience in space, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Earth Virtual-environment Immersive Scene (EVIS) display system based on omnidirectional image projection and a wraparound multiplexed holographic collimating projection screen.  A single unique, high-resolution omnidirectional wraparound image projector projects continuous wraparound imagery onto thin, curved, three-color-(RGB)-multiplexed holographic optics, which collimate the projected light into a virtual image.  EVIS will thus display a greater than 180 degree (up to full 360 degree) free-standing FOV of flowing virtual earth scene to a crew member on a treadmill.  Without multiple projectors, bulky optics, or a tiled screen, EVIS will be compact, lightweight, and power-efficient.  It is producible at low cost by integrating commercially available microdisplays for the omnidirectional projector and by mass producing the multiplexed holographic collimating screen by means of established POC technologies.  In Phase I POC will design in detail an EVIS display system for a treadmill, and fabricate a proof-of-concept model to demonstrate feasibility.  Phase II will focus on optimizing both the material technology and components so that a fully operational prototype is completed.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed EVIS display system will benefit the psychological and physiological well-being of NASA space crews on ultralong-duration missions to the Moon or Mars.  It can also benefit real-time telepresence, remote space exploration, and EVA applications, space flight training, flight navigation, and spacecraft and space station design.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The EVIS display system with a personal exercise machine will create a more inviting and pleasant environment (e.g., jogging in New York's Central Park or along a California beach) than the home or gym.  It can also be used for simulation and training for government and civilian personnel programs such as commercial airplane flight simulation.  Additional applications include remote-controlled robot telepresence for bomb and mine disposal, inspection and surveillance, and scientific and medical imaging.

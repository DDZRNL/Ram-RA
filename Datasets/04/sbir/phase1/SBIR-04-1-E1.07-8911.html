		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This NASA SBIR project will develop modular spray-cooled assemblies that satisfy NASA power and mass budgets and can be scaled to cool multiple heat sources subjected to high heat fluxes and microgravity conditions.  Much of the work on spray cooling has been experimental in nature and technological improvements have been the result of extensive experimental work.  There is a need for a better theoretical understanding.  Power Electronics Leveling Solutions L.L.C. (PELS) analytical team has formulated mathematically the conditions for extracting high heat fluxes from a heated surface in addition to the latent heat of vaporization that takes place in the formation of the bubble under phase change.  PELS has now the opportunity of combining its analytical and experimental capabilities to develop modular assemblies based on spray cooling with the goal of achieving heat fluxes in excess of 100 W/cm2 while satisfying power and mass budgets.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The technology developed in this project has numerous potential NASA applications which can be broadly classified into the following two groups:<BR>(1) Power amplifiers for T/R modules and transmitters.<BR>(2) Modular microwave integrated circuits.<BR>(3) Power lasers.<BR>(4) Power modules for energy storage, flywheels, battery chargers, peak power trackers, motor drives, and smart solid-state switches<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The above applications are not limited to NASA since thermal loads having heat fluxes are found in many military and commercial applications.  For example, the ambient temperature under the hood in an automobile could be in excess of 100 degrees C.  Silicon-based automotive electronics have maximum junction temperatures such that traditional cooling systems like heat sinks and cold plate are not suitable.  Even if they were suitable, the power densities of these systems are impractical for automotive applications.  Therefore, systems relying on spray cooling will find many military and commercial applications (e.g., radar systems, dc-dc converters, power supplies).

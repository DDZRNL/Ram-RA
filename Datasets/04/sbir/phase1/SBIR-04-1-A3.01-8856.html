		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The need for a small, lightweight, remotely-operable transponder for UAVs is identified. This would allow integration of UAVs into the national airspace while providing an equivalent level of safety during operations as manned aircraft. A network-centric, integrated transponder and altitude encoder is proposed to meet this need. Phase I includes device design and bench top testing of system components. Phase II includes design refinement, prototype fabrication, and comprehensive flight testing of the device in KalScott's UAV.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The transponder can be incorporated into NASA's Access5 effort to integrate UAVs into the national airspace safely. NASA currently flies several UAVs on earth science missions. This transponder can be applied to those vehicles. This transponder can be used on contractor-provided UAVs as well for NASA missions.  
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The transponder can be used for airspace integration of UAVs. Such vehicles are now increasingly used for homeland security, science, civilian, and homeland security missions.

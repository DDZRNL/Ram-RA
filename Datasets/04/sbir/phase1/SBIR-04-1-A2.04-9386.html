		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		In this project advanced acoustic blankets for improved low frequency interior noise control in aircraft will be developed and demonstrated. The improved performance is achieved with a novel lightweight composite system that has been previously experimentally demonstrated on laboratory structures. The advanced blanket system will also satisfy new flammability and toxicity requirements with minimal integration issues. Work will be carried out with our partner NEVA Associates and acoustic material manufacturers to design commercial versions of the advanced blankets suitable for aircraft. Integration issues related to application in aircraft fuselages will be considered.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Potential NASA commercial applications of the new technology are throughout the US commercial and general aviation industry. The advanced blankets will result in quieter interiors of aircraft and also satisfy new flammability and toxicity requirements. The new blanket systems will thus increase the economic competiveness of the US aircraft industry worldwide.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Potential non-NASA  commercial applications of the technology include reducing sound in defense aircraft, automobiles, industrial equipment as well as reduction of payload noise in launch vehicle fairings. The technology will result in a new, innovative passive blanket technology for noise control that will find general application in a multitude of products where low frequency noise control is important. The product will be of high economic benefit to many US industries that compete worldwide.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		SMH Consulting proposes to develop a web-based decision support system to assist in Rapid Assessment, Monitoring, and Management (RAMM-DSS) on a regional scale. SMH Consulting will focus on the Chesapeake Bay Watershed and collaborate with the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) for the RAMM-DSS development during Phase I. The RAMM-DSS will supplement operational decision support tools already in use with tailored data products routinely derived from NASA's MODIS data. Delivery of data products and information will be through a web portal where users can view, query, and download data for a specified area and time period of interest. The RAMM-DSS will support NASA missions by (i) lowering technical and logistical barriers to the use of ESE data, (ii) making ESE data easy-to-use for practitioners, and (iii) supporting educational initiatives on use of RS data in operational scenarios. The web delivery of data and information tailored to client requirements will bridge the gap between RS data providers and applicational users. Further, the educational component consisting of real-world, hands-on case studies and RS and satellite/sensor overviews, will aim to eventually close this gap altogether by making practitioners more knowledgeable and aware of the use of RS data in their daily operations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This project will meet NASA goals by:<BR>?	Making MODIS-based data products and information useful and easy-to-use by practitioners on a routine basis<BR>?	Supporting the development of operational decision support systems <BR>?	Developing a unique, systematic method for delivery of MODIS-based data products to end-users by further processing Level 2 data to match exact user requirements and incorporating a unique "Alerting service" <BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		?	Monitoring of soil and crop conditions, identifying "problem" areas, and improving planting/harvesting schedules;<BR>?	Monitoring ground conditions and cost effectively allocating resources during, for example, snow storms and floods<BR>?	Identifying areas of LC changes to reduce expenses of county and state wide re-mapping programs and introducing information on current LC planning activities and assessments, modeling, and development initiatives;<BR>?	Enabling an early warning system for the detection and monitoring of, for example, forest fires and gypsy moth outbreaks; and<BR>?	Providing climate/weather modeling and forecasting entities with improved regional and global datasets on cloud and snow cover dynamics.<BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This SBIR Phase I proposal describes a novel method to make deep and far UV optical filters from macroporous silicon. This type of filter consists of an array of parallel, independent leaky waveguides made in the form of a free-standing, two-dimensionally ordered silicon structure with pore walls coated by a dielectric multilayer. The proposed filters offer unmatched levels of rejection within a very wide rejection band combined with a high level of transmission within the pass band that can be centered throughout the deep and far UV range. In addition, unlike common interference-based filters, the spectral position of the pass and rejection bands will not depend on the angle of incidence. The proposed filters will be light weight and may be manufactured cost-effectively in large quantities. In Phase I, it is proposed to demonstrate the feasibility of the method by fabricating pore structures with different pore wall coatings and measuring the transmission and other optical properties.  In Phase II, optimized filters will be fabricated and their properties compared with design predictions.  Phase III will involve product design, fabricating filter structures to meet customers' physical as well as optical needs, and marketing and sales investments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Deep and far UV imaging is a powerful technique to study auroral activity and compositions of atmospheres around solar system planets and moons. UV index forecasting, earth impact and other vital environmental information can be obtained. Available filters suffer from problems stemming from either a narrow band of high rejection or a wide band of shallow rejection, and degradation of the filter performance with the variations of angle of incidence. Problems with available UV transparent materials (moisture absorption, delamination) lead to difficulty in making robust or large area filters. The proposed filters can solve these problems and reduce costs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		UV filters are used for harmful UV radiation detection, water purification, proof-of-flame, water analysis, postal security systems, environmental monitoring, semiconductor lithographic instrumentation, medical analyzers and monitors (ophthalmology), high voltage corona detection and electrical spark imaging. Superior filters based on porous semiconductor technology may be adjusted for almost any wavelength throughout the extreme UV-to-visible spectrum, thus enhancing the performance of fluorescence instruments used for applications such as DNA sequencing, microplate readers, flow cytometry, human genome mapping, and pharmaceutical development They will be useful in biomedical research and Raman spectroscopy used in imaging applications, and process control in the chemical industry.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		A database of nucleon-nucleon elastic differential and total cross sections will be generated by stochastic simulation of the quantum Liouville equation in the Wigner representation, incorporating innovations of: (1) antisymmetrization effects of spin ? nucleons in phase space; (2) the first order quantum corrections as a stochastic process for two-nucleon dynamics; and (3) a linked list algorithm to streamline and speed computing. Phase I will produce a prototype 4-dimensional phase space simulation of one dimensional spatial scattering, which will be extended in Phase II to three dimensional spatial scattering with a full 12-dimensional phase space model. Significance includes design of radiation shielding materials for manned NASA missions into deep space, where galactic cosmic rays pose a serious health hazard. Computer codes simulating nuclear transport through materials, with associated input databases of interaction cross sections, enable radiation risk assessment of shielding materials. The proposed database of nucleon cross sections forms a subset of the input database. The simulation may potentially be extended to generate databases for nuclear elastic, inelastic, and fragmentation cross sections. Commercial applications include radiation protection for humans on earth under hazardous conditions. The simulation also has applications to nanotechnology and quantum information technologies.

		For manned NASA deep space missions, the challenge of protecting humans and onboard instrumentation from galactic cosmic rays, while meeting the stringent requirements on spaceship design and payload, demands optimal design of radiation shielding materials. Computer codes simulating nuclear transport through materials, with associated input databases of interaction cross sections, enable radiation risk assessment of shielding materials. The proposed database will form a subset of the input database. Also, if nuclear fueled energy plays a role in NASA missions, appropriate shielding materials may be required to reduce the risk of radiation exposure to sensitive payload.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed innovation will have a commercial spin off, in conjunction with NASA technology, for developing protective radiation shielding materials for use in high radiation environments on earth. The proposed simulation is also of interest in atomic, molecular, nuclear, and interstellar sciences, and nanotechnology and quantum information technology at which scales purely quantum effects begin to gain dominance.

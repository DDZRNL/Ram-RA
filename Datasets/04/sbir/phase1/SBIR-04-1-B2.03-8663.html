<P><B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>Proteomic studies in 
microgravity are crucial to understanding the health effects of spaceflight on 
astronauts. Unfortunately, existing tools for measuring protein, antibody, and 
enzyme expression are limited to earth-borne laboratories due to their 
complexity and size. This proposal offers a novel technology that provides a 
palm-top platform suitable for real-time experiments on the Space Shuttle or 
International Space Station. The technology uses nanoelectronic transistors 
coupled to antibody bioprobes to provide a label-free "direct detection" system 
that is rapid and easy to use with minimal skill. The system is completely 
self-contained, including all reagents and waste products, and operated from a 
PDA-style handheld computer. Phase I will demonstrate the detection concept and 
Phase II will deliver prototype units for testing. 
<P><B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>The 
proposed endpoint of this program is a handheld bioassay system that would be 
ideally suited for all biomedical research and diagnostic needs of current and 
future space missions. 
<P><B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>Point 
of care and telemedical diagnostics are the most rapidly growing segment of the 
medical testing market, for which this technology would be ideally suited.

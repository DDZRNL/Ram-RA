		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Sierra Engineering Inc. (Sierra) believes that the subject triaxial liquid propellant swirl injector has the potential to meet many of NASA's Earth-to-Orbit (ETO) propulsion systems goals. The triaxial swirl injector is ideally suited to a wide range of liquid oxidizers and fuels, including hydrogen and a variety of hydrocarbons.  It holds the potential of excellent high-frequency combustion stability characteristics, low injector production cost, and deep throttling capabilities similar to a pintle injector.  Additionally, this injector offers the potential for excellent thermal compatibility and outstanding propellant atomization characteristics.  The concept is well suited for both main chamber and preburner applications.  This Phase I SBIR focuses on developing prototype mechanical designs and the supporting analysis necessary to justify fabrication and testing during a follow-on Phase II effort.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The triaxial swirl injector is applicable to booster, upper-stage, decent, ascent and in-space engine designs.  The stability and cost characteristics of the triaxial swirl injector also make it very attractive as a preburner injector for both fuel-rich and ox-rich staged combustion systems.  Staged-combustion systems are essential for high-performance earth-to-orbit propulsion systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Sierra has been developing film-cooled engines for Microcosm and Northrop Grumman projects.  These projects would benefit from improved injector reliability accompanied by reduced manufacturing cost.  The USAF and MDA are also interested in low cost injector concepts that can accommodate a wide range of fuels.

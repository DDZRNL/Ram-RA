		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Silicon based ceramics are the leading candidates for the high temperature structural components of the advanced propulsion engines.  For such applications, one key drawback of silicon based ceramics is the volatilization of the protective silica scale in engine relevant oxidizing and water vapor environments at temperatures up to 1500 degrees C. Thus for the realization of silicon based ceramic components in advanced propulsion engines, environmental and thermal protective coatings will be needed. UES, Inc. proposes to develop a multifunctional environmental barrier coating concept utilizing advanced materials, coating design and coating processing technique for low thermal expansion silicon nitride. The performance and stability of the coatings developed in this program will be determined in relevant engine environments at temperatures up to 1500 degrees C.  Based upon the test results coating design and process parameters will be further refined in Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Advanced Si based ceramics are the candidates for future NASA reusable space propulsion components. Robust environmental barrier coatings will be a critical part for successful introduction of advanced Si based ceramics and composites in future space vehicles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Successful completion of the proposed technology through Phase I and Phase II effort will also enable the usage of Si based ceramics in the propulsion engines of Department of Defense vehicle applications.  In the private sector, the proposed technology can be used in aircraft propulsion, and electric power generation, ceramic diesel and gasoline internal combustion engines.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed innovation is a passive, self-regulating, gravity-independent Advanced Product Water Removal and management (APWR) system for incorporation into Polymer Electrolyte Membrane  (PEM) primary fuel cell power plants. Passive water removal is incorporated into each cell of the power plant stack. Only pressure differential is required to manage within the cell and to remove and discharge liquid product water from the power plant. The APWR system eliminates the gas circulator, centrifugal separator, heat exchanger (condenser) and controls that comprise the water management system in the conventional aqueous electrolyte fuel cell power plants now in service It also can simplify the reactant supply system by elimination of fuel and oxidant humidifiers. No rotating or active components or gas circulation are required in the APWR system. APWR is based on PEM technology proven in industrial and automotive applications but not applied to space power plants.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The APWR cell has application to a various future NASA mission including the Advanced Lauch System, lunar base fixed power, the Crew Exploration Vehicle, as well as future Mars and planetary missions where a simple, common power module is required.  
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The APWR cell also has application to Non- NASA aerospace missions such as the High Altitude Airship, as well as commercial backup power and power quality systems for grid and data security.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		NASA's safety mandate for crewed and high value spacecraft currently necessitates design requirements that create a cost barrier for commercial companies trying to provide on-orbit logistics services for NASA. The proposed innovation offers a means to facilitate commercial involvement in on-orbit servicing by developing a spacecraft that removes this burden from commercial vehicles. The spacecraft will:<BR>?	Perform automated rendezvous and capture to ferry commercial spacecraft to target spacecraft<BR>?	Provide a safe interface between simple, low cost, commercial spacecraft and high value targets (ISS, CEV, Lunar Lander, propellant depot, or high value satellites)<BR><BR>This will serve as key infrastructure element to enable emerging commercial space companies and other developers of low cost systems to play significant roles in NASA's Exploration program and/or ISS re-supply activities.  This infrastructure will:<BR>?	Prevent restrictive and extremely expensive fault tolerance, safety, and Human Rating requirements from being levied on the commercial vehicles,<BR>?	Remove the need for commercial vehicles to design, develop, and test independent automated rendezvous and docking (AR&D) systems,<BR>?	Reduce the amount of expensive AR&D and safety related hardware launched and discarded on each flight, and<BR>?	Reduce the cost of integrating each spacecraft through standardized interfaces.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The primary purpose of the SBIR project is to create a new element of NASA's infrastructure that will enable the use of low cost commercial spacecraft in NASA's overall development strategy. Some examples are:<BR>? Low cost ISS re-supply using commercial launch and spacecraft developers<BR>? Unique solutions to some of the mission challenges for the exploration program<BR>? Support and servicing of NASA satellites<BR><BR>The use of the spacecraft does not need to be limited to low cost commercial spacecraft. It can also be used for:<BR>? Any automated rendezvous and docking program<BR>? Test platform for Exploration program
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Any infrastructure that supports the introduction of low cost commercial spacecraft will have longer term commercial applications. Some of these include:<BR>? On-orbit spacecraft servicing<BR>? Commercial support of NASA's exploration mission or ISS re-supply<BR>

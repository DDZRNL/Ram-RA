		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The technology required to deploy Directed Energy Weapons (DEW) for use against hardened military targets may be constrained to just a few nations, but for soft targets like commercial aircraft and Air Transportation System (ATS) assets options are plenty for terrorists, organized crime or rogue states hoping to inflict harm. These devices are readily configured for covert operations favored by such groups. This work will identify, quantify and provide guidance to intercept RF, EMP and HPM weapons terrorists might deploy against the ATS. Designs within this group will be categorized by type of design, quantitatively analyzed to determine threat parameters and broken down into components that can be screened by ATS personnel. The end product of this work will directly improve the safety and security of the ATS.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The NASA Strategic Plan includes requirements to enable a more secure air transportation system through development of high-payoff technologies. The goal of this work is to directly deter potential terrorist attacks and contribute to improving the security of commercial aircraft and the ATS. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Commercial applications related to accurate prediction of electromagnetic threats are vast. Virtually, every government agency from federal to local authorities have the need to understand the threat posed by EMP and HPM weapons. Sooner or later terrorists, organized crime, or a foreign state will utilize an EMP or HPM weapon against an American target that will create fear in the commercial marketplace. There are very few corporations that have protected their computer assets to these threats. What CEO wants to find that 500 computers and his company's entire network would be destroyed by an electromagnetic attack?

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		BRO will provide commercially available optics software that dependably calculates image plane irradiance to the precision required by TPF missions. Calculations will be compared to those predicted in the published literature. BRO will use the Gaussian Beam Decomposition Algorithm (GBDA), which works within fully 3D systems, simulates interferometers and deformable mirrors, includes polarization, and calculates fields at all propagation distances.  In Phase II, BRO will increase the speed of the GBDA, write software to estimate the errors in calculations to include the effects of polarization aberrations on the irradiance and add optimization capabilities.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed software is a tool that will be used to design, analyze and optimize the complex optical systems for imaging planets around stars. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This is a general tool for optimizing systems for which diffraction and interference is an important contributor to their performance.  Manufacturers and designers of systems that use interferometers, wavefront sensors, and deformable mirrors would use this software to design their systems and improve the performance of their products.  The software would be used to design commercial interferometers and wavefront sensors.<BR><BR>

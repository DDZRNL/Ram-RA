		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Current shared aperture diffractive optical elements (SHADOE) have intrinsic residual wavefront errors on the order of 20 waves which limits the angular resolution of the LIDAR application to a range between 150 and 400 micro-radians. It is possible to reduce these aberrations by constructing a secondary holographic correction plate using the aberrated wave from the SHADOE as one of the two construction waves. The other construction wave is either a collimated wave or an f#2 focused wave. All five overlapping apertures require individually constructed plates.  This method of correction requires the use of the final playback wavelength for construction and so is useful for 532 and 355nm but not for 1064 nm. Computed diffractive optics can be used for 1064 nm using measured aberrations at the same wavelength. This proposal deals just with fabrication and test of the 355 nm LIDAR applications for which an entirely optical recording set up is adequate.  Correction plates in the 2 inch diameter range are proposed with likely reduction in angular spread to under 50 micro-radians, which will greatly improve the signal to noise numbers in a LIDAR application.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		 Applications include improvement to LIDARs used in terrain and vegetation mapping with possible uses in coherent Doppler and other wind detection LIDARs. The UV elements may also be space qualified. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Commercial LIDAR applications such as terrain mapping, wind speed measurements near runways, pollution monitoring and possibly standoff material identification. The same technology can be used for production of big photon buckets for laser communications, fast spectro-photometers, solar collection and dispersion, solar laser pumping, improved resolution of large monochromatic telescopes and architectural lighting.<BR>

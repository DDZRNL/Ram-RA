		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This SBIR proposal aims to develop all-passive fiberoptic lighting systems that can be used on long space missions or here on earth.  By addressing the traditional problems of concentration and solar tracking in a novel way, we will create a high efficiency lighting system that is also very durable and inexpensive.  In this Phase I work, Applied Optical Materials will research two distinct methods for improving on conventional plastic fiber lighting technology.  These innovations are directly relevant to the concentration efficiency of the system and have very high potential to reduce the cost and maintainability of passive lighting systems to a level commensurate with business and consumer applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		There is a need to find inexpensive, durable and power efficient means of lighting crops, promoting biomass decomposition, illuminating living quarters, etc. for longer space missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Americans spend over $40 billion annually to light homes and offices, and our consumption of electricity is directly related to dire ecological consequences such as global warming.  The proposed system can address the needs of residential and commercial lighting in an economical and ecologically sound way.

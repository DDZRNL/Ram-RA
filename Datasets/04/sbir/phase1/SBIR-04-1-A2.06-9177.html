		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		       Cornerstone Research Group Inc. (CRG) proposes to develop an advanced reflexive structure system to increase the survivability of aerostructures.  This reflexive system will mimic the pain withdrawal reflex on which the human body relies.  The proposed reflexive system will incorporate a continuous health and performance monitoring system via an embedded dielectric film, an adaptive composite structure based on CRG's shape memory composite material (Veritex<SUP>TM</SUP>), and an intelligence system which will be interfaced with both the health/performance sensors and the adaptive structure. When activated, Veritex<SUP>TM</SUP> will recover its structural integrity via shape recovery and a novel healing process.  These features enable the use of Veritex<SUP>TM</SUP> as an adaptive structure in the proposed reflexive system.  The development of a reflexive system for aerostructures will enable increased safety and security and demonstrate a better understanding of integrated performance systems.  This reflexive technology could find immediate implementation on all current and future UCAV systems and future implementation on platforms such as the International Space Station, Lunar, and Martian habitats.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		       Supporting NASA's Aeronautics Enterprise, this project's technologies directly address requirements for enhanced aircraft safety and survivability.  These technologies will enable conceptual flight vehicle/platform designs integrating smart, intelligent, and adaptive flight vehicle capabilities.  The International Space Station, Lunar, and Martian habitats are all examples of structures that will benefit from a reflexive system.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		       This project's technologies developed for NASA systems would directly apply to systems operated by other government and commercial enterprises.  Government systems that would derive the same benefits would include, but not be limited to, aircraft structures, marine structures, shelter structures, and many other structural systems operated by all agencies of the Department of Defense.  This technology's attributes for reflexive repair should yield a high potential for private sector commercialization for reflexive systems for many types of structures that see combat environments.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This SBIR Phase I effort proposes an innovative class of refractory metal intermetallic composites as alternatives to high temperature metallic materials presently used and/or considered for in-space propulsion components.  In addition to a superior high temperature performance potential, these niobium-based intermetallics could offer significant cost savings over conventional refractory alloys, provided they can be affordably manufactured into near-net shapes.  An advanced reactive metal casting technology is applied to produce the most sophisticated Nb-based intermetallic composite component shape ever attempted.  Innovative shape processing techniques are needed for Nb-based intermetallics, since they are critical to manufacturing cost-effectiveness.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Potential NASA commercial applications include in-space propulsion components and aeroengine and rocket propulsion components (particularly as replacements for nickel-based superalloys and refractory alloys in high temperature applications).
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Potential non-NASA commercial applications include replacement candidates for nickel-based superalloys and refractory alloys in high temperature and corrosion-resistant applications.  Essentially, any application and/or industry that needs the superior strength-to-density of Nb-based intermetallics within relative affordability while possessing high temperature and corrosion-resistant physical properties superior to nickel-based superalloys could use this technology.

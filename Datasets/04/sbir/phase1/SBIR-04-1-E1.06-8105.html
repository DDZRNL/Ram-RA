		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		WaveBand Corporation in collaboration with Virginia Commonwealth University proposes to design and fabricate a new sub-millimeter source based on an InAlGaN superlattice (SL).  Semiconductor SLs have proven their ability to deliver high-frequency current oscillations caused by specific electron dynamics in a narrow miniband.  For this project, WaveBand proposes to demonstrate SLs based on one of the GaN-family materials that deliver high temperature and high power operation superior to those provided by conventional III-V materials based on GaAs and InAs alloys.  The idea of Bloch oscillators has been around for a while, yet actual example has not been demonstrated.  The reason is that dc-current instability prevents oscillations at high frequency.  The innovation of the proposed work is that we plan to use short-period SLs with complex miniband electron energy dispersion that suppresses the dc-instability and allows electrons to oscillate at multiples of the fundamental Bloch frequency.  MBE-growth of short-period SLs will be performed using formation of spontaneous superlattices from an immiscible composition.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Proposed source may serve as a compact local oscillator in a heterodyne receiver integrated system. <BR>The innovation will benefit measurements testing the Earth's atmosphere: climate and meteorological parameters, including water vapor, clouds, aerosols; air pollution; and chemical constituents such as ozone and carbon monoxide.  The device will be responsive to NASA needs for Advanced Communication Technologies for Near-Earth Missions where wide bandgap III-Nitride devices are sought for high-power high-efficiency solid state power amplifiers and integration of electronic devices with optoelectronic components on III-Nitride templates. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Solid-state terahertz-range sources are urgently needed in various applications including sensors for detection and analysis of hazardous chemical and biological agents, and sub-millimeter wave imaging systems for concealed weapons detection and spectroscopy,

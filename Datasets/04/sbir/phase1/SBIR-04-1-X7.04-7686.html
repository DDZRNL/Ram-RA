		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The ability to capture and record the low-level signals in the noisy environments typical of manned and unmanned space exploration missions will prove an invaluable tool in the monitoring of spacecraft health and the operation of spacecraft instrumentation. The technology now exists to create a miniaturized, low-power integrated data acquisition system capable of capturing these signals and making them available to spacecraft operators through on-board control and communications resources. Using our extensive experience and expertise in miniaturized embedded data acquisition systems, Tanner Research propose to develop a new class of data acquisition devices capable of capturing and recording spacecraft health and status information throughout the spacecraft's mission. The system will be capable of acquiring information at various rates and qualities, based on direct user input (controls) and system status. Prototype hardware will be delivered at the end of Phase I and a evaluation versions of production-quality prototypes will provided at the end of the follow-on Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The data acquisition system proposed by Tanner Research will satisfy the requirements for spacecraft and surface exploration systems in which a variety of on-board sensors (strain gauges, position sensors, etc.) must be interfaced to an on-board mission computer. The data acquisition system will filter and condition sensor outputs, digitize the outputs and communicate with other platform computing resources. A particular focus is that of low-level signals in high noise environments where size, weight and power are at a premium. Applications include determining the health and status of a robotic arm on a Mars rover or other sample return mission. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Potential non-NASA applications for the proposed data acquisition system include terrestrial UAVs, UGVs, and other robotic or autonomous systems which must operate in harsh (high noise or high-radiation) environments. Robots that are used to explore (nuclear reactor) accident sites are one potential example. As the cost of the system is reduced through increasing volume, additional applications in the aerospace, automotive and industrial markets are envisioned.

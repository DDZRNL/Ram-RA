		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
			The water content of clouds, whether in liquid or ice form, is a key variable to be measured when either calibrating remote sensing systems or when calculating the climatological effects of clouds.  While a variety of sensors exist for making these measurements, all of the existing sensors require far too much power or other energy input to be used on small platforms with limited payloads such as UAVs, balloons, and kites.  <BR>	Anasphere has developed and completed preliminary testing of a novel cloud water content sensor which does not require any external energy input, but is capable of measuring both liquid water and ice content of clouds.  Preliminary results have been extremely promising. <BR>	Phase I work will include the fabrication and demonstration of proof-of-concept sensors based on the designs investigated in the preliminary research, culminating in a balloon-borne flight with a radiosonde through a cloud.  Phase II work will include the refinement of the design, extensive laboratory testing, and extensive field intercomparisons and trials.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
			One area of application will be in supporting the development of remote sensors (including passive sensors, active radars, etc.) that are designed to measure these same cloud properties.  Such sensors may be ground-, aircraft-, or satellite-based.  Another area of application is the measurement of cloud water content in support of studies related to cloud properties, radiation transfer, and climate change.  Until highly accurate remote sensors become available, field researchers will have a need to directly measure cloud water properties using in-situ sensors.  
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
			Researchers in several other governmental agencies (including NOAA, DOE, and NCAR as examples) and universities will have applications similar to those of NASA researchers.  Private businesses engaged in remote sensor development will also find the sensor useful in the testing and calibration of their sensors.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Advanced life-support systems, which use chemical, physical, and biological processes, are being developed to support future long-term human planetary exploration.  As a result, there is a need to develop innovative food processes for baseline crops, such as dry beans (legumes) that have a shelf-life of more than one year and can support human life during extended space travel.  Legumes are hydrated in large volumes of water to about 50% moisture to help reduce process times.  Hydration is lengthy often requiring more than 8 hours using room temperature water, or boiling water for 2-3 minutes followed by soaking for at least one hour. Additionally, long cooking times ranging from about 30 minutes to over 2 hours are also required. We propose a reduction in the time, energy, and water requirements for processing legumes by using a novel combination of food grade carbohydrases to enhance the processing characteristics of legumes (Pinto, Navy and Kidney beans) prior to implementation of conventional (boiling, cooking, canning or microwaving) techniques.

		Long-duration, shelf-stable food:  Food-grade enzymes can be used to develop highly acceptable, shelf-stable food items derived from other plant-based food sources.<BR>Food Processing:  Food-grade enzymes can be applied to baseline crops, such as beans, wheat, soybeans, rice, and other grains to reduce the time, water, and energy requirements during processing.   <BR>

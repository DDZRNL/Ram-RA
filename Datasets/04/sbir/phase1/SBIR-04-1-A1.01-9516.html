		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		To improve aviation safety, NASA requires crew-centric technologies that ensure appropriate situational awareness through improved information presentation.  Presenting information by 3D display can significantly facilitate human perception and counteract biases and error-tendencies, leading to improved aviation safety.  To address this NASA need, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new 3D COckpit Display (3D-COD) system for aircraft flight decks, based on fast scanning liquid crystal (LC) optics, to create a compact multiuser, multiperspective 3D display system that has no moving parts and requires no 3D glasses.  This interactive system brings automultiscopic viewing to pilots and crew members on the flight deck, with a greater than 60 degree FOV, 2048x2048 resolution, 60 Hz flicker-free full-color, high-brightness, and crosstalk-free operation, introducing 3D display technology to the cockpit.  The use of LC technology well developed for flat-panel LC displays, reduces cost and makes the system commercially attractive.  In Phase I POC will develop a scaled-down version of the fast-scanning LC optics display system and demonstrate its 3D operation on a laboratory 3D testbed system.  This testbed will be upgraded to a fully packaged optimized prototype in Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed 3D-COD display system will be used not only in the cockpit, but also for air traffic control, training, and multicraft airspace image displays, engineering design, training and simulation, and scientific visualization and analysis.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The 3D-COD technology has huge commercial potential.  It will find applications in the engineering development and entertainment industries, particularly in theme parks, museums, and educational institutions.  This technology can also address the multibillion dollar video game industry.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		National LambdaRail (NLR) offers unprecedented communication capabilities on the National and possibly International levels.  Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new 3D multichannel networked (3DMCN) system for visualizing large collections of Earth science data in a highly distributed and networked environment, compatible with the high speed National LambdaRail (NLR), with the necessary interfaces and video processing hardware/software.  One of the critical issues in the development of such systems is the capability to transmit high-resolution (High Definition format) multi-channel images/video from a central rendering/processing location to multiple visualization stations, which can be thousands of miles apart.  To address 3D video/telepresence on the NLR POC will develop special compression software for multi-channel transmission, removing both intra- and inter-channel redundancy.  At the end of Phase I POC will demonstrate 3D video transmission over multi-Gigabit Ethernet channels in a laboratory environment.  In Phase II a full system with multiple visualization stations connected to the NLR will be developed, including network interfaces, video compression, and 3D video stations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The initial application of 3DMCN will be for Earth science data visualization, with particular emphasis on networked true 3D environment visualization.  This initial application reflects the focus of this project on the needs of NASA.  Other applications of the 3DMCN systems will include mapping:  meteorological imagery for weather maps, satellite imagery for satellite image maps, topographic maps, digital elevation models (DEMs), and specialized maps showing geology, hydrology, demography, vegetation, agricultural land use, cities, forests, roads, etc.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed 3DMCN technology is ideal for multichannel live video transmission and storage.  This technology has many applications in visualization, video communication, virtual reality, medicine, and related fields.  In addition to advanced multi-channel 3D visualization, it will bring new bandwidth efficiency to computer training and simulation, video games, air traffic control, environmental monitoring, and automatic satellite orbit control.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Advanced cathode materials having high red-ox potential and high specific capacity offer great promise to the development of high energy density lithium-based batteries. A novel advanced cathode material having higher capacity and operating voltage than conventional CFx cathode is proposed to develop high energy density lithium batteries. The proposed cathode material will be synthesized and characterized using different analytical and electrochemical techniques. <BR><BR>Several prismatic design lithium pouch cells will be developed with the proposed cathode material and lithium anode in carbonate-based lithium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte and will be tested to demonstrate the proof-of-concept.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The successful completion of Phase I work will demonstrate the feasibility of developing high energy density and long life lithium batteries for NASA's Deep Space Power Systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The U.S. progressively lost her position in each generation of new battery technology developed for consumer electronic applications. The rapid development of a new advanced battery technology with high capacity cathode materials is, therefore, essential for us in order to gain our worldwide competitiveness for portable electronics (such as memory backups, etc.) and medical (such as heart pacemakers) applications. <BR>

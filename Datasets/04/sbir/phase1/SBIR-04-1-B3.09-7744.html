		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The NASA vision of Space Exploration requires new approaches to radiation shielding.  Both Spiral 2 and Spiral 3 concepts are extremely sensitive to weight reduction.  Currently used thermal protection (TPS) and radiation shielding concepts are separate identities.  As a result, the net weight of current TPS/radiation shielding concepts is very significant.  In an effort to greatly reduce the mass of the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), a totally new concept is proposed. It merges a novel approach to TPS combined with a totally new approach to radiation shielding.  A boron carbide foam will be produced by a novel method.  This foam will be integrated into a CEV TPS concept.  As a result, the TPS will serve a multiple function including radiation shielding resulting in a significant weight saving.

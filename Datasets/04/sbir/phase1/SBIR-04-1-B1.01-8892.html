		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This Phase I SBIR effort initiates development of a high-sensitivity low-noise all-silicon CMOS-MEMS accelerometer for quasi-steady measurements of accelerations at sub 1 micro-g levels.  The accelerometer module includes integrated low-noise CMOS circuitry with active offset and low-frequency noise cancellation to enable high-precision DC measurements.  The high-performance of the sensor is enabled by innovation in both MEMS accelerometer and readout circuit technologies: i) Single-crystalline silicon capacitive accelerometer structure.  The device has high sensitivity and low thermo-mechanical noise; ii) Innovative high-yield fabrication process that enables formation of high-sensitivity devices on top of CMOS wafers; iii) New and improved low-noise capacitive sensor readout CMOS circuit.  This novel microaccelerometer has several NASA applications including measurement of residual accelerations on spacecraft and ground-based low-gravity facilities.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed CMOS-MEMS accelerometer will reduce the size, mass, power requirements and cost of the instruments for measuring the residual accelerations on spacecraft or in ground-based low-gravity facilities.  By using innovative device and circuit technologies the proposed MEMS sensor can resolve sub micro-g quasi-static accelerations as solicited by GRC and MSFC under topic B1.01 (Exploiting Gravitational Effects for Combustion, Fluids, Synthesis, and Vibration Technology).  Also this device can be employed for space platform stabilization, and miniature self-contained or GPS-augmented navigation systems for micro-satellites, spacecrafts, aircrafts, and ground vehicles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		High precision accelerometers with micro-g sensitivity have several non-NASA applications including self-contained and GPS-augmented navigation and guidance systems, oil-exploration and earthquake prediction, tilt measurements, and underwater acoustic measurements.  The impact of low cost, small, high-performance micromachined accelerometers in these applications is not just limited to reducing overall size, cost and weight.  It opens up new market opportunities such as personal navigators for consumer applications, and it enhances the overall accuracy and performance of the systems by making formation of large arrays of devices feasible (i.e. large sensor arrays for oil and gas exploration).

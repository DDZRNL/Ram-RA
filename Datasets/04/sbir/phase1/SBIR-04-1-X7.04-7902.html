		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The purpose of the proposed effort is to provide a novel and innovative reconfigurable software defined radio (SDR) development system that supports the design and implementation of SDRs for human Moon/planetary surface exploration and deep space missions.  This type of revolutionary technology provides significant assistance to the SDR designer, enabling the development of a wide class of radio systems and supports customization at any level within the radio architecture.  The proposed development system is ideally suited for design and implementation of ultra simplified and efficient forms of SDR.  The focus of this proposal is to demonstrate the applicability and feasibility of this particular SDR development technology to space exploration through analysis, design, and implementation.  <BR><BR>Successful completion of the proposed Phase I technology effort will culminate in a demonstration of interoperability with at least one NASA communications system.  In addition, it will permit a Phase II effort to produce hardware and software that can be used to demonstrate the performance and impact of the proposed technology in some on-going NASA project, through demonstrating interoperability with at least two NASA communications systems.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Reconfigurable software defined radios have a wide applicability to NASA systems.  This is especially apparent with the development of high-capacity FPGA devices that can tolerate the radiation environments of space.  Specific applications of interest include: <BR> - embedded wireless communication systems for low data rate (e.g., sensor measurements) as well as high bandwidth systems (e.g., EVA suit cameras).<BR> - dedicated space-to-space communication links, especially in support of Lunar and planetary missions
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Software Defined Radio is rapidly growing in popularity and, consequentially, new application domains regularly emerge for SDR in the commercial and government marketplace.  Of particular interest to StarVision Technologies is the integration of the foundational Space-SDR technologies into its line of small form factor HDTV cameras.  Other areas of immediate interest and benefit to the Space-SDR team include wireless sensors, low or battery powered devices, and patient monitoring systems.

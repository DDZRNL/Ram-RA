		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The aviation system of the United States of America is one of our national treasures. Very few elements of our culture capture the America spirit like aviation. Air transportation plays an absolutely vital role in our economy, and is also a core part of our high standard of living. But this importance of aviation in our society also makes aviation a highly desirable target for terrorists. Secretary of State Colin Powell has said that "no threat is more serious to aviation" than man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS).  Although on-board defenses against MANPADS are being developed for commercial aircraft, these systems will not be deployed for many years and will be very expensive. The innovation proposed herein provides an information and decision support system to enhance security monitoring and patrolling around the perimeter of airports ? where the threat of MANPADS attacks is at its highest. This effort will merge the use of advanced airport surface surveillance data with decision support algorithms and security threat and vulnerability assessment methodologies to identify and alert security personnel regarding the airport perimeter areas of highest vulnerability and greatest access to targets of opportunity for MANPADS attacks or other terrorist activities.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The MANPADS threat against commercial aviation is real and must be addressed as soon as possible. A significant need exists for the Airport Perimeter Security Advisor (APSA) technology that will be developed through the conduct of this SBIR to complement airborne solutions. The APSA tool may be of interest to DHS, TSA, FAA, and airport authorities, in addition to local law enforcement responsible for patrolling the area around airports. This effort represents an excellent opportunity for NASA to leverage the already successful SMS program to provide additional benefits to the NAS through airport security improvements.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Commercial spin-offs of the APSA tool would focus on airport surface information display and management. Most airlines do not have sufficient information regarding the location of their aircraft and other assets on the airport surface. A commercial version of the APSA airport surface and terminal area map with dynamic flight information could be of significant commercial interest to the air carriers. Mosaic ATM is well positioned to obtain commercial funding from airlines to develop decision support tools to optimize the air carrier operation. Note that many air carriers already use SMS as an integral part of their daily operation.

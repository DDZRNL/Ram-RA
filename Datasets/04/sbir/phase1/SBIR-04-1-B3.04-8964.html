		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Microcide proposes to develop novel multipurpose non-toxic sanitizing wipes that are aqueous based, have shelf life of 3-5 years, have broad spectrum microbicidal activity, detergency for cleaning and chelating properties to bind toxic metal ions. The proposed wipes can eliminate undesirable characteristics of presently used commercial sanitizing wipes by NASA. The commercial sanitizing wipes use ethyl and isopropyl alcohols, hydrogen peroxide, quaternary ammonium compounds (Qacs), bezyl-4-chlorophenol and phenylphenol as active microbicidal agents. <BR><BR>The proposed sanitizing wipes will use FDA approved food additive non-corrosive ingredients. By raising the pH, the microbicidal activity of the wipes can be terminated, which can help biodegradation and recycling the wipes. The wipes will also use recyclable cellulose carrier fabric. With food additive ingredients, these wipes will be safe for use on environmental and food contact surfaces, on fruits and vegetables as well as on skin, hands and outer body parts. The wipes will be free from any undesirable organoleptic properties. The wipes will have efficacy against a broad spectrum of environmental, pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms and also against both antibiotic sensitive and resistant bacteria. These wipes will be suitable for prolonged space missions for use on the shuttle, the ISS and the Planetary Outposts. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed Microcide wipes are novel multipurpose non-toxic sanitizing wipes that can prevent food contamination, improve hygienic conditions and indirectly save healthcare expenditure. The proposed wipes can serve not only the needs of prolonged space missions but also of all other commercial NASA activities. These sanitizing wipes will have broad-spectrum microbicidal activity against environmental, pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. These biodegradable and recyclable wipes can be used on environmental and food contact surfaces, on fruits and vegetables as well as on skin, hands and outer body parts.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		In addition to their use in space, the nontoxic multipurpose sanitizing wipes proposed by Microcide will have wide-ranging commercial applications. Because of potential application on environmental and food contact surfaces, on fruits and vegetables as well as on skin, hands and outer body parts, the sanitizing wipes will be an everyday use item for general population. The numerous places the wipes can be used are homes, restaurants, offices, healthcare institutions, nursing homes, day care centers, food processing plants, school systems, travel industry, military and other consumers locations.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Technology Application, Inc. (TAI) is proposing to demonstrate feasibility of implementing silicon germanium (SiGe) strained-gate technology in the power complementary metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (CMOSFET) and logic devices for a logic and power transistor controller for space-approved stepper motors at cryogenic temperature.  Power electronic systems contain digital and analog circuits, and the increasing complexity of these systems required for deep space missions and naval electric-powered propulsion requires a new approach in material and processes to operate efficiently at cryogenic temperature.  The metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) is the building block for both digital and analog circuits.  Silicon (Si) is a good material for fabricating power MOSFET and electronic devices for operation from 300 K to 77 K.  Devices made from Si suffer from carrier freeze-out below 77 K.  Silicon carbide (SiC) is another material suitable for power switch transistors;  however, SiC deivices suffer from carrier freeze-out at temperature higher than that of Si.  SiGe heterostructure bipolar transistor (HBT) devices are good candidates for low temperature operation.  However, SiGe HBT devices suffer changes in characteristics as the operating temperature gets colder.  SiGe HBT device switching waveform of a dc-dc converter became distorted below 120 K.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Deep space missions and NASA Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) require electronic devices and components capable of operating at extreme hash environments.  The cryogenic temperature and radioactive environments that the electronic systems must endure require a new approach in materials and processes.  Stepper motors are critical components in deep space missions to drive lens, filters or infra-red cameras.  The ability to package the motor controllers in the extreme environments yields reduction in cost, weight, and improve the packaging of the spacecraft or instrument.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Power electronics for high temperature superconducting (HTS) motors such as the next-generation all-electric ships being developed by the Navy; significant size and weight reduction are potentially available in all-electric aircraft weapon and surveillance systems, wireless communications for both military and commercial applications.  There are advantages for cryogenic cooling applications such as commercial cellular base stations and the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) program and superconducting magnetic coils contained in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment, magnetic levitation transportation, and particle accelerators.

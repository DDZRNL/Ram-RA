		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Southwest Sciences proposes to develop innovative instrumentation for the rapid, 3-dimensional imaging of biological tissues with cellular resolution.  Our approach is a variant of optical coherence tomography that will use a very small, low power and compact white light source to provide 2 micrometer or better image resolution.  This device will enable NASA researchers to non-invasively study the structure of living, functioning tissues and cells.  The instrumentation is based on a compact, low cost, low power white light source and can be designed for operation in spaced-based laboratories.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Applications of interest to NASA are studies of cells and tissues of animals and plants grown in micro-gravity, studies of cells exposed to space stresses such as micro-gravity and radiation and studies of cell functioning in response to environmental or physiological stresses.  In addition, this technology can be applied to micro-gravity developmental biology studies, such as inner ear development in xenopus tadpoles or zebra fish model organisms.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		A rapid, high resolution 3-dimensional optical imaging method will have important commercial applications in clinical and biomedical research  including detection of cancerous and precancerous tissues, imaging of venous and arterial structures, optical biopsy and microsurgery guidance.  This technology can be incorporated into endoscopes, catheters and similar devices for in vivo applications.

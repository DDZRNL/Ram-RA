		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed optical device is a fiber-based multi-channel switch to quickly switch a fiber-coupled laser among many possible output channels to create a fiber-based fixed-array laser transmitter for next-generation NASA lidar systems.  The key innovation is the use of an arrangement of electro-optic prisms created in a nonlinear optical crystal through domain reversal to direct the laser into one of many possible output fibers.  This design will provide several important features that are required, yet not currently available in a fiber switch, in order to achieve a fiber-arrayed lidar source, such as high optical power handling, reduced crosstalk, low optical loss, fast switching times, low power consumption, and robust construction in a monolithic package with no moving parts.  The Phase I effort will demonstrate feasibility of the approach by creating a preliminary device with representative features to assess the suitability of the technology for use in lidar systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed switching array will enable the creation of a fiber-based fixed-array laser transmitter that, combined with a fiber-arrayed detector, can provide laser imaging with a shaped field of view for an enhanced lidar return signal and image resolution.  Furthermore, the monolithic construction, low power consumption, and predicted high reliability will make the device suitable for airborne and space-based deployment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		In addition to its use as a electro-optic switching array for NASA lidar, the device will have applications in the areas of optical remote sensing and environmental monitoring, military applications, and basic research.  In addition to lidar applications, the proposed switching device will also be useful in applications requiring all-fiber switching and multiplexing using high power lasers.

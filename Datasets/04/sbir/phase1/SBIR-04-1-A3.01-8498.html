		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The Surface Management System (SMS), developed by NASA Ames Research Center in cooperation with the FAA, has received wide and significant acceptance by the air transportation community. The SMS utilizes flight plan data and airport surface surveillance data to track and model the operation of flights on the airport surface. Predictions of flight arrival and departure times from specific runways are generated by SMS. SMS provides these predictions of future airport operations to numerous airport, ATC and air carrier users to create shared situational awareness. NASA continues to conduct advanced research on airport surface traffic management concepts and tools. Fundamental research in this area has been very difficult to conduct in the past, however, due to the lack of electronic data representing airport surface operations. With the current deployment of airport surface surveillance systems, such data is now becoming available. This effort proposes the creation of a surface operations data warehouse and analysis tool for effective analysis and understanding of airport surface operations. Data mining capabilities will support research of taxi routing, sequencing and congestion management strategies used by air traffic controllers. Such a tool will also provide significant benefit in the SMS adaptation process.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The Surface Operations Data Analysis and Adaptation (SODAA) tool proposed herein will support NASA's advanced research into airport surface operations and decision support tools. Previous NASA efforts in the development of advanced decision support tools have benefited greatly from deep understanding of the ATC operation. Through data warehousing and data mining capabilities, the proposed SODAA tool will provide the infrastructure and information necessary for NASA researchers and other industry analysts to achieve this level of knowledge and understanding of the airport surface ATC operation. Additional tools will support the creation, validation and maintenance of SMS adaptation data.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Air carriers conduct analyses of airport surface operations in an attempt to reduce costly delays, but current information sources lack sufficient detail. A significant market exists for a commercial analysis product for air carriers. Mosaic ATM maintains close working relationships with numerous air carriers and is well positioned to obtain commercial funding to develop and implement tools to help optimize the daily air carrier operation. Note that FedEx and Northwest airlines already use SMS as an integral part of their daily operation for Memphis, and UPS will begin to use SMS as part of their operation for Louisville shortly.

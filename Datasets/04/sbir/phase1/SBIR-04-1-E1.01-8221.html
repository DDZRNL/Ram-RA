		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		TRS Technologies proposes large stroke and high precision piezoelectric single crystal and electroactive polymer actuator concepts?HYBrid Actuation System (HYBAS) for cryogenic passive optics devices such as Fabry-Perot interferometer and Fourier Transform Spectrometer for NASA remote sensing applications. Both single crystal piezoelectrics (PMN-PT and PZT-PT crystals) and electro-active polymer (EAP) are well known novel materials with large strain under electric activation. TRS has lead the development of single crystal actuators for applications with broad temperature range (<20K-300K). The National Institute of Aerospace has been extensively involved in electroactive polymer materials and device development and they recently invented the hybrid actuation system (HYBAS) which exhibits significant strain improvement by combining single crystal piezoelectrics and EAP. HYBAS actuator design considering special properties of single crystal with different crystal cut will be carried out using both analytical and FEM modeling. A HYBAS actuator with stroke of 1~2 mm will be prototyped and tested with and without pre-loading. The characterization data of HYBAS will be compared with the performance of the existing TRS actuators for consideration in Phase II etalon designs. In Phase II cryogenic etalons using HYBAS and/or other TRS cryogenic actuators will be designed, prototyped and characterized.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		HYBAS actuator controlled etalon for -Perot interferometer and Fourier Transform Spectrometers will allow broader range of spectral scanning for NASA remote sensing. Cryogenic HYBAS actuator technology also offer capability of large stroke, high precision and fast responsive for cryogenic adaptive optics, vibration control and smart structures in  many future NASA missions such as JWST, SIM, SAFIR, TPF and others.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		HYBAS actuators are also attractive for many DOD remote sensing applications and adaptive optics programs as well such as  DM technology for directed energy applications. Apart from the active and passive optics applications, large stroke, high precision and fast responsive HYBAS actuators are also good candidates for fiber optic steering, microwave tuning, vibration control and smart structures, electromechanical optical switch, and micro/nanopositioning for photonics and biomedical tooling, etc.

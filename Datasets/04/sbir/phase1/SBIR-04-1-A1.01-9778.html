		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Aircraft encounters with turbulence are the leading cause of injuries in the airline industry and result in significant human, operational, and maintenance costs to the airline community each year.  A large contributor to the above injuries and costs is that flight crews do not have sufficient situational awareness of the location and severity of potential turbulence hazards to their aircraft.  AeroTech will improve pilots' situational awareness of turbulence hazards by developing an integrated, graphical cockpit display of turbulence hazard information scaled to their specific aircraft.  This display will negate the need for inference that is required to interpret current turbulence information.  With better knowledge of turbulence hazards' severity and location, pilots will be able to avoid turbulence encounters or prepare for them by having all occupants seated with seatbelts on, thereby avoiding injuries.  Phase I work will develop, based on pilot input, a concept of operations and a requirements document for this display, evaluate several potential turbulence hazard information sources, and define requirements for simulations to be carried out in Phase II.  By the end of Phase II an intuitive and meaningful cockpit, turbulence hazard display will be developed and tested using simulations and operational flight evaluations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		When the goals of the proposed R/R&D are met, this cockpit display and underlying system will directly contribute to the stated national goal of NASA's Aviation Safety Program (AvSP) of a 50% reduction in aviation accidents by 2007. This work will be completely aligned with other Turbulence Prediction and Warning System (TPAWS) efforts, as well as other efforts in the Weather Accident Prevention (WxAP) element.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		When the goals of the proposed R/R&D are met, this cockpit display system will provide pilots with improved turbulence hazard information allowing them to operate more efficiently and safely.  Significant reductions in fuel waste and costs associated with injuries due to turbulence are expected to be major commercial drivers for this system. The market for this display is all Part 121 carriers (both domestic and international).  Delta Air Lines is currently operationally evaluating several of the technologies whose outputs will be integrated into the proposed display and has also agreed to support the efforts of this proposal.

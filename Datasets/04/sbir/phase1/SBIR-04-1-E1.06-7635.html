		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		High-speed devices using InP play a critical role in the realization of power amplifiers for wireless and optical communication systems. Current gain cut-off frequencies in excess of 200 GHz have been demonstrated for InP HBTs, indicating the potential of these devices for use in high bandwidth communication systems and high-speed direct digital synthesizers.  To achieve a higher output power and higher efficiency, InP HBT based on GaAsSb base layer is proposed in this research effort. This novel material technology offers the highest potential to achieve the highest output power and efficiency at W-band.  We would like to achieve at least 1W of output power at W-band with at least an efficiency of 40%.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		InP based HBT technology is a platform technology that can be used<BR>for MMIC applications from X-band to W-Band. It offers the highest<BR>output power and efficiency at these frequency ranges. There is no<BR>other technology that can offer this type of performance
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		InP based HBT has the potential to migrate to lower frequencies such<BR>as L and S-band. The potential exist for these amplifiers to be applied<BR>to cellular applications which would significantly increase the volume<BR>requirement.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This proposal details a novel mobile data transceiver solution that supports standalone wireless sensors and concurrently acts as a gateway between multiple sensor webs. This innovation uses Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology to communicate with a variety of sensor technologies using many different radio waveforms and communication protocols. The proposed system is designed to be adaptable to mission requirements and all aspects of its operation can be remotely modified after deployment. When possible, the solution uses commercial of the shelf technology (COTS) components and incorporates open data operability standards for information visualization.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This solution will enable both real-time and delay tolerant data gathering from legacy NASA in-situ sensor webs already deployed by NASA earth science researchers and enable a new class of roving sensors. Applications within NASA include environmental and agricultural monitoring, border security, and resource and facilities management.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Applications that could be created from this research and development effort are found in most of the world's largest markets including military, public safety, agricultural, industrial, utilities, and the facilities management sectors. The innovation includes geo-positioning technology that enables a completely new class of dynamic, mobile data gathering applications that have yet to be commercially targeted.

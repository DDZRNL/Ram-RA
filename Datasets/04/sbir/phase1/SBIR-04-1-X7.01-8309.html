		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This document proposes that a network routing protocol, such as the popular Internet Protocol (IP), can be combined with high speed switching fabrics to create a hardware independent routing environment for software radio. The flexible routing provided by such a network layer would allow signal streams to be dynamically routed (and re-routed) between computational elements. This would allow software radio designers to build flexible, fault tolerant signal processing chains for many applications and hardware implementations. This is innovative because conventional IP implementations cannot meet the performance requirements (throughput, jitter, latency) of software radio data streams. The innovation of this research stems from the unique combination of software radio development requirements, advances in network and transport layer designs to support high-speed switching fabrics, and the inherent capabilities provided by IP.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The flexible routing provided by such a network layer enables new functionality in software radios, especially with regard to fault tolerance. The most efficient designs directly link components using high-speed buffers or buses. These designs do not provide the ability to dynamically reconfigure signal processing functions in response to hard failures or new external communications requirements. On the other hand, general-purpose network and transport layers do not meet the high speed I/O requirements of signal processing systems. This unique approach, if successful, would eventually provide an IP-based architecture that allows software radio designers to build reconfigurable signal processing chains.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The Phase I effort, if successful, will demonstrate the feasibility of combining high-speed IP streams with switching fabric to support software radio applications. This would give software radio designers the ability to build flexible, fault tolerant signal processing chains for many applications and hardware implementations. Currently, such solutions must be engineered on a system-by-system basis, which is extremely labor and cost intensive. In general, this work could increase the degree to which software radio designs can be reused, development cycles can be shortened, and costs can be reduced.

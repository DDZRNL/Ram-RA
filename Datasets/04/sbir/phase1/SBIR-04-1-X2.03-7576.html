		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		In this Phase I SBIR effort, Structured Materials Industries, Inc. (SMI)will design, fabricate, and test more efficient photovoltaics for 1.06 micron wavelength wireless power transmission (WPT) systems.  The need for such photovoltaics is well understood by SMI and builds upon our exiting WPT efforts, which have highlighted the requirement for efficient, cost-effective, and thin-able photovoltaics with a peak absorption matched to the output of available high power Nd:YAG lasers at 1.06 microns.  The proposed work will address this need by developing SiGe photocells to help enable WPT implementation for both ground based and space based applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Wireless power transmission is of considerable interest to NASA. The potential exists to use ground based WPT systems to power satellites, as well as space based WPT systems to deliver power to vehicles for exploration. Wireless power transmission can provide auxiliary power for mission-specific tasks, or primary power when other sources (such as direct solar power) are not available.   Currently there is a need for cost-effective, thin-able photovoltaics with a peak absorption matched to the output of available high power Nd:YAG lasers at 1.06 microns.  The proposed work will address this need by developing SiGe photocells to help enable WPT implementation for both ground based and space based applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Many other potential applications exist for WPT systems in both military and commercial markets. The military is interested in powering unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and high altitude airships (HAA) for communications and surveillance. Commercial applications include powering unmanned vehicles and remote systems for communications, meteorology and natural resource management. There is also the possibility of beaming space based solar power back to earth. The development of infrared photocells based on SiGe materials will be of considerable value in developing and implementing WPT systems for these commercial applications.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		We propose to develop flexible solid state polymer-based solar cells that have a power density >1000 W/kg and > 5 year life in the space environment. The specific approach that we will employ it to make intimate organic-inorganic nanocomposites of polymeric electron donors and low-percolating nanoparticle electron acceptors. The polymeric donors have a novel hyperbranched structure which ensure a three dimensional network with high isotropic charge mobility. The high aspect ratio nanoparticle acceptors have a high intrinsic mobility and low percolation threshold. Materials are modified chemically to form intimate interpenetrating networks. The cells are formed by laminating the composite between high and low work function contacts disposed on space-qualified flexible polymer substrates. Phase I entails demonstrating cells with >2% AM0 efficiency using this approach.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The costs of transporting high capacity space power systems from earth to a range of NASA project installations, such as a Martian or lunar base, is a critical issue for future space exploration that can be addressed with high power density photovoltaics. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Commercially, the approach holds the prospect for order of magnitude reduction in the cost of photovoltaics for terrestrial power generation. Thin flexible photovoltaics and also be integratred into building materials and windows for homes, office buildings and automobiles.

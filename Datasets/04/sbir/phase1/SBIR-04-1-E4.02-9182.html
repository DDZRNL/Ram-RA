		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		"CODE (COrps DEvelopment) STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) ? Moon Mars and Beyond; DLESE-Powered On-Line Classroom" shares the excitement of President Bush's vision of space exploration with 8th grade students. Program fulfills standards-based 8th grade curriculum and will be implemented in two diverse Escondido schools (Grant, Rincon). San Diego County Office of Education will ensure relevance and integration into formal curriculum.  Through thematic approach to learning and multi-disciplinary exhibit-centered final project, Program strives to engage broad cross-section of students and teachers.  <BR><BR>Focus is on developing a theme-specific DLESE (Digital Library for Earth System Education) collection and portal. On-line learning communities and inquiry based learning protocols (San Diego State University) will enhance DLESE effectiveness. Implementation culminates with multi-disciplinary student exhibit at participating schools and San Diego Aerospace Museum, sharing excitement of space exploration with general public. In Phase II DLESE collection will be expanded to support additional grade levels (3rd, 5th, 8th, high school), there will be broad implementation in San Diego and Nashville (through Fisk University), and teacher training.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		DLESE-Powered On-Line Classroom stocks STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) pipeline at critical 8th grade junction. It is designed to fulfill standards-based curriculum, endorsed by San Diego County Office of Education, and will be implemented countywide in Phase II. This CODE (COrps DEvelopment) STEM concept can be used to deliver other content, fulfilling mandatory NASA outreach requirements (typically several percent of research budget). NASA spends approximately at 450-million dollars/year on outreach and we aspire to capture 1% of the market in CODE STEM Outreach Products.

		DLESE-Powered On-Line Classroom stocks STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) pipeline at the critical 8th grade junction. It is designed to fulfill standards-based curriculum, endorsed by the San Diego County Office of Education, and will be implemented countywide in Phase II. The CODE (COrps DEvelopment) STEM concept can be used to deliver other content, fulfilling mandatory NSF and DoE outreach requirements (typically several percent of research budget). NSF and DoE spend over a billion dollars/year on outreach and we aspire to capture 1% of the market in CODE STEM Outreach Products.

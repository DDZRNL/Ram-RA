		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		In the proposed Phase I program, Busek Co. will demonstrate an innovative methodology for clustering Hall thrusters into a high performance, very high power propulsion system.  The concept uses multiple thruster discharge assemblies with a common (shared) magnetic structure.  The concept combines the benefits of clustering that include modularity, reliability, reduced beam divergence and throttleability with the cost, mass savings and power loss reduction of a shared magnetic structure.  In Phase I, Busek will conduct a sub-scale demonstration of a shared magnetics cluster based on our existing BHT-600 (nominally 600 W input power) Hall thruster.<BR><BR>A methodology for shared magnetics clustering will be developed that can be applied to the full range of Hall thruster power requirements (100 kW ? 1 MW) envisioned by NASA for obit insertion, planetary transfers and manned exploration.  In Phase II a 200 ? 400 kW shared magnetics thruster based on NASA's existing high power Hall thruster technology will be designed and built.<BR><BR>Busek is uniquely positioned to implement the proposed program having expertise in both the clustering of Hall thrusters and shared magnetics thruster development.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The cluster will enable cargo and propellant transport, pre-positioning missions for lunar and Mars exploration, and enable a reusable orbital tug.  The cluster's redundancy is a benefit over a single, large thruster.<BR>Moreover, the cluster can be throttled to run at high Isp or high T/P and can grow or shrink to fit different missions.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		As communication satellites evolve to use all electric propulsion, there is a need for larger power thrusters for orbit raising. The shared magnetic Hall thruster clusters, in principle, can be applied across the spectrum of thruster sizes.   The Air Force anticipates a need for very high clusters of Hall thrusters in the 100kW to 150kW range for orbit transfer vehicles, space tugs, and re-supply vessels.<BR><BR>

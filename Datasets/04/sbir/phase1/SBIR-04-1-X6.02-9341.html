		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The hot structures for current space vehicles require an atmospheric entry thermal protection system.  Reusable hot structures that can function without requiring any atmospheric entry thermal protection system for space vehicle would constitute a paradigm.  A high temperature stable fiber reinforcement and a ceramic material that exhibits atmospheric entry thermal stability can be combined into a composite which possess the mechanical properties to serve as a reusable hot structure that can function without any atmospheric entry thermal protection system.  This unique and new ceramic matrix composite (CMC) will be developed and characterized to demonstrate it can meet the requirements of a reusable hot structure for space vehicles which can operate without any atmospheric entry thermal protection system and optimized samples will be delivered for more detailed testing at NASA<BR><BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The application for a very high temperature CMC which can operate without a protective coating system include all types of space vehicles, aerospace systems, defense systems, gas turbines for aircraft and land base, chemical and slurry process system, molten metal transfer and general high temperature commercial applications.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Virtually every aerospace system, missile system, defense systems, hot gas turbine engines, land base turbines and high temperature commercial systems operating above the use temperature of superalloys, and even then, some replacements because of the low density of 3.2g/cc will have application of this SiC/sialon composite that doe not require a thermal protection system.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		ZIN Technologies in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic Foundation will use their combined experience and research and development expertise to develop a new compact ambulatory biometric data system for space and commercial terrestrial use.  This design will improve on the existing design onboard the International Space Station and other available systems by increasing the system resolution from 12 to 24 bits, reducing the weight by 40%, decreasing the overall volume by 70%, increasing usability, extending the dynamic range of biological signals that can be recorded, increasing on-board memory capacity, and providing additional instantaneous feedback to users through an extended local processing capability.  Data will be acquired through a cell phone sized unit possibly attached to a subjects belt loop.  Data is transmitted wirelessly to a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) where it can be accessed and viewed by the subject.  Data will also be wirelessly transmitted to a processing unit for real-time transmission to ground.  When out of range of the processing unit, data will be stored onboard the monitoring device for later transmission.  The design will allow for real time data streaming to ground stations and easy accessible viewing of metrics by astronauts on-orbit (or medical subjects terrestrially).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Numerous NASA applications exist.  Of course the most obvious application is support of health monitoring on human space flight and exploration missions.  Additionally, numerous opportunities exist in support of ground based investigations that may or may not be directly related to human space flight. This includes baseline monitoring of astronauts health, health monitoring during strenuous training procedures, on-ground evaluation of physical training techniques and muscle/bone loss countermeasures.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The availability of an economical, user-friendly device such as the one proposed here could open new directions for the study of many biological processes and offer clinicians the opportunity to monitor aspects of their patients' health that are not currently accessible.  Among the applications contemplated are: feature detection and alert generation for electrocardiograms; long duration analysis of electromyograms; home-based sleep disorder analysis via EEG; seizure detection and alert generation via EEG; analysis of limb loading and joint motion after joint replacement surgery; Analysis of respiration data; physiological monitoring such as continuous blood glucose recording.

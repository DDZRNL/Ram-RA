		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent software agent technologies are key and revolutionary technologies that are needed to fulfill spacecraft autonomy and robustness operations capabilities and functions. The Distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent spacecraft autonomy and robustness system integrates real time control and health monitoring with planning and scheduling to achieve the long-term mission objectives. This project develops the Distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent software agents consisting of automation in multi levels, knowledge base, inference mechanism, and communication. The proposed Distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent software agents for operations assistant takes advantage of innovative techniques of individual decision and control methodologies and emphasizes the synergism among all subsystems to assure the overall system performance. At the end of the project, a demonstration system will be established to evaluate the proposed software system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The NASA would directly benefit from this research effort by acquiring the novel Distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent software agents for unmanned vehicle autonomy. Our software agent design technique as well as the software product can apply to manufacturing, precision machine tools, process control, engine control and automation applications, including automobile and commercial aircraft manufacturing, robotics, flight controls, smart highway systems, etc.  
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The results of this project lead to the commercialized product: Distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Software Agents for Unmanned Vehicle Autonomy. The applications of this technology arise in all areas of manufacturing systems, unmanned vehicles, Distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent vehicle highway systems, industrial processes, and command, control, communications and intelligence (C3I) systems.

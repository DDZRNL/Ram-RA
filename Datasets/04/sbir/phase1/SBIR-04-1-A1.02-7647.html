		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This proposal presents a dual approach to the development and certification of an alternative system for ice protection of turbine engine inlets.  It combines a new generation low power ice protection system with a novel path to certification that is based upon requirements that turbine engines be capable of operation in a hail environment.  Eliminated are requirements for high voltages and currents characteristic of all previous impulsive or expulsive deicing systems.  It is postulated that if the engine can operate safely in the hail environment as defined by the FARs, then it can be expected to operate safely and economically in the presence of particles shed by the deicer which are demonstrably smaller and less hazardous than hail. Such a system presents a viable alternative to the use of hot air ice protection systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The system proposed is a viable alternative to bleed air ice protection for engine inlets.  NASA has a national objective an overall improvement in the safety of aircraft operation.  Protection of aircraft from exposure to icing environment is included in that charter.  One of the most important trades involved in the development of icing conditions is between energy and icing performance.  This trade has been shown that it can be addressed by the use of low power ice protection systems on lifting surfaces.  It remains to apply these principles to engine inlets. This is the commercial promise of this system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The system proposed is a viable alternative to bleed air ice protection for engine inlets.  It should find wide application on turbine powered aircraft that are designed to achieve even greater efficiency of operation through the use of exclusively electrically powered systems, including ice protection.  This "all electric airplane" concept has been under consideration for many years by NASA and other industry organizations.  Indications gained from public disclosures by companies, especially Boeing, of the elimination of bleed air as a means of ice protection are firm indications of the intent to develop new technologies in support of more efficient aircraft.

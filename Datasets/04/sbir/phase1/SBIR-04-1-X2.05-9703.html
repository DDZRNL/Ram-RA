		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		VPT proposes an innovative concept whereby complex, multiple-output, DC-DC converter systems can be configured through use of only 2 standard product hybrid DC-DC Converter modules.  The key module attributes that make this feasible are: programmable output, parallel current-sharing capability, synchronization capability, dual (plus and minus) output voltage, 500V input-output-case isolation, external shutdown, total dose and single event effects radiation hardening, and ability to be element evaluated, screened, and qualified to MIL PRF 38534 Class K (space flight) standards.  Once these attributes are satisfied, it is shown that highly complex systems can be designed and delivered with a minimum of nonrecurring engineering.  This includes 28V or 100V input systems, low voltage and higher voltage outputs, and highly varying output power.  The system allows output series operation for increased output voltage, as well as input series operation to accommodate increased input voltages.  This is all accomplished without the need of a centralized controller.  This confines most of the common failure modes to graceful degradation as opposed to catastrophic shut down.  In Phase I, it is demonstrated that a complex, multiple output system, 100Vin, 1KW system is configured with multiple 100W, 28V input modules.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The modular power system concept proposed offers to significantly reduce cost and schedule for a wide variety of NASA power converter applications such as lunar mission, Solar Dynamics Observatory, Jupiter Icy Moon Orbiter (JIMO), and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The concept is also applicable to a wide range of commercial and government spacecraft, most notably the GPS satellite system.

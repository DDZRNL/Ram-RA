		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		NASA's future space science missions cannot be realized without the state of the art high temperature insulation materials of which higher working temperature, high reliability, and low cost are highly desired. T/J Technologies proposes to develop a high temperature, durable, readily processable electrical insulation materials.  The key element of our approach is the development and demonstration, in a breadboard configuration, the feasibility of a new high temperature polymeric composite material based on organic-inorganic nanocomposites with tailored structure and composition that will dramatically increase the Glass Transition Temperature and working temperature of the host polymer, polyimides. Future work of this proposed research, during phase II, will be mainly focused on developing all the associated technologies. The development of high working temperature, durable, radiation resistant electrical insulation materials is important for on-board propulsion and power systems for manned and unmanned deep space missions within NASA as well as electrical and microelectronic industries for applications such as capacitors, electric motors, circuit-printing films, semiconductor coating, etc.

		For this program, we are seeking to directly address the market needs of NASA for high temperature insulation materials that are durable for soft x-ray, electron, proton, and ultraviolet radiation and thermal cycling environments, lightweight electromagnetic interference shielding, and high-performance, environmentally durable thermal control surfaces. Based on the unique nano-reinforcement mechanism, the proposed high temperature insulation material will possess superior thermal mechanical properties and will meet all the requirements for NASA's manned and unmanned deep space missions.

		The proposed composite material may find its use in the electrical and microelectronic industries for applications such as capacitors, electric motors, circuit-printing films, semiconductor coating, etc. The proposed composite materials may also be used as a new class of high performance engineering plastics.

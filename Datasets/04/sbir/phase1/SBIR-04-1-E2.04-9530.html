		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
			This proposed Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I addresses the development of advanced gel propellants and determination of their suitability for selected applications.  Currently, propellant gels consist of fuel (or oxidizer) combined with a polymeric gellant such as a cellulose derivative and suspended aluminum (or silica) particles.  However, higher specific impulse and density specific impulse, more efficient (i.e., finer) spray formation, and reduced pumping requirements are desired so that formulations incorporating combustible particulate species (solid additive and particulate gellant, which, ideally would be the same) are sought.  Phase I will consider a matrix of formulations drawn from various highly combustible solid nanoparticulate species and additives.  Properties (density and Isp) of various formulations will be calculated.  Formulations with the desired calculated Isp will be prepared and measurements of surface tension between various system components performed.  Rheological properties of the resulting gels will be measured and the flow and spray characteristics of candidate formulations evaluated.  Finally, initial testing of preferred gel systems arising from Phase I will be conducted.  Phase II will consist of extensive testing of preferred propellant formulations and determination of their suitability for various applications.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
			Successful completion of the proposed program will lead to formulation and characterization of advanced gel propellants for a number of applications, including those for thrust and maneuvering.  The technology will enhance Isp, increase density, and reduce sloshing in a variety of liquid propellants.  Application to toxic propellants will reduce safety and environmental concerns as well.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
			The technology would attract interest from companies involved in fuel and propulsion manufacture.  Additionally, the use of nanoparticles in other applications such as fluid properties modification are conceivable.  The use of the propellants in APUs for aircraft or ballast blowing in ships are other potential applications.<BR>

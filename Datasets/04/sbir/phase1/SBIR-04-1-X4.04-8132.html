		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		American Remote Vision Company (ARVC) will research and develop a novel new type of non-pyrotechnic latch and release system for use in servicing umbilical applications (as well as an enormous range of other aerospace and commercial applications). This device (whose starting point is the ancient "chinese fingercuff") will be a robust, reliable, reusable latch; scalable over many orders of magnitude in size and load; capable of gripping or releasing in milliseconds; and useful in lunar regolith environment. The concept has already been proved at the 1,000 pound level. We will develop the theory of operation in grab, hold, and release modes (and maybe failure modes). We will build prototypes and test them to verify the math models.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This non-pyro latch and release mechanism has an almost universal application in all of aerospace. It can certainly replace explosive fasteners. (In some applications it can replace fasteners.) It can be used for workholders and collets in industrial applications. It can be used for robotic grippers and grapplers. It will certainly be an important part of any future umbilical design, because you have to hold the umbilical carrier plates together and release them reliably. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This cyclable reliable, and reusable latch has almost universal application in ordinary industry and in weapons. In manufacturing it can replace many workholders and collets. In defense, it can hold missiles and bombs to their launch platforms. It can be made an integral part of many quick-disconnect systems.

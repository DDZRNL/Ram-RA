		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Space Micro Inc. proposes to develop an innovative Turbo-Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Modulation (TC-OFDM) ASIC device.  The proposed device provides data transmission at very high data rates (1 ? 10 Gbps), with high bandwidth efficiency (up to 8 bps/Hz), and with excellent bit error rate (BER) performance at signal-to-noise ratios approaching Shannon's theoretical channel capacity limit.  The TC-OFDM modulator is programmable so that a single ASIC device can support a wide variety of communication links, with different data rates, FEC code rates, and RF channel bandwidths.  The modulator also supports dynamic adaptation of FEC code rate and modulation during operation, to maximize data transmission in systems with time-varying communication link conditions.  The proposed TC-OFDM modulator is radiation hardened for operation on spacecraft and high altitude airborne platforms.  The end result of the proposed SBIR program is innovative TC-OFDM communication link technology and components that will enable greatly increased data transmission rates from space-to-space and space-to-ground, to meet the needs of future NASA earth science missions.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed TC-OFDM modulation scheme will increase the data transmission capacity for NASA's near-earth missions by more than a factor of 10 as compared to existing systems.  The TC-OFDM modulator device that is developed under this SBIR program can be used directly on a variety of future NASA Earth Science platforms, including the next generation TDRSS spacecraft, LEO/MEO earth science satellites, and high altitude airborne platforms such as drones and balloons, as well as manned aircraft.<BR><BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The technology developed under this SBIR is directly applicable to other commercial systems, including: very high data rate telemetry systems (both line-of-sight and space-based), line-of-sight microwave links for telecommunications, and foreign government space systems.  There are also non-NASA applications in the U.S. Government DoD, including the transformational satellite (TSAT) RF downlinks, and data transmission from other reconnaisance satellites and aircraft.<BR><BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The work proposed herein would establish a concurrent design environment that enables aerospace hardware designers to rapidly determine optimum risk-constrained designs subject to multiple uncertainties in applied loads, material properties, and manufacturing processes. This means that the design process no longer would consist of a sequence of separate code invocations to: (1) obtain the geometry model, (2) determine the various loads, (3) determine performance, (4) perform a structural analysis, (5) perform design optimization, and (6) perform a probabilistic risk assessment. Instead, all of these functions would be automatically incorporated into a single framework using existing physics-based deterministic modeling codes and a set of computer-generated data transfer interfaces.  Thus, a design engineer would be able to rapidly explore the design space to identify the minimum weight design that meets a given reliability constraint ? thereby avoiding both an overly conservative design and a too-risky design. For example, the software tools that implement this innovation could be used to determine the wall thickness of a launch vehicle's external cryogenic propellant tanks exposed to high but uncertain thermal and aerodynamic loads and with a reliability probability of 0.99999.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		A fundamental architectural change in the design process is proposed that could revolutionize the ways many commercial designs are conducted that involve advanced technology and important uncertainties. For example, high-tech applications such as jet engines, central powerplants, artificial hearts, flight-qualified control system actuators, home heat pumps/air conditioners, automotive engines, and avionic circuit boards all require ultra-reliable, minimal-maintenance operation. Some of these operate in uncertain hostile environments and all involve a continuous stream of technical improvements with inherent uncertainties.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		A high efficiency low scatter echelle grating will be developed using a novel technique of multiple diamond shaving cuts. The grating will have mirror surfaces on both faces for high efficiency in high orders. The grating will be manufactured using a 3/4 ton air bearing grating carriage that oscillates at 30 strokes per minute between two non-contact magnetic fields. The groove spacing will be controlled by an interferometer measuring system and feedback system between the optical blank and diamond cutting tool.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		NASA will be able to consider this new technology for applications that demand high efficiency with coarse diffraction gratings. Novel applications that require both sides of the grooves to be highly efficient can also be considered for the first time.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Non-NASA commercial enterprises will also be able to consider this new technology for applications that demand high efficiency with coarse diffraction gratings. Novel applications that require both sides of the grooves to be highly efficient can also be considered for the first time.

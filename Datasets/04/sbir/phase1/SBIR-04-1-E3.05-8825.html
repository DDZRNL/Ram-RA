		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Technologies that support the configuration of sensors and satellites, and allow the reconfiguration or retargeting of sensors in response to user demand or significant events require mechanisms to autonomously understand the type and current state of on-board resources and to re-task these resources in such as way that the system achieves its global objectives. Here we propose the development of an integrated framework for onboard dynamic sensor (re)configuration, discovery and classification of data, based on SensorML (Sensor model language). We also model each satellite as a multi-criteria multi constraint optimization problem to optimize the usage of resources in response to significant events without adversely affecting the normal operations. This is achieved through negotiation among various satellites that have overlapping sensing capabilities so that globally optimal solutions can be found by computing joint plan qualities resulting due to sharing of resources. We propose to use IAI's propriety Cybele agent platform (www.cybelepro.com) that provides capability to model and simulate such complex distributed systems. DIVA a case tool developed by IAI would be employed to design and implement negotiation protocols among satellite agents to demonstrate the collaborative global optimization of autonomous planning process for multi-sensor retargeting.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The immediate NASA application is in integrating sensor configuration and control. A unified framework for sensor definition and discovery along with an intelligent autonomous control mechanism will enable a level of autonomy and dynamic responsiveness in remote satellite based monitoring capabilities. It eliminates the need for intensive manual intervention in the event of sensor failures or significant events by providing sufficient on-board intelligence to dynamically reschedule the resources. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Any resource scheduling and control problem can be addressed by this solution. Of special interest is factory scheduling and planning, decentralized control of autonomous robots, team formation in distributed systems, evolutionary systems such as ecological and natural systems.<BR><BR>

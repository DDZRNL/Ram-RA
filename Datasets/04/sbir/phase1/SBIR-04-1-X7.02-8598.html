		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed research is aimed at investigating a procedure verification and validation toolset, which will allow the engineers who are responsible for developing the on-board procedures to validate early, continuously, collaboratively and in real-time. Currently these engineers are limited to the use of big simulators such as the Space Station Training Facility (SSTF) for the ISS, which is costly to run and requires a scheduling of the facility a long time in advance. The targeted tool would fill the gap between the very limited validation done at their desktop (mainly peer review of the procedure) and the simulator run (where the procedures are tested in the very expensive training environment).<BR>This project has a number of innovative aspects, which will make the work of procedure developers easier and more consistent. Benefits realized from using a desktop based procedure validation toolset include the increase in safety, reduction of training costs, and improvement in procedure delivery time through early detection and resolution of errors.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Use of procedures is pervasive to all NASA organizations, and programs, whether they support on-orbit or ground-based operations, for crew use or as automated procedures, for payloads, sub-systems or for entire spacecrafts. In the coming years, Space Shuttle, International Space Station, and the CEV will continue to depend heavily on complex procedures. Providing these programs with an advanced procedure V&V toolset on the desktop will provide a significant support for shortening the procedure development life cycle. A desktop validation tool has the potential to significantly reduce the number of SSTF runs and the number of procedure defects found during SSTF sessions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The envisioned toolset can be applied to any complex system requiring an operational procedure as it also needs ways to be validated. Desktop based tool support for such system is currently missing. A tool that can be customized to different systems will be useful within DoD organizations using heavy equipment operating procedures, such as airplanes, tanks, transport equipment, or logistics support equipment. In the commercial arena, operational procedures are also being used in a broad range of areas, such as airplane checklist, power plant, refineries, and chemical plants operations. This type of technology can be adapted to these different domains and provide benefits similar to those provided to NASA.<BR>

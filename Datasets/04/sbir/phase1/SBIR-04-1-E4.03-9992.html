		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Wireless technologies are an increasingly attractive means for spatial data, input, manipulation, and distribution. Mobitrum is proposing an innovative Adaptive Wireless Transceiver, which is targeted for NASA's Earth Science applications for field personnel and robotic platforms to interface with various wireless sensor networks, in real time, ingest data sequentially from a variety of input sensors, provide initial field verification of data and distribute the data to various nodes and servers at collection, processing, and decision sites.  This effort addresses important technology gap for interfacing with various wireless sensor networks and transmitting/receiving data over long distances.  This effort will include: (1) Design of the high-level system architecture of the adaptive wireless interface that employs model-based reasoning to achieve a specified level of competence in radio-related domains, (2) Design of the adaptive wireless module, and (3) Develop rules, procedures, software algorithms, and techniques through modeling and simulation for designing an adaptive wireless module.  The proposed enabling technology will provide NASA an effective wireless device for Earth science, data relay, and other situational awareness.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Adaptive transceiver for wireless networked sensors will enable NASA's Earth sciences for spatial data input, manipulation and distribution activities as well as design and engineering collaboration to be more effective. Mobitrum anticipates the following applications that NASA will benefit from the proposed adaptive wireless transceiver technology: 1) Disaster recovery; 2) Field communications device for spatial data input, manipulation and distribution; 3) Sensor, measurement, and field verification applications; 4) Biometric identification applications; 5) Data collaboration and distribution applications; 6) Condition-aware applications; 7) Location-aware applications; and 8) first responders.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The opportunity for adaptive wireless technology lays in future wireless networks and communications. There are tremendous business applications and deployments for cellular 4G networks based on adaptive radios beyond 2004. Mobitrum anticipates the increasing popularity of mobile handhelds including PDA/Cell phones brings with it an exciting opportunities for the adaptive radio, which will serve a key factor to make handhelds deployable throughout heterogeneous wireless networks whether for corporations or for individuals. As a result, "true mobility" is created through the programmable radio bands, hence, more value-added services are deployable and increase revenue to wireless service providers and handheld makers.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The innovations proposed by ResearchSouth are: 1) a robust method to automatically insert high quality anisotropic prismatic (viscous boundary layer) cells into any existing CFD mesh; and 2) a robust unstructured mesh movement method able to handle isotropic (Euler), anisotropic (viscous), and mixed element grids for CFD applications, particularly, CFD-based design optimization. ResearchSouth is proposing to develop efficient, design-oriented application software that will significantly impact the current practice of computational design and analysis of aerospace vehicles. The most overlooked?and arguably the most enabling?technical aspect associated with the rapidly maturing CFD-based design optimization is mesh movement, especially for high Reynolds number viscous flow applications. CFD analysis based on unstructured grid technology is becoming the preferred approach for flow analysis of geometrically complex configurations. However, in the area of mesh movement and viscous mesh generation, the unstructured grid arena has experienced near paralysis for several years. We are proposing research that will provide robust solutions to both of these challenges and, thus, will provide air vehicle designers access to the full potential of unstructured grid technologies for performing design optimization as well as highly efficient "what-if-and-reanalyze" geometric modifications.<BR><BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		NASA applications include design optimization of new access to space vehicles, interface with multi-disciplinary software, and  propulsion system optimization. Our software will add critical functionality to NASA-developed unstructured grid CFD software including the SAMdesign package just delivered by ResearchSouth to NASA Dryden.  Since our proposed mesh methods are also applicable to structural finite element analyses, the various multidisciplinary analysis and optimization efforts at NASA can also use this meshing software. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		No commercial software currently exists that reliably and robustly handles unstructured mesh movement. The potential market for our software is very broad?our software can be used for fluid applications in the aerodynamic, automotive, biomedical, turbomachinery, and hydroelectric fields as well as for structural and electromagnetic applications. Each of these markets can immensely benefit from design optimization, provided that unstructured mesh movement and viscous mesh generation are no longer impediments.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

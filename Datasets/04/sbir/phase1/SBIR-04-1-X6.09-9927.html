		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Mobitrum is proposing to develop a broadband wireless device for real-time data acquisition and monitoring applicable to the field instrumentation and control systems associated with ground testing facilities. This effort is targeted for data management and intelligent sensor fusion across local and mobile computational platforms for real-time graphical representation and methods for collaborative distribution, efficient storage, and archival. This effort will include (1) Design of the wireless device to maximize the capability of the rocket engine ground testing and safety assurance that include: power consumption, reliability, performance, data rate, throughput, signal coverage, security, configurability, portability, and cost; (2) Design of the wireless device architecture including network topologies, user's query language, data representations and formats, communication modules, low-level device driver,  fault tolerance, portability, and performance; and (3) Specify smart agents for rules, procedures, software algorithms, and techniques for designing a high-speed wireless portal system.  Smart agents will increase the capability of the data acquisition and health monitoring from remote access and increases the safety. This proposed enabling technology will provide NASA a cost-effective and high-speed tool for collaborative data management and distribution, sensing and monitoring, and other situational awareness such as testing infrastructure and facilities.

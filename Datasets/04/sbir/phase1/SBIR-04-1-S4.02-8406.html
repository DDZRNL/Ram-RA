		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The innovation in this Phase I project is to prove the feasibility of using model-based design (MBD) tools to predict the performance and useful life of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components and COTS-based systems outside of their rated temperature range. These tools will consist of novel modeling tools, advanced system and data analysis capability. The modeling tools will differ from all known technologies in that they will facilitate the capture of experimental data on COTS devices that will get automatically transformed through novel modeling methods into newly created behavioral models with performance degradation and lifetime effects. These tools are relevant and important in providing NASA the means to quantify the reliability and lifetime (i.e., capability and risk) of COTS components and COTS-based systems and provide a trade structure for the assessment of competing technologies. Furthermore, these novel modeling and design tools will provide a means of integrating disparate models, allow agile evolution of models, and encourage MBD reporting mechanisms be used in reviews. Ultimately, these MBD tools will enable lower-cost system development and cost versus lifetime assessment, shorten development time, and extend flight-proven technology to broader applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The potential NASA applications include all manned and unmanned vehicles<BR>that involve electronics (COTS-based or not). The tools being developed at<BR>Lynguent will offer a consistent approach to modeling, simulation and data<BR>management, test bench development, archival of test and simulation data<BR>along with the models used for design, and specification management. The<BR>API-based approach will enable this collaborative design environment to be<BR>used for modeling and design debugging in all of the commercially available<BR>tool flows. Thus, as a 3rd party add-on tool suite, these tools will apply<BR>to electronics and mixed-technology systems that go onboard all NASA<BR>vehicles.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Lynguent's tools are designed to be more mainstream than simply extreme<BR>environments. Since these tools are based on hardware description languages,<BR>they are applicable to any discipline (electrical, mechanical, hydraulic)<BR>where models can be expressed in terms of differential, algebraic equations.<BR>Event-driven phenomena can be modeled and simulated (i.e., digital or analog<BR>event-driven). The mix of these disciplines is also possible (i.e.,<BR>mixed-technology). So, among the non-NASA applications are any<BR>electronics-based design involving analog, digital, mixed-signal electronics<BR>as well as mixed-technology systems such as MEMS. This is an incredibly<BR>broad market spanning the transportation and semiconductor industries and<BR>military applications.<BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		      Cornerstone Research Group inc. (CRG) proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of a lightweight, deployable Veritex <SUP>TM</SUP> supporting annulus structure to support large radio frequency (RF) antennas.  Veritex<SUP>TM</SUP> composites are similar to other high-performance composites, with the exception that CRG's shape memory polymer (SMP) resin, Veriflex<SUP>TM</SUP>, is used as the matrix resin. This allows for easy manipulation of the composite above the activation temperature, making it a unique material for use in dynamic structures and other applications requiring both load strength and "shape-shifting" modulus flexibility. In this Phase I program, CRG will develop and evaluate materials and related fabrication technologies based on Veritex<SUP>TM</SUP>, and develop a deployment scheme with built-in redundancy.  This technical approach fulfills NASA's requirement for a very large, lightweight, on-orbit deployable RF antenna aperture structure by offering a practical, deployable, structural support that will address the short comings of current rigidized inflatable structures.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		       Supporting NASA's Earth Science Enterprise, this project's technologies directly address requirements for inexpensive, lightweight, highly compact launch configurations, and reliable precise deployment for thin-film space-based RF antennas.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		       This project's technologies developed for NASA systems would directly apply to systems operated by other government and commercial enterprises.<BR>       Government systems that would derive the same benefits would include but not be limited to space-based sensor and communication systems operated by Department of Defense.<BR>       This technology's attributes for deployable antennas should yield a high potential for private sector commercialization for RF applications by Ball Aerospace and Technologies has documented their interest in this commercialization opportunity (see letter of support on page 25).<BR>       Deployable Veritex(TM)tubes may also be useful for terrestrial structures in disaster areas such as shelters and bridges.<BR>

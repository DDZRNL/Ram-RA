<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
American remote Vision  Company (ARVC) will continue to research and develop a new non-pryotechnic latch and release sytem for use in servicing and flight release applications, among others. We have built and demostrated  prototypes from the 20 pound range to the 2000 pound range.  The devices are force multipliers, where the force increases linearly with initial grip force, and exponentially with overall grip length. The prototypes are of two basic varieties (a) linear basket "fingercuff" grippers with actuation mechanisms, and (b) rotational grippers with actuation mechanisms. We have invented a method to precisely control both versions, for controlled release applications. The devices are simple, reliable, inherently reusable, nonfouling, and fault tolerant.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
This non-pyrotechnic latch and  release mechanism has an almost universal applicaqtion in all of aerospace. It can certainly replace explosive fasteners in many applications. It can be used for workholding and tool holding in manufacturing applications. It can be used for robootic grippers and grapplers. It will certainly be an important component in future umbilical and umbilical carrier design, for its reusability and reconnection capability.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
This cyclable, reliable, reusable latch and release device has almost universal application in ordinary industry and in weapons. In manufacturing, it can replace workholders, tool holders, and collets. In defense it can be used for boomb and missile release systems. It can be made an integral part of many quick-disconnect systems.

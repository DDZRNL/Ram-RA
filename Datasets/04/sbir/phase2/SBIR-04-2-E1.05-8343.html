<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Remote Sensing Solutions, Inc. (RSS) has developed a novel, practical design that will produce a low-cost precipitation radar / radiometer sensor. Operating in a stand-alone mode or in a network configuration, this system will provide the measurements critical to the NASA Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) calibration / validation efforts. With its unique ability to acquire simultaneous dual polarized, dual wavelength, active and passive measurements, this instrument will be capable of providing NASA and the research community with unique data that will significantly further research in the areas of precipitation rate and particle size retrievals. By utilizing solid-state technology and an innovative pulse compression scheme, the sensor can be built at a fraction of the cost of conventional precipitation radar while still maintaining the required sensitivity. The proposed Phase II effort will focus on developing and demonstrating the performance of two key innovations: the dual polarized, dual wavelength wideband antenna feed and transceiver.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed novel low-cost scanning DPR sensor network system will support GPM efforts by providing an essential and unprecedented data set to validate and improve GPM retrieval algorithms and aide in calibration/validation studies. Deployed at the GPM super sites and elsewhere, it will provide direct and statistical comparisons with horizontal scanning radars, such as S-Pol, Chill and other systems, such that the new data from the DPR radars, either stand-alone or in networked configuration, can augment that of the established lower frequency radars.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
RSS has identified the rapidly growing deployment of commercial Doppler radars for use by television station weather forecasters as a primary target market for use of this DPR system. Doppler systems solely provide reflectivity maps, whereas the DPR system will be capable of adding accurate precipitation rates, phase detection and wind speed information. With Doppler radar systems from companies such as Baron Services starting at $300k and approaching $1M, the DPR is an attractive option at approximately $200-250K.
<br>
<br>Additionally, the DPR will enable many research institutions, such as universities, government and private sector research labs, to advance their efforts in the areas of precipitation studies, weather forecasting and long-term climate forecasting while fitting within their budgets. With billions of dollars being spent on weather products and forecasting, this unique and low-cost sensor network will improve local QPE measurements and forecasts.

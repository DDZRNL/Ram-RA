<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
One of the highest priorities of a regenerative life support system for manned space missions (to the Moon, Mars, and other remote locations) is to recover and process wastewater to provide clean water. Among detectors used to monitor recycled water quality, a total organic carbon (TOC) instrument must be used to assess the organic contaminant level. Available TOC instruments have major limitations for space missions: they need periodic resupply of reagents and water; thus, storage of toxic chemicals and crew time for maintenance are required. The aim of this project is to develop a novel Total Organic Carbon Analyzer (TOCA) for real-time monitoring of water quality. It will be designed with an operational lifetime of 5 years with no maintenance required and no need to supply reagents or water. During the Phase I, Lynntech designed, fabricated, and successfully tested both critical components of TOCA and a breadboard TOCA. Testing included ersatz reverse osmosis permeate water. Requirements for TOC range (0.25 to 50 ppm) and accuracy (? 25% above 1 ppm and ?0.25 ppm below 1 ppm) were met. During Phase II, an optimized, precise, reliable, flight qualifiable, microgravity compatible TOCA prototype will be designed, fabricated, tested, and delivered to NASA.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed instrument will find application in NASA's regenerative life support systems on-board spacecrafts, space station, and future lunar and planetary habitats. One of the highest priorities of a regenerative life support system is to recover and process spacecraft wastewater to provide clean water, which is essential for the crew well being and the success of manned space missions. The proposed technology will provide real time monitoring of water quality by indicating the level of organic contaminants in the recycled water. It will solve key issues needed for manned space missions: no need to supply chemicals or water; need for chemical storage, dilution and dosage are eliminated; no crew maintenance time is required; low equivalent system mass; and use of small water volumes.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed technology has immediate commercial applications in many areas where the water quality control is essential, e.g., environmental monitoring, pharmaceutical industries, semiconductor industries, medical diagnostics, laboratory instrumentation, food and drink industries, hospitals, etc.

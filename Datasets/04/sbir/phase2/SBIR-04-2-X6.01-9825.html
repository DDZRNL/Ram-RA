<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
ASRI proposes to develop an advanced and commercially viable Non-Intrusive Vibration Monitoring System (NI-VMS) which can provide effective on-line/off-line engine vibration monitoring capabilities without relying on intrusive key-phasor speed measurements.  Many powerful vibration signature analysis techniques for engine-health monitoring rely on key-phasor signals to extract/enhance critical fault signatures from noisy vibration measurements.  In many situations (e.g. SSME HPOTP), such speed measurements are not available, usually due to the safety concerns of a key-phasor's intrusive installation (e.g.in a high-pressure liquid-oxygen environment for HPOTP).   As a result, the ability/reliability for health monitoring and post-test diagnostic evaluation is severely limited.  The proposed NI-VMS overcomes this problem by utilizing a novel signal analysis technique called Pseudo Key Phasor (PKP) to reconstruct a PKP signal directly from external vibration measurements.  This procedure enables powerful signal analyses that require a key phasor to become applicable, greatly enhancing fault detection and diagnostic capabilities.   NI-VMS can reduce the risks of catastrophic engine failure and improve the reliability of NASA's current/future propulsion systems.  Phase I feasibility studies using SSME test data have successfully demonstrated the technical merits of NI-VMS.  Phase II will complete design, development, and testing of the prototype NI-VMS hardware/software system.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Successful development of NI-VMS can provide enhanced diagnostic evaluation capabilities for NASA's current SSME as demonstrated through several HOPTP anomaly investigation activities related to the Space Shuttle return to flight. For NASA's future propulsion systems development, when intrusive key-phasor instrumentation is not feasible, NI-VMS offers a valuable alternative to meet the health-monitoring requirement.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
NI-VMS has significant applications in commercial/DoD transportation, power generation industries, and the manufacturing sector where many aircraft/plant engines/machinery are not instrumented with key phasor due to safety/cost concerns. NI-VMS's unique capability in performing non-intrusive monitoring will exert a strong appeal for these industries to use it to meet industrial and commercial health-monitoring requirements in reducing the risks of catastrophic hardware losses and plant downtime.  Benefits to U.S. industry will be realized through contributions to safer aircraft/spacecraft propulsion, more efficient power generation, reduced downtime, and reduced operation and maintenance costs.

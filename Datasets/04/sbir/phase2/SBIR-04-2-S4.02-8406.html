<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The innovation in this project is model-based design (MBD) tools for predicting the performance and useful life of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components and COTS-based systems beyond their rated temperature range. Phase I results have shown the feasibility of these tools, which consist of novel modeling tools and advanced system and data analysis capability. The modeling tools differ from all known technologies in that they facilitate the capture of experimental data on COTS devices that get automatically transformed through novel modeling methods into newly created behavioral models with performance degradation and lifetime effects. These tools are relevant and important in providing NASA the means to quantify the reliability and lifetime (i.e., capability and risk) of COTS components and COTS-based systems and provide a trade structure for the assessment of competing technologies. Furthermore, these modeling and design tools provide a means of integrating disparate models, allow agile evolution of models, and encourage MBD reporting mechanisms be used in reviews. Ultimately, these MBD tools will enable lower-cost system development and cost versus lifetime assessment, shorten development time, and extend flight-proven technology to broader applications. Lynguent plans to develop MBD tools based on its Phase I feasibility study and to utilize a high temperature testbed (DC-DC converter) as a case study to demonstrate a calibration methodology for the tools to insure accuracy with respect to accelerated testing results. This calibration methodology will be developed in consultation with leading experts in the field of reliability modeling and high temperature measurements of electronics and packaging.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The potential NASA applications include all manned and unmanned vehicles that involve electronics (COTS-based or not). The tools being developed at Lynguent will offer a consistent approach to modeling, simulation and data management, test bench development, archival of test and simulation data along with the models used for design, and specification management. The Lyngo collaborative design environment will be new capability for modeling and design debugging in multiple commercially available tool flows. Thus, as a third party add-on tool suite, these tools will apply to electronics and mixed-technology systems that go onboard all NASA vehicles. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Lynguent's tools(ModLyng and Lyngo) are designed to be more mainstream than simply extreme environments. Since these tools are based on hardware description languages, they are applicable to any discipline (electrical, mechanical, hydraulic) where models can be expressed in terms of differential, algebraic equations. Event-driven phenomena can be modeled and simulated (i.e., digital or analog event-driven). The mix of these disciplines is also possible (i.e., mixed-technology). So, among the non-NASA applications are any electronics-based design involving analog, digital, mixed-signal electronics as well as mixed-technology systems such as MEMS. This is a very broad market spanning military and commercial applications, including transportation, medical electronics, semiconductor, and consumer product segments.

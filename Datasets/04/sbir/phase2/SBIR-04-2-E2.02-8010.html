<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Communications applications are strategically moving toward Internet Protocol-based architectures and technologies. Despite IP's huge potential, (e.g. cost effectiveness, reduced development and installation times), it has not proved to be appropriate for space communication applications. IP-based space networking links exhibit poor performance induced by narrow bandwidth, long propagation loops, large transmission errors, and/or intermittent connectivity. In Phase I, Broadata Communications, Inc. (BCI) successfully designed a preliminary network protocol technology to overcome these problems. BCI's innovative Universal Space IP Transparent Proxy (USIT) achieves accurate network measurements and reconfigurations, providing a 10 times, on average, improvement in network throughput, as compared to existing state-of-the-art IP solutions. In addition, the USIT solution is transparent (thus independent of any network functions such as compression) and is seamless (i.e., works with non-USIT network hosts/nodes).  Its simplicity will enable it to be placed in a variety of Earth network nodes, ensuring its compatibility with, and ability to improve, network performance in space. In Phase II, BCI will optimize the system's design to develop a full-scale highly optimized system, including two tangible prototypes: a portable space-qualified USIT software package, compatible with existing NASA space network nodes, and, a rack-mountable stand-alone GSSL embedded system, with both hardware and software.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
BCI's system is applicable to Command and Data Handling for ES missions, and, can generically support IP use in many other NASA missions. Examples are IONET, direct line-of-sight near-earth satellite communications, TDRSS, DSN, beyond Earth multi-hop/relay communications. The USIT is particularly useful for networks that are characterized as "Long Fat Pipes" (LFNs).<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
In addition to NASA applications, USIT is applicable to many commercial networking scenarios, with similar problems. Examples are wireless Internet access networks, RF trunking links, commercial satellite networks, mobile enterprise networking, and packet-based cellular networks.   BCI's modular USIT design also will enable it to enhance performance in different types of access networks, including 802.11 Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, WiMax, etc.

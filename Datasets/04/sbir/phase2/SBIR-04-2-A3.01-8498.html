<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
This effort undertook the creation of a Surface Operations Data Analysis and Adaptation (SODAA) tool to store data relevant to airport surface research and facilitate searching, visualizing, and analyzing that data, with the goal of improving understanding of airport surface operations.  Data mining capabilities will, for example, support research of taxi routing and departure sequencing strategies used by air traffic controllers.  The SODAA tool will reduce the time and cost required to build and maintain Surface Management System (SMS) adaptations.  Finally, the SODAA tool will facilitate benefits and other studies by readily providing large sets of data without each researcher needing to separately collect appropriate data.  In Phase 1, we designed and built a portion of the envisioned SODAA database as well as a limited visualization tool that, after Phase 2, will allow users to query the database and view the results in a variety of different formats.  In addition, users will be able to add new analysis capabilities by creating plug-in modules.  In addition, we conducted a variety of analyses of SMS data, providing insight into surface operations.  Finally, we identified which SMS adaptation files could be developed using the SODAA tool.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The significant costs of aviation delays and the opportunity to reduce such delays through this effort result in a strong market for the SODAA technology. The application of this work at NASA can be grouped into two categories: supporting the development of airport adaptations for surface automation systems and supporting fundamental understanding of surface operations and traffic management.  In addition, SODAA provides a repository for data that may be used in other NASA projects.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Non-NASA applications include use of SODAA by the FAA, air carriers and airport authorities, and other (e.g., university) researchers.  The FAA will use the SODAA tool in the same ways as NASA, both to support developing and maintaining airport adaptations for automation systems that include an airport surface component and to gain fundamental insight into current operations.  Air carriers will use SODAA or Mosaic ATM's services leveraging SODAA to improve efficiencies in their operations or planning decisions at hub airports.  Finally, airport authorities have expressed interest in SODAA's data recording capabilities for improving the accuracy of their billing for landing/takeoff operations and noise abatement functions.

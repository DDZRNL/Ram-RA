<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Long duration space missions and extended manned missions on the surface of the moon and Mars are key elements of NASA's new Vision. These missions will require utilization of in situ resources and materials to reduce up-mass and up-volume and for fabricating habitable structures from in situ materials. The overall objective of this Phase II is to design and fabricate an in situ materials processing solar furnace system using the flat panel thin film MPRS concentrator technology successfully developed during Phase I. The capability of this system will be demonstrated by realistically processing lunar regolith simulant into useful product specimens such as fiberglass rods for structural reinforcement and bricks for habitat construction. 
<br>	The technology foundation established in Phase I, which demonstrated unprecedented solar concentrator design and performance versatility, combined with UAT's extensive experience in designing and fabricating thin film concentrators and lightweight deployable structures, provides a sound basis to project that this objective can be achieved.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
MMPRS solar concentrators are applicable to solar furnaces for lunar surface in situ materials processing, space solar thermal propulsion systems, Wireless Power Transfer, thermionic propulsion, and concentrating solar photovoltaic systems.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
This concentrator concept may be used by commercial satellite operators to substantially enhance their design versatility. Terrestrial applications include both photovoltaic and solar thermal commercial and residential heating and cooling systems.

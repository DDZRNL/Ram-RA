<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The innovation combines a new generation low power ice protection system with a novel path to certification that is based upon requirements that turbine engines be capable of operation in a hail environment. Eliminated are requirements for high voltages and currents characteristic of all previous impulsive or expulsive deicing systems. It is postulated that if the engine can operate safely in the hail environment as defined by the FARs, then it can be expected to operate safely and economically in the presence of particles shed by the deicer which are demonstrably smaller and less hazardous than hail. Such a system presents a viable alternative to the use of hot air ice protection systems, and will require a two magnitude lower power.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The system proposed is a viable alternative to bleed air ice protection for engine inlets. The number of NASA applications is not so large as the number of commercial applications. However, NASA has a national objective an overall improvement in the safety of aircraft operation. Protection of aircraft from exposure to icing environment is included in that charter. One of the most important trades involved in the development of icing conditions is between energy and icing performance. This trade has been shown that it can be addressed by the use of low power ice protection systems on lifting surfaces. It remains to apply these principles to engine inlets. This is the commercial promise of this system. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The market for electric powered ice protection is confirmed as a result of recent decisions by major aircraft manufacturers.  Clearly, the movement to replace conventional bleed air ice protection for lifting surfaces is well underway.  Even though the new electro-thermal de-icing systems present improvements in efficiencies of operation, the requirement still exists for use of anti-icing systems on the engine inlets.  The substitution of de-icing systems for anti-icing on engine inlets offers an opportunity for another order of magnitude improvement in the power required to protect engine inlets.   This is possible by the use of a mechanical de-icing system that repeatedly sheds ice particles that are small in comparison to the FAR hail and rain environments to which the engine is qualified.
<br>
<br>The use of a de-icing system as a means of protecting not only lifting and stabilizing surfaces but engine inlets as well will result in overall operating efficiencies beyond any improvement offered to date.

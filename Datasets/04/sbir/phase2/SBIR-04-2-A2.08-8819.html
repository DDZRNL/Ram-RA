<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
ZONA Technology (ZONA) proposes to develop an enhanced model updating nonlinear system identification (MUNSID) methodology that utilizes flight data with state-of-the-art control oriented techniques.  The MUNSID toolbox augments the current match-point solution approach using the mu-analysis method with identified nonlinear operators.  The procedure calls for a high-fidelity linear aeroelastic model to be tuned quickly with available aeroelastic/aeroservoelastic flight data sets, while block-oriented models are used to highlight the underlying nonlinear structure of the dynamic system.  This framework is capable of accounting for several nonlinearities including those due to aerodynamics, structures, control/actuator, and/or geometry.
<br>
<br>Specifically, this on-line Flutter/LCO predictor can be used to accurately estimate a supercritical LCO case if the global nonlinear dynamic behavior is described throughout a hardening nonlinearity, as well as a more dangerous dynamic behavior, denoted as subcritical LCO, could be developed if a global softening nonlinearity is identified. The devised MUNSID Toolbox will become the flight control engineer's "every day tool" to predict on-line Flutter/LCO phenomena. In Phase II, MUNSID will be updated with fast and computationally efficient routines for system modeling, LFT representation, identification of nonlinearity, estimation of uncertainty, and stability analysis. Deliverables include the MUNSID production software including a GUI, a library of S-functions, and the related user manuals.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Nonlinear identification, modeling and analysis software for aeroservoelastic instability clearance is still non-existent, leading to cautious and expensive flight test procedures.  The proposed toolbox will become a standard analysis package for aeroservoelasticity. NASA/DFRC has been working for many years towards achieving a software package that would predict the onset of AE/ASE instabilities with a high factor of safety for efficient envelope expansion.  The proposed MUNSID toolbox is aimed at providing an expedient on-line prediction capability that integrates with current NASA procedures in the control room.  The methodology for a nonlinear Flutter/LCO predictor tool will complement and enhance the current capability for predicting instabilities during envelope expansion.  The MUNSID Toolbox will be applicable to flutter envelope expansion programs of military, civil transport as well as general aviation aircraft where the design is aeroelastically dominated or the potential exists for aeroelastically induced instabilities.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
ZONA's business plan for this toolbox will follow the existing ZAERO product/service strategy.  The toolbox will be marketed towards the flight test applications on a wide class of aerospace vehicles: (a) USAF's UAV/UCAV, joint-wing sensor craft, (b) Next generation Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) with enhanced control/maneuver capability, (c) DARPA Morphing aircraft program, and (d) Boeing's 787 and executive jet designs of Cessna, Raytheon, etc.  Potential customers for the MUNSID Toolbox include engineers in the automotive industry, developing suspension and powertrain systems, aerodynamic developments for race cars, as well as for nautical engineers doing ship design and analysis, particularly mitigating vibrations and high acoustic noise due to large motors.  Other areas of application include aircraft carrier vibration issues, analysis of power blackout, and in flight dynamics for complex flying control systems for manned and UAV.  It will be a powerful tool for the aerospace industry performing health management within the health monitoring of flexible extraterrestrial vehicles and in vibration analysis for large solar panels and/or antennas in satellites.  In addition, the MUNSID toolbox is envisioned as a diagnostic measure technology for the neural control of the cardiovascular system in humans.

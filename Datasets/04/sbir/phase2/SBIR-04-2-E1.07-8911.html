<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
This NASA SBIR Phase II project will produce a flight suitable test bench based on a modular spray-cooled assembly that considers NASA power and mass budgets and can be scaled to cool multiple heat sources producing high heat fluxes under gravity and microgravity conditions.  Thermal management solutions for certain NASA applications like laser diodes are not all that suitable with a need for a better solution.  
<br>
<br>PELS in a NASA SBIR Phase I project developed a modular assembly based on spray cooling under phase change achieving heat fluxes approaching 100 W/cm2 per evaporator using Fluorinert<SUP>TM</SUP>(FC-72) as the cooling liquid.  This was possible because of PELS novel fluid removal approach.
<br>
<br>This Phase II project builds upon the improvements in spray cooling performance by bringing improvements in the packaging to achieve volume and weight gains at the system level so spray cooling can become the standard thermal management solution.
<br>
<br>The terminal objectives of this SBIR Phase II project are (a) To optimize the design of the modular spray-cooled assembly demonstrated in the SBIR Phase I project, and (b) To extend this design to cool multiple heat sources subjected to heat fluxes approaching 200 W/cm2 under microgravity conditions.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The technology developed in this project has numerous potential applications for NASA, which can be broadly classified into the following two groups:
<br>
<br>(1)	Laser diodes
<br>(2)	Modular microwave integrated circuits
<br>(3)	Power amplifiers for T/R modules and transmitters.
<br>(4)	Power modules for energy storage, flywheels, battery chargers, peak power trackers, motor drives, and smart solid-state switches
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The NASA applications are not limited to NASA since most of those applications are also found in many military and commercial applications.  For example, the ambient temperature under the hood in an automobile could be in excess of 100 degrees C.  Silicon-based electronics have a maximum junction temperature of 150 degrees C so traditional cooling systems like heat sinks and cold plate are not suitable because they do not satisfy automotive specifications.  Even if they were suitable, the power densities of these systems are impractical for automotive applications.  Therefore, systems relying on spray cooling under phase change providing higher thermal margins will find many military and commercial applications (e.g., radar systems, avionics systems, dc-dc converters, personal computers, micro-climate coolers, electric motors).

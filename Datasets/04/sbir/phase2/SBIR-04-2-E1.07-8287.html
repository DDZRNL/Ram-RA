<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Advanced instruments used for earth science missions require improved cooling systems to remove heat from high power electronic components and maintain tight temperature control for sensitive instruments. Mesoscopic Devices proposes to develop a pumped two-phase cooling loop that will provide high heat flux, distributed load cooling (> 100 W/cm^2) in a lightweight system. In Phase I, an extremely compact pump optimized for two phase cooling was demonstrated, along with advanced lightweight cold plates. Pump and cold plate advances in Phase II will further reduce the mass and improve reliability.  A complete thermal loop will be constructed and tested to demonstrate the improved pumps and cold plates.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed two-phase pumped loop will enable cooling of multiple distributed loads, decreasing the mass and increasing the sensitivity of advanced instruments for terrestrial, aircraft, balloon and satellite missions. It can be used for cooling instruments, high power electronics, radar, microwave and laser systems. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Two-phase pumped cooling loops are expected to be enabling technology for high-power motor drives, rack-mount computers, advanced workstations, and microwave systems for vacuum deposition. The proposed system could be adapted for cooling phased-array radars, communications and industrial lasers.

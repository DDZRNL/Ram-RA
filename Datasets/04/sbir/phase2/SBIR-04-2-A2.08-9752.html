<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The innovations proposed are twofold: 1) a robust unstructured mesh movement method able to handle isotropic (Euler), anisotropic (viscous), mixed element (hybrid) and generalized polyhedral unstructured grids for CFD applications, particularly, CFD-based design optimization, and 2) a robust method to automatically insert high quality anisotropic prismatic (viscous boundary layer) cells into any existing CFD mesh. All objectives in Phase I were met and all tasks were completed as proposed. The methods worked very well for both 2D and 3D geometries, for tetrahedral, hexahedral, and general polyhedral element types, and for the simple viscous meshes. In Phase II, we will extend the software into a general purpose package for use by NASA, other Government agencies, and commercial customers.  We will implement our 3D viscous mesh generation method including a general solution-adaptive meshing capability. We will develop the software necessary to compute sensitivity derivatives of the mesh operations. Two important software design goals for our final Phase II software are ease-of-use and convenient access to its functionality. We will develop two types of user interfaces: graphical access (for the end-user) and programming access (for integration with flow solvers). We will assemble all of the methods developed in Phase II into a single, coherent, design-oriented, product-version code with extensive focus on incorporating a parallel processing capability into the software.  The verification & validation plan will follow the industry-standard approach now used by commercial software houses and will include an extensive set of NASA-relevant test cases.  The software will be documented and delivered to NASA. The Phase II software has significant potential for commercialization and sales in the non-Government sector.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
This software package is a major improvement in the power and quality of software design tools available and represents an enormous benefit to NASA. The resulting software product is a major advance in the state-of-the-art and will represent the first breakthrough in this technology area in many years.  This will provide NASA with a powerful software tool to perform very efficient and rapid design assessment of evolving next generation space vehicles.  Our software adds critical functionality to unstructured grid CFD software already in use at several NASA Centers including: NASA Dryden's unstructured adaptive-mesh, design optimization code SAMdesign; NASA Langley's design optimization code FUN3D and aeroelasticity code USM3D; and NASA Marshall's generalized mesh CHEM code and combustion code FDNS. Since our new mesh methods are also applicable to structural finite element analyses, the various multidisciplinary analysis and optimization efforts at NASA can benefit from our software. Given the ability to quickly modify and analyze trial geometry configurations, development of revolutionary design concepts will be facilitated.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The following are some of the many Non-NASA commercial applications for the generalized meshing  software. (1) pollution dispersion from stacks of industrial processing plants, (2) design of viscous mixing processes for chemical manufacturing companies, (3) computation of exhaust flow from automobile and bus exhaust systems, (4) design of more efficient internal combustion engines, (5) commercial airplane design for improved fuel economy (6) analysis and design of waste disposal systems, (7) design of air conditioning systems for large buildings, (8) air quality modeling for large-city streets.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
	Several solid waste management systems currently under development result in the production of gas-phase organic contaminants which, due to the periodic and unpredictable nature of solid wastes and contaminants produced by these systems, cannot be treated by the Trace Contaminant Control System.  Two examples of these are the Heat Melt Compaction System under development at NASA - Ames Research Center and the Microwave Powered Solid Waste Stabilization and Water Recovery System under development at UMPQUA Research Company (URC). During the Phase I effort, we demonstrated the gas-phase catalytic oxidation of a variety of toxic organic compounds and carbon monoxide, with very high rates of conversion to innocuous gases, primarily CO2 and H2O, at relatively low temperatures. In the proposed Phase II effort both process and materials will be further refined to optimize the utility of the catalytic technology with respect to solid waste management goals.   The Phase II research and development will result in the design, assembly, rigorous testing, and delivery to NASA of a prototype system, sized to operate in conjunction with both the NASA developed heat melt compaction system and the URC developed microwave waste stabilization and water recovery system.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Flight Hardware for long duration missions such as a Mars transit, Mars base, or permanently manned Lunar outpost.  The gas-phase catalytic oxidation reactor technology may be employed to destroy toxic gases originating from solid waste processing technologies. This will preclude the venting of these gases into the cabin atmosphere and will reduce risk to crewmembers from airborne exposure and also prevent the passage of an excessive contaminant load to the Trace Contaminant Control System (TCCS). . This technology may also find other applications, where high concentrations of toxic gases must be treated to meet the requirements of specific mission scenarios.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
1) Manufacture and sale of catalyst; 2) design and fabrication of small, medium and industrial scale reactors.  Low temperature catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide and volatile organics has the potential for widespread application in pollution control and environmental remediation.  Small-scale systems may be employed at home or in automobiles to destroy cigarette smoke, cooking odors, etc.  Medium scale systems may be used in large buildings to combat 'sick building syndrome'.  Larger scale systems may be incorporated into specific industrial manufacturing and chemical operations to destroy harmful emissions.  Larger scale systems may also be employed to destroy toxic materials contained within hazardous wastes.

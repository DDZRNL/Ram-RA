<P><B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 
words)<BR>ORBITEC proposes to develop a unique Advanced Vortex Hybrid Rocket 
Engine (AVHRE) to achieve a safe, highly-reliable, low-cost and uniquely 
versatile propulsion system. The benefits of AVHRE result from the combination 
of four innovations: (1) the patented vortex injection technique which generates 
a coaxial vortex pair, driving high solid-fuel regression rates and improved 
combustion efficiency; (2) high-regression rate paraffin solid fuels; (3) 
patented regression sensor technology, and (4) a new fuel formulation innovation 
to control the solid fuel regression characteristics and provide improved 
structural integrity of the grain. These innovations simplify hybrid rocket 
design, development, and manufacture both inherently and by providing many 
practical design degrees of freedom that can be harnessed for a given 
application. Specific benefits of the AVHRE technology include: (1) increased 
propellant mass fractions; (2) the ability to tailor and optimize a hybrid 
propulsion system for a given application; (3) increased ISP efficiency; (4) a 
reduction or elimination of residual fuel; (5) improved grain structural 
integrity and increased thermal properties; and (6) reduced need for thermal 
insulation. The Phase II effort will design, develop, and test a 10,000 lbf 
AVHRE-I chamber and a suite of practical AVHRE engineering design tools that 
will be delivered to NASA upon completion of the project. 
<P><B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, 
approximately 150 words)<BR>The AVHRE addresses key design, performance, and 
operational challenges of traditional hybrid rocket engine systems. If 
successful, this would catapult hybrid rocket systems into a highly competitive 
position for many Earth-to-orbit propulsion applications, where their inherent 
safety, simplicity, and low-cost could be competitively harnessed. The AVHRE 
hardware, analysis, and engineering design approaches developed during the Phase 
II program will be useful tools that NASA will benefit from. AVHRE addresses the 
need for high performance, low cost, reliable/safe, and flexible propulsion 
technology required for Earth-to-Orbit (ETO) applications and planetary 
missions. The fuel formulation technology demonstrated during the Phase I AVHRE 
project can also likely be adapted for producing ISRU fuel grains to meet 
Martian and Lunar propulsion needs. 
<P><B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, 
approximately 150 words)<BR>AVHRE is expected to have a competitive position in 
reusable and expendable launch vehicles, sounding rockets, and upper stage 
propulsion systems. A new market is also emerging to provide suborbital launch 
vehicles for space tourists. The AVHRE could play a vital role due to its 
inherent safety and lower development cost. ORBITEC is also closely 
investigating the entertainment markets, including rocket car demonstrations at 
air shows, amusement rides, and model rocketry packages that would use the 
cartridge loaded AVHRE propulsion system. In addition to these applications, 
this new type of vortex combustion may have significant industrial benefits. For 
example, many classes of air-fired combustors can use the vortex combustion 
technology for improved combustion efficiency, potentially reduced emissions, 
and to reduce the required pre-processing.

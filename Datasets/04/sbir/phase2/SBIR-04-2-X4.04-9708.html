<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The Phase II project will advance innovative, cost effective and reliable nano-phase exothermic RCC joining processes (ExoBraze<SUP>TM</SUP>) in order to be able to reinforce or repair of space shuttle or other reentry vehicle TPS structures. MRi, Boeing and NASA-Glen Research Center will be partnering to improve exothermic joining process control,  to develop preforms that can bond RCC panels in a variety of configurations, to increase the joint strength and demonstrate process robustness, to test joints to validate expected service performance and to scale the joining process in order to fabricate demonstrator components for test and validation.  The Phase II effort will look at improved WO3-Al exothermic precursors and develop preform based on polymer bound mats that control the amount of exothermics delivered to the RCC joints. MRi and its partners will develop methods to improve bond strengths through the use of joint prelayers, such as NASA-GRC's GRABER materials or other glass formers. After process improvements are made, MRi and Boeing will, using subcomponents, develop and demonstrate RCC panel repairs, stengthener ribs and panel doublers for as part of its robust RCC efforts. Mechanical and thermal tests will then be designed and conducted to develop more realistic test data on ExoBraze RCC joint performance.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The ExoBraze technology is fabrication technology for joining ore repairing many of the thermal protection systems (TPS) that exist or are being developed. For example, as a means to repair and add reinforcements to the LE panels to the Space Shuttle and/or on NASA's future Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV0. Additionally.,  ExoBraze joining may  find wide use as a tool for TPS construction in every type of NASA spacecraft and as a tool for remote assembly in space where welding could not be accomplished. Finally, nano-phase exothermic materials, the core ingredient of the ExoBraze process, have additional potential for NASA in improved systems for remotely separating spacecraft or as energetics for propulsion.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
High performance exothermics bring a range of uses. Many of the immediate uses are military focused from joining ceramic armor tiles to their backing plates to the use of the nano-phase particulates in self-destructing penetrators that upon missing their target would explode into dust before causing unwanted collateral damage. An ordinance related nano-phase exothermics application is for IR decoy flares. In this application, a range of nano-phase particulate would be selected for their capability to emit in the IR range and burn and radiate with the appropriate intensity. Additional DoD joining applications include  joining Si3N4 tubes to one another that would enable the fabrication on 1-meter long gun barrel linings and in applications where ceramics, ceramic composites or refractory metals need to be joined  such as hypersonic vehicles, aircraft and ordinance. Commercial examples of applications include joining of wear plates for industrial components, linings for reactors and furnaces, extrusion and materials forming tools. ExoBraze can also join thermally sensitive component of dissimilar materials joining with applications emerging in electronic packaging and assembly. Examples include electronic thermal management heat sinks where ceramic or metal matrix composites are being joined or in packages that are mounted to pre-soldered boards or components where heating the entire component would damage the assembly .

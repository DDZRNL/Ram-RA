<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
This proposed project will attempt to develop a data analysis system for structural health monitoring on space structures. The data analysis software will be a key component in space vehicle health management system and can be used to in vehicle life prediction. The sensor data analysis algorithm is aimed at providing a modeling and simulation tool for data collected from a network of distributed sensors. The sensor network can be implemented via the state-of-the-art technology of distributed wireless dust network. A novel algorithm combining measurement data from the sensors and the analytical model based on the concept of finite element analysis is proposed and the feasibility of the algorithm to detect structural damage will be tested in this project. The project focuses on integrating the new mesh sensor network technology into structural health monitoring. The data analysis system can monitor the performance of defective structural component in a space vehicle and issue proper warning for maintenance and repair. The concept has been tested feasible in Phase I.  During Phase II, the algorithm will be further developed into a commercial software to be used for the structural integrity monitoring of many engineering applications.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed system can be used to monitor the integrity of a wide range of space structures. This system can be used to monitor the performance of metallic and non-metallic structural components and the space structural system. The structural health monitoring system will be a key component in space vehicle health management system and the data collected can be used to predict the remaining service life of the space structures. The system will be a valuable technology for the safety of future space exploration including manned and unmanned missions to the Moon, the Mars, and other long-rang space missions.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Since the proposed data analysis system is non-parametric meaning that the technology is not dependent on the geometry and material properties of the structures being monitored, the system can be used to monitor the structural integrity of one structural component, a sub-structural system, and the entire structural system. This technology can be applied to a very wide range of engineering applications. Examples of potential applications include automobiles, nuclear power-plant structures, and civil infrastructures such as the pipeline systems, bridges, and high-rise buildings. The system can be integrated into the vehicle health management system and life prediction system.

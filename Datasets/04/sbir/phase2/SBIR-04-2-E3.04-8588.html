<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Multichannel virtual reality visualization is the future of complex simulation with a large number of visual channels rendered and transmitted over high-speed networks like National LambdaRail (NLR).  POC proposed to develop a next generation "true" 3D visualization system that works without headwear and to link it through the NLR with a remote computing center.  To accomplish this goal we have developed in Phase I a fully functional 3D Multichannel Networked (3DMCN) system based on stereoscopic principles and compatible with the NLR network.  One of the enabling technologies that is being developed in this project is multicorrelated channel video compression, which takes advantage of spatial redundancy in multiscopic channels.  The Phase I demonstration included stereoscopic 3DMCN system linked to live real-time high definition (1080i) dual-channel video.  In Phase II we will continue the development of a new compression scheme that can offer 200-300% improvement in compression ratios for multiscopic channels versus independent channel compression used in other state-of-the-art compression approaches.  We will also concentrate on the improvement of the existing true 3D visualization system in terms of higher resolution, lower channel-to-channel crosstalk, and wider field-of-view.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The initial candidate NASA applications with the greatest potential for benefiting from improved multichannel compression fall into three categories. The first is Multi-Channel Video Compression Scientific Visualization, which offers the potential for collaborative efforts with true 3D displays; one rendering supercluster will be able to serve multiple visualization locations separated by thousands of miles.  The second is Scientific Data Visualization, which includes 3D visualization of scientific data for analysis, computer modeling, and simulation over the NLR.  The third is Live Multichannel Video Transmission, which involves multichannel data being transmitted in real time for display of sensing data/imagery acquired by satellite or aircraft in high definition.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Other potential government applications include:  3D visualization of forests and farmlands to monitor plant species, crop health, the impact of drought conditions, and the spread of plant diseases, etc., environmental monitoring of land use, vegetation coverage, water resources, pollution, etc.; visualization of natural disasters to assess damage and identify areas in critical need of assistance, and to identify endangered areas, as well as to forecast crop yields. Commercial applications include HD video communication, virtual reality, medicine, computer training and simulation, video games, air traffic control, environmental monitoring, and automatic satellite orbit control.  The proposed system can enhance 3D modeling, simulation, and structural optimization.

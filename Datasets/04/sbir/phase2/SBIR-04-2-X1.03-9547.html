<P><B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 
words)<BR>The Carbon Monoxide Silicate Reduction System (COSRS) is a novel 
technology for producing large quantities of oxygen on the Moon. Oxygen yields 
of 15 kilograms per 100 kilograms of feed soil were demonstrated during Phase I 
using both lunar and Mars soil simulants. This is about five times the oxygen 
yield achievable by hydrogen reduction. Up to 30 kilograms of oxygen per 100 
kilograms of feed soil are recoverable by adjustment of the carbon-silicon 
ratio. <BR><BR>Soils are sequentially subjected to iron oxide reduction by 
carbon monoxide, in-situ deposition of carbon throughout the soil by carbon 
monoxide disproportionation, and finally high-temperature carbothermal reduction 
of silicates by the deposited carbon. <BR><BR>COSRS operates in a closed system. 
An inventory of carbon is maintained in the form of carbon monoxide, carbon 
dioxide, and solid carbon. Most of the oxygen recovered from soil is in the form 
of carbon monoxide, which is converted to carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is then 
reacted with hydrogen in a reverse water gas shift reactor. The RWGS system 
regenerates carbon monoxide for use in the COSRS process and produces water, 
which is electrolyzed. Hydrogen from electrolysis is recycled within the RWGS 
system. Oxygen from electrolysis is the COSRS product. <BR>
<P><B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, 
approximately 150 words)<BR>COSRS is a potentially enabling technology for human 
Lunar exploration because it can produce the majority of the oxygen available in 
undifferentiated Lunar soil, or roughly five to ten times the yield of hydrogen 
reduction technologies. This increased productivity eliminates the need to 
beneficiate the soil, thereby enabling automated lunar oxygen facilities that 
could produce return propellant prior to the arrival of the crew. This will 
greatly decrease the launch costs required to support a lunar base, and also 
enable long range exploration using ballistic hoppers employing Lunar oxygen. 
The COSRS will also work on asteroids, Mars, and Jupiter's moons.
<P><B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, 
approximately 150 words)<BR>The integrated COSRS/RWGS/Electrolysis system has an 
application in production of pure silicon metal for terrestrial manufacturing of 
photovoltaics and electronics components. The integrated COSRS/RWGS/Electrolysis 
system also has future applications to the production of large quantities of 
oxygen, iron metal, and silicon metal from random lunar and Martian regolith for 
lunar and Martian bases, and could be used in the same way to allow useful metal 
production from very low grade ores on Earth. Furthermore, the closed COSRS/RWGS 
system would enable the terrestrial production of iron and other metals without 
generating carbon dioxide greenhouse gas.

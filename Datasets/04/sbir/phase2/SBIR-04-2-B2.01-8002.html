<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>

<br>This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II proposal seeks to develop a low cost, robust, highly precise and accurate CO2 monitoring system. This system will employ a novel mid-infrared laser source, which was successfully demonstrated during Phase I along with a bench-scale laboratory sensor.  Quantitative analysis of the Phase I results showed that the goal of determining the mole fraction of CO2 in atmospherically relevant gas mixtures with a precision of 0.05% min-1 was achieved.  The Phase II project will significantly refine approach and improve the long term stability such that an onboard gas calibration system needs to operate at most once-per-hour.  The resulting compact, fully integrated Phase II prototype will enable completely automated CO2 concentration measurements to be routinely performed with unprecedented accuracy.  Commercial systems based on the Phase II prototype will be refined and marketed during Phase III. Additionally, the core technology can be applied for the detection of other target species such as CO2 isotopes, methane, and CO.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
NASA's Fundamental Biology Program seeks to improve our understanding of gravitational effects on plants and animals.  The success of this proposal will directly impact this effort by providing compact fieldable CO2 analyzers with the requisite precision and accuracy to aid this effort.  Additionally, NASA's Earth Science Enterprise has taken a lead role in understanding Earth's atmospheric dynamics.  In particular, to better understand climate change and global warming, a more detailed knowledge of carbon exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere is required.   The success of this effort will directly impact this area as well.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The worldwide market for low cost, high precision CO2 monitors is quite large due to the need to monitor greenhouse gas emissions and enforce world-wide emissions standards.  Additionally, the core technology is promising for the detection of other target species such as CO2 isotopes, methane, and CO.  Commercial arenas for the technology therefore include trace gas monitoring, pollution monitoring, and industrial process monitoring.

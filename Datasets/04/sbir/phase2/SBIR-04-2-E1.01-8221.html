<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Large stroke and high precision electroactive single crystal and polymer actuators are desired for cryogenic passive optics such as Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) and Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) in NASA remote sensing missions. The results of the Phase I program have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using electroactive  single crystal and polymer actuator concepts for large stroke, high precision cryogenic actuations for passive optics.  We believe this result justifies the Phase II continuation to develop electroactive single crystal and polymer actuators for cryogenic tunable FPI and FTS for remote sensing applications. In particular, single crystal stack actuators with stroke of 25 um at 77K, flextensional actuator with stroke of 100-200 um and hybrid single crystal /polymer HYBAS actuators with stroke 1-2 mm will be developed for both current cryogenic tunable FPI and future passive optics. Single crystal piezoelectrics are attractive because they exhibit 3 to 5 times the strain of conventional piezoelectric ceramics, have very low strain hysteresis, and retain excellent piezoelectric performance at cryogenic temperatures. HYBAS actuation concept exhibits significant strain improvement by combining single crystal piezoelectrics and EAP.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The results of the Phase I program have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using electroactive  single crystal and polymer actuator concepts for large stroke, high precision cryogenic actuations for cryogenic tunable FPI and FTS in passive optics applications.  These actuators also hold promising for adaptive optics applications to many future NASA missions such as JWST, SIM, SAFIR,TPF and others.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The electroactive single crystal and polymer actuator technology  is also well suited to satisfying several non-NASA requirements. In particular, there are several active DOD programs interested in developing high temperature superconductor based microwave devices requiring large stroke and precision actuators for tuning. Apart from the passive optics and adaptive structures applications, large stroke, high precision electroactive single crystal and polymer actuators are also good candidates for vibration control and smart structures, electromechanical optical switch, RF communications, and micropositioning for photonics and biomedical tooling for Non-NASA applications.

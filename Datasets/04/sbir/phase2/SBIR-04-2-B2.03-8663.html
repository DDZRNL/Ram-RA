<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
This Phase II program builds from the successful Phase I efforts to demonstrate that Quantum Logic Devices' nanoelectronic platform for biological detection could detect binding of Epo, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IGF-1 in saline and serum without labels. The creation of an electronic "direct detection" platform for proteomics, enables rapid point of care monitoring of metabolic analytes in microgravity. This Phase II proposal will build working prototypes based on PDA-style electronic data capture with disposable assay cartridges for the analytes demonstrated in Phase I.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The product of this program is a handheld bioassay system that would be ideally suited for all biomedical research and diagnostic needs of current and future space missions. Real-time, quantitative monitoring of proteomic analytes will answer real questions about the metabolic and physiological changes induced by microgravity and space flight.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
This technology will be a key part of the rapidly emerging paradigm of telemedicine, and provide point of care diagnostics capabilities, which are the most rapidly growing segment of the medical testing market.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
This proposal is for the development of innovative compact, high power and extremely reliable 2 micron seed laser using newly developed Tm3+ doped germanate glass fibers, which exhibit high quantum efficiency. This type of fiber based seed laser is needed for constructing high energy pulsed 2 micron Ho-doped crystal lasers for LIDAR applications. The single frequency fiber laser, which will be developed as part of the seed laser, is needed for building coherent laser Radar for space exploration program. We propose to use highly Tm3+ doped germanate glass fibers with high gain per unit length to form a short linear cavity to generate single frequency fiber laser operation. Germanate glass exhibits lower phonon energy compared to silica glass, increasing the quantum efficiency of 3F4 level of Tm3+ ions. Importantly, Tm3+ can be highly doped into germanate glasses, which results in so called cross-relaxation, dramatically improving the gain per unit length and the quantum efficiency. The single frequency fiber laser will be used to construct seed lasers by integrating with controlling electronics.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
This innovative fiber based seed laser can be used to generate high energy pulsed 2 micron Ho-doped crystal lasers, which are generally used for LIDAR applications in NASA. The single frequency 2-micron fiber laser with high-speed frequency modulation capability, which will be developed in this SBIR project as part of the seed laser, is needed for NASA's space exploration program. Single frequency fiber laser is needed to build coherent laser radar to perform instant measurement of velocity and concentration of CO2 and other gases, which can, for instance, support space vehicle's accurate landing on Mars.  
<br>
<br>Such a fiber laser and seed laser are inherently much more reliable compared to currently existing free space solid-state laser. Almost all components in the fiber laser and the seed laser have been used for space applications, which means both the fiber laser and seed laser can be qualified for space application.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
There are a number of potential non-NASA commercial applications. Seed laser is needed for high energy pulsed 2-micron solid state lasers for commercial applications. The single frequency fiber laser is needed for fiber optical sensing, commercial coherent LIDAR, and long distance ranging, especially for defense applications.

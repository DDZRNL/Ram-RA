<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
This project will develop a much-needed multidisciplinary analysis tool for predicting the impact of aeroelastic effects on the functionality of inflatable aeroassist vehicles in both the continuum and rarefied flow regimes.  In this integrated multi-physics multi-disciplinary computing environment,  high-fidelity modules for continuum and rarefied aerodynamics, stress, heat transfer, and computational grid deformation are coupled. This flexible and extensible approach allows the integration of state-of-the-art, stand-alone NASA and industry leading continuum and rarefied flow solvers and structural analysis codes into a computing environment in which the modules can run concurrently with synchronized data transfer. 
<br>
<br>The Phase I study proved the feasibilty of this approach. Tightly coupled fluid-structure continuum flow demonstrations were conducted on a clamped ballute configuration. The feasibility of implementing a DSMC flow solver in the simulation framework was demonstrated, and loosely coupled rarefied flow aeroelastic demonstrations were performed. A NASA and industry technology survey identified several software tools for fluid and structural modeling to be integrated into the environment. Phase II efforts will focus on full implementation of these tools. They include NASA-selected CFD and DSMC codes, and commercial leading structural analysis codes capable of modeling non-linear shape and material response of thin-film inflated aeroshells. Extensive verification and validation studies will be performed, and the software will be applied in ballute technology development.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
):  The simulation technology developed under this SBIR program will find direct and immediate applications with NASA and industry in ongoing aeroassist technology development programs. It provides significant capability advances in crucial areas of aeroassist vehicle development: 1) definition and screening of ballute configurations in the concept phase, and 2) verification of aeroassist system functionality across the flight envelope. Inflatable decelerator technology may find a multitude of applications under Project Constellation for providing deceleration and precision landing capability for cargo delivery to Mars outposts or in returning large amounts of down-mass from Earth orbit.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The flexibility provided by the multi-disciplinary computating environment in enabling the exchange of individual modules without breaking the functionality offer the opportunity to other government and industry organizations to implements their own trusted and proven tools into this simulation system. Non-NASA application areas include analysis of space-based inflatable structures such as telescopes and mirrors, satellite solar panels and military reentry vehicles (inflatable decoys, etc) exposed to the atmosphere. The aeroelastic analysis of parachutes and parafoils and the analysis of high-altitude, high-endurance surveillance aircraft with flexible wings will be improved. Further military applications include stabilization and deceleration of ordnance with attached inflatable decelerators.  The full integration of the MSC.NASTRAN and ABAQUS structural analysis codes in the MDICE simulation environment opens a multitude of potential other applications that would benefit from coupled analysis with these codes. Applications include a wide range of coupled structural analysis opportunities from naval applications in submarine and ship hull fluid-structure analysis, civil engineering applications in wind-driven building aeroelastic predictions, to aeronautical applications for airships, balloons, aerobots, decelerators, and many other flexible air vehicles.

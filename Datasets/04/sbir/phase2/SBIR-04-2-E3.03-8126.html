<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Diamond Data Systems (DDS) proposes the development of a new advanced architecture, algorithms and software to support the end-to-end processing of LIDAR data to derive useful information products such as Digital Elevation Models  (DEM).  The approach is innovative in three ways.  First, it proposes a complete end-to-end system instead of a solution that addresses only a single step of the complex problem of accurately gathering, processing, and reporting of the data.   Second, it proposes a system that is designed to minimize human interaction and manual data entry.  Third (and possibly the most important) is that it proposes both the implementation of multiple algorithms to perform the data processing, as well as an extensible, open software architecture which allows algorithms to be incorporated into the system in the future.  This approach allows for the development of a dynamic system which can be extended not only by DDS, but by third parties as well.  Our proposal is relevant to topic E3.03 in that it provides for the efficient production of a DEM product from an active imaging system (LIDAR).

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Lunar and Martial Surface Mapping ? NASA leveraged LIDAR technology as part of the Clementine project for mapping the LUNAR surface and will continue this effort with the Lunar and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter projects.  This high resolution data will be the key to determining optimal landing and environment exploitation sites.
<br>Weather Studies ? LIDAR is being used by NASA for discovering how high, thin clouds at many heights affect climate, understanding how dust and other particles move across the globe,  and exploring aerosols and clouds on other planets by satellite.  This capability is made possible with the use of Differential Absorption LIDAR (DIAL) and was tested in the LIDAR Atmospheric Sensing Experiment (LASE).
<br>Spacecraft Fault Detection ? As part of the Orbiter Boom Sensor system Optech and MD Robotics are attaching a LIDAR scanner to the boom of the space shuttle remote manipulator system (SMRS), in order to scan the surface of the spacecraft for faults.  This was developed in wake of the Space Shuttle Columbia incident. 
<br>Earth Science ? All applications of Earth Science benefit from accurate Digital Elevation Models derived from LIDAR data.  This includes floodplain mapping, precision agriculture, land use, forestry management and many other applications.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Disaster Management ? LIDAR data has been found useful for disaster management purposes, such as recovery of the World Trade Center, hurricane destruction analysis, and plume propagation modeling.
<br>Topographical Update ? LIDAR data is being utilized for topographical update projects. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has initiated a modernization of floodplain maps throughout the United States using LIDAR data in its Map Modernization Initiative.
<br>Coastal Erosion ? LIDAR data is currently being utilized to detect coastal changes in order to study coastal erosion.
<br>Nautical Charting ?LIDAR is being utilized for measuring seabed depths and topographic elevations for navigation, nautical chartering, rapid environmental assessment, and regional costal zone mapping.
<br>Forestry ? LIDAR data is utilized to detect forest canopy change for forest management.
<br>Aviation Safety ? LIDAR was utilized in the Airfield Initiative to identify vertical airfield obstructions to aviation 
<br>Corridor Mapping ? LIDAR data is utilized for pipeline right way analysis for oil and gas companies as well as transmission line right of way analysis for power companies.
<br>Network Planning ? LIDAR data is utilized for Telecom propagation modeling for wireless and mobile network planning.
<br>Land Use Planning ? LIDAR data it used to determine optimal location sites for commercial facilities planning.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Embedded wireless sensors of the future will enable flight vehicle systems to be "highly aware" of onboard health and performance parameters, as well as the external flow field and potential threat environments.  Because there will be no opportunity to replace batteries on a regular basis, these systems will have to rely on energy harvesting strategies to convert ambient energy into electrical energy to provide long-lived power.  TPL proposes to develop a micropower system that will combine TPL's patented microbatteries and microsupercapacitors with vibrational energy harvesting for use with wireless structural health monitoring (SHM) systems.  The solution proposed will include all components required for a complete power supply for wireless SHM sensors, including proprietary power regulation and conditioning circuitry that draws very low power.  
<br>TPL is a leader in designing and manufacturing power for light weight, minimum volume, minimum footprint, wireless systems.  TPL's effort has been supported by Goodrich Fuel and Utility Systems whose expertise with Structural Health Monitoring will provide guidance on sensor requirements, integration and packaging.  These relationships will facilitate realizing devices that will meet end-user requirements, and provide a commercialization pathway for Phase III.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
There are numerous applications for wireless sensors in aerospace to reduce the weight and cost of future flight vehicles.  NASA's interest in structural health monitoring, in particular, extends to air and space vehicles, fixed wing and rotorcraft, satellites, inter-planetary mission vehicles, and high altitude, long endurance (HALE) vehicles.  For wireless sensors in general, NASA applications will extend from remote sensing on earth, climate and meteorological monitoring, and geolocation in planetary exploration.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
There is a myriad of non-NASA applications that have been discussed throughout this proposal; but for structural health monitoring, they include bridges, buildings (particularly high value, or sensitive buildings such as nuclear power or chemical plants), seismic detection, and ships (e.g. oil tankers or other vessels carrying cargoes that may be harmful if spilled).   Other applications of wireless sensors extend into medical, industrial manufacturing (inventory management, process control), agricultural, domestic (smart house), and automotive (some estimate up to 1trillion automotive sensors in 2010 including tire pressure monitors and stability control).

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
During this Phase II program we propose to build on the key aspects of the nanodroplet encapsulation technology to demonstrate optimized formulation and encapsulation of protein drugs. The ability of the nanodroplet generator to produce nanoscale drug "containers" with designer characteristics provides us with a distinct advantage in targeting protein containing vesicles to diseased cells and organs. We plan to target cancerous cells and tumors using our engineered drug vesicles, with specifically designed lipid outer layers as well as targeted surface functionalization to improve drug uptake by the cells, reduce toxicity, and otherwise improve safety and efficacy. The optimized vesicles will result in improved stability and enhanced control of pharmacokinetics in both cell lines and animal models.The nanodroplet platform will be scaled up to produce gram quantities of engineered vesicles  with a monodisperse size distribution and a target size of 200nm.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The immiscible nanodroplet processor provides NASA with a platform that will impact space driven goals for biotechnology research as well as manned exploration activities.  The nanodroplet technology lends itself to several important applications in drug formulation, diagnostics and sample preservation.  For drug formulation applications, it is envisioned the astronauts on long-term missions may be provided the capability to program specific drug formulations for personalized space medicine care.  Formulations may be tailored to meet the pharmacokinetics of drugs administered in space, for specific applications that include countermeasures for space borne afflictions such as bone loss due to microgravity and radiation exposure.  Other applications may include the mixing and dosing of nutriceuticals to ensure astronaut health and peak performance and psychotherapeutics to treat long-term isolation experienced on extended missions.  Finally, drugs for the treatment of diseases such as a cancer that may develop on a long-term mission to Mars may be of interest.

<br>The nanodroplet technology may also have applications in space medicine diagnostics and continuous water sampling and monitoring.  For astronaut personal diagnostics, the nanodroplet approach may be utilized to analyze blood, urine or saliva by sampling, targeting and/or concentrating specific analytes.  Similarly, the nanodroplet approach may be applied for monitoring the safety of drinking water used by the crew

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The Nanotrope nanodroplet encapsulation technology tremendous potential for commercialization in such diverse areas as targeted drug therapy, personalized medicine, and point of care testing, especially for patients where samples are sub-optimal and the need for treatment may be frequently adjusted. Clearly, the ability to produce functionalized particles has tremendous potential for cancer therapy. With the nanodroplet technology, we can customize drug formulations for small, at-risk populations, or even for individuals on a rapid turn-around basis.  The technology provides a compact device that is capable of titrating particle compositions on demand, which will allows care givers the new ability to adjust dosage levels to meet the need of the individual according to the patient's response to initial treatments.  In addition, our technology is operated by inexpensive microfluidic devices that are readily adapted to conventional drug delivery instruments such as syringes or inhalers.  Thus, we anticipate the facilitated integration of our on-demand, monodisperse drug formulation technology with a reduced time to market.

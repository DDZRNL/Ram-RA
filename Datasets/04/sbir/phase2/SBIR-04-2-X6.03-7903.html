<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The Phase I effort successfully demonstrated the feasibility of a terrain guided automated precision landing sensor using an innovative multi-field-of-view stereo motion system with a novel real time terrain mapping algorithm.  The objective of the Phase II proposal is to develop a complete prototype and characterize the performance of the LandingNav sensor system in all of the relative motion environments anticipated for the descent of the Lunar Surface Access Module.  The result of the Phase II work will be a comprehensive flight characterization of the new landing navigation system and a closed loop demonstration of the multi-camera stereo vision unit working with the feature detection and terrain mapping to avoid hazards.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The innovations validated during the Phase I effort have potential applications for the NASA Lunar Surface Access Module as an autonomous precision landing navigation sensor system.  In addition, the technology is applicable to lunar surface operations, autonomous rendezvous and docking, Mars landing and Mars flyers.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
There are a significant number of potential non-NASA applications that are both government and commercial.  Potential government applications include DOD unmanned aerial vehicles, border patrol sensing systems and critical infrastructure monitoring.  Commercial applications include industrial inspection and robotic navigation, security surveillance and surveying for agriculture and oil and gas enterprises.

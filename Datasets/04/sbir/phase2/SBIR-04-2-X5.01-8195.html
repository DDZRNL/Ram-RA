<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Energid Technologies will create a comprehensive software infrastructure for rapid validation of robot designs.  The software will support push-button validation through existing commercial design software, such as SolidWorks.  After validation is invoked through the design-tool GUI, the robot design data will transfer to separate networked or integrated software for analysis.  An interface will be provided for communicating with commercial third-party analysis software, and Energid will also provide its own analysis software through the common interface.  Energid's own analysis software will allow interactive placement of any number of end effectors on any number of mobile mechanisms, each with any number of kinematic links and branches.  The articulated-motion control system and joint-controllers will be automatically generated from the robot description.  For both control and simulation, generic multi-degree-of-freedom joints will be supported.  Energid's software will provide dynamic simulation, including articulated-body, actuator, control system, impact, and terrain dynamics.  The automatic control system generation and dynamic simulation will support parametric, Monte Carlo, and parameter-optimization analysis.  The software will allow physical descriptions, end-effector descriptions, control algorithms, and the environment to be arbitrarily exchangeable as modules through the Extensible Markup Language (XML) and Dynamic Link Library (DLL) plugins.  A new XML-based language, ROAMEL, will support configuration, data transfer, and exchange.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Because of its general nature, the design validation tool will have application to all of NASA's robotic missions, including orbital missions, lunar missions, Mars missions, asteroid reconnaissance, and Galilean satellite landers.  For future robotic missions, robotic devices and vehicles will progress through a design cycle, and the proposed validation tool will broadly reduce cost and improve schedule.  Upon completion of the project, the validation software will be ready for use, and Energid will partner with larger NASA contractors to commercialize it through contracts that both apply the software directly to the design cycle and leverage the toolkit for manipulator control and human-robot interface development.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Energid will offer the software to industries needing sophisticated design and validation tools.  As the market grows for home, industrial, agricultural, military, entertainment, and exploratory robots, the demand for turn-key design-analysis tools will continually increase.  Energid will support all of these robotic market segments.  In addition to the turn-key analysis package, Energid will extend the software components developed under this effort into a commercial C++ software toolkit that can be licensed.  Customers will purchase the toolkit as software libraries and header files.  By linking these libraries into their code, developers will have full access to all the simulation, control, and analysis capability provided by the toolkit.

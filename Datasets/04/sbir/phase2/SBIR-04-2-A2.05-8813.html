<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Phase I results showed that two surface treatments, oxidative plasma and reactive finishes, are effective means of modifying the surface chemistry of exfoliated graphite nanoflakes.  The surface modifications provide a more compatible surface energy for dispersion in polymers and create well-bonded interfaces with the polymer matrix.  In order to be cost effective for NASA and commercial applications, the surface treatment processes need to be applied on a large scale.  In the Phase II program, both treatment methods will be scaled-up to semi-continuous processes.  Custom equipment will be fabricated to process large quantities of treated nanoflakes.  The resulting treated nanoflakes will be characterized for surface chemistry and morphology and processed into polymer composites and continuous carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites.  The composites will be characterized for conductivity, thermal and mechanical, and diffusion barrier properties.  It is expected that these composites will find applications as fuel cell bipolar plates, composite cryogenic storage tanks, and in light weight structures for aerospace, military, and transportation.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Nanomaterials are emerging as the next materials revolution.  They have proven to greatly modify conventional materials properties at low loadings.  As such, they will find many applications within NASA's mission such as fuel cells, cryogenic storage tanks, and structural composites for vehicles like the reusable launch vehicle.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The advantages of nanomaterials that make them attractive for NASA use also make them attractive for use in commercial specialty composite materials.  Nanomaterials are already being applied in automotive applications.  Additional uses in aerospace, military, medical, and sporting goods will follow like they have with continuous fiber composites.  The low cost of the treated graphite nanoflakes will ensure that they attain a large market share.

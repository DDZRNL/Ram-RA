<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Current shared aperture diffractive optical elements (ShADOE) have intrinsic residual wavefront errors on the order of 50 waves which limits the angular resolution of the LIDAR application to about 300 micro-radians. We have reduced these aberrations by constructing a secondary holographic correction plate using the aberrated wave from the ShADOE as one of the two construction waves. The other construction wave was collimated. All six overlapping apertures require individually constructed plates, we delivered only 2 thus far. This method of correction requires the use of the final playback wavelength for construction and so is useful for 532 and 355nm but not for 2054 nm. Computed diffractive optics can be used for 2054 nm using measured aberrations at the same wavelength. This proposal deals just with a continuation of fabrication and test of the 2 inch 355 nm holographic correction plates (HCP) to bring resolution well under 50 micro radians. Secondarily we propose to make and measure a small 2054 nm ShaDOE and demonstrate a digitally mastered HCP that will approach diffraction limited performance as required at that wavelength.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Applications include improvement to LIDARs used in laser topographic applications such as terrain and vegetation mapping with possible uses in coherent Doppler and other wind detection LIDARs. The UV elements may also eventually be space qualified and paired in a hybrid combination with the 2054 nm recivers.There are no moving parts to get a 360-degree look at the sky in at least 6 discreet look angles, each of which share a common full aperture. These correction plates produce smaller spots, a narrower FOV and therefore better signal to noise in NASA LIDAR applications. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
We have mainly addressed NASA needs to date. We are aware of several companies that make Lidar components and systems but we do not know who they make them for or how many they make. We have an interest in making HOE and DOE components primarily  and we plan to partner with other companies in making markets for their systems with our components. One closely related spin off has already occured in laser free space communication at 1550 nm.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
 Based on the success of the phase I effort, Advanced Technologies Group, Inc. proposes the development of a Cryogenic Flow Sensor (CFS)  for determining mass flow of cryogens in spacecraft propellant management. Current point sensor technology is incapable of determining high pressure, high flow rate cryogenic fluid quality and mass flow rate, and has proven to be inaccurate in attempting to rapidly measure cryogen depletion.  If there is an abrupt change in fluid quality, turbo-machinery can over-speed causing catastrophic failure.  The CFS will provide a means to avoid these failures as well as providing fluid quality data for a wide range of flow systems. Experimental hardware was able to detect the onset of two-phase flow and the presence of debris in the flow of water.  The innovation clearly shows that it can discern between entrained gas bubbles and unwanted debris.  The sensor has the potential to determine size and quantity of the contaminant.  In addition, a non-intrusive method for determining the Mass-Flow?Rate of the fluid propellant has been designed, and is the focus of this phase II effort.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The more technically challenging application of producing a cryogenic fluid quality sensor, has been requested by both NASA SSC and NASA MSFC.  SSC has requested the sensor for monitoring test stand propellant quality. MSFC is interested in the ability to monitor Turbopump supply and discharge for cavitation.  In both of these applications there is not a current sensor available that can accomplish their individual objectives.  The largest technical challenge is in the 6,000 psi cryogenic window.  This obstacle will be overcome through several design iterations with existing manufacturers who currently make cryogenic windows that operate to 2,000 psi.  One of these companies is 3E<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Such an instrument for measuring the intensity of reflected (scattered) light may be used for the qualitative determination of small amounts of diverse materials which have the ability to absorb or reflect light when in liquid suspension.  Examples include the measurement of traces of silver wherein the chloride ion is added to solution of material containing silver to produce insoluble silver chloride in suspension form.  This method of nephelometry also finds application in the measurement of bacterial growth rates,  for the analysis of cholesterol, glycogen, and enzymes, for any measurement situation where an unknown composition may be transformed into or related to a form of suspension.  This would also be useful in any commercial beverage application where clarity needs to be monitored.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Phoenix Integration's vision is the creation of an intuitive human-in-the-loop  engineering environment called Decision Navigator that leverages recent advances in multi-dimensional visualization technology, state-of-the art optimization algorithms, and parallel processing capability. The visualization displays help designers understand key trends and trade-offs, follow the progress of the optimization algorithm, and interact with and guide the algorithm so as to make decisions regarding promising designs. This tool is fundamentally different from traditional optimization tools because of its interactive nature. Phase I research proved the feasibility of the Decision Navigator concept by integrating an optimization engine with multi-dimensional visualization tools and then integrating the combination into the Phoenix Integration design environment known as ModelCenter. This Phase II proposal builds upon the Phase I proof of feasibility study and completes the concept as a practical commercial decision support tool. Key technical elements added in Phase II include the ability to collaborate with other users, the ability to manage risk and uncertainty, and interactive "wizards" that will help users accomplish common tasks. The Decision Navigator will be a critical link in exercising NASA mission models, trade studies, system and investment analysis, and program and technology planning.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
NASA requires new capabilities to characterize and model technology involving performance, risk, and cost, and the means to exercise that knowledge in the context of system-wide trades and design. The Decision Navigator will be a valuable tool used to develop and deploy space mission systems and will complement the "use what we have" philosophy by helping engineers to choose the best combinations of existing and newly developed hardware. Typical applications include CEV design, system integration, mission analysis, shuttle support, robotics design, and aeronautical research. Managers will benefit through the increased capability to evaluate mission risk and perform dynamic mission re-planning. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Non-NASA commercial applications embrace a wide spectrum of defense, electronic, automotive, and heavy equipment industries. The Decision Navigator will foster an environment for innovation and will expand the level of product design to create innovative offerings in the market. It will also help to reduce the time and cost of the design process, make industrial products more optimized and robust, and use engineering resources more efficiently. The proposed decision support environment will be useful to anyone who uses models and simulations to design a product or make a decision as in the financial industry minimizing investment risk or maximizing returns.

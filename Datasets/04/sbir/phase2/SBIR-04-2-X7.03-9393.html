<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The ADEPT project aims to improve the state-of-the-art with respect to capabilities and costs of scenario-based training in support of future space exploration missions at NASA.  The key features of ADEPT will include: (1) a scenario-based intelligent tutoring system focused on the problem of training systems-operators on how to think through operational contingencies; (2) reliance on explicit representations of target mental models for the systems students are being trained to operate; (3) incorporation of an extensive authoring tool suite to lower costs of training development; and (4) use of multi-modal tutor-student dialog interaction to get at student decision rationale.  Innovations include (a) a new instructional design methodology and supporting tools tuned to the demands of scenario-based contingency response training; (b) application of systems models to training in operations contingency reasoning as opposed to diagnosis or design; (c) development of tools that exploit systems models to support conceptual design of appropriate training scenarios, and development of interactive tutorial dialogs; and (d) attacking cost, quality, flexibility, and longevity issues through an overall training systems design (and project execution plan) emphasizing openness to integration of existing and future components such as simulators, user interfaces, and authoring tools.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Projected future missions will require controllers and astronauts to interact with more capable (semi) automated and robotic systems.  Current training practices, tied as they are to scripted scenarios and human instructors, are too costly, inflexible, and inefficient in the face of escalating training needs: more systems, greater complexity, and evolving procedures.  The next rounds of lunar exploration will likely involve robotic vehicles with greater potential for autonomy, and controllers will need to learn to supervise these systems in varied ways depending on factors such as immediate mission, environmental setting and expected hazards, latest operational procedures and system health limitations, etc.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Many organizations are looking at a future defined by ever more ambitious undertakings, supported by ever more complex and intelligent systems, and requiring increasing productivity and autonomy from highly skilled staff.  It is necessary to train the workforce both to follow procedures and to cope effectively with contingencies.  Training and retraining are a constant burden as workers move between jobs, and as procedures change to reflect changes in the system, mission, context, operating regimen, or regulations.  Industries with heavy reliance on production, distribution, transportation, and information processing systems are all examples of potential consumers of ADEPT technology.

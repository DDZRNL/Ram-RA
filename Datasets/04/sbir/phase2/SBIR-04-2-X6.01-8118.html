<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Sierra Engineering Inc. (Sierra) believes that the subject triaxial liquid propellant swirl injector has the potential to meet many of NASA's Earth-to-Orbit (ETO) propulsion systems goals. The triaxial swirl injector is ideally suited to a wide range of liquid oxidizers and fuels, including hydrogen and a wide range of hydrocarbons.  It holds the potential of excellent high-frequency combustion stability characteristics and low injector production cost, similar to a pintle injector.  Additionally, the triaxial swirl injector offers the potential for excellent injector and combustion chamber thermal compatibility and outstanding propellant atomization characteristics, both at levels far superior to a pintle injector.  The triaxial injector concept is well suited to both main injector and preburner applications.  The Phase I SBIR effort focused on understanding the influence design variables have on injector performance.  We developed the mechanical design concept for a prototype injector.  The proposed Phase II effort will complete the detailed design and analysis of the prototype injector.  The test hardware will be fabricated and tested with several propellants.  A preliminary design will be developed for a large-scale combustor.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Current NASA applications for the swirl triaxial injector include CEV and a range of in-space applications.  The goal is that the injector will be analytically scalable from as small as 50lbf-class to larger than 80,000 lbf-class for a variety of hydrocarbon fuels.  The combination of analytical model results and test data will validate the design methodology.  The design is amenable to a variety of liquid fuel combinations including LOX/CH4 and LOX/kerosene.  The characteristics of the triaxial swirl injector also make it very attractive as a preburner injector for both fuel-rich and ox-rich staged combustion systems.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
There is a wide assortment of non-NASA customers for a demonstrated triaxial swirl injector.  The marketplace currently appears to need a 40,000-lbf-class pressure-fed injector - Rocketplane XP, Virgin Galactic and Microcosm/Scorpius Falcon.  Additionally, the USAF ARES program is interested in similar sized LOX/hydrocarbon engine systems.  The practical market for these engines ranges from as few as a couple a year, plus spares, for novel demonstration flight systems, to hundreds per year in the case of a surge production for a fielded system similar to DARPA's FALCON system.

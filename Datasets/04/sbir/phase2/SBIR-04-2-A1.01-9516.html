<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a 3D cockpit display (3D-COD) system for improved pilot situational awareness and safety in 3D airspace by overcoming the inherent limitations of 2D information presentation.  The proposed display will be automultiscopic and will be based on a projector, a stationary holographic optical element screen integrated with a high-speed electro-optical scanner and high-speed electronics with a software interface to NASA systems.  This minimum 8-in. diagonal drop-down head-up display with no moving parts will present six or more perspective views to air crew members, forming integrated virtual volumetric 3D images viewable over a 60 degree horizontal field of view.  In Phase I POC designed a laboratory prototype and successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed system by assembling a single-user monochrome 3D-COD prototype.  In Phase II POC will further develop the true 3D display technology and construct a fully functional system that will project distortion-free, 400-600 lumen, full-color, virtual volumetric 3D images at a 30-60 Hz video rate for real-time user interaction with the images, each from his or her own perspective.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The crew-centered 3D-COD system will find applications in NASA Synthetic Vision Systems to significantly enhance air safety through improved pilot situational awareness by information presentation in 3D.  This system will benefit air traffic control, simulation, training, 3D design, and multicraft airspace image displays.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The 3D-COD technology has huge commercial potential, and will find applications in engineering development and entertainment, and particularly in theme parks, museums, and educational institutions.  Niche applications include visual tools for medicine, and for design and development of complex machinery and systems.

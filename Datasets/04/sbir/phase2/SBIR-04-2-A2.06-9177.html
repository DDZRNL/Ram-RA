<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Cornerstone Research Group Inc. (CRG) will develop an advanced reflexive structure technology system to increase the survivability of future systems constructed of lightweight composite structures. Application of this innovation will apply to a broad selection of high performance systems ranging from aircraft and spacecraft to habitats for space stations and interplanetary exploration.  The control system for the reflexive structures will mimic the pain withdrawal-reflex on which the human body relies. This is important because rapid response is critical to survivability. The proposed reflexive system will incorporate a continuous health and performance monitoring system via embedded piezoelectric sensors, an adaptive composite structure based on CRG's shape memory composite material (Veritex<SUP>TM</SUP>), and an intelligence system which will be interfaced with both the health/performance sensors and the adaptive structure. When activated, the adaptive composite will recover its structural integrity via shape recovery and a novel healing process.  The development of a reflexive structural system will enable increased safety and security and demonstrate a better understanding of integrated performance systems.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
This project's technologies directly address requirements for smart, adaptive structures with intelligence for enhanced survivability of air and space platforms.  These technologies offer an effective solution to improving structural survivability through integration of multi-functional materials into a single structural system.  Benefits of this technology could be widespread throughout NASA platforms including interplanetary habitats, the International Space Station, unmanned air vehicles, and personal air vehicles.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Government systems that would derive the same benefits would include but not be limited to military and commercial aircraft operated by the Department of Defense (DoD), commercial airlines, and the general aviation community.  This technology's attributes for active sense and respond structural recovery should yield a high potential for private sector commercialization for active structural health monitoring and management in several types of space-based and terrestrial structural systems.  Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Vought Aircraft Industries have documented their interest in this commercialization opportunity.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
This proposal is submitted under the Innovative Tools and Techniques Supporting the Practical Uses of Earth Science Observations topic. We seek to create a prototype rangeland decision support system that links remote sensing based rangeland products, a soil biogeochemical model and web-based tools for data mining, data management and product visualization. The resulting decision support system will be unique and innovative by not only providing operational remote sensing observations of rangeland condition, but also web-based tools that utilize these observations to provide critical information on soil fertility/productivity, greenhouse gas emissions, and potential erosion and sedimentation. Our Rangeland Decision Support System (RDSS) will build off of existing RANGES and DNDC tools. Landsat and MODIS prototype processing algorithms for rangeland condition (height, forage production, fractional cover) have been developed under the previous RANGES project and Phase I. The result of this Phase II project will be a series of web data management tools and a prototype RDSS for Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed and Santa Rita Experimental Range regions in Arizona.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Our Rangeland Decision Support System will be designed to facilitate easy use of NASA Earth Observations from existing (Landsat MODIS, TRMM and AMSR-E) and potential future (NPOESS) NASA resources and addresses current interests in the Earth Science Application agricultural efficiency, carbon management and watershed management priority areas. Through our web-portal, a wide array of users will have access to remote sensing and model products that are critical for improved and sustainable rangeland management. RDSS would be also useful as a gaming tool for educational applications, natural resource managers and policy applications for better understanding of rangeland management, carbon and nitrogen cycling and sustainability of rangeland forage systems.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
We anticipate our routine mapping and monitoring of rangeland products will be a very useful service to support USDA Risk Management Program needs for Risk Management Products for Pasture /Rangeland and forage systems as part of the USDA Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC). The RDSS will also be useful tool for assessing the efficacy of carbon sequestration projects (a particular interest of NRCS). The RANGES products coupled with the information on C and N cycling and susceptibility to erosion and sedimentation will be extremely useful for the US EPA TMDL process. In addition, RDSS can be applied for USAID applications on rangeland rehabilitation worldwide.

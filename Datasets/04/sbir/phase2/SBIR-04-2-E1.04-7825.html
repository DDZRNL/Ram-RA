<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) can render microwave radiometer measurements useless. We have proposed a method and an architecture that can be used to identify sources of RFI and identify an optimal scheme for the mitigation of RFI. The system consists of a fully functional digital radiometer that can collect data in the field and pipe the pre-detected signal into, for example, a spectrum analyzer for in-situ analysis or into removable flash memory for later analysis. The digital radiometer employs a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for employing flexible mitigation strategies. It will also use a programmable noise source for generation of artificial RFI in the laboratory setting, allowing for efficient mitigation algorithm development in a laboratory setting, independent of actual RFI, which may be intermittent. Thus the proposed instrument can be used to identify RFI, develop mitigation approaches for RFI, and validate the mitigation strategy. The Phase II effort will fabricate and test an L-band version of the proposed system.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
NASA is seeking techniques for the detection and removal of RFI in microwave radiometers. Techniques which are proven to mitigate RFI will be incorporated into future spaceborne and airborne microwave radiometer instruments. The device under consideration here could serve either as a product or service to NASA. Systems that could benefit from this technology include, but are not limited to, Lightweight Rainfall Radiometer, GeoSTAR, ACMR, HYDROS, and future AMSR instruments.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Aerospace corporations, Universities, government agencies other than NASA, and international groups also construct radiometers that could benefit from the results of this technology. Indeed, RFI mitigating radiometer technology developed by NASA will increasingly be exploited by other institutions, especially as enabling technologies like validated RFI mitigation techniques are developed. These institutions known to the authors to manufacture radiometers include, but are not limited to, Aerospace Corporation, ProSensing, Inc., Radiometrics, Inc., U. S. Navy, NOAA Environmental Technology Laboratory, The University of Michigan and The University of Massachusetts.

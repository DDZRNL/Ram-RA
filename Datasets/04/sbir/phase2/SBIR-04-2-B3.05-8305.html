<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
BioWATCH is a modular ambulatory compact wireless biomedical data acquisition system.  More specifically, it is a data acquisition unit for acquiring signals from biomedical sensors using modular acquisition modules attached to a common data and power bus. Several module slots allow the user to configure the unit by inserting sensor specific modules. The data is then sent real time from the unit over any commercially implemented wireless network including 802.11b/g, WCDMA, GSM, or EDGE. BioWATCH is of a distributed computing hierarchy and has a common data controller on each sensor module.  This innovation allows for the modularity of the device along with the tailored ability to control the cards using a relatively small master processor.  The distributed nature of this system affords the modularity, size, and power consumption that betters the current state-of-the-art in medical ambulatory data acquisition. The current state-of-the-art in biomedical data monitoring is limited in its modularity and relies on centralized computing models.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Numerous NASA applications exist in both human health monitoring and human life science experimentation. The most obvious application is support of health monitoring on human space flight and exploration missions.  Additionally, numerous opportunities exist in support of ground based investigations that may or may not be directly related to human space flight. These include baseline monitoring of astronaut health, health monitoring during strenuous training procedures, on-ground evaluation of physical training techniques and muscle/bone loss countermeasures.  Many experiments that have already flown on Shuttle and Station have required long duration monitoring and BioWATCH will be capable of extending the capability of such science activity.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
This innovative design has obvious commercial applications for extending health monitoring outside clinical facilities and this has the potential to improve the patient's quality of life. It will provide health research institutions a flexible modular system that can be tailored to their experimentation.  The modular nature of the system, use of standard communications protocols, and software will allow for economical growth of the system with the development of new technologies, e.g. greater memory storage.
<br>The proposed device and associated software could find many applications in ground based medicine and biomedical research.  The tradition of long term monitoring was pioneered in the field of heart electrophysiology by Halter monitors and this has now expanded to a more generalized approach to ambulatory monitoring (e.g. Wilhelm FH, Roth WT, Sackner MA. The lifeShirt. An advanced system for ambulatory measurement of respiratory and cardiac function. The availability of an economical, user-friendly device such as the one proposed here could open new directions for the study of many biological processes and offer clinicians the opportunity to monitor aspects of their patients' health that are not currently accessible.  BioWATCH is capable of improving home health monitoring by providing clinicians the ability to allow round-the-clock monitoring of patients  at work, home, play, and sleep with more mobility and modularity than conventional home health monitoring equipment.

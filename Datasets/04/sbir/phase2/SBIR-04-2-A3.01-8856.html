<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
A method and device for situational awareness for unmanned air vehicles is presented. This enables integration of UAVs into the national airspace in a safe manner, equivalent to the level of safety of manned aircraft. Phase I results are presented and discussed. Phase II plans are discussed in detail. The Phase II will culminate in flight tests of the proposed gear. Alignment with national initiatives such as Access5 is discussed.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
NASA, and several other agencies are evaluating UAVs for science, homeland security and military missions. The FAA requires that UAVs be allowed to fly in the National Airspace only if they have a level of security equivalent to manned aircraft. The proposed hardware addresses this issue. NASA has a strong civilian UAV effort currently to support Suborbital Earth Science missions. This device can be used on such NASA UAVs.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The transponder can be used for airspace integration of UAVs. Such vehicles are now increasingly used for homeland security, science, civilian, and homeland security missions. Specific military end users have been identified.

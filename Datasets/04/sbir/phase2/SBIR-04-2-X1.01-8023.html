<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II proposal offers to develop a comprehensive computer simulation methodology based on the finite element method for the simulation of the electron beam freeform fabrication process.  It will utilize the successful accomplishments of Phase I project. The following major tasks are proposed for Phase II;  (1) a user subroutine to model Gaussian distribution of the heat input, (3) a new highly sophisticated thermal model of material deposition, (4) a user subroutine for the prediction of microstructure with graphical representation of the output, (5) study of convection in the melt pool to determine its shape,  (6) fabrication of three different types of samples and measurements of microstructure, residual stresses and distortions, and (7) computer simulation of the samples using all models developed under the program for their verification.  A thermo-mechanical code ABAQUS will be the primary simulation tool.  A computational fluid dynamics code, FLUENT, will be used for the study of the melt pool shape.  These models will be applicable to ground-based as well as space-based EB systems.  They will also be applicable to laser, TIG and other deposition processes.  A strategy for the commercialization of the methodology and products is discussed.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed computer simulation methodology is applicable to all material deposition processes including EBF3, laser, TIG and traditional welding.  NASA has identified several in-space applications of the EBF3 process ranging from near to far term; e.g., (1) on-orbit construction of space structures on the order of tens of meters to a kilometer in size, (2) the development of a small, multifunctional system that could be used to manufacture spare parts on long-duration human exploration missions, and (3) the development of a miniaturized automated system for structural health monitoring and repair.  There could be other applications not yet disclosed in open literature.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed simulation methodology is applicable to all situations where EBF3, laser or TIG process is used.  This includes fabrication of new parts, repair of localized defects in the newly manufactured parts, adding features to existing parts, refurbishment of used parts, and fabrication of functionally-graded-materials or FGM.  It is applicable to a variety of materials such as aluminum, titanium, nickel-based and other high strength alloys.  The list of potential non-NASA customers includes the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and the Army; Boeing, Lockheed Martin, GE Aircraft Engines, Pratt & Whitney, Sciaky, Acceleron; power generation and automotive industries.  Boeing and Sciaky have recently acquired new EBF3 systems.  Pratt & Whitney has targeted the application of the EBF3 technology for two of its most advanced engines; namely, the F-119 engines for the F-22 aircraft and the F-135 engines for the JSF. The U.S. Navy is exploring its application aboard ships and the Army in field units or on-site repairs.

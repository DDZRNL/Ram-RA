<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The objective of the proposed Phase II research effort is to develop advanced composite blankets for improved sound reduction in aircraft structures. Phase I successfully demonstrated the use of advanced blankets for sound transmission suppression and the applicability of the technology to aircraft interior noise control perpetuating a license agreement with a major U.S. Fortune 100 company to aggressively and expeditiously pursue product commercialization. The highest performing advanced blanket resulted in ~5 dB reduction in radiated power from an aircraft test panel. Reductions are broadband with an effective frequency range from approximately 100 to 1000 Hz resulting in decreased vibration and radiated acoustic levels across this range. The small 6-10% weight has acoustic benefits far greater than standard mass law effects. In Phase II attachment, temperature, and installation effects will be studied. Additionally, analytical design tools will be developed to automate the design process for practicing engineers making it possible to work from basic concepts and application requirements/specifications to achieve a final product which can be readily manufactured. Together the proven design concepts of Phase I and those proposed in Phase II represent the future in aircraft insulation in terms of acoustic performance, cost, weight, airframe integration, and passenger safety.
<P> <B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 
  150 words)<BR>
  NASA applications for advanced aircraft blankets with improved low frequency 
  sound transmission attenuation compliment all aircraft and aviation agenda. 
  The commercial potential is extensive throughout the US commercial and military 
  markets resulting in an immediate economic competitive advantage of the US aircraft 
  industry worldwide. They are cost effective, compact, lightweight, configurations 
  not only satisfying the latest toxicity and flammability requirements, but benefiting 
  from minimal integration issues due to similarities in shape and form of current 
  blanket systems. We will work closely with our team members of NEVA Associates, 
  Boeing Aircraft Company and the relevant blanket product supplier to determine 
  the application requirements and limitations and product manufacturing parameters 
  respectively. 
<P><br>
  Potential applications include NASA's Airspace Systems Program and Vehicle Systems 
  Program. Both would benefit from overall reduction in cabin noise levels in 
  aircraft transport vehicles. Additional applications include space vehicles 
  and structures such as the Space Station and the Space Shuttle. <br>
<P> <B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, 
  approximately 150 words)<BR>
  Successful execution of this project will result in an immediate and widespread 
  application throughout the US commercial and general military industries. During 
  Phase II, professional relationships will be built with material and blanket 
  product suppliers to determine application requirements, limitations, and manufacturing 
  parameters. SMD has discussed the details of the advanced concept with a major 
  material manufacturer who currently supplies a variety of products to the US 
  military for use in personnel protection and they have agreed to provide viability 
  assessments and probable route to market for the most promising SMD candidate 
  materials. <br>
  <br>
  Market segments which will benefit from advanced blanket concepts are divided 
  into military, architectural, industrial, commercial, and original equipment 
  manufacturers (O.E.M.s). Some potential Non-NASA Applications include: (1) Military: 
  Fabric Shelters, Naval Engine Noise, HVAC, Hummer Noise Control, Mobile Medical 
  Units and Hospitals (2) Industrial: Manufacturing Fans, Blowers, Compressors, 
  CNC's, HVAC (3) OEM: Trucks/Tractor Trailers, Commercial Floor Cleaners, Bank 
  Equipment, Compressors. <br>

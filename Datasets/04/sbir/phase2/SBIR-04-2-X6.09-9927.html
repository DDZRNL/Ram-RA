<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Combining smart sensor with wireless technology is a compelling addition to structure a large-scale smart sensor networks for real-time data acquisition, distributed detection and estimations. This requires a distributed data acquisition and control system containing edge-sensing devices to interact with different types of sensors, which poses significant challenges to the system architect.  Mobitrum is proposing an innovative solution to fill the gap between sensing devices and data acquisition system by offering an end-to-end architecture and methods to interface with edge devices and to present data that they generated. The effort includes: (1) Object-oriented approach to interfaces with standard-based smart sensors and smart transducer interface modules (STIM), (2) Advanced intelligent data acquisition and control, (3) Sensor health assessment, (4) Data management and intelligent sensor fusion across local and mobile computational platforms. The significance of the innovation is that the new system can significantly lower the cost and increase the capabilities to improve remote testing and safety assurance.

Mobitrum's wireless data acquisition and control system will enable the NASA Space Transportation Test facility to be more effective in data input, manipulation, and distribution activities as well as design and engineering collaboration. NASA will benefit from the following proposed technologies: (1) Field communications device for spatial data input, manipulation and distribution; (2) Sensor, measurement, and field verification applications; (3) Condition-aware applications; (4) Location-aware applications; (5) Biometric identification applications; (6) Data collaboration and distribution applications; and (7) Wireless instrumentation for robotic manipulation and positioning for audio and visual capture, and real-time multimedia representation.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The opportunity for the wireless data acquisition and control technology is a key element for future wireless content service providers. The proposed technology can provide enhanced wireless data acquisition and control in a variety of applications such as the following: (1) Utility and remote meter reading; (2) RFID for tracking and personal public warning; (3) Building automation systems for real-time monitoring and control of security and surveillance systems, alarms, HVAC, etc., (4) Manufacturing and distribution for industrial automation using RFID;(5) Health care for wireless monitoring equipment; and (6) Distributed GIS and services.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
We propose to develop a radiation tolerant/hardened signal processing node, which effectively utilizes state-of-the-art commercial semiconductors plus our innovative space radiation mitigation. Building on our Phase I success, a unique combination of DSP and FPGA hardware and software will be demonstrated, including in space radiation environments. The resulting product will enable dramatically improved on board signal processing capabilities.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The technology and products evolving from this SBIR program can be used directly on a variety of future NASA space exploration missions. These may include Mars rovers and orbiters, JIMO, New Millenium, New Horizons-Pluto express/Kuiper belts, and manned lunar programs.
<br>In addition, applications include lunar reconnaisance orbiter, Phoenix, Dawn,Earth Science platforms and space science missions, including: the Space Shuttle, International Space Station, earth science mission platforms (CINDI, Hydros, CALIPSO, AIM, CloudSat,Aquarius,TWINS), and next-generation TDRSS spacecraft.  Products evolving from this SBIR will enable affordable, survivable, high performance communications on future programs such as LDCM, Ocean Vector Winds, and space interferometry.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The technology and products developed under this SBIR program have the same benefits for applications in the DoD and private sectors that it has for NASA.  There are a wide range of DoD programs with requirements for very high on board data and signal processing.  These include new LEO and GEO space platforms such as AEHF, GPS follow ons, RADARSATs, the transformational satellite (TSAT) and advanced  polar system (APS) satellite.  Other  applications include both DoD and NRO intelligence/reconnaisance satellites and the DoD weather satellites (DMSP). Other non-DoD US Government applications include the fleet of LEO and GEO weather satellites operated by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
<br>Private sector applications include telecommunication satellites and foreign government and commercial space systems (ESA, CNES, JAXA).

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Previous high temperature magnetic bearings employed electromagnets only. The work proposed in this SBIR program seeks to utilize High Temperature Permanent Magnets (HTPM) developed by EEC. This will improve efficiency since the majority of the static load on any bearing can be suspended by the magnetic field of the HTPM. 
<br>
<br>The end product will be a high speed/high temperature/high load test platform for the future development of bearing, motor, generator, and seal components.  This capability will be of special benefit to the aerospace and process machinery industries. In addition the component demonstrations from this SBIR will provide designers with the confidence needed to integrate similar components in their high performance machinery.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Following are potential NASA commercial applications for high temperature magnetic bearings:
<br>(1) Enable lighter weight, higher temperature gas turbine engines and other machinery to operate effectively in hostile, high temperature environments such as the surface of Venus, and for propulsion and energy storage.
<br>(2) Power generation systems for space needs in Brayton cycle and other systems.
<br>(3) High temperature motor-generators
<br>(4) Deep space exploration that requires nuclear power utilizing Brayton and Sterling engines.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
High temperature magnetic bearings operate at high temperature under vacuum with low bearing drag, and would benefit use in aerospace applications for energy storage/attitude control flywheels. High temperature magnetic bearings can operate continuously at high temperatures and therefore could be used in turbines for advanced Army tanks engine designs as well as in turbines and expansion engines used in the chemical processing industries. High temperature magnetic bearings operating at and above 1000<SUP>o</SUP>F could be used in aircraft generators directly integral to high-pressure regions of aircraft engines in advanced designs. Additionally, high temperature magnetic bearings can be used in turbomachinery in conventional power generation applications.

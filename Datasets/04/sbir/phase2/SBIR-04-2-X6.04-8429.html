<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
There is a need to develop electromechanical actuators to improve
<br>performance beyond that of hydraulic devices currently being used in
<br>numerous aerospace and industrial applications. Beginning with NASA-provided performance specifications, this Phase I SBIR effort has employed a systems approach to develop and optimize the design of an electromechanical linear actuator appropriate for demanding launch vehicle thrust vector and control surface applications. The actuator system design consists of a high-efficiency permanent magnet motor with redundant current channels for system fault tolerance, multiple high-bandwidth controllers that are matched to motor characteristics, and a compact roller-screw mechanism, along with housing and supporting elements. A system of innovations was necessary to overcome the inherent limitations of today's electromechanical actuators, which were developed based on the limitations of traditional motors, power electronics, and available actuator hardware. The projected weight of the actuator prototype to be built in Phase II is less than the existing hydraulic systems currently in use by NASA, and half of previous electric prototypes having the same performance specification. Working with a major aerospace company partner, the Phase II Team will deliver a tested prototype actuator system as a basis for future advanced commercial products.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed scalable technology will result in linear and rotary motor,
<br>generator and electromechanical actuators for a broad range of NASA
<br>applications, including: crew and cargo launch vehicles, Crew Exploration
<br>Vehicle, Upper Stages, Earth Departure Stage, Lunar Surface Access Module
<br>and lunar rovers. Specific subsystems include: Auxiliary Power Units, Air
<br>Conditioning Compressors, spacecraft door and hatch opening actuators, and
<br>high-bandwidth servo-motors for numerous control and robotic applications. A wide range of lunar base and space exploration applications would benefit, given that all such systems will need to minimize weight, be fault tolerant and maximize energy efficiency.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Non-NASA military and civilian applications for the proposed technology
<br>include: civilian and military aircraft thrust vector linear actuators,
<br>actuators for Wing Leading and Trailing Edge (Flap and Slat actuators),
<br>Electric Brake Actuators, Landing Gear Retract & Door Actuators, aircraft
<br>carrier blast deflectors, tail hook actuators, Aircraft Power Generators /
<br>APU's, thrust reverser actuators, door and hatch opening linear actuators,
<br>earth moving equipment, motion simulation platforms, industrial presses, and high-bandwidth linear and rotary servo-motors (with linear elements removed)for numerous industrial and military control and robotic applications.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Noise mitigation for subsonic transports is a continuing high priority, and recent work has identified successful exhaust mixing enhancement devices (chevrons) that have demonstrated substantial capability for reducing aircraft engine noise in critical takeoff and landing conditions.  Existing fixed-geometry chevrons, however, are inherently limited to optimal noise mitigation in a single operating condition and also can impose significant performance penalties in cruise flight.  An adaptive geometry chevron using embedded smart structures technology offers the possibility of maximizing engine performance while retaining and possibly enhancing the favorable noise characteristics of current designs.  Phase I identified a promising candidate for a variable geometry chevron using high force Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuators.  Building on coupled CFD/finite element modeling predicting successful performance, subscale demonstration-level actuated chevrons were constructed that yielded the required deflections in both benchtop and low speed wind tunnel tests.  Phase I also identified and tested new high temperature SMA (HTSMA) materials technology to enable the devices to operate in both low temperature (fan) and high temperature (core) exhaust flows.  The proposed Phase II effort will continue development of this technology and demonstrate extension of this concept to operation at full-scale stiffness levels and at realistic dynamic pressure and temperature conditions.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
By providing highly innovative concepts for propulsion system components for subsonic jet transports, the proposed effort will directly support a range of NASA goals, including flight demonstration of noise alleviation technologies.  The chief technical output of the effort will be enabling technology, design data, and prototypes for a variable geometry devices to replace the promising but limited current generation of fixed-geometry chevrons.  Extensions of this HTSMA device technology could also permit powerplant performance optimization for prospective high altitude long endurance aircraft, as well as broadly applicable methods for analysis and design of smart-materials-based propulsion flow control systems.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
A successful Phase I/Phase II effort will open the door to prototype testing and eventual implementation of flight-qualified SMA adaptive chevron hardware.   The most direct beneficiary would be next generation subsonic transports that could incorporate high-force, all-electric exhaust mixing control systems into power plants with an optimal balance of reduced noise and improved performance. Successful implementation in this application would also lead to spinoff developments in a number of actuation tasks, including aerodynamic controls and thrust vectoring for both civil and military applications such as high speed aircraft and missile systems.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Many wireless technologies are already available for sensor applications. It is inevitable that many non-interoperable wireless technologies between 400 MHz and 5.8 GHz will be deployed for wireless sensor applications. As a result, monitoring across different wireless interfaces will become a challenge for sensor data collection and management due to lack of interoperability between them.  Mobitrum is proposing a dynamically adjust transceiver that uses a waveform-DNA approach similar to a process of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) coding structure used in medical world. This effort addresses important technology gap for interfacing with various wireless sensor networks and transmitting/receiving data over short and long distances. This effort will include: (1) Finding the waveforms of RF signals, (2) Reading/comparing the waveform, and (3) Controlling the waveform.  The waveforms of the interested RF signals are pre-digitized and stored in the transceiver to compare with the one that is actually received through a wideband antenna.  Once the type of a waveform is identified, the intelligent software in the transceiver will configure its RF characteristics to adapt wireless interface dynamically.  The proposed enabling technology will provide NASA an effective wireless device for Earth science, data relay, and other situational awareness.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Adaptive transceiver for wireless networked sensors will enable NASA's Earth sciences for spatial data input, manipulation and distribution activities as well as design and engineering collaboration to be more effective. Mobitrum anticipates the following applications that NASA will benefit from the proposed adaptive wireless transceiver technology: 1) Disaster recovery; 2) Field communications device for spatial data input, manipulation and distribution; 3) Sensor, measurement, and field verification applications; 4) Biometric identification applications; 5) Data collaboration and distribution applications; 6) Condition-aware applications; 7) Location-aware applications; and 8) first responders.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The opportunity for adaptive wireless technology lays in future wireless networks and communications. There are tremendous business applications and deployments for cellular 4G networks based on adaptive radios beyond 2004. Mobitrum anticipates the increasing popularity of mobile handheld including PDA/Cell phones brings with it an exciting opportunities for the adaptive radio, which will serve a key factor to make handheld deployable throughout heterogeneous wireless networks whether for corporations or for individuals. As a result, "true mobility" is created through the programmable radio bands. Therefore, more value-added services are deployable and increase revenue to wireless service providers and handheld makers.

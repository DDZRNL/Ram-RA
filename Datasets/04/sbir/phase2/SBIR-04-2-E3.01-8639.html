<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
We propose to implement a constraint-based data integration system for wildfire intelligence, for use during both the pre-planning and event response phases of wildfire fighting.  Our system will automatically integrate online, heterogeneous data sources and hyperspectral imagery.  Current technology tends to focus mostly on the event response phases and supports only limited types of integration, usually between structured databases.  With the emergence of the Internet, there now exists an enormous number of other online information sources that can be combined with local databases and satellite imagery, including NASA MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) products, in order to better assist human analysis.  In this Phase II proposal, we will implement the constraint-based data integration system for wildfire intelligence that we designed in Phase I. The system will allow users  to manage large amounts of data from heterogeneous sources using a single interface, to annotate and extend that data (to add a layer of "knowledge" on top of the data), as well as to quickly identify data updates.  The resulting application will complement existing technologies, and serve as a rich, integrated interface that allows one to more easily and quickly plan for, analyze, and react to wildfires.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The research disseminates the work currently being done by scientists in the Ecological Forecasting Group at NASA Ames, complementing the past investment NASA has made in this work.  Our proposed wildfire intelligence portal will leverage emerging NASA MODIS products and combine that data with data from other sources, so as to add a richer layer of knowledge to the existing products.  Our proposed system, when implemented and deployed, will give NASA scientists the opportunity to gather feedback about the applicability of those products.   Based on evaluations from domain experts, NASA will be able to better assess its practicality and may be able to gain detailed domain knowledge that can help refine and extend its current product set.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The research has a direct application to a series of industry-specific, vertical portals that we are designing, such as a portal for sporting goods intelligence ("Sports InSite").  The next-generation of our constraint-based integration technology will serve as the infrastructure for the front-ends to these vertical portals and allow us greater flexibility and automation during development and deployment.  Other aspects of our Phase II work, such as implementation of support for user-defined extensions and automatic highlighting of new information, also have direct commerical relevance, as these needs are ubiquitous in portal systems.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
This proposal is specifically written to address the need for improved L and P band T/R modules for use in active microwave surveillance of earth surface and atmosphere.  The solicitation called for investigation and development of core technologies that will significantly improve T/R module performance.  Improvements needed include reduced power consumption, mass, size and increased data rates.  Hittite Microwave Corporation is a fabless semiconductor company that has been developing microwave monolithic integrated circuits (MMIC) for over 19 years.  The T/R module circuit functions are diverse imposing several different process requirements.  For example the key process specification for the LNA is the minimum noise figure (Fmin) of the process, for the control functions the switch cutoff frequency, and for the PA the power added efficiency.  Hittite has focused on developing E/D PHEMT processes and simulations presented in this Phase II proposal are based on models from a new Triquint E/D PHEMT process.  The E/D process is promising as a work horse process offering overall superior performance for LNAs, PAs, and control components.  Hittite will use the Phase II program to design and develop and fabricate an efficient single chip T/R solution for the array application.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed program will lead to development of highly integrated MMIC chips for phased array applications operating at 1.25 GHz.  While the MMIC chips will be designed with the goal of applications in space, those designs will provide a design baseline for MMIC products that will find applications in phased array applications including low earth orbit (LEO) synthetic aperture radars (SAR) used for measurements of surface characteristics such as deformation and strain.  The proposed program will support introduction of low-cost alternatives for phased array T/R modules.  These products have a potential of generating amounts to $10-$30 million dollars of additional revenue for the company.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed program will lead to development of highly integrated MMIC chips for phased array applications operating at 1.25 GHz.  While the MMIC chips will be designed with the goal of applications in space, those designs will provide a design baseline for MMIC products that will find applications in other phased array radar applications including high-capacity data communications equipment such as internet connection for commercial airplanes.  The proposed program will support introduction of low-cost alternatives for highly integrated synthesizers.  These products have a potential of generating amounts to $10-$30 million dollars of additional revenue for the company.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		High-bandwidth, Radiation Hardening, low-power, low-EMI, easily reconfigurable and upgradeable transponder-based interconnects between processor nodes, subsystems, and blocks are of utmost importance for the achievement of high performance computing on orbit and for providing reliable electronic systems in natural space and terrestrial radiation environments. In response to the described needs, we will develop a novel, monolithic radiation-tolerant transponder, which will be integrated into a hermetically-sealed pigtailed multi-chip module, containing opto-electrical and electro-optical components. Module will be featuring FPGA-friendly parallel interface and will provide an improved radiation tolerance, high data rate, low power consumption, and advanced functionality. The developed ASIC transponder will utilize our patent-pending high-speed current-mode logic library of TID-tolerant-by-technology and SEU/SEE-tolerant-by-architecture cells.  8B10B encoding will be used to achieve data disparity equal to 0, optimize performance of the optical receiver, and perform a reliable clock recovery. The encoder and decoder will utilize our patented radiation tolerant half-rate architecture. A fully functional module will be delivered and tested at the end of Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The developed technology will be critical to all space programs performed by DOD and will have a great impact on the TacSat development. The proposed solution provides a scaled-down, simple design that can be used and reused, and will save precious development time and resources while giving system engineers plenty of flexibilities. NORT commercial version will be a critical component for upgrading private/enterprise networks, reducing latency while transferring data from memory storage to individual users including production of motion pictures, intra-hospital networks, inventory management, last mile fiber at home, oil industry (well management), and a variety of other applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The successful accomplishment of this project will result in the development of a compact RH ASIC or MCM, which has the potential to revolutionize intra-spacecraft system development for near Earth and deep Space exploration. The universal software-reconfigurable interface will not only speed-up the system's design and assembly process, but will open the way for the implementation of a true Plug and Play architecture and in-situ hardware adaptation. This is extremely important for the realization of future innovative concepts for space exploration over the next decade. The immediate NASA applications for the developed technology include: CEV, CLV, Lunar Lender, and Lunar Outposts.

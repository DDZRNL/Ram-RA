		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Manned planetary exploration has become re-invigorated, thanks to President Bush's recent call for a lunar base to be established within two decades and manned landing on Mars sometime after 2030. Such exciting explorations will demand innovative technologies for the next round of manned exploration of space.
One such technology that is desired to be advanced is LIDAR  the LIght Detection And Ranging, for which SMI and Cornell University jointly proposed to develop a 1 x 10 electrically switched silicon nano-optic switch/multiplexer for use with high power lasers in LIDAR systems, especially the fiber-based fixed-array laser transmitter for use in NASA planetary explorations. Specifically, we have invented a few approaches to minimize optical absorption and optical loss in silicon nano-photonics and extend the applicability of silicon from infrared into visible and near-infrared spectrum with wavelengths shorter than 1100nm. These methods will serve as the groundwork for striding progress in Phase II.
The prototype 1x16 photonic switch array will have < 10 nano-second switching time, < 3dB optical loss, complete temperature stabilization circuit, electronics driver circuits, and can transmit greater than 200 micro-Joules transmission over 5 nano-second pulse at 10 kHz repetition rate for LIDAR applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Chemical concentrations can be analyzed using a DIfferential Absorption Lidar (DIAL). A Doppler LIDAR is used to measure the velocity of a target. These LIDAR devices also have wide-ranging civilian uses, such as range finding in civilian aviation and land topography, wind and atmospheric monitoring using Doppler LIDAR, and environmental chemical monitoring using DIAL as well as in Homeland security applications.

		<BR>
		Elevation measurements for manned and unmanned landing vehicles on the moon and on Mars.

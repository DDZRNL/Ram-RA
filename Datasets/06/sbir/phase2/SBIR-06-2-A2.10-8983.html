		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Development of a new generation of high speed rotorcraft has been hampered by both an absence of strong predictive methods for rotors operating at very high advance ratio and a dearth of relevant test data.  Phase I initiated work on these challenges with rotor tests and development of enhanced analyses for high speed flight.  Phase I testing produced useful data on model scale autorotating rotors at advance ratios up to 1.7, thereby supporting analysis development and laying the groundwork for further Phase II testing.  Enhanced yawed flow models for comprehensive rotorcraft analyses were also investigated and an enhanced lifting surface blade/wake model was developed and validated for improved modeling in this regime.  Additionally, Phase I studied CFD grid generation and flow analysis methods for improved modeling of reversed and strong spanwise flows.  Phase II will see further high advance ratio rotor tests, up to 2.5, and CFD analysis supporting the development of new validated models suitable for extreme yawed flow.  These new models will be incorporated into CDI's commercial rotorcraft aerodynamics software for immediate use in rotorcraft design and flight simulation codes.  A hierarchy of models will be developed supporting applications ranging from high resolution CFD to real-time simulation.

		<BR>
		There is currently significant interest in high speed rotorcraft concepts within DOD, as well as among several civil developers.  This interest has sparked ambitious and high risk/high payoff projects.  Examples include the Sikorsky X2 co-axial rotor and the Groen Brothers/DARPA slowed-rotor heliplane.  The test data and analytical enhancements proposed here would provide critical support in the design and evaluation of these concepts.  In addition, the analysis and test data would facilitate design and assessment of other compound aircraft and unmanned vehicle concepts utilizing slowed rotors to reduce noise and improve cruise performance while maintaining an efficient hovering capability.  The hierarchy of solutions would support both analysis of new concepts and the development of high fidelity flight simulations and trainers for new high speed/slowed rotor aircraft.

		8.	The proposed effort directly responds to NASA's SBIR solicitation goal of developing validated physics-based multidisciplinary computational tools applicable to the design, analysis and optimization of rotorcraft aerodynamics.  Specifically addressed is the solicitation request for improved modeling of high speed and slowed rotor concepts.  This project will provide timely support for projected technology integration work of the Integrated Variable Speed Rotorcraft Concept presently being conducted by NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) through 2011.  The proposed effort is structured to produce valuable unique test data on aerodynamic characteristics of high speed rotors as well as analysis enhancements supporting their design, particularly V/STOL aircraft utilizing a slowed-rotor system.  The project will yield software for use by NASA and industry personnel - compatible with standard tools such as the OVERFLOW, CAMRAD II, and FUN3D solvers - in supporting such design and assessment activities and complement design work on variable speed propulsion systems.

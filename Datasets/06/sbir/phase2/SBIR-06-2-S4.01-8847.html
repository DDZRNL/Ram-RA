		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are the key components for digitizing high-speed analog data in modern data acquisition systems, which is a critical part of sensor/detector array readout electronics widely used by NASA. Unfortunately, commercially available ADCs consume high power and feature high system latency and poor linearity; especially at input bandwidths larger than 1GHz. In addition, these ADCs are not radiation tolerant due to the utilized process technologies and thus are susceptible to harmful total ionization dose and single event upset effects. Thus, they do not satisfy NASA's low-power, radiation tolerant, and high bandwidth (>20GHz) requirements. In response to the described needs, we propose to develop a monolithic high input bandwidth, radiation tolerant analog-to-digital converter (HIBRA), which will be implemented into a sealed metal-ceramic microwave package with an FPGA-friendly parallel interface and will feature an improved radiation tolerance, high sampling rate, extremely high input bandwidth, and advanced functionality. The ADC will utilize ADSANTEC's high-speed current-mode logic library of Total Ionization Dose-tolerant-by-technology and proprietary architectural cells.  The fully functional ASIC will be fabricated in IBM SiGe technology at the end of Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The developed technology will be critical to all space programs performed by NASA and DOD and will have a great impact on Space Based Radar development. Our solution provides a scaled down, simple design that can be used and reused, and will save NASA and DOD development time and resources while giving system engineers plenty of flexibility in space craft development. HIBRA's commercial version will be a critical component in the upgrade of measurement instrumentation, advanced telescope ground system development, wireless and fiber-optics communications, and other applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The successful accomplishment of this project will result in the development of an ultra-wide band ADC, which will revolutionize spectrometer system development for near Earth and deep Space exploration. The universal, user friendly, LVDS interface will not only speed-up the system's design and assembly process, but will open the way for the implementation of a true Plug-and-Play architecture and in-situ hardware adaptation. This is extremely important for the realization of future innovative concepts for space exploration over the next decade. The immediate NASA applications of the developed technology include: VESPER, SIGNAL, CAMEO.

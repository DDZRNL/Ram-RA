		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The potential benefits of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) for aerodynamics and combustion simulation hvae largely been missed, due to the complexity of generating grids for complex topologies, and the requirement for boundary fitted grids which reduce the accuracy of the method. The Phase 2 Program builds on the Cartesian grid LES flow solver developed under Phase 1, and includes new techologies such as immersed boundary conditions, multigrid code acceleration, compressibility, and advanced subgrid scale models for turbulence and combustion. Experimental validation cases using NASA-sponsored experiments, and using actual aeroengine combustor hardware will be performed, comparing the LES flow solver results with experimental combustor exit temperatures, and with other code predictions, providing a unique opportunity for validation of the flow solver.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The aerospace and power generation industries have expressed strong interest in this approach to Large Eddy Simulation, and feel it may finally bring the benefits of the technique to practical fruition. Specific users for the Phase II LES solver include Pratt & Whitney, Siemens, Spiritech Advanced Products, UTRC, as indicated by letters of support. A diverse group of industries, including automotive, biomedical, and other propulsion groups all have key product design issues that can ba best addressed by the LES approach.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications within NASA GRC include project and test support of combustion experiments, including testing of novel fuel injector and combustor concepts as performed with P&W and GE at NASA GRC facilities. The LES flow solver will also work as a numerical framework for NASA in its on-going evaluations of physiscs-bsaed models of turbulence and combustion. The Cartesian grid approach promoted here will potentially standardize the use of LES solvers within NASA and industry, due to the reduced need for highly accurate CAD-based geometry definition of engine hardware.

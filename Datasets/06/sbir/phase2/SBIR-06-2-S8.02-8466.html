		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Supercomputing plays a major role in many areas of science and engineering, and it has had tremendous impact for decades in areas such as aerospace, defense, energy, finance, and telecommunicationsto name just a few.  Supercomputing enables many of our most important high-tech tools, and nowhere is it more important than at NASA, where attaining increased computing speed and performance at lower costs are constant objectives.  The goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is exactly thatto develop, validate, and commercialize next-generation supercomputing capabilities that provide NASA and other government/commercial users with massive increases in speed at minimal cost and with reduced energy requirements and  significant "footprint" efficiency.
In Phase I of this NASA SBIR project, Accelogic successfully demonstrated the feasibility of developing the world's first reconfigurable computing linear equation (banded) solver for large-scale computing problemssuch as those seen in aerospace applicationswith greatly increased speed using an FPGA chip.  The speed attained was equivalent to 240 CPU's per FPGA chip for banded systemswhich represents nearly a 60x computing speedup (surpassing the 50x Phase I target).  Accelogic's Phase I success sets the stage for a Phase II effort focused on prototyping/validating an initial supercomputing acceleration product.  The Phase II technical goal is to demonstrate the potential for 1,000x speedup.  
During Phase I, Accelogic has proven it is ideally positioned to capitalize upon recent advances in reconfigurable computingmany of which were attained by Accelogic's own experts.  Applications for the products targeted by this project include many that are of interest to NASA, DOD, DOE, and many commercial entities.  Based on Phase I results and the clear commercial potential, Accelogic has obtained interest/commitment letters from well-established commercial vendors and key NASA contractors, including Silicon Graphics.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to the NASA applications, many other applications are highly dependent on high-performance linear algebra, and those applications will be enabled by the acceleration levels (100x to 1,000x) targeted by Accelogic.  They include circuit simulation, financial portfolio management optimization (interior point methods and linear programming), nuclear physics, power distribution network design, and radar signal processing.  Each one these applications represents a significant market by itselfwith many of them crossing the $1 billion threshold. The ability to solve large-scale linear equations rapidly is a clear and fundamental driver for the following activities and/or industries both inside and outside of NASA:  product design and performance simulation (aerospace, automotive, defense, boats, nuclear energy, electronic chips, power networks, radar, telecommunications, acoustics, buildings and bridges, drugs, chemistry, antennas and radio systems, machinery, combustion); economic forecasting (insurance, financial markets, budgeting, hedge funds management); physical forecasting (weather, environmental engineering, geophysics); and data analysis (defense, logistics, search engines, national security, gaming, marketing).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		As leading supercomputer vendor Silicon Graphics states in its Phase III commitment and partnering letter to Accelogic, our proposed NASA Phase II work on extremely-fast linear equation solvers is expected to be "absolutely disruptive" for the High-Performance Computing and supercomputing industries, enabling a significant leap in performance for important supercomputing applications that are at the core of NASA's mission.  Those applications include CFD, structural analysis, computational molecular dynamics, chemistry, computational electromagnetics, machinery, combustion, plasma physics, weather and climate modeling, and earth sciences. These fields depend heavily on large-scale linear algebra kernels, and they have not yet seen significant benefits from the typical performance leaps of reconfigurable supercomputing, due to the difficulties that the RC community has had in achieving large speedups for linear equations.  As is highlighted in our Phase I final report,  Accelogic is the first R&D group to have demonstrated large, sustained speedups for non-toy, large-scale linear equations of relevance to the aerospace industryand particularly to NASA.

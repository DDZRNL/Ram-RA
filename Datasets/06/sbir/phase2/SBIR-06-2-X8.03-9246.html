		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In order to address the NASA lunar mission, DESC proposes to develop a proton exchange membrane (PEM) closed-loop pure oxygen fuel cell for application to lunar surface exploration, building upon DESC's expertise and fundamental demonstrations in closely related technology. Building upon the Phase I project, the static feed fuel cell hardware will be scaled up approximately three times in active area. The single-cell performance of the larger cell will be compared against the smaller cell. Sub-scale stacks will be tested for durability. The number of cells per stack will be increased as the thermal management and mass transport phenomena permit.  Thermal modeling will be conducted to predict the level of heat removal required by scaled-up stacks. Thermal management techniques will be investigated to permit effective scale-up.  Flight cell stack and system design will be undertaken at the concept level.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		DESC is pursuing several emerging markets through its Hydrogen Technology business unit.  The common element of these market opportunities is the need or desire for electrolysis-based hydrogen generation.  One of the emerging markets in the Hydrogen Technology business plan is backup power for wireless telecommunication sites.  Several fuel cell companies have already been offering backup power packages for this market.  However, the typical fueling solution has involved delivered hydrogen.  Based on the market analysis DES has conducted, this is not a practical solution for many wireless sites.  In response to this application gap, DES has been working with several fuel cell companies and backup power OEM's to specify a high pressure electrolyzer module (2,400 psi output) that will meet the recharge requirements for a fuel cell powered backup system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Based on DESC's unique experience in commercializing PEM-based products, transitioning to military and civilian aerospace applications are important outcomes of this technology development effort. Civilian commercial derivatives of this technology would be enabling technology for airship-based telecommunications systems and reliable remote power applications. Impacts of this technology on military operations include enabling high altitude unmanned aerial vehicle operations and a variety of underwater vehicle operations, especially unmanned underwater vehicles. The similarity between the high altitude and undersea applications is that both require the storage of oxidant in addition to the storage of fuel. Pure oxygen capable fuel cells are a critical need for both operating environments. The high altitude UAV's can be used for missile defense, surveillance and communications. Undersea applications include long-term distributed data gathering with long endurance buoys, transport of special forces personnel, and mine neutralization among others.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In Phase 1, CRG demonstrated the feasibility of a novel approach to prepare cyanate ester based elastomers. This approach polymerizes in-situ siloxane within a reactive elastomer precursor matrix in order to achieve an elastomeric material with highly tunable and desired mechanical properties.  This methodology shows great potential in materials development for applications such as space deployable structures, space seals, and aeroshells. Using this methodology CRG was able to show that elastomeric cyanate ester materials having a vary broad range of thermal and mechanical properties could be formulated using a relatively small amount of CRG's synthesized monomers and other low-cost, commercially available components, such as low-cost, low molecular weight silicone materials.  The cyanate ester elastomer materials exhibited excellent thermal stability, maintaining their elastomeric properties to temperatures below -100 C and as high as 300 C.  The proposed Phase 2 effort will leverage Phase 1 results and CRG's other extensive R&D in elastomeric material technologies to bring the methodology to readiness for transition to operational use.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		CRG currently has a Missile Defense Agency contract to look at innovative rocket motor insulation materials.  Aerojet has expressed an interest during that effort for the cyanate ester elastomer as a potential insulation matrix.  CRG has also discussed the material technology with Raytheon regarding using the cyanate ester elastomer as a coating for its low dielectric properties instead of the current polyurethane coating.  These are just two examples of applications, CRG sees the potential to use the cyanate ester elastomer in a variety of government and commercial applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This project's technologies directly address requirements for a variety of NASA applications, including deployable structures, exoatmospheric space seals, aeroshell deployment mechanism, and adhesives.  CRG has discussed the technology with engineers and scientist at NASA regarding specifically the seals, deployable structures, and adhesives.  There is a need for an elastomeric material that has an operational temperature ranging from -70 C, as is the case for self-deployable space structure systems and space seals, to high temperature needs 250 C, as is the case for future high speed aircraft systems.  The cyanate ester elasotmer material also is beneficial due to its resistance to space environments.

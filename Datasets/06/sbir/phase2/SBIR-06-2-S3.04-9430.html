		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR Phase II proposal introduces a fast multi-mode hyperspectral-multispectral (MM-HS-MS) sensor with programmable spectral resolution. The sensor brings the following long-waiting benefits to the remote sensor community: (i) switchable between HS and MS operations, (ii) variable spectral resolution from 10nm to 560 nm; (iii) fast frame rate (54-1,750Hz), (iv) short full spectral range data acquisition time (10-1-10-2 sec), (v) increased sensitivity (particularly in measuring weak object or scene under lunar and man-made illumination), (vi) improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and (vii) more flexible balance between the spectral image scanning speed and the data storage/processing flow rate.  Other features include: lightweight/compact size, versatile operation on orbit, low orbit, and even on ground, and low cost.  
The Phase II objective is design, assemble, and test the MM-HS-MS sensor prototype; evaluate performance pros and cons versus the state-of-the-arts; verify sensor performance against the NASA mission program; reach TRL-6, and deliver the sensor to NASA.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The sensor has wide industrial and military applications to include the following.  Biomedical applications to map fluorescence of biological tissue; Forensics and counterfeit detection; Color inspection and sorting to spectroradiometrically accurate color measurements and color uniformity determination, which can accurately be converted to the CIE color space, pixel by pixel, for quality inspection in manufacturing and color matching of parts; Paper industry: to acquire snapshot moisture profiles across paper web in paper machine; Pharmaceutical industry: to detect foreign pills based on their chemical composition in pharmaceutical production; Earth remote sensing for geology and forestry monitoring among the prominent usages; Agriculture for early detection of localized problems in crops that can be corrected by local treatment; Environmental monitoring to detect hazardous organic compounds within the atmosphere; and Food online inspection to detect bruises during fruit packing; inspect tomatoes, rice grains, seeds, or meats; or determine whether food products are sufficiently cooked.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The sensor can be used for a few programs within NASA, such as James Webb Space Telescope project, Landmark-Discovery, Vision mission, to name a few.  NASA is looking for immediate solutions to the following two unmet demands: 
1) A rapid framing camera for active decent imaging (see Mars Surveyor Lander (MSL)) which has the capability to actively change and maneuver its decent - best to maneuver the base instrument to regions of mineralogical interest;
2) A broadband, rapid, no moving parts, large spatial area, low spectral resolution camera which could serve as an initial awareness camera for region of interest surveying for something like Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO).

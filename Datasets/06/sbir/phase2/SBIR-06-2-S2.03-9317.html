		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NanoSonic has developed a nanostructured spray self-assembly manufacturing method that has resulted in ultra-lightweight (< 0.4g/cc) textile interconnects for photovoltaic arrays, durable EMI shielding (-70 dB) solar collector membranes with unprecedented flexibility (> 1000%), and multi-layer, high efficiency thermal rejection coatings for deep space missions.  NanoSonic has analyzed opportunities for its unique self-assembly processing techniques with the Photovoltaic and Space Environments Branch at NASA GRC.  Focus was placed on radiant heat barrier coatings formed as multiple organic and inorganic well-defined segments using spray-based self-assembly processing.  The spray technique allows the incorporation of materials required to achieve high coating reflectivity with low absorptivity and high emissivity over large-area NASA structures.  The low &#61537;/&#61541;&#61472;coatings will be transitioned to use on NASA deep space mission structures, near space airships and commercial rooftops and buildings.  NanoSonic has also developed ultra low mass density fabric materials with patterned conductive traces capable of conducting high electrical current densities and capable of withstanding extreme thermal (-140<SUP>o</SUP>C to 450<SUP>o</SUP>C) and mechanical environmental conditions required in deep space.  Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> textiles will be transitioned to large area photovoltaic arrays.  Such multifunctional Gossamer materials would provide adequate mechanical support and low loss electrical interconnect network functionalities for power generation arrays.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Dual use commercialization exists for nanostructured Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> perfect mirrors as the market for ultra-low absorptivity, high emmisivity coatings is large and growing, due primarily to pressing needs to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas production while conserving fossil fuels.  Spacecraft structures are an important and specialized but limited total market for high efficiency ultra-low &#61537;/&#61541; coating materials.  A significantly larger market commercial opportunity exists for similar coatings on civilian infrastructure  rooftops and buildings.  The building market is the largest single commercial market worldwide, and in the U.S., more than a third of all energy consumed is used for heating and cooling.  Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> nanocomposites and textiles serve as conducting electrodes for high strain mechanical actuator and sensor devices, and low-weight, electrically conductive and mechanically flexible coatings for systems requiring physically-robust electromagnetic shielding, ground planes or electrical interconnection.  NanoSonic offers a unique alternative to metal foil and metal-coated polymer materials.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications for Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> multilayer metal-dielectric perfect mirrors include ultra-lightweight, high efficiency radiant heat barrier coatings or collectors for thermoelectric devices and protective coatings against electrostatic charging, EMI, radiation, and abrasion for deep space exploration missions.  Reducing the effects of solar gain would reduce the power, weight and system complexity needed to cool critical components and compensate for large-scale structural distortion and attitude variation.  At the systems level, the spacecraft power budget would be reduced, because a significant portion of power expenditure is related to compensating for unwanted thermal effects.  Ultra-low modulus Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> membranes would serve as durable solar concentrator membranes with the added benefit of EMI shielding and unsurpassed flexibility.  Highly electrically conductive Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> textiles serve as flexible, super lightweight PV array interconnect materials.  NanoSonic's spray ESA process is an economically feasible option for manufacturing multilayer nanostructured stacks and shielding coatings for large area space structures.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Paragon Space Development Corporation proposes to develop a single-loop, non-toxic, active pumped radiator design with robust, reliable operation near stagnation regimes as expected to be experienced by NASA's Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) and thermal control systems of the Lunar Base at the lunar pole.  This will be achieved through an innovative use of a common terrestrial-application, safe fluid that has lower temperature stalling characteristics over typical space-based radiator fluids.  Phase 1 has already shown this fluid to stall per predictions and, through a previous contract, Paragon has demonstrated its capability to perform spacecraft heat rejection.  The significance of this work is to understand stagnation behavior, both planned and mitigated, and then design and demonstrate a robust and reliable radiator performance based on this knew found knowledge.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Paragon has identified several commercial entities pursuing the development of orbital transportation vehicles and services.  As the space industry has grown, commercial applications include not only support of the International Space Station through the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program but also tourism.  Specifically, the development work proposed here will address thermal control in low power, cold conditions that occur at such mission phases as long-term docking on the ISS or space hotels.  For this reason, initial research indicates that the proposed radiator functionality is highly competitive in the target areas.  And in fact, given the strong teaming relationships that Paragon has with industry-recognized companies such as COTS teams Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) and Rocketplane Kistler (Paragon is on both teams) and as Bigelow's space hotels, Paragon can readily incorporate this more robust radiator capability as required, increasing the fidelity of the commercial products sooner.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In the Manned Space Market, Paragon's initial market for a stagnation robust radiator is NASA and its prime contractors developing thermal control systems for the LSAM and the base on the lunar poles as part of the President's Vision for Space Exploration.  Developing a thermal control strategy that is robust and reliable in low power operations while residing in a cold environment is absolutely required to successfully and safely achieve the mission of returning crews to the moon by 2020 as stipulated by NASA's Global Exploration Strategy and Lunar Architecture, released in December of last year.

NASA applications include the following:

·        Human rated spacecraft applications such as LSAM, Orion

·        Thermal control for a Lunar Base at the lunar pole

·        Variable power spacecraft applications

·        Interplanetary space vehicles

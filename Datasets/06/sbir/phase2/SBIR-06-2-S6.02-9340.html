		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		AdvR, Inc. proposes the development of a highly efficient, fiber pigtailed, waveguide-based UV frequency converter module.  This UV module will be an important element in future NASA sponsored Doppler lidar and High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) aerosol missions.  The key innovation is the use of dual-element periodically poled waveguides embedded in a nonlinear optical substrate.  This innovation results in a vast improvement in the measurement capabilities of lidar systems by enabling the use of a single stabilized laser to both operate a high power transmitter and generate low power frequency tripled light for synchronous calibration and frequency locking of the Fabry Perot filter on the lidar receiver.  To be used in a space-based system, the UV module must be rugged and must perform optimally in a radiation environment over the mission lifetime.  To achieve this goal, the proposed dual-element structure will be packaged in a compact, robust fiber-pigtailed package which will readily lend itself to future space qualification for mechanical stability of the package and radiation damage resistance of the non-linear optical material.

		<BR>
		AdvR's development of a non-linear dual-element periodically poled waveguide is the basis for a robust UV source.  By enabling a single-pass configuration in a sealed, compact package, the resulting UV lasers can be cost effectively mass produced, and provide end-users with convenient hands-off operation.  This technology will enable new applications including wildland fire assessment, bathymetry, weather and water quality assessment, as well as being used in highly effective blood coagulation tools, time-of-flight fluorescence spectroscopy systems, and sources for optical lithography.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary near-term NASA application for the fiber pigtailed UV converter module is in Goddard Space Flight Center's Tropospheric Wind Lidar Technology Experiment (TWiLiTE) project, an instrument that measures the Doppler shift of aerosols in order to measure wind speed.  Beyond the TWiLiTE demonstration the UV module with its capability to produce, highly efficient, light in the ultra-violet region will be an important technology for future NASA Doppler lidar and High-Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) aerosol missions. Incorporation in TWiLiTE will be a system level validation of the approach to advance the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for the future NASA space based lidar system development. The Atmospheric Sciences Competency (AtSC)/Chemistry Dynamics Branch (CDB) at the NASA Langley Center also uses a similar lidar system that will benefit from a robust efficient UV converter module.

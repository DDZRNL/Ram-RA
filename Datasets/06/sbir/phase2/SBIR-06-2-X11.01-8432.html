		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Phase I project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the vapor compression hybrid two-phase loop (VCHTPL). The test results showed the high temperature-lift capability and robust operation under transient heat loads of the VCHTPL. At the end of Phase I, the VCHTPL technology reached the NASA's defined Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 (Component/breadboard validation in a laboratory environment).

The principal Phase II objective is to elevate the VCHTPL technology to NASA's Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6: System/subsystem prototype demonstration in a relevant environment. This will be achieved through addressing the key technical and integration issues identified in Phase I of the proposed program. During Phase II, multiple generations of hardware will be designed, fabricated and tested to demonstrate the capability of the vapor compression loop technology in meeting the thermal performance, form factor, mass and reliability requirements for NASA's lunar missions. Five technical tasks plus a reporting task are planned to achieve the Phase II technical objectives.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The VCHTPL technology also has broad applicability in military and commercial terrestrial markets. The characteristics of the technology such as the high heat flux capability, compact/lightweight structure, high degrees of simplicity and reliability, make it an attractive choice of cooling solution for the following terrestrial markets/applications:

	Commercial microprocessor diagnostic equipment cooling. Current solution uses pumped single phase cooling which becomes inadequate at higher heat fluxes. In addition, the cooling solution is required able to dissipate the heat at sub ambient temperatures.
	Commercial server farms/data centers. Current standard technologies are air-cooling and HVAC.
	Commercial telecommunication equipment enclosures (indoor and outdoor). Current standard technologies are air-cooling and HVAC.
	Military and civilian land vehicles (vehicle environmental control system, power electronics, optoelectronics, electrical converters, drives and motors, fuel cell reformers and stacks). Current standard technologies are air cooling, HVAC or pumped liquid cooling.
	Military aerial vehicles (electronics onboard high altitude UAV, power electronics onboard All Electric Fighter Jets, directed energy weapons). Current standard technology is pumped fuel cooling.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The current standard aerospace two-phase thermal management devices are axially grooved aluminum/ammonia heat pipes. Loop heat pipes and capillary pumped loops are increasingly be used in spacecraft thermal control. Pumped single-phase loops have also been used, for example, in the Mars robotic exploration systems, and are being considered for use in the nuclear-electric propulsion system heat rejection subsystems. The hybrid two-phase loop is an emerging technology for high performance thermal management, which competes with the LHP and CPL technologies. 

More specifically, the lunar surface missions will require compact and high performance heat acquisition, transport and dissipation systems with a high temperature lifting capability to reject heat to the hot lunar environment. The vapor compression hybrid two-phase loop (VCHTPL) technology will provide a crucial solution for the NASA systems which require temperature lift and refrigeration for lunar missions.

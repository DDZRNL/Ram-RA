		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Cornerstone Research Group Inc. (CRG) will develop new shape memory polymer (SMP) deployment mechanisms for actuating thermal protection system (TPS) panels to create a deployable, large surface area aeroshell.  This innovation will exploit Veriflex(R) -- CRG's high-performance SMP material -- to create a low-mass actuation system for a deployable aeroshell design.  Veriflex(R)-based mechanisms will deploy the aeroshell without the use of motors, springs, or mechanical controls.  These simple, self-deploying, self-aligning mechanisms will reduce the mass and the complexity of the aeroshell design. Veriflex(R)-based deployment mechanisms will enable use of panels made from existing TPS materials to create a large surface area aeroshells that will stow in a highly compact pre-launch and storage configuration and then self-deploy before entry to the operational configuration.  The TPS panels will deploy outward and increase the diameter of the aeroshell.  For every 10 percent increase in the diameter, there will be a 21 percent increase in the total surface area of the aeroshell.  The relative volume of space needed to stow the entry vehicle would not increase.  This innovation directly addresses the need for aeroassist/aerocapture technology for planetary exploration spacecraft as defined by subtopic S7.04 of NASA SBIR/STTR Solicitation 2006-1.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This project's technologies developed for NASA systems would also directly apply to deployable subsystems for spacecraft operated by other Government and commercial enterprises.  This project's deployment technologies will be easily tailorable to actuation of instrument booms, instrument covers, and solar arrays for a wide variety of remote sensor and communication spacecraft.  Furthermore, materials and design modifications could prove the technology's suitability for a myriad of applications in terrestrial and air vehicles, including drag reduction to drag modification, stabilization and control, and boundary layer control on airfoils and other vehicle bodies.

		<BR>
		Supporting NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate and addressing NASA's need for aeroassist/aerocapture technology for planetary exploration spacecraft as defined by subtopic S7.04 of NASA SBIR/STTR Solicitation 2006-1, this project's technologies enable low mass, large surface area deployable aeroshells for providing aerocapture functionality for future planetary exploration missions similar to the Phoenix Lander, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and Mars Science Laboratory.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced Scientific Concepts, Inc. (ASC) has developed a 128 x 128 frame, 3D Flash LADAR video camera which produces 3-D point clouds at 30 Hz. Flash LADAR captures an entire frame of data from a single pulse of light, therefore platform motion and vibration will not affect the measurements.  This is not true for any other laser-ranging system, such as scanning LIDAR.  Additionally, with no moving parts, the system is smaller, lighter, and requires less power than traditional approaches. The Phase I project used an ASC camera at the JPL mars yard to gather test data. Hazard Identification, and Entry Decent and Landing applications were investigated. These data sets were taken and delivered to JPL.  The analysis demonstrates that a Flash LADAR system can resolve landing hazards and is suitable as an EDL sensor.  This data, together with inputs from JPL scientists, was used to develop a brassboard camera concept for NASA applications. The optimized camera will be fabricated and delivered in Phase II.  This sensor will not be spaced qualified, but the Hi-Reliabilty module developed for phase II will be the first step.  Space qualification will be the next necessary step for Flash LADAR.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The compact, low power 3D Flash LADAR Camera developed on this project will have direct applications to collision avoidance and navigation for military autonomous air and ground vehicles. These cameras will also be directly applicable to terrain mapping for military and commercial applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The 3D Flash LADAR Camera developed on this project can support future EDL requirements for lunar or planetary exploration. Not only will the camera be able to support hazard mapping and navigation but it can also support other terrain mapping requirements. The camera includes a fog, dust and liquid penetration mode, which will allow landing and navigation in hazardous conditions.  ASC will deliver a Phase II brassboard system that meet NASA's requirements for an EDL sensor.  This sensor will increase the success of NASA operations such as:
1.	Mars Landed Exploration
2.	Exploration of  Moons (ALHAT, Jupiter Icy Moons)
3.	Asteroid and comet rendezvous and sample return
4.	Rendezvous and Docking
5.	Situational awareness
6.	Rock abundance and distribution maps
7.	Topographical mapping
8.	Rover mobility and navigation

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Leveraging Phase I SBIR successes, in Phase II, a single photon sensitive LIDAR receiver will be fabricated and delivered to NASA. In Phase I, high-gain, electron-initiated avalanche photodiodes (e-APDS) were designed, manufactured, and characterized over a range of temperatures. The e-APDs, sensitive from 1064 nm to 4300 nm, were fabricated in single-layer p-type HgCdTe films grown using liquid phase epitaxy on IR-transparent CdZnTe substrates. Variable-diameter e-APDs, large-area 250-micron diameter e-APDs, and segmented 1-mm x 1-mm e-APDS - each with sixteen 250-micron x 250-micron pixel elements - were mounted to ceramic submounts, tested, and characterized. Under receiver bias, the e-APDs exhibited exponentially increasing gain that exceeded 1250. The devices showed exponentially increasing gain as a function of cutoff wavelength, and with decreased temperature - in agreement with our models for HgCdTe e-APDs.
In Phase II, we will optimize HgCdTe films for 1.53.6 micron response and fabricate 250-micron diameter e-APD elements, designed for operation with gains exceeding 1250, without excess noise. These e-APDs, when integrated with custom-designed <100 e- rms noise transimpedance amplifiers and optimized to match the e-APDs' capacitance, will realize single photon sensitive LIDAR receivers for NASA LIDAR applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential markets for the NIR APDs include: telecommunications, quantum cryptography, computed tomography, confocal microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy, LADAR/LIDAR, chem/bio hazard detection, astronomy, and neural imaging. 
Military applications for these low-noise NIR APDs include LADAR and 3-D imaging, both for existing 1064 nm systems and for eye-safe 1550 nm systems. Other markets include unmanned aerial vehicle navigation and tracking, tactical missile seekers, and armored vehicle protection.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High sensitivity HgCdTe APDs have utility in applications in deep space optical communications, as well as NIR through the LWIR LIDAR/LADAR applications. HgCdTe FPA-enabled LADAR instruments can provide measurements from both the dark side and the sunlit portion of a celestial body, thereby significantly increasing the useful observational coverage.

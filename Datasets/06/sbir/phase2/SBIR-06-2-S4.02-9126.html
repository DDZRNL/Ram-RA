		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The overall goal of the proposed phase II SBIR program is to develop a compact, high SNR TDI APD array for future NASA earth observing missions. The enabling TDI APD technology is based on ultra-high sensitivity AlInAs/GaInAs APDs operable in the 1240 to 1640-nm spectra band integrated with Si CCDs that will enable for the first time, true TDI and CCD-like detector operation at these wavelengths. The performance of this TDI APD array will meet or exceed current performance requirements for radiometric sensors. The TDI APD array sensor will be designed to operate at 300K resulting in a significant weight, size and power reduction. At the conclusion of the program, we will deliver to NASA for evaluation and for mission insertion, fully packaged end-to-end tested TDI APD arrays with SNR in the range of 570-1066 within the 1240-nm and 1640-nm spectral band.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential DOD applications include: airborne 3-D imaging LADAR transmitter/sensor (and sophisticated image processing) to penetrate dense trees and camouflage in order to detect, identify, and characterize targets on the battlefield such as tanks and armored personnel carriers, missile seekers, passive imaging camera with the capability of generating real-time displays of imaging scene. Commercial applications include: commercial receivers operating in the 1-1.5 micron wavelength range for fiber optic communications and free space communication and lidar tranceivers for terrain mapping, navigational guidance, and surveillance through foliage, forestry inspection, agricultural monitoring, and production monitoring in the automotive and steel industries as well as commercial and law enforcement applications. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Development of such detectors will more than double the SNR of the APD arrays required for the next generation of spaceborne remote sensing instruments, free-space optic fiber optic communication and solid state imaging LADAR systems for tracking satellites, vehicle docking, navigation, and guidance. Other applications include photon correlation spectroscopy and space-based instruments and astrophysics observatories in the infrared wavelength. A specific NASA instrument in which this technology will be applied include the Ocean Radiometer for Carbon Assessment (ORCA) for the Global Ocean Carbon, Ecosystem, and Coastal Processes Mission (GOCECP) and the Aerosol, Cloud, and Ecosystem (ACE) mission.

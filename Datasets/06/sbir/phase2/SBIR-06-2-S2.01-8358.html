		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The objective in this project is the development of a monochromatic x-ray source for a small x-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS) suitable for NASA missions.  This instrument will allow in situ elemental and chemical state measurements in off-earth NASA missions.  The need for these measurements is for understanding resource availability, toxicity, and chemical issues like oxidants on Mars.  The small XPS developed in a previous SBIR, NNC04CA20C, has a mass of 15 Kg and will reduce to 7 kg as refined for flight.  It will operate with about 10 watts.  This tool needs a monochromatic x-ray source for the capability to understand the chemistries expected on NASA missions as called out in Future Space Science Enterprise (SSE) missions.  
In Phase I for this proposal we designed a combination of sources that will accomplish this need. It uses both a monochromatic and a non-monochromatic x-ray source to provide the quality data needed at a data rate suitable for potential missions. It uses low power, has a small mass and has some redundancy to reduce risk.
Non-NASA applications will be process monitoring for semiconductor, polymer films and bioprocesses manufacturing.  This application will be made available by the small size

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The small XPS instrument will be a useful and cost effective process-monitoring device.  XPS has not been used because of expensive, difficulty and is easily misinterpreted. The cost of ownership was high.  
Our business model will allow process monitors with a XPS core but different sample handling and software for each application.  This reduces development cost, maintains fit to each application and speed.  Few functions allow simplicity and low cost.  NRE charges will pay the cost of tuning the instrument for each application.  
Surface/Interface Inc., founded by the PI, used this model for hard disk media market. The small XPS, with a monochromator, will allow expansion to Semiconductor, polymer film and bioprocess markets
We are in contact with potential customers about this approach for the polymer per-printing treatment and low k gate oxides.  We have customers committed to purchasing dedicated process monitors based on the small XPS.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A low mass XPS using low power is the ideal tool for in situ studying materials on planetary objects.  The in situ measurement avoids contamination problems.  Rapid measurements allow examining resources, potential surface chemistry dependant toxicity issues and the nature of surface chemistries, like the oxidant on Mars.
A Planetary Instrument Definition and Development program in progress at JPL under Dr. Paula Grunthaner will provide a detail study of these applications using a modified small XPS.  Apparati, Inc. will design and build the system.  It uses a new film developed at JPL that allows measurement on samples at Mars atmospheric conditions.  This film, with the small XPS allows simple measurements on Mars with samples near rather then into the instrument.
The proposed x-ray sources reduce background signals and improving resolution.  The improved signal to noise of the measurements and improving sensitivity allow looking for small chemical effects and concentrations.

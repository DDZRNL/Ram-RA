		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The NLNS software developed in phase I is a robust and user-friendly environment that NASA researchers can use to customize the latest HHT technologies for their applications in astrophysics, earth sciences, and exploration. The proposed technology includes the latest discoveries and inventions not available in the state-of-the-art. Its taxonomy includes gravitational sensors and sources, expert systems, portable data analysis tools, software development environments, and software tools for distributed analysis and simulation. The Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) and related analysis technologies were successful in detecting non-linear and transient LISA-signal components of very small magnitude with respect to the signal noise. Other types of NLNS analyses will include de-noising (filtering), spectral analysis, reconstruction, and registration, potentially extended to two-dimensional data. The proposed research and development team has participated in the latest cycle of technology development related to the HHT at the theoretical, implementation, and application levels. Not only will the creation of the proposed software contribute to the detection of gravitational wave signals (for both LIGO and LISA data) or understanding patterns of climate change temperature records from ice cores or monitoring structural dynamics, but also in other non-linear and non-stationary applications within and outside NASA's mission.

		Starodub has worked with FHWA to study many problems. Based on the positive reception in the highway community known for its traditionally conservative approach, most Government agencies, in research, develop-ment, and operations, may benefit from this product with a reduced learning curve with the proper exposure to this technology. Starodub shall focus its marketing effort on illustrating the software with solutions from NASA applications output from this SBIR project and from a plethora of applications previously developed and revisited in the new analysis product in collaboration with Dr. Zhaohua Wu and Dr. Norden Huang. The current list of potential non-NASA application areas includes non-destructive evaluation for structural health monitoring in highway infrastructure, vibration, speech, and acoustic signal analyses, earthquake engineering, manufacturing processes, bio-medical applications, and financial market data analysis

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Starodub and its team propose to develop a HHT-technology software over the first two phases that will supersede earlier HHT products with newer methods that address previous limitations. Phase I focused on the LISA and LIGO black hole merger data, the climate change temperature records from ice cores, and monitoring structural dynamics. The new methods discussed in the work plan are generally applicable to most sensors data that capture non-linear, transient signal components embedded in noise and other signals.  The current and potential NASA applications of the latest HHT technologies cross-over astrophysics, earth sciences, and exploration. They are cosmological gravity wave and planets hunting, global primary productivity evolution map from LandSat data,  climate change temperature records from ice cores, non-destructive evaluation for structural health monitoring, and vibration analysis of NASA equipment. A two-dimensional application on hurricane data (NOAA) illustrates the potential for non-linear and non-stationary image analysis.

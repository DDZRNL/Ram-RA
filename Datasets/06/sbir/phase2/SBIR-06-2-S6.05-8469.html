		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The goal of this Phase II project is to deliver an integrated L-band transmit/receive (T/R) module which will be fabricated from a GaAs-based combined HBT/PHEMT epistructure.  The T/R module will consist of a power amplifier, a low noise amplifier, and two switches.  The performance goal for the low noise amplifier is 30 dB gain with a less than 1.0 dB noise figure.  The performance goal for the power amplifier is 30 dB gain, 34 dBm (2.5 W) output power, and efficiency greater than 60%.  The performance goal for the switches is that they not materially affect the operation of the amplifiers.  All components will be fully integrated on a single substrate.  Post Phase II work includes the integration of a phase shifter, amplitude modulator, and control and interface circuitry on the same chip.  We estimate the technology readiness level at the end of the Phase II program to be 6 or 7.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The major potential application for L-band T/R modules is in wireless communications.  As the capabilities of wireless devices expand, there is an increasing need for compact, efficient T/R modules.  The proposed HBT/PHEMT structures are an excellent technology platform for meeting the market demand for improved power amplifier performance at high efficiency levels and with lower DC power consumption.  Specific customers would be the manufacturers of T/R circuitry for mobile applications.

Another potential customer is X-band radar systems for military applications.  The L-band technology described in this proposal could be readily adapted for X-band use.  X-band radars are used in both ground-based and airborne applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A key potential customer for an L-band T/R module is NASA.  The module would be used in L-band radars on remote sensing satellites, which are a critical component of NASA's exploratory mission.  Synthetic aperture radar can provide measurements of water cycle, global ecosystems, ocean circulation, and ice mass.  L-band radar is particularly attractive for these applications.

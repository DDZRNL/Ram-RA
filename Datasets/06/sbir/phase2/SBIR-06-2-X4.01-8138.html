		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Abstract: The Multi-Purpose Excavation Demonstrator (MPED) is a commercial effort and a third generation of technology, following Bucket Wheel Excavator and Bucket Ladder Excavator work by the Colorado School of Mines.  The Moonraker<SUP>TM</SUP> is an industrial instantiation, designed to be commercially viable.  The proof-of-concept machine is currently under construction.  

A phase two SBIR consists of: 1) upgrades to the original design, including more appropriate materials improvements and maturation of point solutions, 2) development of a robotic tool arm/turret to cradle, position and manuever the the excavator blade within it's work volume, 3) development of a 'universal' modular tool interface between the excavator blade and the robotic tool arm, 4) physics-based modelling and simulation of the excavator/tool arm/mobility platform ensemble, 5) a simulation which continues to co-evolve into a control systems/human interface, 6) extensive laboratory and field testing of excavator prototypes, particularly forces on buckets, and 7) enhanced systems reliability.  Field testing will include technology demonstrations at a Lunar Analogs site.

Related contextual topics are undergoing continous examination, including a simplified tool arm manipulation and control method, operations 'in the dirt' at the worksite, exploitation of regolith fines (dust) as a high-yield component of ores, and mitigation of the adverse effects of dust on the excavation system through exclusion, passive electrostatics and other methods.  This project draws extensively upon the expertise of CSM alumni who have prior experience in the earlier generations of Lunar Excavator prototypes.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial and Industrial Space applications where the customers are
multinationals and consortia.  Lockheed has a BWE predecessor, 
(CSM Gen 1) and there is value to the ISRU community of the MPED 
Gen 3 device with all of it's applications-specific enhancements.

		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Trenching, mining, burying structures, erecting berms, etc. on Moon, Mars.
Capable of as narrow as 10 cm trench for cables and much wider when 
sweeping, with depths to 61 cm.  In pre-positioning and precursor missions 
the MPED could dig large trenches and cover emplaced habitats with 
protective regolith layers.  Larger trenches are iteratively dug stepwise to 
accommodate cylinders.  A very versatile, low-energy, unattended device.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

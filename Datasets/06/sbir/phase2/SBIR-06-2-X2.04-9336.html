		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We are developing CAD tools, models and methodologies for electronics design for circuit operation in extreme environments with focus on very low temperatures (<20K). These new tools and methodologies will give rise to circuit designs that minimize the requirements for external heat sources that are currently often necessary for operation of low-temperature electronics. Such technology would significantly improve reliability, performance and lifetime of electronics that are used for space applications, including satellites and space travel. This will be achieved through the development of unique circuits and simulation tools that are derived from novel physics-based modeling techniques and verified by experiment. Temperature-stable designs and design methods will be provided as well. The new cryogenic design tools will greatly reduce the chances of error during actual circuit implementation, and thus reduce the number of design cycles, thereby substantially decreasing fabrication times and expenses. Models and CAD tools are relatively inexpensive as compared to fabrication costs; thus the results of this project should provide a very large return on investment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to NASA, there is a large civilian space applications business, especially with respect to communications satellites. There is also a large commitment by the Department of Defense to space applications. This work should find applications with these types of organizations as well. 

There is also a very large need for cryogenic electronics in terrestrial low noise applications. These applications can be found in infrared and far infrared optical detectors. Furthermore, any application where the input signal is extremely weak, and a very large signal to noise ratio is required, may be enhanced by cryogenic operation. CoolCAD is currently in discussion with agencies and industry for developing design methodologies for their infrared photo-detector arrays, and for very low noise communication circuits.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The work proposed in Phase II of this program will help NASA develop 
electronics for space missions where ambient temperatures are in the cryogenic region. We are developing CAD tools for DC, AC and  Transient device modeling for very low temperatures. We plan to provide model cards for compact spice-type simulators for electronics design at cryogenic temperatures, as well as modifications to Process Design Kits for cryogenic circuit design. This will allow NASA to operate electronics in outer space without the need to provide ambient heating. Applications will also be in electronics where low noise is required, including infrared sensing and communication.

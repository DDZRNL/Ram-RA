		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposed Phase II program seeks to create dual-band pixel-collocated MWIR/LWIR photodetector arrays based on III-V semiconductor materials in a Type-II superlattice structure.  The Type-II superlattice offers a customizable cutoff wavelength while maintaining a lattice-matched condition to the host substrate.  This superlattice also has lower Auger-recombination, which reduces dark current noise, than HgCdTe solutions, and is sensitive to normal incidence radiation, in contrast to QWIP approaches.  The Phase I efforts successfully designed, fabricated and characterized a Type-II dual band IR photodetector.  The superlattice material growth will be further optimized in the Phase II, along with modifying the fabrication steps required to realize dual-band photodetector arrays.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Defense has a strong need for multi-band IR photodetector arrays for such applications and target detection and tracking.  Cold objects in space require sensors operating in the MWIR/LWIR/VLWIR regimes.  Chemical detectors can also utilize these devices by identifying toxic species based on infrared signatures.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA can apply multi-band IR photodetectors for myriad purposes.  Of current interest is pollution monitoring by remotely sensing gases based on their infrared absorption spectra.  Multi-band IR can also be used to determine the temperature of distant objects with unknown emissivity.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

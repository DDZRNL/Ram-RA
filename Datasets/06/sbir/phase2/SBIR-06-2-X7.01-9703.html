		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has many needs for maintenance and repair technologies for long-duration human space missions.  We propose to continue developing a compact, portable, vacuum-compatible, multi-axis Manipulator/Machining Center (M/MC) to satisfy many of NASA's needs.  Our M/MC will provide complex manipulation during: layer-additive manufacturing; collection of geometric data for reverse-engineering; real-time non-destructive evaluation; and non-destructive material property determination.  Our M/MC will also finish-machine near-net-shape parts produced using layer-additive manufacturing.  Design features of our M/MC will: minimize mass, volume, and power consumption while providing required capabilities; maximize life and reliability; and enable our M/MC to operate in space-based vacuum, microgravity, and partial-gravity environments.  In Phase II, we will: generate alternative designs of M/MCs for space-based applications; and design, build, test, and zero-g-flight-test a prototype M/MC.  In Phase III, we will design, build, and sell M/MCs to the government and private sector.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We will adapt our space-based Manipulator/Machining Center (M/MC) to produce an Earth-based M/MC for many military and private-sector manufacturing applications, including: military in-theater fabrication of spare parts, including for the Army and Navy (for example, aboard submarines); and private-sector manufacturing, including die/mold work, prototyping, small production runs, and cases in which raw materials are expensive.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Our Manipulator/Machining Center (M/MC) will satisfy many of NASA's needs for space-based manufacturing applications. Our compact, portable, multi-axis M/MC will perform: (1) reverse-engineering data generation; (2) additive manufacturing; (3) real-time non-destructive evaluation during layer-additive processing; (4) non-destructive material property determination; (5) recycling/generation of feedstock materials for deposition processes; and (6) five-axis subtractive manufacturing.

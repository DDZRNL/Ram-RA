		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are attractive candidates for use as power sources in aerospace applications because they have high specific energy, energy density and long cycle life. However, conventional Li-ion batteries experience loss of capacity and increased impedance and poor cycle life when they are charged/discharged at high rates over C-rate. These problems are magnified at low temperature operation. The limitations in the high rate capability of Li-ion batteries are mainly caused by slow solid-state diffusion of Li+ within the electrode materials Yardney/Lithion Inc., the world leader in cutting edge Li-ion battery technology proposes to investigate new non-toxic nano-engineered electrodes that significantly shortens the Li+ diffusion length within the electrode materials and increases the rate capability of Li-ion batteries. The goal of this Phase II project is to manufacture rapid recharge Li-ion battery for aerospace application. Yardney will manufacture 5 prototype cells capable of recharge at less than 15 min at room temperature. During the phase I we found that the nanoengineered anode showed excellent rate capabilities compared to planar electrode. Nanoarchitectured current collector provides higher safety due to large surface area contact with the active material and that acts as heat sink in high rate applications and also lower impedance.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High power applications include power tools, electric vehicles and telecommunications. Automotive and industrial sectors, where the slim, small-sized battery will deliver large amounts of energy while requiring only a minute to recharge. For example, the battery's advantages in size, weight and safety highly suit it for a role as an alternative power source for hybrid electric vehicles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		he target application for this nanoengineered Li ion battery technology is space applications that require high energy and power densities. This technology will have superior performance at low temperatures due to the very small internal impedance of the nano-engineered electrode materials. This battery will be safe at high rate applications due to large surface contact to the active materials.

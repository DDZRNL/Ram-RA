		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To meet the design challenges of tomorrow, NASA and industry require advancements in the state-of-the-art for physics-based design and analysis frameworks. In particular, NASA needs the ability to make more use of physics-based models earlier in the design process. This will allow engineers to more accurately capture the complex coupling between engineering disciplines and to more accurately simulate the complex behavior of novel design configurations. Key technical barriers include long execution times, model and data complexity, and geometry management. In the Phase II project, Phoenix Integration will expand on the successful Phase I prototypes to develop new technologies and user interfaces that will help overcome these barriers. This project will focus on (1) the development of a flexible capability for implementing Multi-Disciplinary Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) strategies (such as multi-fidelity) in ModelCenter, (2) the creation of a flexible geometry visualization and monitoring capability for high-fidelity system models, and (3) the extension of Phoenix Integration's "Plug-In" infrastructure to better support a wide range of high-fidelity analysis and geometry management tools (CAD/CAE tools, meshing tools, mesh morphing tools). These technologies will combine with other NASA funded technologies to create a robust physics-based design and analysis framework for designing next generation air vehicles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are numerous non-NASA applications of the SBIR technology. A common element is the economic need to accelerate and optimize the design and decision making process. The proposed technology will provide substantial value to designers and engineers in aerospace and defense markets such as DoD, aerospace original equipment manufacturers (platforms, propulsion, systems), first tier suppliers, and research facilities. Related markets include other industries such as automotive, electronics, process industries, heavy machinery, shipbuilding, oil and gas, and utilities that utilize modeling and simulation tools in the design process. There will also be application in emerging markets such as alternate energy, medical devices, nano-technology, and space commercialization.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		To meet Fundamental Aeronautics Program goals, NASA requires the ability to perform Multi-Disciplinary Analysis and Optimization (MDAO). MDAO enables virtual access to flight envelopes and virtual expeditions through the design space for the exploration of new vehicle and propulsion concepts. The proposed technology provides the MDAO integration framework necessary for implementing fast and effective physics based multi-system analysis and design tools. High-fidelity physics based analysis is essential to the understanding of novel new unconventional designs but is equally valuable when working at the performance margins of conventional vehicle and propulsion systems to improve efficiency and reduce noise and emissions.  The proposed technology enables high fidelity analysis to be accomplished early in the design process thus enabling improved decision making. In addition to the achievement of Fundamental Aeronautics goals, the technology will be beneficial to many NASA programs at a wide variety of NASA centers involved in space, propulsion, operations, and mission designs.

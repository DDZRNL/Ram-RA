		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The key innovation in this effort is the development of a decision support tool for distributed air-ground scheduling sequencing, spacing and  merging of aircraft in the terminal airspace, and the development of modeling and simulation  testbed that will enable the evaluation of NAS wide impacts of technologies related to Airspace Super Dense Operations in the Terminal Airspace. The SBIR will primarily focus on developing algorithms and a  simulation testbed that will enable the modeling and fast-time simulation of simultaneous sequencing, spacing  merging and de-confliction in terminal airspace, reduced arrival spacing (with altitude offset/co-altitude) for very closely spaced parallel runways at OEP airports (Super Dense Airports Concepts), High density corridors (tubes) characterized by parallel tracks and delegation of separation responsibility to the flight deck via CDTI and ADS-B and Rerouting for mitigation of weather impacts  to terminal area operations The tesbed will be built on top of NASA's Airspace Concept Evaluation System (ACES).  While ACES does provide gate to gate simulation capability of the NAS, it currently does not include the modeling and simulation support for  spacing and merging related concepts in the terminal airspace. This research effort is a direction in meeting this technology need.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Initial target market for the proposed technology are commercial vendors of onboard separation spacing and merging products such as ACSS, Boeing, BAE and Honeywell.  IAI is currently working closely with with Aviation Communication & Surveillance Systems (ACSS) who have offered to assist in evaluating and bringing the Phase 2 technology to market.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Technology developed in this effort is of direct relevance to NASA's NGATS Airportal program. NASA's NGATS ATM-Airportal project currently supports this vision by focusing research efforts to develop, demonstrate, and validate operational concepts, proof-of-concept systems, algorithms, technologies, tools, and operational procedures for use in maximizing capacity and throughput in the Airportal environment. The Decision Support Toolkit being developed in Phase 2 will be of significant value to NASA analysts and contractors support Airportal research under cuurent NASA NRA's.  In addition to the Airportal effort the Airspace program will also significant  from enhancements made to ACES software. ACES is currently actively used by NASA contractors and researches.

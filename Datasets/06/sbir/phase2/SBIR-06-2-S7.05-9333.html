		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To meet the increasing power demand of today's spacecraft systems, an integrated power electronics system capable of interfacing, and simultaneously controlling, three power ports is proposed in this project. This new proposed power electronic architecture employs a single-stage power topology, thus allowing cost-effective control of power flow with improved efficiency, power density, and reliability.

The project is developing an innovative, dc-dc converter which can effectively manage the interface of a source, a load, and an energy storage function within a single-stage, three-port topology.  Modern advances in digital control, in conjunction with a novel power processing concept make this logical next-step possible.

This unique topology and controller function together to realize three power processing paths which simultaneously utilize the power devices, allowing increased functionality while promising reduced losses and enhanced power densities.

Control objectives include battery charge regulation, solar array peak power tracking, and/or load voltage regulation. 

The Phase I efforts completed the preliminary analysis and the proof-of- concept prototyping. A demonstration test was successfully conducted substantiating feasibility.

Phase II will focus on system level control in order to  demonstrate the concept in a relevant application with a solar array source, a lithium-Ion battery, and an electronic load bank as the bus.

		<BR>
		Tax credits have resulted in an exponential growth in the photovoltaic market.  While grid-tie systems are becoming more common, there has been no significant move to store energy for power outage contingencies or nighttime-operation.  A significant reason for this is the market lacks a power conversion topology and control structure to manage the functions required effectively.  While grid-tie inverters are very low complexity, a PV system suitable for island mode operation must include ports for bidirectional battery management, a PV array, and a load connection.   Further, an overarching control scheme is required for power transfer management.  No product handles these functions entirely, largely because of the complexity of the control and the number of converters required is cost-prohibitive to a very cost-driven market.  APECOR believes the 3-port topology with a microcontroller-based management structure will represent the minimal solution and will present the industry's first economically-viable product offering.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The power system of a spacecraft is the major contributor to overall mass. The sources and the energy storage devices are the heaviest and bulkiest components. The design of a spacecraft power system is dominated by the compromise between system architectures. A limited number of conversion stages yields a simple non-flexible system, often with over-sized sources and storage.  This effort targets the need for oversized systems by developing control and power conversion protocols that can greatly reduce the required size of arrays, batteries, and converters without reduced functionality.

The concept proposed here promises to address these mass issues and could find use on all NASA programs  manned and unmanned.  

Current programs like Constellation and its Crew Exploration Vehicle would greatly benefit.  In addition, the work will have a direct application to unmanned satellite design where battery management and array power extraction can be greatly enhanced - a requirement for interplanetary missions.

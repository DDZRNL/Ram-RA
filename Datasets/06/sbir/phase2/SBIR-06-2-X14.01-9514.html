		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		ZIN Technologies, Inc. is developing a novel Miniature Treadmill with resistive exercise capability for use in spaceflight exercise countermeasures and broad terrestrial therapeutic applications. The treadmill offers excellent periodic impact exercise to stimulate bone remodeling and cardiovascular activity as well as an added component of resistive exercise to encourage all-body muscle maintenance. The goal of this project is to demonstrate by design and analysis that the proposed treadmill will satisfy the stringent volumetric, power, and performance requirements demanded by lunar missions and provide the active feedback necessary to control the treadmill and display Daily Load Stimulus (DLS). We are additionally developing a new novel speed control algorithm in which the runner can modulate the treadmill speed through adjusting their stride.  A new subject load device is being developed for use in providing a more earthlike gravity replacement load to astronauts during spaceflight. We along with our partner the Cleveland Clinic believe that a hybrid compact exercise device along with the direct feedback of DLS is a unique and new approach that will provide a superior in space exercise system than ones currently in use on ISS.

		The aging of our population will require exercise devices that are in-line with core conditioning and management of musculoskeletal health. Osteoporosis is a major public health threat for an estimated 44 million Americans or 55 percent of the people 50 years of age and older. In the U.S., 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone mass, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis. The proposed mini-treadmill exercise device with real-time Daily Load Stimulus (DLS) measurement has the potential to provide an effective mechanism to combat or manage osteoporosis.

In addition to the unique applications of the integrated mini-treadmill for Space Flight crews, ZIN Technologies will develop specific commercial technologies: 

-Resistive pneumatic constant force technologies (actuator design)
-Treadmill daily load stimulus monitoring and feedback to runner
-Treadmill drive system speed control based on center of pressure measurement

We believe this intellectual property to have high licensing value to commercial treadmill original equipment manufacturers.  Our partnership with the Cleveland Clinic will again be utilized to ensure the successful planning, implementation and commercialization of the Mini-Treadmill technologies.  Together we have already developed a SBIR success story in the commercialization of a medical monitor and the incorporation of a joint venture:  ZIN Medical.

		With the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) calling for long term extended missions to the moon and Mars, there is a pressing need to equip astronauts with an effective exercise countermeasure system to maintain astronaut musculoskeletal health and ensure mission success. Countermeasures such as cycling, treadmill, resistive exercise, and rowing have been employed extensively on the International Space Station (ISS), however the space and power requirements will be much more stringent on lunar missions than on ISS. The treadmill design of this effort will aim to address the inherent challenges of spaceflight along with the specific implementation of the Daily Load Stimulus (DLS) theory to mange musculoskeletal health of astronauts.

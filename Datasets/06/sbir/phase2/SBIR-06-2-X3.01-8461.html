		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR Phase II project proposes the development of lightweight compact nanostructured catalytic reactors for air purification from toxic gaseous organic pollutants, particulate matter, and microorganisms.  Volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) will be catalytically oxidized inside high-density arrays of uniform cylindrical nanopores that comprise the reactor.  The nanopores of the catalytic substrate are conformally coated with appropriate catalyst, forming ultra-high aspect ratio, high surface area, cylindrical nanoreactors.  Such unique architecture provides improved mass and heat transfer and ensures conversion of volatile organics into non-toxic products with unmatched efficiency.  

The proposed low-mass, low-volume and low-power-consumption reactors are intended to replace conventional packed-bed catalytic oxidizers used currently for removal of trace organic contaminants from spacecraft atmospheres.  The Phase I project unequivocally demonstrated the feasibility of VOCs oxidation and confirmed the strong competitive advantages of the proposed architecture over conventional reactors and structured catalysts.  The Phase II goal now is to develop, fabricate and validate nanochannel reactor prototypes, and to initiate their integration into air purification modules.  The expected result is commercially viable, low-cost, compact yet highly efficient and robust nanochannel reactors for air purification.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology will enable advanced performance of personal and collective protection equipment, such as air purification systems on board of commercial aircraft; commercial, industrial and medical air purification systems; military and civil defense air purification and CBRD protection systems; personal protection equipment (escape hoods, gas masks, respirators). Spin-off commercial applications of nanostructured reactors include fuel reformers for fuel cells, catalytic combustors and burners, chemical microreactors, membrane-reactors for numerous applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Proposed catalytic nanochgannel array reactors will enable advanced performance, mass, volume and power savings for catalytic oxidation subassemblies for trace organic contaminant removal from spacecraft and space habitat atmospheres.  The proposed technology is expecially suitable for long-duration missions, such as orbital stations, lunar lander and lunar outpost, as well as future human flights to Mars.

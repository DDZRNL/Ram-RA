		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal is based on successful results of Phase I project where it was shown that the use of volume Bragg gratings in PTR glass as selectors of transverse and longitudinal modes in external resonators of fiber lasers resulted in single-frequency oscillation. Technology of low-loss thick volume Bragg gratings in photo-thermo-refractive (PTR) glass which provide extremely narrow spectral width down to 60 pm in the spectral range of 1.5 um is developed. New narrow-band filters based on coherent and incoherent combinations of Fabry-Perot etalons and volume Bragg gratings are demonstrated. The main purpose of this NASA SBIR Phase II project is to develop the prototype of a compact single-frequency mode laser oscillator with pulse energy in millijoule region by means of pulse pumped Er-doped single-mode fiber. The main feature of the laser design is the use of new narrow-band filters based on a coherent and incoherent combination of Fabri-Perot etalons and volume Bragg gratings (VBGs) recorded in photo-thermo-refractive (PTR) glass for longitudinal and transverse mode selection in an external laser resonator. Those new spectral filters will be used in external resonators of large area photonic crystal fibers. Optimization of parameters of Bragg filters and active fibers will provide both single frequency operation and high pulse energy.

		While the proposed project is directed to the particular NASA application, diffractive gratings in PTR glass have a lot of various applications in science and high technology. They will be used for laser beam steering, beam combining and sampling, intracavity mode control, etc. Moreover, PTR diffractive optical elements have great advantages for detection of laser signals in LIDARs and LADARs, for Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) in telecommunications, for spectral selection in telescopes used in astronomy, and in various optical sensors. Optical sensors are a major component of U.S. import and export trade, and, as an enabling technology, are critical to a broad range of fields: national security, environmental, material and information science, transportation and space exploration, construction and manufacturing, biology, chemistry, medicine, and many others.

The main area of interest of DoD government agencies and private laser and semiconductor companies is focused on spectrally and angularly controlled diffractive beam deflectors, beam steering elements, mode selectors, incoherent and coherent beam combiners for both solid-state and semiconductor lasers, adjustable attenuators and beam splitters for laser beams. It is clear that the range of PTR technology applications is significantly wider that those mentioned above. OptiGrate is committed to develop these various applications and successfully bringing them to the commercial markets in a cost effective manner.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Practical implementation of our innovation should dramatically increase the parameters of manufactured pulse lasers at 1.5 um. These lasers are applicable for a wide range of remote sensing devices and a number of instruments under consideration by NASA scientists. They include Lidar systems for global measurements of atmospheric winds, CO2 and Ozone concentrations, aerosol and cloud composition and density, and Earth surface topography. In addition, the Lidar remote sensing technology is being pursued for planetary exploration and aeronautics applications. 

Potential NASA commercial applications of high efficiency diffractive optical elements in PTR glass are in the fields of high-resolution spectroscopy, narrow-band filtering for detection of different chemical agents, spectral scanning with sub-Angstrom resolution, remote sensing and targeting, range finding, spectral sensing and other NASA applications where diffractive optical components are the key elements.

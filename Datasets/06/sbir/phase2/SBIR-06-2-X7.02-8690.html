		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		As space missions become more complex and as mission demands increase, robots, human-robot mixed initiative teams and software autonomy applications are needed to provide increasing levels of support to the mission and to Astronauts. Whatever the task, robot teams will need to interact with Astronauts and possibly Mission Control. There is a need for cooperation and communication among all autonomous entities. Robotic intelligence is required in at least four areas: two-way communication with humans, safety awareness, self-monitoring, and self-maintenance. Robot teams will need to interact with Astronauts concerning the state of their hardware. They may need to interact with humans in order to insure human safety.  In Phase 1, we developed an initial HSI Framework (HSIF) to structure protocol-driven interactions (conversations) among Astronauts and multiple-component autonomous systems (soft-bot systems (SBS)). In Phase 2, we extend our HSI framework, with new protocol development that will support interactions among {human-robot team}, {SBS robot}, {human robot} and {SBS- human  robot team}. In Phase 2, a protocol library will be developed. Scenarios involving interactions among humans, robot teams and soft-bot systems will be simulated using the protocol library. The protocol library will be integrated with robotic software and implemented on a hardware (robot) platform.

		<BR>
		This HSI Framework (HSIF) is also applicable to multiple DoD needs, as it is applicable to general autonomous systems. It is applicable to US Army and DARPA projects which involve soldiers teaming with robot teams for search and rescue, for patrol, for mine-field demarcation, etc. HSIF is applicable to the US Coast Guard needs, as it is interested in pairing autonomous small surface ships with autonomy applications to guard harbors.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The HSI Framework (HSIF) provides design requirements and a protocol driven approach to support interactions among human and autonomous systems, including robot teams and soft-bot autonomy applications. The protocols support exposure of state and safety information, as well as Astronaut-initiated changes in autonomy mode and the propagation of information on resulting modified functionality to dependent autonomous systems, leading to more robust interactions. This technology is applicable to NASA Exploration Missions, including the Lunar Outpost.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

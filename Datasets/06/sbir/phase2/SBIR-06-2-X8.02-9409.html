		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		For lunar-based fission power systems that will support In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) or Mars robotic and manned missions, power requirements may vary from 10s to 100s of kWe to support initial human missions and longer term lunar bases.  Due to the large amounts of waste heat generated by these systems, a key consideration is the development of lightweight, highly efficient heat rejection systems (HRS) that can operate at elevated temperatures (~550 K).  Our innovation is the integration of an ultra-light radiator panel with a lightweight titanium heat pipe.  Our approach will reduce the total mass by 32% compared to our baseline design.  In addition, our innovation will greatly surpass the performance of carbon-composite systems under consideration and represents a lower risk approach to achieve a practical HRS.  In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility by fabricating, demonstrating, and delivering a proof-of-concept panel.  During Phase II, we will fabricate, test, and deliver a full-scale prototype.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		While the main applications for our innovation are space-based systems, our novel heat rejection systems can be applied to commercial thermal management systems that are severely weight constrained.  Such systems can benefit from the lightweight, high-temperature capability of our unique innovation.  These applications can include radar, aerospace, large-scale power systems, and energy recovery applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Our innovative heat rejection system, which is based on the integration of an ultra-light radiator panel material with a lightweight titanium heat pipe, will reduce the total mass of the HRS compared to other options under consideration.  The results of our work would have far-reaching benefits for government space and military systems.  These include nuclear power generation for long-duration interplanetary and planetary-based missions, mobile power systems, and satellites.

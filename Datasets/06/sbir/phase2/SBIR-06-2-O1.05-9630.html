		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Purpose of this effort was to offer a novel solution to the pressing need for radiation tolerant memory for the demanding satellite and space probe worldwide community. The effort included radiation testing of the Ferro Electric Random Access (FRAM) memory developed under NASA/JPL contract NNG04CA25C, and the design of stacked versions resulting in up to 16Mb of storage in a footprint smaller than a standard TSOP. The work done resulted in a number of tested samples of 2Mb FRAM die fabricated using the 0.35 um process at Fujitsu, and designed by Cellis Semiconductor. The packaged parts were electrically tested then subjected to radiation testing. The enclosed radiation test program conducted and the successful results are contained herein. For higher density configurations, a preliminary design of stacks in 2, 4, and 8 high die was done using our µZ Ball Stack<SUP>REG</SUP> technology, offering a total of up to 16Mb of addressable memory.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A Radiation hardened high density non-volatile memory device is a key component for any commercial system in a radiation environment. These applications include commercial space platforms, both GEO and LEO such as the Boeing Space HS-601 and Lockheed A2 100. Telecommunication satellites and sensing applications (NOAA) require this memory to store critical data and support on board data processing. New Missile Defense Agency (MDA) interceptor programs will likely have radiation requirements. Terrestrial applications include nuclear power plants and research accelerators (Fermi Lab). A potentially large market could be commercial aircraft avionics which are becoming increasingly sensitive to single event effects (SEE) as commercial IC feature sizes and voltages decrease.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Virtually all NASA space programs have a demand for dense, radiation hardened, non-volatile memory. These applications range from shuttle, space station, earth sensing missions and deep space probes. The world's most common 1 megabit EEPROM just obsolete, creating an immediate demand for radiation guaranteed non-volatile memory ICs. Some of the NASA missions which will benefit are Mars Surveyor missions, solar system exploration e.g. (Titan, Europa landers, Comet Nucleus Return, New Discovery Program, and Living with a Star).

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In response to NASA's need to develop advanced nanostructured thermolectric materials, UTRON is proposing an innovative high pressure powder consolidation manufacturing to fabricate near net shape and net shape thermolectric components with improved densification and properties than possible conventional powder metallurgical methods. Potential candidate materials such as Tellurides, TAGs and SiGe micro/nano composites will be developed at high compaction pressures (150 tsi) using select geometries/shapes and optimized disk samples will be characterized for geometrical, shrinkage, mechanical, microstructure/microchemistry and thermolectric properties. The proposed work has been planned in close subcontract/collaboration with Teledyne and Auburn University-Space Research Institute. Other advanced nanocomposite alloys and scaling up to fabricate complex geometries will be done in Phase II.

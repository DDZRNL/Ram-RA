		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Ridgetop's role is to develop electronic prognostics for sensing power systems in support of NASA/Ames ADAPT testbed. The prognostic enabled power systems from Ridgetop are to be integrated into NASA's Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics Testbed (ADAPT) and later used in the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV).   Prognostics will provide power supply "state of health", remaining useful life (RUL) and notify operators of impending failures so that load-shedding or orderly switch-overs can be supported.

Using the ADAPT at NASA/Ames Research Center, Ridgetop will design, implement and validate a prototype prognostic sensor that employs both analog circuits and digital logic in a microcontroller unit (MCU) or microproprocessor controller (MPC) to "prognostics-enable" a high efficiency switching power converter.
The ADAPT is a testbed, developed to explore health-management systems in manned spaceflight with three main goals: 1) to assess performance of diagnostic tools and algorithms against a standardized testbed and repeatable failure scenarios, 2) to develop prognostic models (performance degradation, remaining life estimation) for spacecraft subsystems, and 3) prototype Advanced Caution and Warning System (ACAWS) algorithms and user interfaces.  

By developing effective and practical prognostics for a power supply, Ridgetop's role will be to extend the capabilities of the ADAPT testbed.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There is large potential for prognostics in the commercial sector which is expected to exceed $200M by the year 2010.  Ridgetop has segmented the market to focus on high reliability applications such as automotive, banking systems, industrial process control, and commercial aerospace applications.

Prognostics can leverage existing diagnostic backbones such as JTAG, I2C  and CAN buses, to support Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and Prognostics/Health Management (PHM) strategies for critical industrial applications.  For CBM and PHM applications, the value to preserving operational readiness is paramount and these applications are not expected to be cost-sensitive.

Ridgetop estimates the following market sizes for health monitoring systems that have tremendous commercial application for the enabling of prognostics on power systems:
-	Military Market (aircraft and helicopter): $170B by 2015 at an annual growth rate of 5%
-	Aircraft Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO): $64B by 2010

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Ridgetop's plans are to work closely with the NASA Office and its contractors on the application of Electronic Prognostics to a representative Switch-Mode Power System within NASA.  To that end, Ridgetop has had communications with NASA engineers, and has conducted meetings with Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman.  In addition, prognostics can support remote diagnostics/prognostics.  The value proposition to customers is that early detection of impending failures can be made remotely, via the web, and corrective actions employed quickly to preserve overall system integrity.  

With remote systems deployed on other planets, autonomous operation enabled with electronic prognostics is very important.  Advanced warnings and mitigation of failures is facilitated using electronic prognostics that detect an impending failure before it occurs.  For example, there is a 40-minute bidirectional communication delay in Mars-to-Earth communications.  Another application is to detect the degradation of power systems during flights of the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) spacecraft in real-time.  The CEV is the actual crew capsule that will transport up to six crew members on missions to the International Space Station, lunar missions, and deep space travel to Mars and beyond.

Ridgetop will extend the ADAPT testbed capabilities by developing practical prognostics for power supplies.

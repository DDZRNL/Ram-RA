		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to build and evaluate NDIR Analyzers that can be used to observe Eddy Covariance Flux and Absolute Dry Mole Fraction of CO2 from stationary and airborne platforms for a great range of environments. Both open- and close-path analyzers are to be evaluated. Phase I succeeded in building a fast CO2 analyzer with 100 Hz modulation frequency and sensitivity within a factor of two of the target value of 100 ppb. For Phase II, we propose upgrades to the technology that are designed to reach that target sensitivity. We are further proposing individual projects within restricted airspace that will demonstrate the potential of the technologies for significant kinds of observations for Observational Climate Change. Two robotic platforms are to be utilized, the Unmanned Airborne Vehicle (UAV) and The Portable Tower Observatory (PTO). The PTO will provide fluxes and eddy spectroscopy of CO2. The UAV will give CO2 eddy spectroscopy that can be compared for a range of practical heights (5- 30 m) of the PTO. Samples of air are to be dried, and the site is chosen to minimize the impact of H2O vapor on this first deployment of the technologies.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A CO2 Analyzer System without sensitivity to platform motion and associated artifacts would be a valuable tool for many projects of climate change.  DOE's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement facility makes both piloted and unmanned flights to monitor climate related phenomenon.  DOC's Office of Atmospheric Research oversees several labs that monitor climate from ships, piloted aircraft, and buoys. The use of CO2 technology on all those platforms would no doubt prove informative for models of Climate Change.

An attractive platform of opportunity for climate monitoring is the weather balloon.  Approximately 75,000 are launched world wide each year.   If CO2 instrumentation were deployed on one third of them, then 25,000 systems could be sold each year. 

Applications outside of climate monitoring include detection of human cargo by the Department of Homeland Security.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We are proposing to develop observational platforms with full technological capabilities. They are the Portable Tower and the Unmanned Airborne Vehicle. By execution of this proposal we will have much of what we require for eddy covariance observations of CO2 from both. The missing subsystem is the 3-D wind probe for the UAV, and we are proposing to develop it by a separate proposal.

A fast, sensitive CO2 Analyzer Technology will be required for several of NASA's monitoring programs.  The Southern Ocean Carbon Cycle Project, a component of the Suborbital Science Program, has listed CO2 eddy covariance flux as one of the principle measurements from all observing platforms (UAV, tower, and buoy). 

The NASA Earth Observing System will require in-situ support for satellite measurements of CO2 concentration. UAV suborbital technologies will be an ideal platform for verification and validation of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory to be launched in 2008.

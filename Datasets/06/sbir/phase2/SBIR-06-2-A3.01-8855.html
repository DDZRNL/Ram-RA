		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Building on recent advances in formal agent specification, protocol composition, model composers, and visualization capabilities provided by development environments such as eclipse, the key innovation in this effort is the development of an agent model composition toolkit that will enable NASA ACES  users to design and compose agents, activities, and models to meet specific design requirements. From a users perspective the front end of the toolkit will be very similar in spirit to a Simulink<SUP>REG</SUP> or a Matrix-X<SUP>REG</SUP> where users can drag and drop from a library of models, interconnect the inputs and outputs of these models, and run a simulation. In addition to composing models, a key feature provided by this toolkit is a family of "physical language specific adaptors" that will allow users to import domain models written in other languages such as Matlab<SUP>REG</SUP>. Integral to the Phase II effort will enhancements to the ACES-X, TAP architecture to enable plug-n-play of detailed 4-D trajectories in the terminal area, the development of a Command and Control framework for ACES-X and the development of  a library of C2 models to enhance the capabilities of the ACES-X TAP.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Our target market here is the DOD and commercial modeling and simulation community sector. To address this broader modeling and simulation market IAI will extend and generalize the model composition toolbox for applicability to simulations using CyebelPro<SUP>REG</SUP> and make it available as a component of CybelePro suite of tools. Other examples of IAI's commercialization efforts in developing toolboxes for Cybele include the development of a game-theoretic toolbox, a distributed robot control toolbox, and DIVA, a case tool for design and development of Multi-agent Systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Our initial target for the product developed in this effort is the ATM modeling and simulation community within NASA. Over the last few year NASA ACES software has gained increased acceptance and usage by Air Traffic Management (ATM) researchers, concept developers and analysts. It is currently being used by the FAA, JPDO and other organization to develop and evaluate current and future airspace concepts in support of NASAs VAMS and NGATS efforts. The proposed ACES agent model composition toolkit will significantly increase the flexibility and usability of ACES, and reduce the lead time and cost associated with developing new concepts and/or inserting new models into ACES.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		   Phase 1 has seen the development of a revolutionary new type of sensor for making carbon dioxide (CO2) measurements from small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and other platforms such as sounding balloons.  The chemistry behind the new sensor has been proven, example sensors were fabricated, and the technique has shown its immunity to many interferences (notably humidity and temperature) which affect other carbon dioxide measurement technologies.
   Phase 2 will involve optimizing the new sensor in terms of sensitivity and manufacturability.  Several field tests will be conducted with the new sensor, including baseline atmospheric CO2 measurements as well as CO2 flux measurements.  Four sensors of the final design developed in Phase 2 will be delivered to NASA for use on small UAS platforms.  
   Anticipated results include the completed development of a revolutionary new type of CO2 sensor for atmospheric research and its demonstration in the field prior to the conclusion of Phase 2.  A medical variant is expected to quickly result in part from this work as well.  It is also foreseen that several sensors for other gases may be developed based on this all-new measurement technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		   Other federal entities, notably NOAA and DOE, have researchers engaged in similar missions to those outlined above for NASA.  The work of these researchers will benefit from the new CO2 sensor as well.
   A very large market will be found in capnography (the medical measurement of exhaled CO2) for a variety of emergency treatment and diagnostic purposes.  The new CO2 sensor offers major advantages in several areas over existing technologies for this market.
   An industrial application is demand-control ventilation (DCV), in which CO2 measurements are used to keep the CO2 level of air inside a building at a safe level while minimizing the need for fresh air intake.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		   Two of the six Earth Science Focus Areas are Atmospheric Composition and Carbon Cycle and Ecosystems.  Both orbital and suborbital science components supporting research in these Focus Areas can directly benefit from the new CO2 sensor.  The new sensor will be of use in studies of CO2 fluxes and transport carried out using suborbital platforms.  
   Another NASA need the sensor will address is the need for a sensor to fly on sounding balloons to obtain vertical profiles of CO2 for the calibration and validation of satellite (e.g., the upcoming Orbiting Carbon Observatory and follow-on missions) and other remote-sensing measurements.  Disposable CO2 sondes based on this technology will provide an inexpensive and efficient means of addressing this need.

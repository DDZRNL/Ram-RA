		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The objective of the Phase II effort will be an affordable demonstrated full-scale design for a thermally stable multi-meter submillimeter reflector.  The Phase I effort resulted in a design for a thermally stable reflector which by analysis should survive the launch environment and satisfy the as manufactured surface tolerance and on orbit thermal stability requirements for operation at 660 GHz, as in a CAMEO SMLS type mission.  The Phase I effort motivates the Phase II effort to demonstrate with flight-like hardware the thermal stability of the design developed in Phase I.  The Phase I study answered fundamental questions about the important parameters affecting the hygro-thermal stability of a reflector.  In the Phase II, we plan to develop the technology required to realize the important parameters for thermal stability and then demonstrate the predicted thermal stability with a flight-like test article.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This advance would both meet the needs of next generation instruments, as well as provide a technology stepping stone to far term missions that envision apertures on the order of 10 meters. In the near term, Japan's SPICA mission will need a 3.5m cryogenic telescope in the 2010 timeframe. 

In the far term, the SAFIR mission is a high priority in Space Science that is envisioned to feature a 10m class aperture operating at 4K. This large of an aperture would certainly require a segmented design, and assembly (or deployment) would be accomplished without a full aperture master tool.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications involve development and production of large high accuracy reflectors for application in civil science missions such as the NASA / JPL Composition of the Atmosphere from Mid-Earth Orbit (CAMEO) mission where scientific instruments are intended to operate at frequencies up to 660h GHz.

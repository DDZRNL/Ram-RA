		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this Phase II effort Toyon will increase the state-of-the-art for video/image systems.  This will include digital image compression algorithms as well as system level integration, encompassing the image sensor all the way to compressed imagery data transport.  To accomplish these goals Toyon will design a complete FPGA-based video compression system. The novel aspect of this design lies in the dynamically reconfigurable hardware IP cores that will interface to an embedded processor. Similar to a software defined radio (SDR) system where separate RF waveforms are loaded at runtime, Toyon aims to reload separate image compression encoders.  This enables the use of several different image/video compression standards, all on the same hardware platform.  The dynamically reconfiguring architecture of this system enables a single image sensor and hardware platform to handle the two most common space video camera applications, while still maintaining low power consumption in a highly integrated package.  First, H.264 for high framerate, real-time video for situational awareness and surveillance.  Second, lossless JPEG200 encoding for scientific and research post-processing.  However, due to limited funds for this Phase II design, we will most likely work with a purchased H.264 IP core along with a standard JPEG compression core, which Toyon developed on the Phase I of this program.  Providing the capability to reconfigure for both motion video and still image compression will provide near-term utility and demonstrate feasibility for Phase III development.  Toyon will target the solution to a custom fully radiation hardened hardware platform.  Potential radiation hardened components include a Xilinx FPGA, Xilinx PROM, Atmel SRAM memory, Aeroflex voltage regulators, and a Cypress CMOS image sensor paired with space-ready optics.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA applications have direct non-radiation hardened terrestrial counterparts, with possible platforms including vehicles, personnel helmets, aircraft, and permanently mounted structures.  There would be particular interest in air-borne surveillance platforms.  All these applications could be for other DoD agencies as well as private industry.  In addition to non-radiation hardened applications, there would be a range of hardened commercial applications.  A standard platform would be a commercial satellite.  There has also been a recent surge in interest in space tourism, where there would be quite a range of applications for a video system.  However, there are also terrestrial radiation hardened applications, the main source being from nuclear power and research facilities.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The universal applicability of video systems, as well as the adaptable, reprogramable nature of our design, allows a wide range of NASA applications to be targeted.  Possible deployment platforms can be both mobile and stationary.  Several possibilities include mobile ground vehicles, personnel helmets, spacecraft, and planet surfaces.  The system can be designed around the desired application parameters, such as high or low image sensor resolution or output bitrate.  With the system's high radiation tolerance it can be targeted to permanent deployment applications.  Additionally, the use of digital data and standards-based CODECs allows for ease of integration into higher level networks, specifically IP-based networks.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Over the past decade, researchers have been making great strides in the development of algorithms that detect and compensate for damaged aircraft.  Before these algorithms can be used in civil aviation, progress is needed to (a) ensure that these innovative and frequently non-deterministic algorithms will always perform as expected and (b) address challenges associated with integrating these algorithms into an overall avionics system.  The authors addressed the second challenge by developing an integration approach called Operational Envelope Safety Assurance (OESA).  In Phase I, the authors showed that OESA can integrate control, path planning, diagnostics, and structural health monitoring algorithms in a way that ensures the subsystems will never issue commands that put the aircraft outside its safe-operating envelope.  In Phase II, the authors will formalize the approach, develop a general set of OESA subsystem specifications, and demonstrate safe integration of algorithms developed by other researchers under related research efforts.  Phase II will culminate in real-time high-fidelity demonstrations of an integrated controller for a NASA testbed (either the Langley AirSTAR GTM or the Dryden A-53 F-18 testbed) and will set the stage for Phase III flight tests.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The immediate Non-NASA application is algorithms, software, and tools for the civil aviation industry.  Additionally, the technology is well suited for high-level autonomous operations of unmanned vehicles (air and otherwise).  The proposer has an excellent track record transitioning algorithms of this nature for industry for use in commercial and defense-related applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology directly addresses Level 3 IRAC elements of the NASA Aviation Safety Program, and touches on Levels 1 and 2.  Additionally, by integrating structural health monitoring with inner- and outer-loop control, the approaches developed here would also be suitable for life extending control (i.e., using effector redundancy to minimize wear on key structural elements).  Finally, the technology is directly applicable to NASA's space exploration mission in that it provides trajectory generation and control algorithms that are capable of compensating for unforeseen failures or massive uncertainties in atmospheric conditions.

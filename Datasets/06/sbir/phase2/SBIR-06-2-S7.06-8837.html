		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The principal Phase II objective is to refine and further develop the prototype PCHP into a useful thermal management tool.  The Phase I program established the feasibility of thermal control an axially-grooved heat pipe with a variable-volume reservoir.  The follow-on Phase II program will address control system optimization, component longevity, reductions in mass and power, and show that the device can be flight qualified.  It is expected that the Phase II results will bring the PCHP to TRL 6: Prototype Demonstration in a Relevant Environment.

		VCHP heat exchangers:  ACT is developing VCHP heat exchangers for a diesel fuel reforming process.  The PCHP would yield an improved since it would allow for changes in exchanger set point after manufacture, improve set point stability, and provide more rapid transient response.  

Thermal Calibrators:  ACT has a product line of high temperature heat pipes which are frequently sold to national standards laboratories in several countries.  The PCHP technology could be extended to high temperature fluids such as sodium or potassium and allow sales of improved high-temperature calibrators.  A similar market may exist for a low-temperature device such as a PCHP based on ammonia or ethane.   

Laser Diode Cooling:  Laser diode bars generate substantial amounts of waste heat.  Since the emitted wavelength is temperature dependent, as well as removing waste heat any cooling solution must also maintain the diode bar within tight temperature limits.  The PCHP would be ideal for this application since it can carry significant amounts of power while providing tight evaporator temperature control.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The immediate NASA application is to provide an alternative to a heater-controlled VCHP that had been used as a temperature-regulation element for an LHP. This device regulated the amount of heat that was transferred between the liquid and vapor lines and thereby allowed control of the LHP operating temperature.  The PCHP would provide a device with much faster response time and more repeatable performance and could also consume less power.  A second, more general NASA application is thermal management of satellites, in particular those carrying highly temperature-sensitive components such as laser diode arrays.  As well as providing cooling for those components, the actual operating temperature is important because it affects the output wavelength.  The PCHP would provide much tighter temperature control than existing VCHP solutions.   The PCHP would also allow on-orbit adjustment to adjust for uncertainties in performance of the other thermal management components or to compensate for aging of components such as radiator coatings.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Long duration spaceflight and exploration missions will require complex operations and demanding tasks. Success will therefore depend on the knowledge and flexibility of the crew and the critical tools at their disposal. The purpose of this Phase II project is to develop a software tool that combines intelligent tutoring (or logic) with highly interactive 3D simulation software to create an on-demand situational training and operations support system. The platform will include a user interface that allows subject matter experts  not programmers - to author the logic and intelligent portion of each simulation in a non-programming environment for more cost effective training systems development. The project includes the creation of two new application program interfaces (API) an XML schema and several new Java functions to allow for communication between the logic engine software and the 3D scene. A menu-driven authoring interface will then be created. The feasibility of the system was determined in the Phase I project, and demonstrated with a 3D simulated NASA EVA decontamination trainer. For Phase II, a prototype of the system will be created for a current NASA scenario-based training system to test the commercial-readiness of the authoring tool.

		The completion of the Phase II will result in a commercial-ready simulation authoring tool for creation of interactive, user-driven training and simulation systems.  Its competitive advantage is a user interface that will allow subject matter experts to author the flow of a simulation, including tutoring information, simulation triggers and responses to user interactions without programming.  This improves the fidelity of PC-based training systems by introducing more video-game like behaviors like free-form interaction with 3D objects and multiple user choices in from a single scenario, but with a much faster development schedule and more cost effective pace. Immediate sales of the tool are expected from training system developers and low-level game designers, as well as its use in custom training system projects by PLANET's content development group. This tool will also be offered to PLANET's network of training partners currently working on projects for the U.S. Navy and commercial aerospace applications.

		<BR>
		Intelligent 3D simulations are ideal for payload or task trainers as a cost effective means to replace paper text-based instructions and training hardware trainer costs. On long-duration missions, they provide intelligent guides for training since astronauts will likely perform off-nominal procedures or actions trained for several years in the past. When embedded in an IVHM system, they also greatly improve the crews' ability to perform rapid diagnosis and repair. Hypercosm has been available commercially for six years, has been used for the past in several NASA training system developments for payload and robotic arm operations. The completion of the authoring tool will improve its adoption by NASA by providing a method that creates high fidelity, portable training systems that can compete with hardware trainers for effectiveness and cost-of-development.

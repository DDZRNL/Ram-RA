		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Environmental control systems for manned lunar and planetary bases will require condensing heat exchangers to control humidity in manned modules.  Condensing surfaces must be hydrophilic to ensure efficient operation and biocidal to prevent growth of microbes in the moist, condensing environment.  The coatings must be extremely stable and adhere to the condensing surface for many years.  We propose an innovative coating that has proven to be highly biocidal, hydrophilic, and stable.  In Phase I we have proven feasibility by developing methods to apply the coating to prototypical materials and demonstrating hydrophilic and biocidal performance under prototypical conditions.  In Phase II we propose to optimize the coating and demonstrate the performance of prototypical condenser surfaces designed to meet requirements for future lunar and planetary bases.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Efficient and reliable condensing heat exchangers will be needed for fuel cell generators or fuel reforming systems for portable electric power generation or onboard vehicular fuel cells or reformers.  These heat exchangers are required for water-neutral operation and hydrophilic and biocidal surfaces are needed for long-term reliability of the system.  The coating developed in the proposed program will be ideal for these applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's Project Constellation calls for establishing a lunar outpost within the next two decades.  The proposed condensing heat exchanger supports this goal by enabling efficient and reliable operation for the outpost's environmental control system.  By enabling recovery of water from the outpost atmosphere without using consumable absorber materials, the condensing heat exchanger enables simple operation of the environmental control system with minimal logistical support.  The coating will be useful for condensing heat exchangers needed for future pressurized rovers and planetary bases.  The coating will also be useful for potential upgrades of the environmental control system on the International Space Station, which has experienced degraded operation due to failure of hydrophilic coatings on condensing heat exchangers.

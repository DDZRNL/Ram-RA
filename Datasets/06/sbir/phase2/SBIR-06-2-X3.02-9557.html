		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The purpose of the Enhanced Brine Dewatering System (EBDS) is to provide a scalable means of completely recovering usable water from byproducts created by reverse osmosis water purification systems without the use of consumable wicks. Extended duration Lunar and Mars missions will require the conservation and recovery of water to allow for autonomous closed environments that dramatically reduce launch mass and stowage volumes. The EBDS development will build on previous developments in condensing heat exchangers to establish reliable, passive, and energy-efficient methods for recovering water, and will develop the phase separation and solid salt removal and collection methods required for EBDS functionality. The EBDS will use evaporation and condensing surfaces designed to eliminate biological growth through material selection, surface treatments, and hardware operational procedures. Design for the reduced gravity of Lunar and Martian applications enables simplified liquid/gas separation, compared with microgravity applications, and makes the design readily applicable to terrestrial applications. Crew interaction is limited to periodically removing the bio-isolated waste byproducts from the system. A fully functional prototype Lunar Outpost EBDS will be developed and tested for an extended duration, to evaluate long-term feasibility and performance, and to bring the EBDS to TRL 6.

		EBDS provides a reliable, scalable, energy efficient, and low maintenance method of recovering usable water from reverse osmosis brines. The primary use of the EBDS technology is for long-duration space applications due to the high cost of launching extra water, thus both government and commercial space travel will benefit. The first application of EBDS is seen for the Lunar Outpost application to enhance water recovery with some of the systems currently being tested at JSC (e.g., Honeywell Water Cascade Distillation System). Then, as commercial space travel becomes a reality, launch mass and volumetric savings provided by EBDS will directly impact viability of commercial space travel. The EBDS technology will also provide benefits to commercial aerospace when long-term ventures in space, such as orbiting space stations or extra terrestrial outposts for the purpose of tourism or other commercial gain, become a reality.

		<BR>
		The EBDS enables water reclamation from waste water brines without the use of consumable wicks. EBDS can process wastewater created by reverse osmosis treatments and provide water suitable for post-treatment and human consumption. The EBDS can also be used to recover water from laundry washing and drying applications, and directly from urine. The primary application of the EBDS is on extraterrestrial outposts, but it can also interface with the Advanced Water Recovery Systems (AWRS) of the Advanced Life Support (ALS) project or similar systems required for all long-duration human spaceflight systems. By using EBDS, launch mass and volume can be greatly reduced by minimizing the amount of water lost to waste. In addition to saving the volume and mass associated with carrying extra water, crew time and stowage are reduced over other NASA brine water recovery hardware currently under development by greatly increasing the time between service operations.

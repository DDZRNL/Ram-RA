		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced Materials Technology, Inc responds to the NASA solicitation Topic X9 entitled "Propulsion and Propellant Storage" under subtopic X9.01, "Long Term Cryogenic Propellant Storage, Management, and Acquisition".  The proposed Phase II program will focus on developing new multifunctional insulation materials that will impact cryogenic systems for space transportation orbit transfer vehicles, space power systems, spaceports, spacesuits, lunar habitation systems, robotics, and in situ propellant systems.  These innovative materials will be capable of retaining structural integrity while accommodating large operating temperatures ranging from cryogenic to elevated temperatures conditions.  These advanced materials can be incorporated into thermal protection systems (TPS), reducing the amount of TPS and its structure.  We will continue to use the technical approaches that have shown tremendous potential during the successful Phase I effort.  Our key approach will be based on the development, fabrication, and characterization of organic-inorganic nanocomposite foams.  In the Phase I program, we successfully demonstrated the feasibility of fabrication of these new foams with significantly improved mechanical properties.  Our results confirmed that the proposed technology have high potential in developing strong, lightweight, cryogenic insulation materials.  The proposed effort will further enhance and optimize the novel foams, scale up the optimized materials, and culminate in the fabrication of prototype materials to demonstrate the readiness and maturity of our techniques.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology developed under this program can benefit aerospace, marine, aircraft, electronic, electrical, rail, automotive, building materials, and construction industries, as it offers unique combination of insulation, fire protection, and structural support capabilities.  The new organic-inorganic hybrid foams can be used as thermal and acoustical insulation on marine vessels.  These foams can be shaped for easy installation as pipe covering.  Reinforced aluminized polyester/aluminum foil vapor barrier and/or ceramic glass cloths can be easily laminated to the novel foams.  The new foams are specifically suited for the needs of the aircraft industry.  These high performance foams will provide weight savings, improved handling/installation characteristics and enhanced performance durability in service compared to traditional insulation, resulting in lower operating and life cycle costs.  In addition, the foams meet flammability, smoke, and toxicity requirements of aircrafts.  The fire and moisture resistance, as well as thermal/acoustic insulating properties make it an excellent choice for the rail industry.  In many electronics and instrumentation applications, where outgassing is a concern, the new hybrid foams can meet the requirements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		With their ability to remain flexible and resilient from as low as 400 F to as high as +600 F, novel foams offer the ideal choice for lightweight insulation in space applications.  One such application is cryogenic insulation for fuel tanks on major rocket propulsion systems.  Another is thermal insulation on the louvers of communications satellites where intermittent exposure to sun and darkness requires the novel foam's operating temperature range.  The technology proposed in this program will help NASA to reduce the cost of space flight.  Our materials will provide NASA with robust cryogenic solutions and, therefore, will significantly decrease space mission failures.   Other NASA applications include space shuttle program where the new foams can provide lightweight, fire resistant cushioning for medical supplies and critical instruments.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		For over 15 years, FMW Composite Systems has developed Metal Matrix Composite manufacturing methodologies for fabricating silicon-carbide-fiber-reinforced titanium components, also known as Titanium Matrix Composites (TMC), for the aerospace industry. These efforts have resulted in successfully flight qualifying three TMC components, including a piston rod used in the divergent exhaust nozzle actuator for the Pratt & Whitney F119 engine (F-22), and two exhaust nozzle actuator links for the GE F110 engine (F-16). TMC weight savings over the monolithic titanium and steel components being replaced typically varies from 35 to 45% depending upon the application load requirements. The relatively low density of TMC (10% lower than Titanium) combined with its excellent mechanical behavior, results in significantly higher specific static properties than conventional material systems. Additionally, creep resistance of TMC is dramatically enhanced over monolithic titanium due to the presence of the SiC fibers, which do not exhibit discernible creep at the temperature regime of interest. Currently, FMW is working with closely with the aerospace industry to develop TMC structural components for both Military and Commercial airframe applications. FMW proposes to use this same technology to work with the Jet Propulsion Lab to develop a TMC pressure vessel for the Venus Lander mission.

		Expansion of FMW's TMC manufacturing base to include compound curvature parts with integral monolithic attachment points will facilitate the use of TMC in a variety of potential applications. In addition to the targeted NASA application of pressure vessels for planetary probes and landers, other hot metallic structure applications requiring compound curvature would also benefit. Near leading edge surfaces of future hypersonic vehicles and exhaust path surface structure on military aircraft are potential applications that would benefit from the development of the manufacturing methods needed to produce TMC pressure vessels.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Phase I effort conceived a novel method for ISRU oxygen extraction and liquefaction from lunar regolith, repre-senting a significant advance in the state of the art.  The approach uses solar photovoltaics as a power source to heat and extract oxygen with highly favorable system metrics, capable of achieving TRL 3 during a Phase II effort and TRL 6 in earth gravity during Phase III. Autonomy of operation is straightforward with simple robotics.  Annual oxygen output is calculated to be many times the system mass.  Projections of engineering development indicate the potential to be flight-ready for lunar operations by the time a lunar outpost is established, followed by commercial lunar operations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Many nations have announced plans for missions to the moon (China, Russia, India, Japan, Sweden, US).  With a fueling depot on the moon selling a guaranteed supply of LOX for return missions, an economic payback exists for the expenses required to build this factory on the moon.  Trips to Mars using chemical rockets can be fueled from the L1 point ("Gateway"), greatly reducing the rocket requirements for earth launch.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA Administrator Mike Griffin has been quoted saying that entrepreneurs who can extract oxygen on the moon by roasting the soil may generate a "21st century gold rush".  Mike Duke (Colorado School of Mines) has outlined a system involving transport of lunar LOX to LEO to service the needs of space operations, which can generate significant profits.  A number of methods for LLO to LEO transport have been envisioned to carry both passengers (tourists) and cargo.    Economics become favorable with a high-value product such as fuel oxidizer.  Therefore, our invention is necessary for the commercialization of cis-lunar space, making space conducive to further development by entrepreneurs and aerospace companies.

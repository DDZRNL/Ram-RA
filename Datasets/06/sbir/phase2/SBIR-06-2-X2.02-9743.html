		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The new Constellation vehicles, habitats and robots will be highly
sensored and generate large amounts of data.  For this data to be
useful to humans monitoring these systems and to automated algorithms
controlling these systems it will need to be converted into more
abstract data.  This abstracted data will reflect the trends and
characteristics of the systems and their environments.  Currently this
data abstraction process is manual and ad hoc.  It is manual in the
sense that either humans do the abstraction in their heads or the data
abstraction is done by hand-coding computer programs for each data
item.  It is ad hoc in the sense that each data abstraction is
developed on its own with no representation of how it relates to the
tasks being performed or to other data abstractions.  In this project
we propose building a Data Abstraction Architecture (DAA) that allows
engineers to design software processes that iteratively convert
spacecraft data into higher and higher levels of abstraction.  The DAA
also formalizes the relationships between data and control and the
relationships between the data themselves.  The DAA consists of
representations for data and data abstractions, a data store, a
abstraction architecture processing engine and a development
environment.  We will evaluate the architecture using three NASA
domains: 1) a lunar outpost monitoring and control application; 2) a
robotic scientific survey application; and 3) a vehicle procedure
execution scenario.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		he Department of Defense (DOD) is the primary non-NASA
commercialization customer.  Unmanned vehicles, both air, ground and
underwater, are becoming more and more common in battlefield
situations.  Future Combat Systems (FCS) envision manned and unmanned
vehicles of all sizes working side-by-side.  In addition, Congress has
mandated that one-third of all military vehicles must be unmanned by
2015.  Unmanned air vehicles patrol the borders in Iraq and provide
intelligence to support ground operations.  Current vehicles require
multiple crew members to fly each mission.  Often missions cannot be
performed because there are not enough trained crews.  Software that
can allow one person (or a ground commander) to obtain information
directly from several vehicles in an integrated fashion would provide
a significant return on investment.  Our software will help reduce the
operator burden and increase productivity and mission success.
Civilian uses of unmanned vehicles are expanding rapidly.  The
recently announced immigration reform bill authorizes unmanned air
vehicles to patrol the US borders.  Commercial companies might also
use unmanned vehicles to fight forest fires, patrol large
installations, track wildlife or take pictures.  We expect that
commercial applications of our software will mature as unmanned
vehicles become more prevalent over the next decade.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		With NASA investing many billions of dollars in the first new
spacecraft in thirty years, there will be many opportunities for
advanced information technology.  We will target the Crew Exploration
Vehicle (CEV) prime contractor (Lockheed Martin) or one of their
subcontractors (e.g., Honeywell) as partners.  We will also target
NASA Mission Operations Directorate ( MOD) and United Space Alliance
(USA) as a customer for data abstraction in ground operations.  In
addition, NASA's robotic missions and uncrewed space vehicles are also
potential customers. NASA commercialization will focus on two areas.
First, human monitoring of space system (e.g., mission control). In
this case, the DAA is being used to provide human operators with
abstracted data about the system to support their decisions.  The
operators could easily create new DAAs for specific tasks that they
have.  The second NASA application is as a companion to spacecraft and
robotic automation.  Most automation software requires abstracted data
in order to operate.  This project will allow data abstractions to be
created outside of the control software and connected via the data
store.  Control engineers would specify what data they needed for
their control tasks and a DAA would be built to supply that data.  We
estimate we will have five NASA customers within five years of the end
of Phase II.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This work concerns the development of a prototype of a Volume Scattering Function (VSF) sensor for measurement of this inherent optical property(IOP) of seawater. The proposed prototype combines new development from Phase-I with our existing technology to extend existing capability for measuring VSF from 0.1 to 20 degrees, out to 170 degrees. We have developed a new and innovative sensor module that permits high sub-degree angular resolution measurement of VSF. The system is simple, yet powerful. For example, it permits programmability of the range of angles to be explored. A case is one of bubbles, which produce a bump in the VSF between 60-180 degrees. The instrument will be self-contained, internally recording, powered by batteries or external power. Beam attenuation coefficient will also be measured. The technology extends existing VSF measurement capability for benefit of NASA's interest in remote sensing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A signficant number of the activities listed above are also practiced by non-NASA government and non-government agencies, Universities, and private, for-profit enterprises. For example, light in the sea affects primary productivity which ultimately relates to fisheries. Underwater photography and survey, search and rescue, and health of coral populations. Thus, applications in the non-NASA sector are also broad, driven by environmental physical, chemical, and biological sciences.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The inherent optical properties (IOP's) of the sea are relevant to light propagation, primary productivity, ocean color, LIDAR probing, underwater imaging, visibility, and a host of other scientific activities. Some of these activites are from spaceborne platforms, others from airborne or shipborne equipment. The present capability will provide sea-truth data. The data are used for modeling and radiative computations as well.

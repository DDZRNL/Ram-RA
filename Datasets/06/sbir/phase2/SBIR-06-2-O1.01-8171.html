		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Current and upcoming NASA space links require both highly reliable low-rate communications links supporting critical TT&C, ranging and voice services and highly efficient High-data rate links supporting Mission or Payload Data. Investing in re-usable elements, such as Programmable Communications Radios, for ground and flight data handling that are capable of receiving both kinds of links would address current Communication and Navigation needs without foregoing future capabilities. 

Additionally, the development, test, and optimization of new algorithms and modulation schemes require a high-speed platform able to be reconfigured as needed. Such a product would feature an open and modular architecture, allowing users to independently load and route custom code blocks. A modular and flexible High Rate Receiver Backbone (HRRB) would allow customization of some processing firmware and should accommodate advances in deployed link formats more easily than units "factory loaded" for particular signal types.

SRI's Phase 1 SBIR researched, developed an architecture and test bed, and coded and tested an initial set of waveforms as a baseline for a Programmable High-rate Multi-mission Receiver. The results of this effort showed the technical and commercial viability of such a unit. The proposed Phase 2 effort will extend this innovation by developing and implementing an IF front end, refining and extending the performance of the ADC/DAC sections and hardware architecture, extending the architecture to support programmable and configurable decoding processing capacity, testing performance with both extended development support modulators/coders as well as other available high-rate modulators, and delivering a realized HRRB for further NASA use. Additional market segmentation, analysis, and prospect identification would be conducted in preparation for either a Phase 3 or independent SRI development of a market-ready Programmable High-rate Multi-mission Receiver (PHMR).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are many non-NASA business applications and deployment possibilities for a highly programmable satellite, space, and range link receiver supporting low-rate TT&C as well as high-rate imaging and other bandwidth intensive mission data links. The proposed PHMR would be applicable to a wide range of Governmental and Commercial requirements including (1) the DoD ISCN, (2) TSAT, FCS, GIG and other DoD networking initiatives envisioning data rates at or near 1Gbps, (3) commercial networks such as Universal Space Network, Inc. and DataLynx that would be interoperable with NASA assets, offering potential offloading for particular missions, (4) imaging organizations such as Orbimage, DigitalGlobe, USGS, and NOAA missions such as GOES-R and LDCM that provide bandwidth intensive satellite imaging and Earth Observation products, and (5) links required for imaging and other TT&C and high-bandwidth payload transmissions from UAVs and related non-satellite/non-space platforms.

There is also a nascent market for Synthetic or Virtual Instrumentation. This market uses general purpose hardware that is intended to perform many different kinds of signal capture and analysis functions. These tasks often require high-speed, low noise digitization and signal processing equipment that is flexible enough to be used for a variety of tasks. Although SRI has not studied this market in any depth, the requirements of a PHMR or HRRB can be similar to equipment available in this market.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A Programmable High-rate Multi-mission Receiver will enable NASA to support multiple missions and link types with a single, flexible receiver. Utilizing highly reconfigurable receivers for Communications and Navigation tasks in Network and Trunking links, SRI anticipates that NASA will benefit from a design that supports (1) high rate links for Deep Space, Near-Earth, Lunar and Martian Relay missions, (2) low rate links for critical TT&C, ranging and voice services, (3) GEE and Range Upgrade and Modernization within the DSN, GN, SN/TDRSS, STDN and related networks.

Additionally, NASA often conducts research and development with a goal of increasing the understanding of and efficiencies in new and legacy modulation and coding methods. Since sometimes in advanced research "you don't know what you don't know", a receive test platform that is flexible enough for many as-yet undefined decoding algorithms and modulation schemes and, similar to an Arbitrary Waveform Generator, would provide an affordable, flexible, and reusable platform for just such R&D and optimization efforts. Such a High-Rate Receiver Backbone (HRRB) might be appropriate for both Lab and Operational tasks.

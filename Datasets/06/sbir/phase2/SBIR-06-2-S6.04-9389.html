		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		An innovative, ultra-low phase-noise, fully integrated single-chip cavity oscillator is proposed. The cavity is built on a standard MMIC process and has a quality factor of 120 at 50 GHz, and an insertion loss of 7 dB. This proposed technique is very well suited for MMW applications with emphasis on the frequency range 50-100 GHz. The achievable phase noise at 50 GHz is -112 dBc/Hz at 100 KHz offset. This is at least 10dB better than the best fully integrated oscillator reported today. To our knowledge this is the first ever implementation of a waveguide cavity on standard MMIC process. This new technique will allow the realization of ultra-small, high-performance integrated oscillators for future market demands. The oscillator can be readily integrated with digital blocks to form a Phase Locked Oscillator (PLO). The PLO will consist of a cavity oscillator, phase frequency detector, prescaler, and a loop filter. All components can be integrated on InP HBT process.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Miniaturized MMIC sources will be useful in all microwave transmitters and receivers for all applications. Commercial systems operating MMW frequencies include: satellite terminals for video and data transfer, high data-rate portable terminals, point-to-point radio links, automotive radars, and others. Many of those systems require portable and unattended terminals in which the size/weight of components become a major limiting factor. The proposed program will lead to partial solution of those problems in all those commercial systems. The projected number of terminals for those systems add up to millions, representing a large market comparable to cellular and personal communication systems operating in lower frequency bands. Examples:

1.	VSAT and USAT satellite networks for broadband multi-media (voice, video, and data) communications such as Hughes Network. Hittite is a supplier of MMIC components for signal sources used in Hughes Spaceway Terminals operating in the 20/30 GHz band.
2.	High-capacity point-to-point radio links operating in 11, 23, 26 and 38 GHz bands.
3.	Collision avoidance and cruise control radars used in automobiles operating in the 77 GHz band.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Signal sources are critical components in all communications and radar systems. Miniaturized fundamental frequency oscillators will serve the need for receivers in small platforms for deep-space transponders, radars for monitoring planets and earth atmosphere, radio-frequency spectrometers, radiometers, and others.

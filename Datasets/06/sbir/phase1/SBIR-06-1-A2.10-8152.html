<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
This Phase I SBIR program will demonstrate the use of wear resistant high strength nanocomposites in the turbine engine repair and refurbishment process.  The metallic nanocomposite will be applied using laser additive remanufacturing to worn turbine blades.  This would provide greatly increased erosion resistance for rotorcraft turbine engines, extending their life and reducing fuel consumption by 15-20% over the life of the engine.  Powdermet will develop composite feedstocks optimized for laser additive manufacturing, and is teamed with Flight Support International, and FAA certified repair shop certified for T64 engine repairs.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Currently, some rotorcraft operating in severe ground environments such as firefighting, deserts, and dusty urban enviroments need rebuilding in as little as 100-200 hours of operation due to erosion of compressor blades.  As the blades wear, engine efficiency and power are reduced until the rotorcraft becomes unsafe.  The proposed technology would result in a ten-fold improvement in rotorcraft engine life while providing new materials options for laser additive manufacturing and remanufactring of NASA parts including propellant valves, thrusters, bearing races, rotating seals, and other high wear components.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
This program will develop a domestic manufacturing base providing 15-30 micron composite powders to support the emerging manufacturing processes of laser additive manufacturing and cold spray. Powder feedstock design and optimization for laser additive manufacturing would be carried out,  enabing low cost powder production of virtually any alloy or composite for this rapidly growing manufacturing technique.  Currently, only costly nickel and titanium based powders are available in the desired 20 micron particle size, this program would develop a range of wear resistant, higher strength, and tailorable metallic nanocomposites to expand laser additive applications into additional markets.

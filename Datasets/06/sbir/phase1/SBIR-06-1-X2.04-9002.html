<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The program aims to demonstrate a new genre of all-magnetic logic circuits which are radiation-tolerant and capable of reliable operation in extreme environmental conditions including low temperatures and wide temperature swings.  The circuits are based on tunneling magnetoresistive technology, and are expected to have a greater single-event latchup immunity than semiconductor-based CMOS logic.  Recent breakthroughs in magnetic tunnel junction technology have resulted in magnetoresistive responses in excess of 200%.  With these developments adequate current gain may now be realized to implement practical multi-stage logic circuits.  This work will seek to prove novel gate designs and explore the magnetic thin-film tunneling structures necessary to realize them.

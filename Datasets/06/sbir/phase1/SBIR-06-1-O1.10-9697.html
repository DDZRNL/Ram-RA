<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
NASA is planning a series of human and robotic missions to explore the Moon and later Mars. According to NASA SBIR topic O1.10, surface networks are needed for these missions. In particular, for surface networks, NASA needs reconfigurable, directionally selectable, steerable, multi-frequency switched patch or multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna arrays to be mounted on human helmets, robots, and fixed structures (e.g. habitats). These antennas must meet the specific performance requirements for lunar/planetary surface network and the demanding transport and operational space environments. Wang Electro-Opto Corporation (WEO) proposes an SBIR Phase-1 program to develop a "Smart Multifunction Antenna for Lunar/Planetary Surface Network." Two general design approaches will be investigated initially: beamsteering array and MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) array. The technical approach will leverage WEO's existing well-published smart, multifunction, broadband, conformal and low-profile antennas developed for DoD (Department of Defense) terrestrial applications. The proposed Phase 1 research will aim at demonstrating, by breadboard experiments, the feasibility of the technical approach in meeting NASA's specific operational requirements, the constraints of space mission environment, and the limited room on astronauts and robots, fixed nodes, and other platforms. WEO will select the more promising one of these two approaches, based on performance criteria and other NASA inputs, for possible brassboard development in Phase 2.

As announced in NASA 2006 SBIR O1.10, NASA needs reconfigurable, directionally selectable, steerable, multi-frequency switched patch or multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna arrays for human spacesuits, robots, and fixed structures (e.g. habitats). The proposed "Smart Multifunction Antenna for Lunar/planetary Surface Network" is expected to cover various frequency bands at high transmission rate for data, video, and voice for lunar, Mars, and planetary exploration missions. The proposed smart multifunction antennas will also be small, low-profile, and platform-conformable for mounting on the limited room on human, robot, and other small platforms in surface networks as well as other space applications.<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Wireless is considered to be the most important technology for the coming decade (IEEE Spectrum, November 2004); and antenna is its center piece. The proposed smart multifunction antenna has also non-NASA military and commercial applications. The basic technology of the smart multifunction antenna technology can be applied to other platforms facing an ever greater number of wireless systems with increasing bandwidth in both military and commercial applications. Military applications include many JTRS (Joint Tactical Radio System) platforms, aircraft, tanks, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), the Future Combat System (FCS), etc. Commercial applications include cell phone array antennas for basestations, WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network), WiFi, WiMax, etc. In addition to terrestrial communications, the technology is also applicable to communications between the earth and satellites for both military and commercial users.

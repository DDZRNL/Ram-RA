<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
NanoSonic proposes to develop a low-weight, non-invasive in situ autonomous health-monitoring system for crewmembers' lunar extravehicular activity (EVA).  This novel sensor technology aims at monitoring health status to improve comfort and efficiency of astronaut as well as to eliminate catastrophic failure to the individual and mission.  The sensor system would consist of a fully-interconnected, non-invasive, and wearable Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP>-Textile sensor, which would be worn underneath the protective spacesuit (outer-vehicular wear) and/or can also be integrated into the inner lining of suits worn inside NASA exploratory lunar vehicles.  The comfortable, durable, and low mass density fabric sensor network would be developed via Metal Rubber(TM) technology and nanostructured materials for mapping crewmembers' health status via advanced intrinsic physiological monitoring.  Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> is fabricated as a conformal coating or free-standing material via layer-by-layer, molecular self-assembly, which enables thickness and placement control over multiple constituents for true nanostructured multifunctionality; while advanced polymers have allowed scale-up to free-standing materials (several mm thick).  Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> requires less than 0.03 volume % of metal, allowing the manufacturing a cost effective, low-weight material.  NanoSonic's proposed health-monitoring system would address monitoring the astronauts' metabolic rate, heart rate, electrocardiogram (ECG), and body temperature for both EVA and intra-vehicular activities.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA applications for Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> sheet stock and textiles include use as ultra-lightweight wearable health-monitoring systems (as proposed here), deployable antennas, wiring and cabling, and coatings that are protective against electrostatic charging, EMI, radiation and abrasion.  Low modulus Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP>-based materials can also function as conducting electrodes for high strain mechanical actuator and sensor devices, and as low-weight, electrically conductive and mechanically flexible coatings for systems requiring physically-robust electromagnetic shielding, ground planes or electrical interconnection. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> and Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP>-Textiles can be used as replacements for conventional metallic wire sensors, heavy and bulky antenna components, and as a replacement for tin-lead solder for the mechanical, electrical and thermal interconnection of electronic and mechanical components.  Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP>-Textile materials may also be used in high performance, highly flexible and mechanically robust wearable sensor systems, electronic flex circuits, antennas, flexible displays and smart electronic fabrics.

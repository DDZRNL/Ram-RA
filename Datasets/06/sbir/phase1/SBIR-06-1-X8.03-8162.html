<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are attractive candidates for use as power sources in aerospace applications because they have high specific energy, energy density and long cycle life. Yardney/Lithion Inc has become the leader in cutting edge Lithium Ion batteries. At the present moment, two of the Lithion batteries are operating on the surface of Mars with great success. In a conventional Li-ion battery when the rate is higher than C, their charge/discharge performance is severely degraded and loss its capacity permanently. Now we are focusing our interest to develop Li-ion batteries that can rapidly charge/discharge at high current rates. Yardney in collaboration with researchers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, MA, proposes to investigate a new non-toxic nano-engineered electrode that significantly shortens the Li+ diffusion length within the electrode materials and increases the rate capability of Li-ion batteries. The goal of Phase I of this project will be to develop new nano-architectured anode that has rapid Li+ recharge characteristics. Emphasis will be placed upon the construct of Fe3O4 based nano-engineered electrodes with Cu nanorods as current collectors. The high-rate capabilities change with the change in the diameter, packing density and aspect ratio of the Cu nanorods will be studied.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The target application for this nano engineered Li ion battery technology is space applications that require high energy and power densities. This technology will have superior performance at low temperatures due to the very small internal impedance of the nano-engineered electrode materials.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
High power applications include power tools, electric vehicles and telecommunications. Automotive and industrial sectors, where the slim, small-sized battery will deliver large amounts of energy while requiring only a minute to recharge. For example, the battery's advantages in size, weight and safety highly suit it for a role as an alternative power source for hybrid electric vehicles.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Long Range Space RF Telecommunications seeks solutions for long range missions using modular deep space transponders with smaller size and lower power components. While reconfigurable signal processing is typically performed in FPGA's, RF hardware is not nearly as agile, but if it were (small high Q filters, broadband actives) power savings and compact flexible RF radio architectures would be possible. As applied to an identified existing S and X band TTC transponder, the innovation described herein applies to EW and broadband RF channelizers, and commercial Software Defined Radios.<br><br>The proposed innovation seeks to demonstrate that a universal, reusable and digitally programmable RFIC combining avionics proven MEM's and SiGe BiCMOS (130~180 nm) technology is that solution.  The effort will demonstrate the sufficiency of a RF CMOS switch for the application described.  On chip RF primitive circuits are combinatorial configured along with on or off chip ruggedized piezo film MEM's filters/resonators, providing a practical and reliable RF macro block configurable for receive or transmit modes from <100 MHz to >8 GHz.  Primitive RF building blocks are electronically reconnected on chip to enable such RF macro functions as RF up/downconverter, IQ mod/demodulator, and image reject mixer; digital I/O and bias circuitry is included.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Virtually all NASA space programs have a demand for this technology and future product from Space Micro. Applicability to S or X-band DSN, STDN, and TDRSS transponders. Of particular interest are programs for long range RF communications. Potential NASA applications range from space shuttle, space station, earth sensing missions e.g. (EOS), and deep space missions. NASA programs/missions that will benefit include lunar landers and orbiters, Mars missions, solar system exploration e.g. (Titan, Europa, comet nucleus return, New Discovery and Living with a Star (LWS). New programs including both Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) at Lockheed Martin and Commercial Orbiter Transportation Service (COTS) would benefit.   Products evolving from this SBIR may also support  future programs such as Dawn, Aquarius, Kepler, Ocean Vector Winds, and space interferometry.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
There is a great need within both DoD and commercial space for lower cost SGLS hardware with this enabling technology.	<br><br>This technology and product will benefit new  commercial space projects such as communications and imaging. Space platforms, both LEO and GEO telecommunication satellites, such as Intelsat, Direct TV, XM radio, and earth sensing applications e.g. (NOAA and SPOT). 	<br><br>This technology and products will also address DoD space communications needs. This includes Air Force, NRO, MDA, and NOAA projects. Example programs may include T-Sat, ANGELS, TacSat series, AEHF, and STSS.<br>

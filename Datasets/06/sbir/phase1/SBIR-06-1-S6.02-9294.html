<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
To address the NASA Earth Science Division need for high-speed fiber optic multiplexers for next generation lidar systems, Luminit proposes to develop a new Fiber Optic Micromultiplexer (FOMM) based on InP/InGaAsP photonic integrated circuits (PIC) and digital optical switches (DOS).  This approach makes innovative use of a modular expandable binary tree architecture for robust high-speed switching with a new application of the latest PIC and DOS technology.  This approach enables us to design a lightweight (200 g), compact multiplexer that consumes only 1 A of electricity and can switch a fiber-coupled NIR laser transmitter among 16 single-mode fiber outputs in 4 ns while consuming only 5 W of electricity.  In Phase I, Luminit will demonstrate the feasibility of ~20 ns switching and ~1 W laser power with a proof-of-principle 1-to-4 FOMM that has three electro-optical fiber switches, which will reduce the development risk of a Phase II 1-to-16 prototype that incorporates the PIC/DOS technology.  The demonstrated results will offer NASA enhanced return signal and image resolution for lidar systems.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed 1-to-16 FOMM will lead to the creation of a fiber-based fixed-array laser transmitter that, combined with a fiber-arrayed detector, can form a laser image with a shaped field of view for an enhanced lidar return signal and image resolution.  Monolithic integration, high reliability, low power consumption, light weight, and hermetically sealed mini-packaging will make the device suitable for next generation space and airborne deployment. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
In addition to its use as an electro-optic switching array for NASA lidar, the 1-to-16 FOMM device will have competitive advantages in the areas of optical remote sensing and environmental monitoring.  In addition to lidar applications, the proposed 1-to-16 FOMM device will be useful in fiber optic communications and applications requiring all-fiber switching and multiplexing of high power lasers.

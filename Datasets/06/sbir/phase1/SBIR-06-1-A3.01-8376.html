<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The Airspace Flow Program (AFP) is a new Traffic Flow Management (TFM) control technique that has entered operation in 2006. AFPs use two existing technologies, Ground Delay Programs (GDPs) and Flow Constrained Areas (FCAs), to reduce demand on constrained areas of the airspace by issuing delays to be applied pre-departure. The operational use of AFPs during the 2006 severe weather season was received positively by the TFM community. However, there are significant aspects of AFP operational characteristics that differ from the previous airport-based GDPs. NASA's FACET model has already contributed significantly to the research and evaluation of TFM concepts. As the JPDO continues to refine its vision for the Next Generation Air Transportation System, additional capabilities in FACET will support its use as a critical tool for further NASA research. The development of an AFP model for FACET is an essential addition to support research and analysis of both current and future TFM operations. Mosaic ATM proposes to conduct detailed analysis of AFP operations and to develop an AFP model for FACET.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The analysis of AFP operations and development of a FACET AFP model as proposed herein will support NASA's advanced research into TFM operations and decision support tools. The proposed FACET AFP model will provide the infrastructure and capability necessary for NASA researchers and other industry analysts to achieve deep insight into TFM operations. NASA will also benefit from the work to be conducted in this effort, through the transfer of the AFP model into the ACES modeling system.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Universities and other government agencies, including the FAA and JPDO, that conduct research on air traffic management could benefit from the use of the FACET AFP model. There are currently many research and operational users of FACET. The addition of an AFP model will provide added capability and benefit for all users of the system.

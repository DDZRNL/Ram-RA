<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The innovation proposed here is to provide a multi-physics modeling tool for materials damage assessment for application to future aircraft design.  The software compute engine is based on an existing state-of-art multi-physics solver using first principles of mechanical engineering.  Phase I will solve two significant NASA cases using this solver: 1) Coupled fluid-structure simulation of an aircraft wing with aeroelastic behavior and possible fragmentation of the wing, and 2) Simulation of a fuel tank rupture at a ground test facility including trajectory computation of the large fragments. Upon successful demonstration on these two problems, Phase II will proceed to enhance the Multi-Physics, fluid-structure-thermal, compute engine with: 1) a Graphical User Interface (GUI) wrapper to control the simulation, 2) The addition of continuum damage models, 3) a library of models for current NASA materials damage assessment cases, and 4) documentation of the GUI, delivery of the software and on-site training classes.  The GUI will allow non-expert users to import existing models from commercial CAD packages and Finite Element codes.  Using a desktop Personal Computer, engineers can quickly make accurate and reliable damage assessment decisions for future aircraft structures.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA applications include subsonic fixed wing, rotary wing, supersonic / hypersonic aircraft, test facility explosions and safety, space debris impact on orbiting vehicles, future outer space missions for probability of crashes in space, crew survival analysis for deep space missions to Mars with the possibility of micrometeoroid impact, and even flight deck mishaps involving collision and damage..  Plans for future space vehicles, at all NASA centers, including the Crew Exploration Vehicle, are now underway and it's important to learn from the Shuttle experiences in the early design phase. In this regard, NASA has established the "Design for Minimum Risk" criteria. An important element of these criteria is the analysis of component hazards and failure modes to determine the effect on the full system hazards and risks. With these current and future vehicle designs, the existing empirical methodologies used for evaluating hazards and assigning risk will not be adequate to determine the potential outcomes from a particular initiating event.  There is a risk that a critical sequence of events may be overlooked and that a potentially fatal outcome missed.  Therefore, risk management for blast, impact and fragmentation assessment is a top priority.  Digital Fusion, Inc submits this SBIR proposal to provide NASA with state-of-the-art computer software for direct and immediate application to these concerns.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The multi-physics modeling tool will directly apply to DoD Missile Defense Agency (MDA) programs, specifically tactical missiles for defensive interceptor systems which involve blast dynamics, impact and fragmentation. The U.S. Missile and Space Intelligence Center (MSIC) can directly use the software tool to analyze foreign missile concepts and threats. The fluid-structure-thermal interaction software will find commercial application in simulating car crashes, train accidents, ground shock propagation, aircraft-engine interactions with foreign debris, metal forming, component design for cars, aircraft, and watercraft.  Additional materials damage applications include safety analysis of bridges, highways, and explosions in buildings including terrorists' investigations.

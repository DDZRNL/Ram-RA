<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
A fully monolithically integrated L-band T/R module using InGaP/GaAs-based HBTs (heterojunction bipolar transistors) for both the transmit and receive functions is proposed. We plan to improve the efficiency by implementing a DHBT (double heterojunction bipolar transistor) InGaP HBT which is designed reduce the offset voltage. This DHBT design can offer a higher efficiency as well as increasing the safe operation region (SOA), which benefits both the low noise and high power requirements of a T/R module.  The footprint of the device is expected to be reduced by 20-30% by integrating the T/R function using the same device InGaP DHBT platform.   GaAs based devices are critical for the realization of reduced size and reduced power consumption MMIC (monolithic microwave integrated circuits) which provide the fundamental building blocks of T/R modules. InGaP HBT provide the lowest cost technology platform for high frequency devices in comparison to other device technologies such as Si-Ge and InP. In addition, InGaP/GaAs HBTs have been shown to be inherently radiation hard for both proton and g exposure, and are well suited for use in the space environment.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The realization of a high efficiency InGaP DHBT would have benefits <br>in electronically steered phase array radars and synthetic aperture radars. <br>This would provide the ability to obtain information on the surface of future space missions. The integration of the same device technology would reduce<br>the footprint and reduce the weight, which is highly attractive. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The market for this technology is very large since there is an increasing need for higher efficiency power amplifiers while simultaneously attempting to lower power consumption.  The proposed InGaP DHBT based devices are the best technological platform for serving the market demands at L-band and other frequencies for improved power amplifier performance at high efficiency levels and lower dc power consumption.  The immediate market for this technology is the cellular power amplifier market and WLAN.

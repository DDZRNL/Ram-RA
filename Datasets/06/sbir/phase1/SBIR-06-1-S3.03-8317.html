<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Single crystal piezoelectric actuators are proposed to enable  large stroke, high precision, shape control for cryogenic lightweight deployable membrane mirror structures for future NASA Science and communications applications. Piezoelectric properties of PMN-PT single crystal at a temperature of 4 K will be investigated. Compact piezo linear motor utilizing PMN-PT single crystal driver will be assembled and characterized at temperatures of 4K-300K. Specific goals for cryomotor are: maximum stroke >100 mm, maximum driving force ~10 N, response time ~ ms, positioning resolution ~50 nm, operating temperature of 4K-300 K, total mass <50 g, and power consumption <1 W. The deployment structure design and the stroke, force required for membrane mirror deployment will be identified in the phase I, and a 25 mm aperture membrane mirror deployment concept demonstration will be conducted in Phase I. At the conclusion of the Phase I program the feasibility of single crystal cryomotor for deployable membrane mirror will  have been demonstrated. In Phase II, optimized single crystal piezoelectric actuators will be integrated into a 3 m deployable membrane mirror structure and delivered to NASA Labs for evaluation.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Cryogenic actuators with large stroke, high precision, and position set-hold at power-off characteristics are desired for NASA adaptive optics, deployable truss structures, antenna tuning, and positioning. In particular, the proposed cryomotor could be used for shape control actuators, position control actuators and force control actuators for the primary mirror on JWST, TPF, SIM, SAFIR, Con-X and in other space-exploring missions. Large stroke screw driven actuators will also advance vibration control for flexible structures, which have been largely used in spacecraft because of their lightweight and deployability.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Large stroke, high precision actuators have applications such as active vibration control and structure morphing, RF communication tuning, bio-medical manipulators, photonic tooling, micro/nanofabrication and nanoassembly which require over mm stroke while keeping step resolution around nm. Cryomotor also holds promise for large scanning in cryogenic microscopy tools.

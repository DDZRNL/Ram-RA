<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
NASA has identified needs for compact high-energy-density primary and secondary batteries.  Lithium and Lithium Ion cells, respectively, are meeting these needs for both manned and unmanned needs.  The high power available in some of these cell chemistries can cause substantial internal heating in the event of sustained internal and external heating.  At sufficiently elevated temperatures, cell components can react energetically causing cell case rupture, and in some cases, fire.  The proposed will develop and demonstrate an internal means of controlling short circuit, which is chemically and electrochemically compatible with the cell's active materials.  Using suitable controls, safe handling of an external short circuit will be demonstrated in small cells.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed technology will offer a substantial improvement in system and personnel safety on NASA mission where high-energy-density lithium primary and lithium ion secondary batteries are required for mission success.  GI will work with companies who current manufacture these cells for NASA so that the proposed idea can be efficiently and cost-effectively incorporated.  Lithium and lithium ion cells are important sources of compact, reliable power for extravehicular activities (e.g., lighting) and manned planetary and lunar exploration.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Primary lithium batteries, like the Lithium/Thionyl Chloride and Lithium/Iodine cells, have found important use for implantable medical devices including neurostimulators, defibrillators, and drug-delivery systems.  Primary lithiums are also used in Manpack military power and in aviation for emergency locator beacons.  Primary lithium cells provide high cell voltage (3 Volts) and much longer operating time than conventional primary cells.  Lithium Ion rechargeable cells are used in a rapidly expanding market for laptop computers, cell phones, power tools and other portable communication and entertainment devices for the consumer.  In all cases, there is the risk that physical abuse, excessive heating or manufacturing defects could result in a sustained short circuit, leading to cell thermal runaway and cell venting.  GI will work with selected battery manufacturers of these consumer, medical and industrial batteries to incorporate the proposed concept for greatly improved user and system safety.<br>

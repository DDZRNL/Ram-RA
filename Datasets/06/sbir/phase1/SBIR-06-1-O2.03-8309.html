<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
NASA often must deal with the issue of protecting EMI sensitive payloads and instrumentation from damage due to radiated energy.  Many of these EMI sensitive payloads can be damaged by seemingly benign sources such as communication networks or microwave ovens. The problem becomes more difficult when these sensitive payloads and instrumentation require movement from one location to another.  It is extremely difficult and time consuming to identify and characterize the potential threat to these payloads with current tools and techniques. <br><br>Soneticom proposes to utilize a small network of sensors to quickly and efficiently identify and locate sources of EMI radiation. Once the source is located Soneticom will utilize available signal parameters such as Received Signal Strength (RSS) at each sensor to estimate the signal strength at any point within the network's coverage area.  Figure 2.1 is a conceptual diagram of how this innovation might look once displayed on a map. <br><br>Soneticom will utilize the existing Lynx Geolocation platform which has the capability to identify and locate an EMI radiation source in the 20 MHz - 3 GHz range.  The Lynx system will provide the hardware platform to develop algorithms required to estimate the signal strength across the network's coverage area. <br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
There are a number of potential NASA applications for Soneticom's EMI Field Strength Mapping Products: <br><br>EMI Threat Mitigation would be a primary use for the field strength mapping system.  It greatly increases the speed and efficiency of insuring that EMI sensitive equipment will not be compromised while in transit.  The system will identify, locate and display relative signal strengths of potentially damaging levels of radiated power.  Additionally, the system could be used to provide persistent monitoring of EMI levels for instance for the duration of a payload while in processing or on a launch pad.<br>  <br>Communication Validation is another mission that a field strength mapping system could be used for.  By deploying a field strength mapping system communication equipment coverage areas can be effectively mapped highlighting areas of poor coverage or potential interference issues.<br><br>Interference mitigation around the Space Center is a problem that the EMI filed strength mapping system could help resolve and locate and evaluate sources of potential interference that may pose a threat to safe flight operations.  Uninterrupted communication between flight systems and ground operations is critical to safe flight operations.  <br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Interference mitigation around commercial airports is a problem that the EMI filed strength mapping system could help resolve, locate and evaluate sources of potential interference that may pose a threat to safe commercial flight operations.  Uninterrupted communication between flight crews and ground operations is critical to the FAA's mission of safe flight operations.  <br><br>Cellular provider coverage mapping can be accomplished with the proposed system allowing commercial cellular providers to validate cellular coverage area.  The field strength mapping system would allow providers to quickly identify poor reception areas and potential cross cell interferences.<br> <br>Interference mitigation for the FCC is another application for the EMI filed strength mapping system.  The system can be deployed anywhere that the FCC has a complaint about interference.  The system would allow the FCC to evaluate and monitor signal level emissions to efficiently enforce licensed spectrum issues.<br>

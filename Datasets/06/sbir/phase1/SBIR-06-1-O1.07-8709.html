<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
MagiQ proposes to develop a compact tunable high-efficiency low-power-consumption entangled photon source.  The source, based on inter-Fabry-Perot-cavity Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) of pump light in periodically polled non-linear waveguides (PPLN or PPKTP) is expected to provide high spectral density flux of entangled photon pairs.  The output wavelength will be within the C-band (1529 to 1563 nm) permitting usage of plethora of components developed for classical communication links.  The Fabry-Perot setup will provide for the narrow frequency output ? an attractive feature for low power communications in presence of the ambient light.  Waveguide-based inter-cavity SPDC is the main proposed innovation.  The entangled output wavelength tuning will be achieved by changing the wavelength of the pump light.  The wavelength agility will facilitate device usage in the reconfigurable communications links ? a feature that can be very important in the planetary exploration systems involving small robotic explorers.  Breadboard demonstration of the time-bin entanglement setup will be completed during Phase I of the project; delivery of a fully functional device producing both, time-bin and polarization entanglement is expected at the end of Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
In order to circumvent severe flight weight constraints, NASA is looking into replacing conventional exploration rovers with small robotic explorers.  While this approach can greatly enhance planetary data acquisition capabilities, it also faces very significant challenges.  Small robots' size and their limited power storage ability require new, more efficient ways of inter-explorer communication.  Quantum communication techniques have for a while been investigated by NASA Glen Research Center for this purpose.  The research goal is to develop a quantum communication transmitter capable of supporting a 1-km long link while using only microwatts of power.  The proposed entangled photon source will be used as such transmitter.<P>

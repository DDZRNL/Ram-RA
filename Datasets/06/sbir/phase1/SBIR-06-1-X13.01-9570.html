<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Payload Systems Inc. proposes the Radiation Target Area Sample Environmental Chamber (RTASEC) as an innovative approach enabling radiobiologists to investigate the real-time, long-term radiation effects on living cells and tissues.  Most current research into radiation effects on living cultures is limited to short duration radiation exposure because of the lack of in-situ equipment to provide the environment needed to support cell/tissue culture growth while in the radiation field.  While these short-term experiments are vital to understanding cell and tissue culture reaction and adaptation to the radiation environment, long-term exposure at low dose rate is more likely to occur in space, and is more representative of long duration space missions of interest to NASA.  We propose developing the RTASEC to enable long-term radiation exposure studies at the Brookhaven National Lab by providing the proper environmental conditions (such as temperature, relative humidity, gaseous oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration, and ambient lighting) needed for the study of a variety of cell/tissue cultures, including mammalian, plant, microbial cells, and tissues, in both suspension and attachment culture modes.  The RTASEC can be used with a variety of existing culturing systems, including standard vials, wells, and flasks, such as the T-25, and NASA's rotary bioreactor.  As an added benefit, the RTASEC will also be capable of supporting studies involving laboratory animals such as mice and rats.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed RTASEC will enable long duration radiation exposure studies at NSRL.  A variety of cell/tissue cultures, including mammalian, plant, microbial cells, and tissues, both in suspension and attachment culture modes, and rodent experiments will be supported in the RTASEC, making it a flexible tool for NASA radiobiology research at NSRL to increase its efficiency and capability, and help achieve the goals of NASA's Vision for Space Exploration.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Non-NASA applications include use as an incubator for cell/tissue culture and rodent research and development in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and medical industries, and as a portable incubator that can be used in remote field sites.

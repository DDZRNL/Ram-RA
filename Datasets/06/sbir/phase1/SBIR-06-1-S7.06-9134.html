<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
With the increasing power demands and longer life spans of space vehicles, their thermal management becomes ever more critical.  Accompanying this is an unprecedented need for reduction in spacecraft size and weight.  However, reduced weight leads to higher power densities, and waste-heat dissipation densities have grown by an order of magnitude with the use of smaller, more powerful electronics.  Active thermal control methods are needed to cope with the increasing heat dissipation requirements and environmental extremes.  In recent years, spacecraft have employed mechanically pumped fluid loops to efficiently transfer large amounts of thermal energy between two points by means of a forced liquid convention loop.  The development of long-life fluid pumps, however, has not kept pace with the demands of advanced thermal control systems.  Conventional electric motor-driven fluid pumps are heavy, bulky, inefficient, and prone to wear.  Lynntech proposes to extend the operating temperature range of its long-life, low-power, miniature, electrochemically-driven pumps to -60<SUP>o</SUP>C to 110<SUP>o</SUP>C, which will allow their use in space and planetary environmental extremes.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
A rugged, long life, low power, miniature pump capable of operating in extreme environments will have applications in the advance thermal control systems that will be required in future robotic missions and spacecraft.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
With the increasing power density of electronics, there is a growing market for miniature, low-power pumps for use in the thermal management of consumer electronics.  In particular, the interest in a low-cost, lightweight, quiet, efficient liquid pump for laptop cooling is high.

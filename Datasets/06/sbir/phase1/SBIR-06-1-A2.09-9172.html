<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Preliminary design of aircraft structures is multidisciplinary, involving knowledge of structural mechanics, aerodynamics, aeroelasticity, structural dynamics and design concepts. Even though analysis tools and computing resources have improved significantly, very little attention is being paid to the required data exchange and seamless interoperability for true multi-disciplinary analysis. Indeed there is a lot to be gained in performing multi-disciplinary  analysis up front in the design cycle during the conceptual design phase as changes during  mid or tail end of the design process are often expensive and difficult to implement. The net result is increased cost and performance limiting weight penalties on the air vehicle. It is essential to consider the impact of several design disciplines simultaneously to arrive at a satisfactory design where generated data for each discipline is seamlessly generated or available to each design discipline.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Traditional build and test procedures for developing conceptual prototype designs are costly and there is a need to perform computer simulations to rapidly evaluate multiple design configurations. The proposed software framework with advanced workbenches for multiple design disciplines and unique data management capabilities for interoperability between the various design disciplines has tremendous commercialization potential NASA airframe development applications. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Traditional build and test procedures for developing conceptual prototype designs are costly and there is a need to perform computer simulations to rapidly evaluate multiple design configurations. The proposed software framework with advanced workbenches for multiple design disciplines and unique data management capabilities for interoperability between the various design disciplines has tremendous commercialization potential  Non-NASA applications in the  automotive, marine and civil industry sectors that currently employ the costly traditional build and test for conceptual design.

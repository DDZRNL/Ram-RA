<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
NextGen proposes an approach to significantly enhance aeroelastic analysis capabilities over what is commonly available in linear analysis environments such as NASTANTM The approach to accomplish this builds upon an existing software framework that allows the integration of varying-fidelity aerodynamic modeling capability with varying videlit structural models. The approach utilizes inherently nonlinear aerodynamic predictions schemes that are incorporated into the aeroelastic solution strategy. Potentially large (geometrically nonlinear) structural deflections under the influence of nonlinear aerodynamic can be analyzed using the approach. Hierarchical levels of analysis capabilities are included, ranging from simple yet powerful empirical approaches to the complete coupling of high-order CFD codes and nonlinear structural models. An aeroservoelastic solution framework will be developed in Phase I resulting in a prototype nonlinear aeroelasticity method suitable for a proof-of-concept demonstration. The developed methods will be demonstrated on test cases of recent research interest, such as the Active Aeroelastic Wing (AAW) F/A-18 aircraft.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
This software product will benefit NASA commercialization potential by providing a more accurate and capable aeroelastic analysis methodology. The development and subsequent use of these new capabilities will result in more efficient design cycles yielding more effective designs that perform as they were intended. Common use of high-fidelity nonlinear aerodynamics will decrease the cost of producing aerospace vehicles as the risk of encountering a major design flaw late in the development process will be reduced. The expenses of a flight test program may even eventually be lessened as confidence is gained in simulation techniques to validate vehicle designs. For these reasons, transition from NASA research projects to the commercial sector will be facilitated.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The capabilities developed in this effort will significantly benefit general commercial applications because tools will be introduced that greatly simplify the aeroelastic analysis procedure. User-friendly interface modules will be introduced that will allow much faster problem definition and analysis set-up. The intent of this effort is to eventually offer the practicing engineer aeroelastic data relevant to the design process. To accommodate this, automated procedures will be implemented to perform pressure load integration over desired areas, thereby yielding quantities of practical interest, such as forces on aircraft components, hinge moments, and stability and control derivatives.

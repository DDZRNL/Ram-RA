<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Experimental measurements of rotor blades are important for understanding the aerodynamics and dynamics of a rotorcraft. This understanding can help in solving on-blade problems as well as in designing and optimizing the blade profiles for improved aerodynamics and noise attenuation in the next generation rotorcraft. Therefore, a Wireless Optical Pressure/Strain Sensor (WOPSS) system for helicopter on-blade pressure and strain measurement is proposed to utilize the benefits of low coherence interferometry system to create an innovative real-time pressure and strain measurement technique. Leveraging past and current experiences with fiber optic sensor development, a proof-of-concept of optical pressure/strain sensor system with wireless data acquisition and transfer capability will be demonstrated at the end of Phase I. The distributed optical pressure/strain sensor measurements will be used to obtain real-time dynamic pressure fields and mode shapes and displacements by integrating strain data for the helicopter rotor blade. Phase I efforts will conduct optical pressure and strain sensor design analysis to meet on-blade pressure and strain measurement requirements and demonstrate a proof-of-concept prototyped wireless optical pressure and strain sensor package.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Throughout the Phase I effort, we will work in concert with NASA sponsors and our industry to ensure that the WOPSS technology can be seamless integrated with rotor blade systems.  To facilitate technology transfer, we will work in Phase I to address top-level hardware and software integration issues from a systems engineering perspective. Issues such as hardware and control electronics, software architectures, hardware interfaces, manufacturability, ruggedness, and reliability will be considered in Phase I and implemented in Phase II. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The WOPSS technology will be applicable to a wide range of end-users in the defense, commercial, and industry sectors. TSi's WOPSS will be an integrated software/hardware product that can be licensed for manufacture to our strategic manufacturing partner, or a similar rotorcraft producer, depending on the market being addressed. Because TSi already enjoys market share of adaptive materials for precision control of structures, noise, weapons effectiveness, etc., through our existing customers, we plan to leverage these marketing outlets and offer WOPSS systems for enhanced performance where conventional sensors have not been successful from performance and cost perspective. TSi will finalize a formal partnership with a strategic manufacturing partner, who will produce the WOPSS systems specific to commercial rotorcraft. TSi will partner with an OEM manufacturer in an appropriate field of use (e.g., electro-optics manufacturer, weapons systems integrator, aircraft OEM, etc.) to modify the WOPSS as a generic sensor. We will perform final systems integration of the WOPSS systems and conduct direct marketing and sales of the product to the end-use through our internal resources.

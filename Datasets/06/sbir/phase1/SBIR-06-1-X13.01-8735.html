<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Real-time dosimetry is needed to provide immediate feedback, so astronauts can minimize their exposure to ionizing radiation during periods of high solar activity.   Optical radiation monitors provide continuous detection of e- and n.  Radiation induced changes in the optical properties of each sensor's active material are interpreted via software to estimate the dose from each type of particle. Compared to traditional scintillation detectors, Luna's radiation monitors are more compact and better able to identify particle types.  Luna's unique sensor design and detection capabilities enable estimation of the energy and direction of the most energetic particles.  Advanced optical radiation monitors are also less prone to the radiation induced degradation that plagues diode dosimeters.

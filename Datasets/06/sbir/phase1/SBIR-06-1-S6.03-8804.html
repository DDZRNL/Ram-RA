<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
There is a growing need to develop improved technologies for precise airborne measurements of carbon dioxide, CO2.  CO2 measurements are of great importance to many areas of research, including climate change, global carbon budgets, and geological research in relation to volcanic activity.  At the same time, we are entering a period of time in which Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) are becoming more widely used for atmospheric research.  UAS platforms have already proven themselves as a uniquely capable means for making measurements in remote areas and over oceans.  However, existing CO2 measurement technologies are difficult to adapt to or use in the UAS world.  This proposal describes a simple and inexpensive sensor for the precise determination of atmospheric CO2 that will be small enough for flight on small UAS platforms and sounding balloons.<br>Phase I will include the fabrication of a proof-of-concept sensor system, laboratory characterization of the sensor, and culminate in a demonstration of the sensor on a UAS.  Phase II will emphasize improving the basic manufacturability of the design, as well as much more extensive laboratory and UAS testing.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
	Researchers using small UAS systems to study carbon dioxide budgets and transport will directly benefit from the availability of the new sensor.  <br>Another need the sensor will address is the need for a sensor to fly on sounding balloons to obtain vertical profiles of CO2 for the calibration and validation of satellite and other remote-sensing measurements, as well as for gathering these profiles in areas which are not accessible to UAS platforms.  Disposable CO2 sondes based on this technology will provide an inexpensive and efficient means of addressing this need.  <br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
	Other users in the Federal government who will benefit from the new instrument may be found in several other agencies, including NOAA and DOE.  All of these agencies have researchers engaged in studies of carbon dioxide budgets and transport, and the work of these users will directly benefit from the availability of the new sensor.  These users will also benefit from the development of a corresponding balloon sonde version.<br>	An industrial application is demand-control ventilation (DCV), in which CO2 measurements are used to keep the CO2 level of air inside a building at a safe level while minimizing the need for fresh air intake.<br>

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Cornerstone Research Group Inc. (CRG) proposes to significantly improve the performance of communication systems and networks for lunar and interplanetary exploration by engineering a novel communications tower using an emerging structures technology called Veritex<SUP>TM</SUP>. Veritex<SUP>TM</SUP> is a new structures technology based on shape memory polymer that offers the strength-to-weight ratio of high-performance composites and enables dramatic physical reconfiguration. One of the best applications of Veritex<SUP>TM</SUP> is to reduce the volume fraction of structures during shipping. CRG's Future Systems Group will use this technology to engineer a low mass, low packing volume, self-erecting communications tower technology for lunar and interplanetary exploration operations. <br>The innovation of this proposal is in the scale-up of existing deployable structures technology from 3 to 30 meter scale and the engineering of a self-erecting tower. With this innovation in place, lunar communication challenges such as increased point-to-point range, reduced power requirements, large area coverage, and minimized dead-zones will be overcome. <br>During Phase 1, CRG will demonstrate that this technology is both technically feasible and cost effective for lunar operations, maximizing return on investment for exploration operations. During Phase 2, CRG will prototype a large-scale, fully operational tower for demonstration purposes.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Supporting NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate, this project's technologies directly address requirements for developing advanced space communications and networking technology for surface networks and access links.  This project's technologies offer increased point-to-point range, reduced power requirements, large area coverage, and minimization of dead-zones. This effort will develop the technology necessary to enable a ground-based, large-area coverage communications infrastructure to be operationally advantageous for lunar and interplanetary exploration.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
This project's technologies developed for NASA systems would directly apply to systems operated by other government and commercial enterprises.<br>Government systems that would derive the same benefits would include but not be limited to rapidly deployed troop operations and remote area exploration as well as disaster relief communications centers operated by the Department of Defense.<br>This technology's attributes for reconfigurable structures and volumes will yield a high potential for private sector commercialization ranging from low cost cellular telephone towers to temporary bridges and buildings. <br>

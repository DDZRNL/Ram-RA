<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Paragon proposes to develop a single-loop, non-toxic, stagnating active pumped loop thermal control design for NASA's Orion or Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) program. While this technology was developed in the Apollo era, it has not been used in space since then.  Furthermore, the fluids used in those first-generation units are not compatible with today's human-rated flight requirements as they could be considered toxic and/or flammable.  Though work at JSC by Tuan et al. has targeted modeling and verifying the model of a stagnating radiator with one candidate fluid, Paragon proposes to parallel this effort with an alternative fluid as a back-up to that currently base-lined in the Orion program.  <br>This technology will be a significant innovation in that stagnating radiator designs provide self regulation of thermal dissipation parameters.  As heat flow to the radiator is reduced, less cooling capacity is required; stagnating radiators incorporate fluids that gradually change properties. If increased heating loads are encountered, the radiator working fluid changes again to increase the heat transfer capability of the radiator. <br>This technology is directly relevant to NASA's Orion and LSAM development.  Our plan for Phase I and II is in-line with bringing this technology from a TRL 2 to a TRL 4-6 depending on Phase II assumptions.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Assuming successful implementation of Phase I and II activities, this enabling technology will be of extreme value to NASA as already demonstrated with the non-human rated fluid use in the Apollo program.  While the applications will most likely be constrained to space systems, stagnating radiator design systems could enable many of the next-generation systems that are currently in the conceptual design phase, to become a reality. Of obvious and primary application are human rated spacecraft applications such as the Lunar Surface Access Module and the newly named crew exploration vehicle "Orion".  However, the technology can also be applied to variable power spacecraft applications as well as interplanetary space vehicles that require reliable, less complex and elegant thermal control systems.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Assuming successful implementation of Phase I and II activities, this enabling technology will also be of extreme value to an emerging commercial space industry. This includes the following types of spacecraft:  High power commercial satellites and emerging commercial orbital flight vehicles such as Bigelow's space hotels.

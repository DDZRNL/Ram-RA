<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
To address the NASA need for new flexible food packaging materials with effective high barrier against oxygen and moisture to protect food, minimize weight and waste, and ensure a shelf life of 3-5 years for NASA future exploration missions to the Moon and Mars, Luminit, LLC proposes to develop a new One-Component Encapsulating (ONCE) material matrix based on hybrid sol-gel technology.  ONCE brings together a new chemical synthesis of sol-gel, polymer, and zirconium-dioxide nanoparticles to form a coating, which has excellent water vapor barrier properties, with a unique combination of sol-gel and polymer nanocomposite matrix in a transparent, flexible, and UV-curable conformal coating that meets the NASA requirements: high barrier flexible packaging coatings that protect from oxygen and water vapor; less mass and volume; no metallic components; transparent; heat sealable; microwavable; and they maintain the foods' 3-5 year shelf life.  In Phase I Luminit will develop a polymer-based glass-like sol-gel ONCE encapsulated coating for high barrier flexible packaging materials, and demonstrate its resistance to oxygen and water vapor, 100 mg per square meter per day.  Phase II will scale up and optimize the ONCE process to cost efficiently produce ONCE material matrices for more comprehensive oxygen and water vapor resistance.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Potential NASA applications of the ONCE coating material matrix will not be limited to coating on flexible plastic substrates and protecting food in the packaging from oxygen and water vapor.  It has direct applications for transparent abrasion-resistant coatings for flexible solar panels and modules, spacecraft and aircraft windows, and many other uses that require durable exterior coatings with good adhesion properties and long lifetimes with resistance to solvents, electromagnetic radiation, and scratching.  The ONCE material can be incorporated into transparent conductive coatings for aircraft canopies and landing gear.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The ONCE material technology is unique in combining low-cost reliable water/oxygen barriers with high transparency in highly efficient coatings that can also survive abrasion and impact.  They will combine excellent mechanical and chemical resistance, and can be scaled up readily and inexpensively.  ONCE will protect not only food but commercial and military aircraft; military ground vehicles; and display devices.  Many transparent components require durability with excellent mechanical and chemical properties, long life, and resistance to scratching.<br><br>Military applications of ONCE technology include transparent abrasion-resistant coatings for aircraft windows, and many other applications that require durable exterior coats with good adhesion properties and long lifetimes with resistance to solvents, and scratching.  The material can be incorporated, for example, into a transparent abrasion-resistant coating for helicopter windows and other applications such as sensors, lenses, and vision blocks.<br>

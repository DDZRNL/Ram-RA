<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
CTD proposes to investigate the deployment repeatability and microdynamic stability of a hinge and demonstration this repeatability in a deployable mirror test article, which incorporates the proposed precision self-locking hinge actuator.  If successful, the proposed device will be substantially lighter, simpler, more robust, and more easily controlled than other state-of-the-art actuators for deployment of optical systems.  More importantly, the proposed device has the potential of dramatically reducing or eliminating post-deployed microdynamic response, by eliminating mechanical latches. During Phase I, CTD and the University of Colorado (CU) will demonstrate the feasibility of the high-precision, self-locking, linear actuator through testing of a prototype actuator on an existing deployable optics testbed structure at CU.  In Phase II, CTD and its partners will develop and test a self-locking linear actuator for application to a flight program of interest to NASA (e.g., Single Aperture Far-IR (SAFIR) telescope).

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
High-precision, self-locking, linear actuator will enable the development of large optical systems for future astrophysics (space and earth observation) missions.  The technologies, materials and designs developed in this effort will also have broad applicability to future NASA, military and commercial spacecraft in solar array and RF antenna deployment applications.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
CTD has considered use of the self-locking EMC hinge/actuator for low-precision other deployment applications such as solar arrays, radiators, and antennas. To date TEMBO<SUP>REG</SUP> Hinges have been delivered for the following flight programs: the EMCH International Space Station (ISS) experiment (6 Hinges), manifested on STS-121 and TacSat-2 (2 Hinges). TEMBO<SUP>REG</SUP> Hinge designs have been developed for a wide range of applications including deployable solar arrays, deployable booms, and deployable optical systems.  In general, TEMBO<SUP>REG</SUP> Hinges are designed to drive and damp the deployment of the structure and to lock the structure at the end of deployment with no dead band.  The innovative TEMBO<SUP>REG</SUP> Hinges are substantially simpler and lighter than traditional mechanical hinge/actuators, and their use can eliminate the need for separate drive, damping, and locking mechanisms.

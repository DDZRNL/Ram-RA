<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Both FAA and NASA research has highlighted the need for efficient and equitable allocation of NAS resources and increased operational flexibility.  In particular, market-based mechanisms are needed for transferring system-imposed delay from more critical to less critical flights.  In this SBIR, we will develop a National Airspace Resource Exchange System (NRES) that will provide the FAA and the aviation community with a means for trading scarce resources and priorities for ATM services.  Today's airspace system has rudimentary market mechanisms in place.  However, these are valid only for highly specialized circumstances: airport arrival slot trading in ground delay programs applied by FAA traffic managers.  We propose to develop an infrastructure necessary to support secondary markets for the full spectrum of NAS resources and services.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed SBIR directly benefits the NASA's Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) Air Traffic Management Airspace Project, whose primary goal is to develop integrated solutions for a safe, efficient and high-capacity airspace system.  Efficient airspace allocation requires early research in market-based mechanisms for design of the next-generation air transportation system.<br><br>This research also extends NASA objectives from the recently completed Advanced Air Transportation Technologies (AATT) project, whose primary goal was to improve the capacity of transportation aircraft operations at and between major airports within the National Airspace System. As part of AATT, NASA helped develop decision-support tools for air traffic controllers, airline pilots and air operations managers to handle the growing demand for safe and efficient air travel. Our research extends effectiveness of those NASA tools and concepts (CTAS, TMA, McTMA, Regional Metering), by increasing utilization of capacity by increasing the efficiency of NAS resource usage.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The NAS Resource Exchange System (NRES) has application in commercial air traffic management (ATM) within the United States and abroad. In the United States ATM market, the FAA will require the tools and procedures output by Phases II and III of this SBIR to act as a central processor and tracker of ATM-induced delays. At the same time, US air carriers will require tools with which to monitor and manipulate their delay management accounts. Estimates of ATM costs due to delays range from hundreds of millions of dollars to billions of dollars per year. The opportunity to save even a fraction of these costs creates a significant amount of motivation for airline participation in a delay management system. It is reasonable to assume that the number of carriers willing to participate in this system will be comparable to the number of carriers now signed up as active members of the collaborative decision making (CDM) program, which is 27. <br><br>Air-traffic delays in foreign countries are generally not as pronounced as in the U.S., but this has been achieved by sacrificing flexibility in the system ? a major limitation on the ability to handle growth in demand for air transportation. For this reason, foreign ATM systems represent another market for the delay management system.

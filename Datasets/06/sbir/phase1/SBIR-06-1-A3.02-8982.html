<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Metron Aviation designs and develops an integrated methodology and supporting algorithms for estimating environmental impacts of increased traffic on the surface and in the terminal airspace, and extends beyond estimation to identify key causes and develop mitigation options.  From previous work, we provide multi-dimensional impact calculation in terms of noise, emissions, and fuel usage, as well as measurement of these impacts with respect to both baseline and alternative future scenarios.  In AMITIE we add the following capabilities critically important to design of the next-generation system within environmental constraints:<br>?	Automated identification of scenario elements causing the principal environmental impacts;<br>?	Automated generation of mitigation options; and<br>?	Quantification of the benefits of the mitigation options.<br>The specific technical objectives are:<br>?	Integrated estimation/mitigation methodology that provides the basis for closing the feedback loop from environmental impacts to system design and development. <br>?	Develop supporting algorithms that calculate the appropriate metrics, analyze them to identify major causes of impacts, and generate mitigation options that reduce the impacts.  <br>?	Develop a software prototype that implements the estimation, analysis, and mitigation algorithms.<br>?	Exercise the prototype against test cases to demonstrate the feasibility and value of the approach<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA needs for Next-Generation Air Transport System design, development, and evaluation are being addressed by this project in order to estimate and mitigate environmental constraints in such a way that the constraints can be met while still enabling increased NGATS traffic density.<br><br>NASA needs to estimate, identify, and mitigate environmental impacts of many aspects of NGATS, including such elements as Super Density Operations (SDO).  Due to the surface and terminal-area focus of SDO and the ambitious traffic increases being sought, and the nature of the noise and emissions metrics, NASA will need to explore as many different alternative design factors as possible.  NASA will need to quantitatively evaluate and defend the alternatives selected.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Other Government Agencies ? Other Government agencies involved with the development of NGATS include FAA and the Departments of Defense, Commerce, and Transportation.  Each of these agencies will face the need to estimate and mitigate environmental impacts of different aspects of NGATS.  The will also require quantitative analysis of selected alternative design elements.<br>Commercial - Aviation-related commercial firms of all types (airlines, airports, aerospace companies, consultants, etc.) need access to a methodology and algorithms that will help them identify and mitigate the aspects of increased traffic that contribute most to environmental impacts associated with aviation noise, emissions, and fuel consumption.

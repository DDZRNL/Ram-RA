<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The goal of this Project is to develop a high-fidelity computational tool for accurate prediction of aerothermal environment on transatmospheric vehicles. This computational tool will be based on the Unified Flow Solver (UFS) developed at CFDRC for hybrid simulations of rarefied, transitional and continuum flows. In this Project, the UFS will be enhanced with advanced non-equilibrium chemistry coupled to radiation transport and plasma capabilities. The enhanced UFS will include Boltzmann/continuum solvers for gas species and plasma electrons, state-to-state vibrational kinetics of molecules, advanced non-equilibrium chemistry coupled to radiation transport with real gas effects, and charged particle transport and chemistry. Our two strong points are (i) master equations coupled with nonequilibrium chemistry in a multidimensional code, and (ii) Boltzmann solvers for charges and neutral particles providing the capability of using the code both for reentry flows and for the low-temperature plasma flows. Phase I will be devoted to evaluation of physical models, initial implementation and demonstration of new capabilities. In Phase II, these capabilities will be fully developed, validated and demonstrated for selected benchmark problems. The availability of the proposed tool will bring the fidelity of modeling high speed flows of molecular gases to a next level and enable computational investigation of innovative concepts of plasma technologies for different applications.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
This project will result in a high-fidelity non-equilibrium reentry code with predictive capabilities. The code will find direct and immediate application in a multitude of NASA technology development programs under Project Constellation and the New Millennium Program.  Ascent and descent aerothermodynamic effects on Crew Exploration Vehicle components such as crew capsules and landers, RCS plume impact during orbital maneuvering, and plume environments during landing operations near planetary outpost habitat structures will present operational risks. The accurate modeling of aerothermal environments is essential for protecting space vehicles and insuring crew safety and overall mission success.  The code will be used as a design tool for development of new generation reentry vehicles (such as Crew Exploration Vehicle) and components of future hypersonic vehicles. The code will be also used for plasma flow control for subsonic and supersonic aerospace applications. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Technology applications beyond NASA include Theater and National Missile Defense vehicles performing exo-atmospheric missile intercept, interceptor divert thruster plume interaction, and the generation of target missile plume signatures. Advanced space propulsion systems such as arcjets, ion thrusters, and plasma thrusters must be evaluated for their installed performance and environmental impact. The Air Force is actively pursuing development of high-speed, long-range, scramjet-powered strike aircraft that will operate at high altitudes presenting complex propulsion airframe interaction issues.  The software will find numerous commercial and research applications in material processing (Chemical Vapor Deposition and dry etching), semiconductor manufacturing, microelectronics, microsystems, MEMS, etc.

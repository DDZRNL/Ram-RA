<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Future detectors and arrays for visible, IR, and submillimeter imaging and spectroscopy require much higher speed digitizers than are currently available. In particular, low-power (< 5 W) space-qualifiable digitizers with > 5 GHz bandwidth and > 5 Gs/s sampling rates are needed to enable next generation digital submillimeter spectrometers. These digitizers must also provide data reduction and interface to typical digital processing logic using e.g. LVDS-compatible I/O. To meet these needs, Hittite proposes an innovative digitizer combining a high-speed (10 Gs/s), wideband (10 GHz), moderate-resolution (4 ? 6 bit) ADC with a companion digital demux to reduce the data rate and present LVDS-compatible outputs to e.g. Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGAs. The proposed SiGe HBT technology offers high reliability and radiation tolerance for space missions. A conceptual design will be developed in Phase I, and prototype digitizer modules produced during Phase II. Although a two-chip solution is initially proposed to reduce development risk, the technology will facilitate a single-chip solution during Phase III to further reduce size, weight, and power while improving system reliability.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed digitizer is an enabling component for wideband submillimeter spectrometers and other coherent receiver systems. Additional applications include wideband radar and gain control applications, transient recorders for high-energy particle detection and other systems, wideband imagers, and broadband signal capture and analysis systems.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Government agencies (DoD, MDA) will utilize the digitizer in advanced phased-array radar and signal/electronic intelligence (sigint/elint) systems. It will enable temporal and spatial averaging in large radar and lidar systems to provide very high resolution. Real-time gain control and wideband signal acquisition will benefit digital receivers both in the field and for hardware in the loop (HWIL) simulators. Commercial radar and spectrometers will also benefit, as will transient recorders and test instruments such as DSOs and spectrum analyzers. The digitizer can improve the performance of 10 ? 100 Gb/s data links, and reduce the power and complexity of large storage arrays using high-speed VSR optical links. Multi-GHz test and emulation systems for e.g. next-generation hard disk drives will also benefit.

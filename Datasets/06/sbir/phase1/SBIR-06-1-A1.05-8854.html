<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The proposed SBIR project will develop OZ, an innovative primary flight display for aircraft.  The OZ display, designed from "first principles" of vision science, cognition, and Human-Centered Computing, brings all cockpit information required for flight together into a single, unified display that uses a common frame of reference employing both the focal and ambient channels of human visual processing.  <br><br>This proposal addresses Topic A1.05 Crew Systems Technologies for Improved Aviation Safety.  It specifically addresses the goals of ensuring appropriate situation awareness and facilitating and extending human perception, information interpretation, and response planning and selection.  Its primary focus is in the SBIR topical areas of interest in Data fusion technologies for real-time integration and integrity checking of single source information streams of varying spatial and temporal resolution; and Human-centered technologies to improve the access and performance of less-experienced operators and pilots from special population groups.<br><br>Previous experimentation has shown that OZ provides significantly better performance for pilots than conventional flight instrumentation.  The proposal will test the feasibility of using OZ to provide situational awareness superior to that provided by both conventional instrumentation and commercially available electronic primary flight displays.  Phase I will show that OZ is also superior to existing electronic primary flight displays that display conventional flight instrumentation on an electronic display and will develop and demonstrate a prototype OZ system in a general aviation aircraft.  In Phase II the prototype system will be flight tested against competing electronic flight information systems and a DO-178B compliant OZ system will be developed and flight tested to determine its suitability for FAA certification for general aviation aircraft.  <br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed project will develop a primary flight display (PFD) system for general aviation aircraft.  The proposed PFD has potential applications in any NASA aircraft or winged spacecraft.  It also has potential application in air transport aircraft, rotorcraft and military aircraft, some of which are used by NASA in its operations.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed primary flight display (PFD) to be developed under this project is primarily intended for use in general aviation aircraft.  It will provide significantly superior situational awareness with considerably less complexity than commercially available PFD systems.  The PFD system will be suitable for general aviation aircraft ranging from Light Sport Aircraft to business jets, including a newly certified generation of Very Light Jets currently being introduced to the market.  The superior performance of OZ will affect situational awareness and thus safety during flight in instrument meteorological (IMC) conditions, especially single-pilot IMC flight.  OZ also has the potential to provide superior performance to current generation "glass cockpit" (i.e. PFD) systems used in air transport aircraft, and in rotorcraft.

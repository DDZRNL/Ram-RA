<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Redondo Optics Inc. (ROI), proposes to develop, demonstrate, and deliver to NASA an intrinsically safe, miniature, low power, autonomous, and self-calibrated, respiratory health monitor (ResHealth<SUP>TM</SUP>) system for monitoring of the oronasal activity associated with respiratory activity during extravehicular activity (EVA) sorties on Lunar surface exploration. In Phase I of this program, ROI will conclusively demonstrate the concept of the ResHealth<SUP>TM</SUP> monitoring device by extensively testing a conceptual prototype of a multi-sensor array microchip and optoelectronic sensor readout unit capable of detecting, analyzing, and separating vital respiratory activity signatures associated with inspiratory and expiratory air flow. In Phase II, ROI will integrate the ResHealth<SUP>TM</SUP> monitoring device into a field deployable autonomous unit and installed and qualified on a spacesuit PLSS system at a selected NASA test site and delivered to NASA for performance validation. The ResHealth<SUP>TM</SUP> system's wireless communication mode offers true Tele-medicine capabilities to communicate remotely its sensor status and alarm condition to the crewmember EMU computer control and communications system, to other close proximity crewmembers, lunar habitat stations, and to flight doctors in the Mission Control Center. No other available commercial device on the market today offers such capabilities at an affordable cost.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA's Human Space Exploration program has a critical need for breakthrough technologies, including human health countermeasures and autonomous medical care for monitoring astronaut health during Extravehicular activity on the lunar surface and that can find dual use for intravehicular medical monitoring and care. A key physiological parameter to monitor during EVA sorties is the respiratory health activity of the astronaut associated with oronasal oxygen consumption rate, CO2 level and CO2 generation, as well as breathing temperature and humidity within the helmet assembly of the extravehicular activity unit (EMU) or reusable spacesuit.  Other NASA applications include atmospheric air quality control in space habitats, space shuttles, and the space station. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
ROI's ResHealth<SUP>TM</SUP> oronasal respiratory monitor system is poised to revolutionize the field of non-intrusive respiratory monitors used in personal life support systems such as NASA's extravehicular mobility unit. Although, there are commercially available respiratory monitors in the market, ROI's InOSense-Sleep<SUP>TM</SUP> monitor represents a new, highly reliable, technology that can be used to accurately monitor for respiratory breathing disorders such as sleep apnea, SIDS, AOI, AOP, ATEA, and other clinical high risk, life threatening, situations in a user friendly and affordable price. ROI also believes that the ResHealth multi-parameter gas sensor concept will result in an extremely promising product capable of gaining a significant share of the existing gas sensor market.

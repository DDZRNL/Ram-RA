<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Solid rocket motor cases are subject to a variety of external environmental and loading conditions from cradle-to-grave. These conditions can significantly impact the performance and decrease safety of the rocket motor. Fueling of the rocket motor adds an additional complexity in that inspection of the interior becomes impossible while creating the possibility of disbonds between the case and fuel. These factors can have potentially catastrophic consequences for the space vehicle performance. Acellent Technologies is currently developing structural health monitoring systems to address this issue. The TRL at completion of the current technology development is anticipated to be TRL 5-6. The proposed program focuses on maturing the technology to a TRL level 7 for implementation on existing and future space transportation vehicles. The development will be conducted in close collaboration with ATK-Thiokol who fully support the developmental and commercialization efforts.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The Next Generation Space Vehicles architecture definitions will require built-in damage monitoring tools such as those based on the proposed system. Structural integrity determination of critical components of a reusable launch vehicle such as impact damage monitoring for solid rocket motors can be extremely important especially during ascent, in-orbit and re-entry. Unforeseen impact events during this time can cause damage that if not monitored can lead to catastrophic failure of the vehicle. Since nearly all next generation launch vehicle structures will require some form of inspection and maintenance procedures to monitor their integrity and health condition during pre-launch, during space operations and post-flight, the potential applications of the proposed system are very broad. In the future, this system can potentially be used to monitor all major structural components of launch vehicles.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The system to be developed under the present proposal offers the potential to provide a complete solution for a wide range of structural analysis, evaluation, and maintenance requirements and enable a number of high value economic benefits to the aircraft, missile and spacecraft industries. The largest and nearest-term impact areas for the technology are critical but inaccessible areas on structures. The system can potentially be used for applications ranging from aircraft (to monitor impacts on door surrounds, fuselage, wings etc. )to automobiles (crash sensing) and monitoring of bridges and buildings.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Phoenix Integration will develop a collaborative simulation and design environment that will seamlessly integrate the people, data, and tools required for analyzing and designing complete vehicle systems. This next generation environment will help NASA to accurately assess and trade-off competing air vehicle concepts early in the design process. Working within the environment, geographically distributed team members will be able to easily construct large multi-disciplinary multi-fidelity system simulations from a custom library of reusable analysis components. A key feature of the environment will be "numerical zooming", i.e. the ability to incorporate numerical analyses of varying levels of fidelity in the simulation. Interfaces and tools will be provided that will allow users to configure the system simulation and securely execute it using heterogeneous computing resources. A simulation data library will allow users to share models, results, and conclusions with one another, and will serve as a searchable information repository. The expected results of the Phase I research will be a working prototype that will demonstrate key aspects of the proposed design environment. The Phase II program will result in a comprehensive framework environment that will help NASA achieve Fundamental Aeronautics Program goals for a broad range of air vehicles.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
To achieve the Fundamental Aeronautics Program goals, NASA needs a design environment that will allow early stage designers to accurately assess and trade-off competing concepts for a wide range of air vehicles. Key needs include (1) the ability to construct large multi-disciplinary multi-fidelity system simulations from diverse analysis tools, (2) the ability to bring in more accurate higher fidelity tools early in the design process, (3) the ability to deploy and securely execute the system simulation, (4) the ability to archive, share, and understand the resulting data. Phoenix Integration's proposed design environment will meet all of these needs in a cost-effective and timely manner. Because the environment will be built using an open architecture, a wide range of NASA centers and projects will benefit from the framework. Other potential applications include propulsion, operations, and mission designs.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Beyond NASA, the target market for the innovation is any organization involved with complex system design problems. Sectors that could benefit immediately from the proposed design environment include aerospace and defense, automotive, electronics, heavy machinery, shipbuilding, and oil and gas. More diverse, future applications may emerge in areas such as financial modeling, medical research, and disaster modeling. Industries in all of these sectors are looking to modeling and simulation design software to reduce design time, achieve more successful designs, and to reduce the costs of goods and services. The proposed design environment will allow firms with a wide range of analysis interests, staff capabilities, and computer resources to benefit from advanced modeling and simulation capablities.

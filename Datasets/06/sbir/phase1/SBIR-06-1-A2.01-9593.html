<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Cornerstone Research Group, Inc. (CRG) proposes to design and develop a space-qualifiable cyanate ester elastomer for application in self-deployable space structures and future aircraft systems.  Having already demonstrated the feasibility of the current cyanate ester shape memory polymer (SMP) as a space-qualifiable material, CRG proposes to refine its existing cyanate ester SMP to provide the flexibility necessary for self-deployable space structures.  Working extensively on deployable structure systems for NASA and DoD projects (see section 5.2), CRG has demonstrated the feasibility of self-deploying structures by using surrogate styrene-based systems.  CRG now proposes to develop new cyanate ester resins, incorporating the siloxane moiety in the monomer or polymer network, to provide NASA with a material combining the flexibility of siloxanes with CRG's space-qualifiable cyanate ester SMP.  CRG's work with DoD and commercial aerospace customers has also helped to identify the proposed material as a durable, lightweight alternative to current state-of-the-art aircraft systems.  CRG's innovative approach to the development of space-qualifiable cyanate ester elastomer will provide NASA with a low-cost, space-durable, and flexible material for application in self-deployable space structures and future aircraft systems.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Supporting NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, this project's technologies directly address requirements for lightweight, multifunctional, durable, highly flexible, and shape memory materials for self-deployable space structures, future aircraft systems, and exoatmospheric space seals.  This project's technologies offer a wide range of operational temperatures for application in both low temperature and high temperature systems, and will provide the limited outgassing and durability of a space-qualifiable material.<br><br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
This project's technologies developed for NASA systems would directly apply to systems operated by other government and commercial enterprises.  Government systems that would derive the same benefits would include but not be limited to future fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft systems, high temperature flight vehicles, and inflatable systems such as parachutes and inflatable habitats operated by the Department of Defense.  This technology's attributes for deployable structures should yield a high potential for private sector commercialization for communications satellites.<br><br>

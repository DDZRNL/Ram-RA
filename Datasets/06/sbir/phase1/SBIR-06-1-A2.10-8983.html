<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Recent R&D associated with designing high speed rotorcraft has been greatly hampered by a lack of test data and confidence in predictions for rotors operating above advance ratio 1.0.  This proposal outlines a plan for addressing this situation through a series of rotor tests and analytical enhancements.  The three-pillared approach begins with a model rotor test in Phase I that will obtain essential data on autorotation characteristics of rotors operating at high advance ratio.  The second pillar will involve analytical enhancements for comprehensive rotorcraft analyses featuring an improved yawed flow correction and an improved lifting surface blade model that will properly shed wake off the "leading edge" of blades operating as reverse velocity rotors.  The third pillar will focus on improving grid generation methods for CFD solutions to appropriately model reverse and spanwise flow regions.  Phase II will see additional rotor tests and model improvements followed by incorporation of new technology into a software module suitable for immediate implementation in rotorcraft analysis and flight simulation software.  The new software module will provide a hierarchy of methods capable of modeling high speed rotorcraft blade aerodynamics for a broad spectrum of fidelity/speed requirements ranging from real-time flight simulation to high resolution CFD.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed effort directly responds to NASA's SBIR solicitation goal of developing validated physics-based multidisciplinary computational tools applicable for the design, analysis and optimization of rotorcraft in the area of aerodynamics.  The proposed effort will provide invaluable test data and analysis enhancements for the aerodynamic design of high speed rotorcraft, particularly any V/STOL aircraft utilizing a slowed-rotor system.  The Phase I and Phase II test programs will provide important experimental data on aerodynamic characteristics of high speed rotors including Reverse Velocity Rotors.  This test data will be invaluable in the evaluation of future concepts. <br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
There is currently high interest at the DOD in High Speed rotorcraft.  Several ambitious and high risk projects are being funded, such as the Sikorsky X2 co-axial rotor and the Groen Brothers slowed-rotor heliplane.  The test data and analytical enhancements proposed here would provide invaluable support in the design and evaluation of these concepts.  The analysis and test data would also facilitate design and assessment of other compound aircraft and unmanned vehicle concepts utilizing slowed rotors to reduce noise and improve cruise performance while maintaining a hovering capability.

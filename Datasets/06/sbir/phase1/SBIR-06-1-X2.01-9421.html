<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
This proposal addresses the need for a real-time Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) system to identify anomalous states in digital electronic systems used in spaceflight applications and recommend corrective actions. We identify promising host platforms for implementation of PHM and consider strategies for identifying faults at the board level. Models for each approach are developed for further study of the effectiveness in identifying faults, estimating system states, and identifying anomalous states. Each method is then ranked with respect to prognostic fault coverage (state-awareness), missed alarms, and false alarms. Finally, a strategy is developed to optimally and dynamically reconfigure or recover the digital system based on current or predicted system status given by the prognostic/reasoner approach and board topology. By responding to a need for greater health awareness in complex on-board digital systems, the technology developed in this project will improve safety and effectiveness of future spaceflight missions, and improve serviceability and availability throughout the system lifecycle.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Ridgetop's plans are to work closely with NASA on the application of electronic prognostics to a representative electronic network system within NASA. Also, prognostics can support remote diagnostics/prognostics. The value proposition is that early detection of impending failures can be made remotely, via the web, and corrective actions quickly employed to preserve overall system integrity. With remote systems deployed on other planets, autonomous operation enabled with electronic prognostics is very important. Advance warnings and mitigation of failures are facilitated using electronic prognostics that detect an impending failure before it occurs. Another potential application of Ridgetop's technology would be the Advanced Diagnostic Systems (ADS) project, which is interested in reasoners and PHM in the Space Station. Among the level 1 requirements for the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) is rapid launch capability, enabling its use as a Crew Rescue Vehicle for the Orbital Space Station in the event of an emergency. Ridgetop has developed ground-based prognostic tools that can be leveraged to develop applications that provide ground-based logistic support for spaceflight hardware on NASA vehicles. A final example is the NASA Space Shuttle. By using electronic prognostics with mission critical systems, we can reduce false alarms, thereby reducing instances of potentially expensive and unsafe abort-after-liftoff due to false alarm of sensors in critical systems.<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Through the work on this SBIR, Ridgetop will improve its market position in Electronic Prognostics and be able to capitalize on a large market. Ridgetop has initiated commercialization activities stemming from its prior work in prognostics with the introduction of the Sentinel Silicon<SUP>TM</SUP> Library and Sentinel PHMPro<SUP>TM</SUP> products.<br><br>There is a large potential for prognostics in the commercial sector, which is expected to exceed $200M by 2010. Ridgetop has segmented the market to focus on high reliability applications, such as automotive, banking system, industrial process control, and commercial aerospace.<br><br>Prognostics, to the extent that it can leverage existing diagnostic backbones such as JTAG, I2C, and CAN buses, supports Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) strategies for critical industrial applications. For CBM and PHM applications, the value of preserving operational readiness is paramount and these applications are not expected to be cost-sensitive.<br><br>One useful application of this prognostic approach is to monitor the health of electronic power systems. Monitoring of trends may provide an estimation of system level RUL. Self-healing and dynamic resource allocation provide the best approach with respect to visibility, availability, and serviceability of electronic power. Tools will be developed for application across multiple industries, such as commercial aviation and automotive.<br>

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Current and upcoming NASA space links require both highly reliable low-rate communications links supporting critical TT&C, ranging and voice services and highly efficient high-data rate links supporting Mission or Payload Data return. Both are important to the success of a mission and for many ongoing missions rely on aging ground element equipment. Investing in re-usable elements, such as Programmable Communications Radios, for ground and flight data handling that are capable of receiving both highly-reliable low-rate links and highly-efficient high-rate links would address current Communication and Navigation needs without foregoing future capabilities. Current receiver designs typically address either high-rate or low-rate requirements but not both. NASA has requested a high-rate receiver capable of receiving coded and un-coded highly efficient modulation schemes supporting data throughput greater than 300Mbps. The proposed Phase I effort by Summation Research, Inc. (SRI) will develop, load, characterize and optimize these high-efficiency CCSDS and related modulations on a modern, high speed digital processing platform that can also support lower rate TTC and related links. Phase II work would then implement an analog IF front-end, develop deployable digital hardware to replace the evaluation boards used in Phase I, and combine the elements in an innovative Programmable High-rate Multi-mission Receiver (PHMR).

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed Programmable High-rate Multi-mission Receiver will enable NASA Space Operations to support multiple missions and link types with a single, flexible receiver. Utilizing a highly reconfigurable receiver for Communications and Navigation tasks in Network and Trunking links, SRI anticipates that NASA will benefit from a design that supports (1) high rate links for Deep Space, Near-Earth, Lunar and Martian Relay missions, (2) low rate links for critical TT&C, ranging and voice services, (3) GEE and Range Upgrade and Modernization within the DSN, GN, SN/TDRSS, STDN and related networks, (4) yet-to-be-defined capabilities needed to support potential ORS policies, (5) potential uses in Antenna Array or Phased Array Ground Cluster initiatives, (6) firmware designs potentially portable to non-GEE and space-qualified platforms that include FPGA/DSP and ADC/DAC components, and (7) potential integration into higher-level systems at a chassis, module or silicon level for extremely compact and power-efficient programmable communication blocks or Systems-on-Chip (SoC) architectures.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
There are tremendous business applications and deployment possibilities for a highly programmable satellite, space, and range link receiver supporting low-rate TT&C as well as high-rate imaging and other bandwidth intensive mission data links. SRI anticipates the increasing demands on spectrum will drive adoption of higher order modulation types to accommodate upcoming bandwidth demands. The proposed PHMR would be applicable to a wide range of Governmental and Commercial requirements including (1) the DoD ISCN, (2) TSAT, FCS, GIG and other DoD networking initiatives envisioning data rates at or near 1Gbps, (3) commercial networks such as Universal Space Network, Inc. that would be interoperable with NASA assets, offering potential offloading for particular missions, (4) imaging organizations such as Orbimage, DigitalGlobe, USGS, and NOAA that provide bandwidth intensive satellite imaging and Earth Observation products, and (5) links required for imaging and other TT&C and high-bandwidth payload transmissions from UAVs and related non-satellite/non-space platforms.

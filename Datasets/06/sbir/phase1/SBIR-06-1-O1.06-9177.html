<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
In Phase I Harmonic Devices proposes to investigate the feasibility of a low-power, low-volume, lightweight, frequency agile, and fault tolerant EVA radio based on the co-design of the transceiver with high Q contour mode piezoelectric resonators and filters, low-loss switches, and tunable capacitors.  The radio will span from VHF to S-band frequencies (or higher) and support voice, data, and video capabilities.<br><br>HDI's contour mode aluminum nitride (AlN) technology allows the CAD level definition of arrays of filters, resonator, switches, and tunable capacitors, with operating frequencies from 10 MHz to several to several GHz, all on a single silicon chip.<br><br>The proposed work represents a radio architecture paradigm shift in which arrays of high-Q micromachined elements (resonators, switches, tunable capacitors) are embedded in the transceiver circuit blocks.  Conceptually, the library of low-Q circuit elements (resistors, inductors, capacitors) traditionally available to the RFIC designer are supplemented with HDI's high-Q components.<br><br>In the Phase I study HDI will design and evaluate novel high-Q component-based transceiver circuit blocks (LNA, oscillators/synthesizers, power amplifiers, etc.), optimize the design of its RF micromachined components for embedding in RFICs, and determine the optimum radio architecture to leverage its high-Q micromachined component technology.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
HDI's miniaturized, low power, and light-weight EVA radio improves astronaut maneuverability and provides fault-tolerant, reliable communication in harsh conditions.<br>As the solution will be compliant with Space Transportation Radio System (STRS), the proposed radio is high scalable and adaptable to spacecraft and planetary surface vehicles, to an orbiting Space Station, and to satellite and planetary communication links and sensor networks.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed radio embodies novel architecture techniques that are adaptable to a broad range of non-NASA markets.  In the commercial electronics sector, this includes cellular handsets, pages, wireless LAN, UWB, Bluetooth, and commercial aviation.  For military applications, HDI's radio innovations would have direct application to soldier-centric secure communications and waveform generation for electronic warfare and radar.  Radio reconfigurability and frequency agility would address the pressing need for interoperability among police, firefighters, medical personnel and Homeland Security.

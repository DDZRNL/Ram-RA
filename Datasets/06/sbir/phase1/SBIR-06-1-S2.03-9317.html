<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Photovoltaic arrays for future deep space NASA missions demand multiple functionalities.  They must efficiently generate electrical power, have very large areas and very low areal mass densities, mechanical flexibility to allow them to be compactly stowed and deployed in space, and the ability to simply survive and operate in the deep space environment.  The objective of this NASA program is to develop ultra low mass density fabric materials with patterned conductive traces capable of conducting high electrical current densities and able to survive the harsh thermal and mechanical environmental conditions required by deep space missions.  Such multifunctional Gossamer materials would provide both adequate mechanical support and low loss electrical interconnect network functionalities for power generation arrays.  NanoSonic won one of NASA's 13 "nanotechnology product awards" for 2006, recently announced in NASA Technical Briefs, for its electrically conducting and mechanically flexible Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> sheet materials.  The proposed program would build on this successful Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> technology to synthesize patterned, electrically conductive, low-weight fabrics rather than sheet materials.  During Phase I, NanoSonic would produce prototype high performance, ultra low mass density support fabrics with integrated patterned electrically conductive vias and demonstrate properties, and demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale rapid production of such materials.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA applications for the patterned Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> fabrics developed on this program include (1) ultra low areal density fabrics and electrical wiring interconnects for very large PV arrays, (2) low weight RF and EMI shielding materials, (3) low weight antenna array and ground plane components for space-based radar and other communication systems, and (4) in lightweight flex circuits and electronic fabrics. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Non-NASA applications include replacements for lead-based electrical solder, as low weight flexible interconnect electrodes for human prostheses and biomedical sensors, and as low weight RF shielding for consumer products.

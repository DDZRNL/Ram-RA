<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Mainstream is proposing a methodology to reduce the development time and cost, and improve the reliability of future thermal control systems for the next decade of deep space missions by utilizing a Plug-and-Play (PnP)  thermal control strategy.  A unique modular thermal control approach is described in the proposal as well as discussions why such an approach is ideally suited to reducing the development time and cost of deep space satellite thermal control systems as well as power conversion systems.  Phase I will experimentally demonstrate that the proposed PnP  approach can be configured to provide design flexibility, long life and extremely high reliability.  With potential missions to Europa, Venus, and Titan, as well as primitive bodies, the PnP approach can simplify thermal control design while utilizing very compact, reliable, two-phase thermal control bus architecture.<br>In this Phase I effort, Mainstream will demonstrate a unique PnP Tool-Box approach where the thermal control system is easily built-up into a complete integrated system, as well as being integrated into the power conversion components.  Highly integrated systems will reduce cost, reduce system size, improve reliability, and tighten the thermal control.    <br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
This Phase I effort will demonstrate an innovative PnP thermal control and energy conversion methodology that has tremendous applications for deep space satellites, future small planetary exploration vehicles and other spacecraft applications. Mainstream has  already  committed it own resources into performing initial experiments and Mainstream has secured cooperation with both aircraft and spacecraft contractors as discussed within this proposal.  Phase I will clearly demonstrate the potential of this PnP technology.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The Air Force is actively pursuing the capability to assemble, checkout, and launch a satellite within days, or even hours of a battlefield commander's requirement. Mainstream's PnP technology is ideally suited to this rapid satellite configuration application.   This technology also has applications for avionics pod cooling systems.  Further commercialization details are contained in the proposal.<br><br>

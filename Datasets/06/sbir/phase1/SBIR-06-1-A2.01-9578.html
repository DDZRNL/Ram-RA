<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The objective of this proposed effort is to demonstrate the promise of advanced C/SiC and SiC/SiC composites having improved environmental durability and longer life at higher allowable stress levels without using problematic external barrier coatings. Both oxidation inhibited C/SiC and SiC/SiC composite material systems are proposed for this effort on the basis that: (1) C/SiC offers the highest use temperature and lowest cost of all currently available refractory composite systems, and (2) SiC/SiC offers the highest durability and longest life. Each material system offers unique performance/cost benefits and limitations, and each has been identified as a viable candidate for advanced propulsion and thermal protection system component applications. Oxidation resistant C/SiC and SiC/SiC composite plates will be fabricated incorporating a recently developed, 2nd generation oxidation inhibited matrix produced by chemical vapor infiltration (CVI). Test samples from each material system will be prepared and experimentally evaluated in high-temperature tensile stress oxidation environments. The tensile stress rupture results will be compared to "baseline" uninhibited C/SiC and SiC/SiC composites to establish the performance benefits of the proposed approach.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
There are a number of NASA, DoD and DoE programs in progress or being planned that are targeting advanced ceramic composites as viable high-temperature material candidates. While possessing high specific strength and toughness at elevated temperatures, the utility of current state-of-the-art ceramic composites for satisfying these demanding requirements are severely limited by their susceptibility to oxidation embrittlement and strength degradation. The development of ceramic composite materials with superior performance and long-term durability over currently available materials could directly support and possibly impact future programs, such as: Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT), Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology (IHPTET), Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engines (VAATE) Program, and a number of other enabling aerospace programs in need of materials capable of reliable load-bearing operation up to and beyond 3000<SUP>o</SUP>F (1650<SUP>o</SUP>C). The utility of current state-of-the-art ceramic composites for satisfying life, cost and performance requirements are limited by their susceptibility to oxidation embrittlement and severe strength degradation. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Viable near-term applications for ceramic composites include expendable chemical rocket thrusters for orbital insertion, on-orbit attitude control system and/or divert thrust chamber components for commercial and military communication spacecraft and/or various ballistic missile defense KE intercept weapons. Opportunities for retrofit application in turbine engine augmentors (converging/diverging exhaust nozzle flaps and seals) for military aero-propulsion systems also exist, however the issues of long-term durability and damage tolerance are key barriers against insertion. Applications for ceramic composites in advanced airbreathing and rocket propulsion systems and control surfaces for reusable hypervelocity and exo/transatmospheric aerospace vehicles are currently being addressed, however the issues of durability, survivability and maintainability are major concerns. Although less aggressive than the aerospace/defense and nuclear energy-related initiatives, programs are in place for evaluating reinforced ceramics for land-based turbine components, catathermal combustion devices, heat exchangers and radiant burners, which represent opportunities in energy and pollution abatement technologies that may mature over the next 10 or so years.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Environmental control systems for manned lunar and planetary bases will require condensing heat exchangers to control humidity.  Condensing surfaces must be hydrophilic to ensure efficient operation and biocidal to prevent growth of microbes in the moist, condensing environment.  The coatings must be extremely stable and adhere to the condensing surface for many years.  We propose an innovative condenser that will enable highly efficient heat transfer using an innovative coating that has proven to be highly biocidal, hydrophilic, and stable.  In Phase I we will prove feasibility by demonstrating the performance of the proposed hydrophilic and biocidal surface under prototypical conditions.  In Phase II we will demonstrate a full-size, prototype condenser designed to meet the requirements for future lunar and planetary bases.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed condenser will enable efficient and reliable operation for environmental control systems in manned lunar and planetary bases as well as future manned spacecraft.  By enabling recovery of water from the base or spacecraft atmosphere without using consumable absorber materials, the condenser enables simple operation of the environmental control system with minimal logistical support.  The condenser or the coating alone will be useful for future upgrades of the environmental control system on the International Space Station, which has experienced degraded operation due to failure of hydrophilic coatings on condensing heat exchangers.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Efficient, reliable condensers will be needed for fuel cell generators or fuel reforming systems for portable electric power generation or on-board vehicular fuel cells or reformers.  These condensers are required for water-neutral operation, and hydrophilic and biocidal surfaces are needed for long-term reliability of the system.  Efficient condensation is required to minimize parasitic power loss for water recovery.  The condenser developed in the proposed program will be ideal for these applications.  <br><br>

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Hyperspectral imaging arrays offer far more data and the ability to discriminate objects being observed.  Continued difficulties with applying HgCdTe materials, especially for LWIR, present an opportunity for the development of alternate materials. One such candidate for MWIR/LWIR photodetectors are short period Type-II superlattices based on InAs/GaInSb.  This material system has the ability to tune the cutoff wavelengths during device fabrication and yet be amenable to the creation of multi-spectral serially-positioned pixels.  One of the issues this Phase I program will address is the intermixing of Arsenic and Antimony at the superlattice interfaces, which can hamper LWIR operation.  Improved superlattice growth will be achieved through the application of newly developed MBE apparatus.   At a second level, device performance will be enhanced by novel passivation of the pixel sidewalls.  The Type-II superlattices with then be applied to the creation of dual-wavelength photodetectors for MWIR/LWIR imaging.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Commercial applications applicable to NASA include dual-wavelength imaging arrays for deployment on remote vehicles.  The hyperspectral data is valuable for object discrimination when tracking targets in space or performing astronomical observations.  The Type-II superlattice developed here operates at 77 K temperatures, allowing for the possible replacement of extrinsic Si-based photodetectors which require more cumbersome cryogenic cooling down to near 5 K.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Military missile defense systems can benefit from dual-band IR imaging array, particularly for detecting and tracking inbound objects.  These arrays can also find application to infrared-based chemical identification systems and terrestrial mapping.

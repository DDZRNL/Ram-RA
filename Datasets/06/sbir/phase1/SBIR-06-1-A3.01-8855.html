<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The key innovation proposed in this effort is the development of a model composition toolkit that will enable NASA Airspace Concept Evaluation System (ACES) users to design and compose agents, activities, and models to meet specific design requirements. Our technical approach builds on recent advances in formal agent specification, role composition and model composers. The toolkit will allow end-users to use a graphical editor and templates/property sheets to load, create, configure and interconnect agents, activities and domain models.. In addition to composing agent and models, a key feature provided by this toolkit is a family of "physical language specific adaptors" that will allow users to import domain models written Matlab<SUP>REG</SUP>. The toolkit will also provide capabilities to export ACED LDC data to tools such as Matlab for post analysis and graphing.  The primary focus of the Phase I effort will focus on demonstrating the feasibility and capability of this toolkit for the ACES Terminal Area Plant. We propose to demonstrate this capability by developing showing how an end-user, not experienced with Java, can easily add a C2 agent  to perform runway balancing and replace the current timer-based Terminal Area Link transit models with 4-D trajectory models.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Our initial target for the product developed in this effort is the ATM modeling and simulation community within NASA. Over the last few year NASA ACES software has gained increased acceptance and usage by Air Traffic Management (ATM) researchers, concept developers and analysts. It is currently being used by the FAA, JPDO and other organization to develop and evaluate current and future airspace concepts in support of NASAs VAMS and NGATS efforts. The proposed ACES agent model composition toolkit will significantly increase the flexibility and usability of ACES, and reduce the lead time and cost associated with developing new concepts and/or inserting new models into ACES. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Our target market here is the DOD and commercial modeling and simulation community sector. To address this broader modeling and simulation market IAI will extend and generalize the model composition toolbox for applicability to simulations using CyebelPro<SUP>REG</SUP> and make it available as a component of CybelePro suite of tools. Other examples of IAI's commercialization efforts in developing toolboxes for Cybele include the development of a game-theoretic toolbox, a distributed robot control toolbox, and DIVA, a case tool for design and development of Multi-agent Systems.

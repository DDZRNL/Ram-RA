<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The Small Business Innovative Research Phase I proposal seeks to develop a dual channel, compact mid-infrared laser spectrometer for planetary atmosphere exploration.  The device will be capable of measuring trace gases at 3.3 and 4.6 um without the need for cryogens. By using novel, fiber-coupled, solid state lasers, performance will be improved over traditional tunable diode laser sensors. 
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA applications for the instrument described in this proposal include the interrogation of extraterrestrial atmospheres for trace species, as well as in the study of Earth's atmosphere. The described instrument will have applications in atmospheric chemistry and satellite validation performed on uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAV). <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The worldwide market for gas sensors with the capabilities of the proposed system is quite large.  Numerous potential applications can be found in trace gas monitoring, pollution monitoring, industrial process control, and medical diagnostics.

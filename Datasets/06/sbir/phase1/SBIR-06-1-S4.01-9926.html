<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
We propose to design a general purpose reconfigurable wide bandwidth spectrometer<br>for use in NASA's passive microwave missions, deep space network and radio astronomy. <br>In Phase I, we will design and build a low power, low cost real time FPGA based <br>spectrometer board that will analyze a 3 GHz bandwidth signal with 16,384 channels.  <br>Utilizing 3 Gsample/sec 8 bit ADC's and Xilinx Virtex 4 FPGA's, the proposed spectrometer<br>can also be configured to analyze a pair of signals with 1.5 GHz bandwidth each, <br>or four signals of 750 MHz bandwidth each.   A Polyphase Filter Bank (PFB) will be <br>implemented instead of a large FFT, because the PFB has excellent out of band rejection ($> 80$ dB),  <br>preventing strong RFI from contaminating adjacent bands.<br>In Phase II, we will space qualify the spectrometer, provide significantly higher bandwidth <br>capabilities, and add high speed output, and consider an ASIC implementation for lower-power space-based applications. <br>Techne instrumentation has flown on Rosetta, PERSI, and several soundong rockets. <br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA will be able to utilize the Phase I ground based spectrometer<br>for prototyping space based passive microwave instruments, especially<br>focal plane array and multibeam receivers, for antenna holography,<br>spectroscopy at NASA's deep space network, small array imaging systems, <br>and for K12 education at NASA's GAVERT radio telescope.  <br>The Phase II spectrometer can be used for space based microwave missions, <br>beam forming, RFI mitigation, SETI, and for a large array imaging FX correlator<br>at the next generation DSN.<br><br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
We will make the Phase I low cost spectrometer available to the radio astronomy community<br>for a wide variety of applications, including multibeam spectroscopy (eg: HEAT, MAS),  <br>holography, IR and sub-mm heterodyne spectroscopy, CMB resonating bolometer experiments, <br>and small educational radio telescopes at high schools and universities.<br><br>The phase II spectrometer with 10GBe/infiniband outputs can be used for beam forming, pulsar timing and searching,<br>reionization experiments, adaptive RFI mitigation, very long base line interferometry (Mark 5C VLBI for geodesy and astronony), <br>and large imaging correlators such as those needed for SKA, ATA, LOFAR, LWA, PAST and transient searches.<br><br>

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
NAL Research Corporation proposes to develop a small, light-weight, low-cost transceivers capable of establishing satellite communications links for telemetry and control during the launch and ascent stages of flight. The proposed transceiver will offer continuous and truly global coverage. When data are sent from a launch vehicle, the signals are received immediately by one of the LEO satellites and relayed in real-time to command and control center via either Public Switched Telephone Network/Public Data Networks (PSTN/PDN), directly to another transceiver, through the Internet or through a direct IP address. The entire process can take a fraction of a second. This will provide electronic global access to airborne vehicles from any place.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Satellite transceivers have many useful applications within NASA. They can be implemented on the following platforms to relay data from remote regions including launch vehicles, sounding rockets, high-altitude environmental research aircraft, general aviation aircraft, oceanographic platforms, remote sensor platforms, high-altitude balloons, just to name a few.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Satellite transceivers can be extremely useful in many applications. Ships, airplanes and trucks have relied on geostationary satellites to provide mobile satellite services for years. Now, LEO satellite transceiver will soon make mobile satellite services available for individuals. Any type of transmission, internet connection, voice, fax, data or paging, will soon be able to reach its destination anywhere on the planet. The system will simplify communications for business professionals such as salespeople, field producers and reporters for television networks, construction engineers sending plan revisions, oil-company geologists uploading test results, just to name a few. People who live in thinly populated areas that will never be covered by regular cellular phone service, travelers, private pilots, yachtsmen and disaster relief teams will benefit from the LEO satellite-based transceivers as well.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Fibertek has developed transmitters for Lidar and 3D imaging applications based on fiber optics architectures both at 1064nm.  We have demonstrated an all fiber transmitter producing as much as 15W at 10Kpps.  This all-fiber based transmitter produces pulses at 1064nm as short as 750ps and can have its repetition rate varied from 10Kpps to several 10s of Mpps.  In addition the transmitter central wavelength can be tuned.  The space-qualifiable 1064nm transmitter we propose here for Long Range Communication is based on these development efforts.  We propose here to extend the operation of our architecture to 150ps pulses and demonstrate the front end during the Phase-I portion of this effort operating between 1Mpps and 60Mpps.  We will also work to maintain near transform limited pulses and as high wall-plug efficiency as possible. An Engineering-Unit, designed with space traceable electronic components, will be delivered at the end of the Phase-II portion of this SBIR effort.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
In the not so distant future, both commercial and military communications will require high bandwidth inter-satellite links (ISL), air-to-air communications nodes and fixed site free space local communications networks.  Fiber technology will be crucial in developing a global satellite communications backbone that can be used to cost effectively move information globally.  With the continuing improvements in Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) providing as much as 5Tb/s transmission over a single fiber, efficient, compact high bandwidth laser ISLs will be necessary to cost effectively compete with terrestrial/transoceanic fiber cables. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The transmitter developed under this program has numerous applications for ranging and target identification.  The ability to modulate pulses at different rates and different pulse duration will also provide a wide range of opportunities in free communication from undersea when the frequency of light is doubled to military intersattelite communications.

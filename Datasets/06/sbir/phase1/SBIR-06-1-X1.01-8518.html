<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
This proposal describes an Application Coherency Manager that implements and manages the interdependencies of simulation, data, and platform information.  It will also enforce a simulation configuration profile submission that includes the specification of the interdependency requirements.  To describe these interdependences, a general-purpose language will serve as the basis for higher-level rules that are assembled using a higher-level graphical user interface. We propose to implement a graphical user interface that allows the user to manage and assemble rule-profiles.  A rule profile would be created by assembling and parameterizing one or more low-level code modules.  This user interface would then be able to save these profiles into a revision archive, perhaps alongside the applications and the data sources.  These profiles could then be checked out, and used.  Locking the version of such a profile would freeze it in a known state.  Leaving it unlocked would allow it to evolve.   The profiles themselves would likely be stored as XML-based documents that refer to the low-level data-source checker modules

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The development of this ACM technology is consistent with the simulate-first methodology used at NASA.  The ACM technology described in this proposal would improve the effectiveness of NASA simulation technologies.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The ACM technology has definite application in the enhancement of an existing Cybernet commercial effort.  This is a virtual prototyping architecture for designing and virtually testing Vetronics (vehicle electronics) systems. This system is known as the Virtual Simulation Integration Lab (VSIL).  With the VSIL, Cybernet is developing simulation models for various Vetronic components. The VSIL supports rapid model development, model change, and test of virtual Vetronics systems.  This system is able to import  Vetronic components of varying age, which leads to the exact problem this proposal addresses.  The integration of an ACM front-end to the VSIL system will increase its value and usability and will make it a more attractive option within the DoD and commercial Vetronic-related applications.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
NASA, the military, and even consumer product manufacturers are limited in their ability to impliment lithium ion battery technology by the effective operating temperature of the state-of-the-art electrolytes. In this effort T/J Technologies will develop novel ionic liquid electrolytes. Ionic liquids, salts that melt at very low temperatures, show potential as solvents that will allow lithium ion batteries to operate at temperatures as low as -80<SUP>o</SUP>C and as high as 100<SUP>o</SUP>C. Additionally, ionic liquid electrolytes are well suited for space applications because they have near zero vapor pressure and are a non-flammable alternative to the organic solvents commonly used in batteries. It is anticipated that this technology will benefit a broad range of Exploration mission applications including portable power for landers, rovers, and astronaut equipment, as well as stationary energy storage applications such as base power, and storage systems for crew exploration vehicles and spacecraft.   In phase I we will deliver a laboratory prototype cell capable of performing between the NASA temperature extremes of -60<SUP>o</SUP>C and 60<SUP>o</SUP>C while retaining greater than 80 % of its room temperature capacity and cycle life.  In a Phase II effort, the electrolyte will be transitioned to production type cells and fully qualified for safety, life and space use.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
This program directly addresses the market needs of NASA by providing a safe, fast lithium ion battery capable of operating over a wide range of temperatures. The development of safe, wide temperature range lithium ion batteries is important for a variety of NASA near term and long term goals. Namely, high discharge rate, low temperature batteries could see useful deployment on exploration mission applications including portable power for landers, rovers, and astronaut equipment, as well as stationary energy storage applications such as base power, and storage systems for crew exploration vehicles and spacecraft. Nearly 40% of all lithium ion batteries, approximately 400 million units, will be used by the military and other government agencies by 2010. By increasing the useful temperature range, decreasing the fire hazard, and allowing for periodic state-of-health checks of the batteries used in important components for our space and military needs, the electrolyte proposed here will not only increase the usability of lithium ion batteries but will also increase their safety and reliability. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Increasing the operational temperature range and safety of lithium ion batteries offers the potential for huge market opportunities in both military and civilian markets. There are currently many lithium ion battery applications that could benefit from the development of a wide temperature electrolyte; Military and telecom applications are the projected two largest consumers of lithium ion batteries and have some of the most demanding temperature ranges for their batteries. Military applications currently span from -60<SUP>o</SUP>C to 80<SUP>o</SUP>C, however, the upper operational temperatures required for military use is likely to increase as our forces are being deployed into more and more inhospitable locations. Munitions stored in the desert are expected to reach temperatures as high as 125<SUP>o</SUP>C. Telecommunication batteries used in cellular phones and Personal Data Assistants have become an integral part of our daily personal and business lives.  Consumers expect these devices to work both outdoors in the winter time in Fairbanks, Alaska and after having been left on the dashboard of a car in Tucson, Arizona. Both of these markets would see a large benefit from a wide temperature range electrolyte.

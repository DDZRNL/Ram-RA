<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Spacecraft projects today consist of many different cooperating companies and institutions. The project members typically use different thermal design analysis software, making the vital exchange of data between team members difficult, costly, or impossible. One solution would be for everyone to use the same software, such that there would be no loss of data when exchanging models and predictions. However, the end result would be little innovation in thermal design software. Competition drives the development of new technologies, but also creates communication barriers. Each tool suite has unique capabilities and specializations, such that a superset of all tools would represent a tremendous advance in and of itself. We propose to develop a "best of both worlds" solution by adopting and extending an international open standard, STEP, for data exchange of thermal models, results, and test data. Such a standard, if available in all major design tools without limiting the unique capabilities of each, allows customers, contractors, and subcontractors to work simultaneously on the same project while using different software. It also allows each organization to choose the best software for each mission, component, and even design task, resulting in the best overall total project efficiency.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
International cooperation is increasingly common for advanced science missions, which would otherwise strain the budgets of any one space agency. Cooperative thermal design activities, however, are extremely difficult to achieve because the NASA standard tool suite is different from the ESA standard tool suite. No direct means of exchange exists for models, much less predictions and test data. ESA has developed open standards used for data exchange within its suite of tools. This proposal seeks to make the NASA standard tool suite compatible with this current standard, streamlining the engineering process and improving the resulting designs as well. Ultimately, this proposal seeks expansions of the standard in order to make the best tools available for each component or design task, harnessing competition without the current side effect of communication barriers.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The result of this proposed development will be immediately marketable since it overcomes an obstacle with respect to the European aerospace market for military and commercial spacecraft. If the ability to use the best available software product, independent of the delivery format, were available, many European contractors, universities, and other agencies would readily adopt newer and more capable software. A similar effect is expected in America and Asia even though the choice of design software is unconstrained in those markets. An organization might choose to use one software suite for preliminary design, and a different one for final design optimization. The elimination of the current all-or-nothing scenario enables each supplier greater opportunities to provide partial solutions where no such opportunity existed before.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Radiant Acoustics' patented technology for micro-interferometry enables a nano-g intertial sensor for NASA's emerging needs.  The proposed sensor system is 1000x more sensitive than commercial sensors.  The sensor combines silicon micromachining (i.e. MEMS) and nanotechnology-based infrared vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) to form a robust sensing architecture functioning in a fundamentally different way than any existing sensor systems by using an optical interferometer within a 5 mm^3 package.  Working prototypes have been fabricated and characterized.  This Phase I proposal is to develop our proven laboratory innovation into a product for NASA and other commercial markets.  All Key Personnel are Full time Employees of the company.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Nano-g intertial sensors with low payload impact with a potential for 1000x improvment in sensitivity gives NASA the increased performance to push the envelope of demands.  Single axis accelerometers are the primary focus of this phase I proposal, but the exploration of gyroscope concepts employing the sensing architecture and their evaluation are on the roadmap for Phase II development in addition to multi-axis accelerometers.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The North American Accelerometer market will be $360M in 2006 and the Low-G segment of that market is $127M, which represents our initial target market.  Customers in those markets include commercial aerospace companies and industrial equipment monitoring.  Low-G commercial applications include Inertial Navigation systems and vehicle rollover detection.  Given our unique advantage at nano-G accelerations, our Low-G products will be extremely competitive.

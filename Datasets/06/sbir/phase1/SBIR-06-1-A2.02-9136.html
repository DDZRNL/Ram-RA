<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Pentalim Inc. is developing a new sensor for the measurement of chemiluninescence of air breathing engine combustion.  The sensor will be wireless and incorporate optical power scavenging technology that will increase its effective transmission range.  The sensor will also incorporate Silicon Carbide electronic materials to enable in situ monitoring of combustion.   This sensor will be applicable to both future propulsion systems as well as legacy and helicopter engines and will enable improved combustion instability, pattern factor and emissions control.  <br><br>  <br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The sensor will help enable active combustion control for air breathing engines.  As a result, this sensor will be directly applicable to NASA milestones in combustion, controls and Intelligent Health Management research and development as part of its ongoing aeronautics research program.  Additional development of the sensor would also enable it to be applice to rocket engine combustion research and development.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The sensor will be applicable to help enable the requirement This sensor will be applicable to both to both commercial and military air breathing engines in future propulsion systems as well as legacy and helicopter engines and will enable improved combustion instability, pattern factor and emissions control.  Additionally, this sensor will be applicable to ground based turbine systems which also have stringent emissions and perforance requirements.

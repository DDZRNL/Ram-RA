<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The NASA commitment to a human presence in space exploration results in the interaction of humans with challenging environments in space, on lunar, and on planetary bodies.   Meeting these challenges requires the development of technologies that will support human system interaction by integrating monitoring, feedback and situational awareness across all types of mission parameters and observables. A successful human system interaction (HSI) system could extend based on existing agent frameworks and software architectures in which NASA is interested. Our proposed approach enables the design of embedded protocols for human-agent interactions to support crew health, safety, and cognitive load modeling in the context of supporting plan execution as well as overall mission goals and activities. Particularly, our proposed HSI framework consists of various types of agents (including sensing and situational awareness abilities, etc.), a suite of HSI protocols for delegation, adjustable autonomy, situational awareness, HSI and mission-oriented coordination, and the integration of the proposed framework with existing systems to assist mission task operations by providing previously hard to observe, yet vital dynamic information, e.g. human health conditions. Our innovation is an agent-based integrated framework for modeling, simulation and implementation of context and mission aware human-system interaction protocols and interfaces.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The primary result from this SBIR project will be the integrated HSI framework for collaboration of human-agent teams, which addresses the key concepts including human agent delegation, situational awareness, adjustable autonomy, and HSI/mission-oriented coordination. Our efforts on this project will result in a full design for the HSI framework including its associated components and a communication protocol suite. A working prototype for HSI in a crew health monitoring and performance scenario, built on IAI's CybeleTM agent platform, will support NASA mission needs. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The HSI framework is being developed for managing human system interaction. It will provide real time health and mission-oriented situational awareness and assistance for mission planning. The HIS framework includes various supporting elements in the design e.g. ontological representation of domain knowledge and team capabilities, protocol development, extensibility.  The HSI framework can be utilized in any domain areas that involve humans in the decision loop, where the human is supported by software elements. This includes areas of DOD as well as commercial applications such as first responder support, equipment maintenance and troubleshooting support, etc.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Hypersonic aircraft are subjected to extreme conditions with respect to mechanical thermal and acoustic loads. Materials with complex microstructure, such as Functionally Graded (FGM) and honeycomb, are expected to play a key role in such vehicles. Detailed numerical stress and thermal analysis of such materials, with conventional Finite Element Methods (FEM), is extremely difficult. The Fast Multipole Boundary Element Method (FMBEM) is a very promising candidate for carrying out such calculations efficiently and accurately. This is an O(N) method (where N is the size of a problem) with respect to both matrix formulation and solution of linear systems.<br><br>It is proposed that two user-friendly software packages based on the FMBEM, to be called AvantFGM and AvantHoneycomb, will be developed in this proposed Phase I project. These packages will be used to carry out mechanical and thermal characterization of these complex materials. The output of these packages will deliver material properties as functions of spatial coordinates, which can then be used to carry out conventional FEM analyses of aircraft components of complex geometrical shape.<br><br>Plans for Phase II call for development of fully functioning commercial software capable of analyzing many realistic situations pertaining to hypersonic aircraft. Phase III will be concerned with further development of the software to include damage accumulation (due to, for example, mechanical, creep and thermo-acoustic fatigue) and risk analysis.<br>

The primary objective of the AvantFGM and AvantHoneycomb software, to be developed during the Phase I project, is to demonstrate the feasibility of the FMBEM approach to carry out thermal and mechanical characterization of materials with complex microstructure, of interest to NASA. Functionally Graded and honeycomb are examples of such materials that are expected to play key roles in hypersonic vehicles. Such materials are required in order to survive the extreme mechanical, thermal and acoustic conditions that prevail in and around hypersonic vehicles. This software will help NASA in developing new materials systems, structural concepts, and manufacturing/fabrication technologies for such vehicles.<br><br>The Phase II project will continue further development of the Phase I software and address details of issues such as combinations of extreme loads, normal and reentry flights and dynamic effects; and help NASA understand the effects of microstructure on structural response. Plans for Phase III include a study of damage accumulation and risk analysis of hypersonic vehicles from a structural viewpoint.<br><P>

The Fast Multipole Boundary Element Method is a very exciting and powerful method for solving detailed problems with complex microstructure. Meshing is much easier than the FEM due to the reduction of dimension by one, thanks to the BEM. Both matrix computation and solution of linear systems scales as O(N), where N is the size of a problem. The results are accurate and efficient. This method has already been applied to problems of composites, fabricated scaffolds, fuel cells, micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) and (ongoing work) blood flow. It has huge potential applications in a variety of problems in diverse areas such as mechanical and aerospace (composites, diesel filters), semiconductor (MEMS), power generation (fuel cells), bioengineering (study of bone, soft tissue and blood flow) ? for characterization of heterogeneous materials with complex microstructure ? either man-made or natural. Once the behavior (typically thermal or mechanical) of such materials is characterized by the FMBEM, the results can be used in conventional FEM analyses of structural elements of complex geometrical shape composed of these materials.

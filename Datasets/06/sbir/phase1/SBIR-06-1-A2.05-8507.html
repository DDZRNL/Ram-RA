<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
To enhance aerodynamic design capabilities, Desktop Aeronautics proposes to combine a new sweep/taper integrated-boundary-layer (IBL) code that includes transition prediction with a Cartesian Euler solver developed at NASA. This combined solver will play an important role in the preliminary design of both conventional and unconventional aerospace vehicles traveling at subsonic, transonic, and supersonic speeds.  Complex aircraft configurations may be easily analyzed with the practically automated surface intersection and Cartesian mesh generation of the Euler solver.  The proposed design-oriented approach to transition prediction will permit rapid assessment of aircraft that exploit natural laminar flow to reduce drag. To facilitate design and numerical optimization using the new aerodynamic analysis, a parameterized geometry engine that can quickly model complex aircraft configurations will be interfaced with the Euler/IBL solver. Desktop Aeronautics will also develop a set of optimization tools well-suited to use with the geometry engine and aerodynamic analysis.  This set of tools will permit aerodynamic shape optimization and multidisciplinary design at earlier stages in the vehicle development process.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Aerodynamic shape optimization with an Euler solver and integrated boundary layer method is used by all major aircraft manufacturers and certainly at NASA centers. The advantage of the proposed application is the time required to complete a design problem. Because the Cartesian Euler solver is virtually automatic, extremely robust, and time-efficient, and because the integrated boundary layer method allows the Euler solver to be useful in many flight regimes, this application could be used on virtually all aerospace vehicles. The addition of a transition model provides a new and unique capability to design aircraft that exploit natural laminar flow.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed project would generate an innovative commercial application that would address the needs of virtually every major and even some minor companies that design aircraft.  The specific applications are identical to those listed in the "NASA Applications" and therefore are not repeated here.  Note that the proposed application would also be marketable abroad since the Cartesian Euler solver can be licensed internationally.

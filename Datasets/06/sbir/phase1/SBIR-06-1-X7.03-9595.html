<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Robots will be precursors to human exploration of the lunar surface.<br>They will be expected to prepare the lunar surface for human<br>habitation as well as conduct scientific investigations.  As humans<br>arrive the robots should be able to shift to providing direct<br>assistance to human exploration activities.  Such tasks require a new<br>generation of robotic vehicles -- a generation that has flexible,<br>dexterous manipulation capabilities and adjustable software<br>controllers that can shift between remote teleoperation, autonomy and<br>co-located human interaction.  Our innovation consists of two<br>components.  The first component is a reconfigurable, dexterous<br>manipulator that is designed to be mounted on a mobile robot.  The<br>manipulator will be light-weight and low-power.  It will contain a<br>reconfigurable number of up to seven degrees-of-freedom.  The second<br>component is a software system that can adjust control of the<br>manipulator from teleoperated to autonomous and that can control the<br>mobile robot and the manipulator as a coordinated unit.  We propose to<br>implement a method called Coordinated Resolved Motion Control that<br>will automatically and jointly control the rover as well as the<br>manipulator such that the manipulator will stay away from<br>singularities.  Together these two innovations will substantially<br>increase the capabilities of NASA rovers, making them more efficient<br>and effective.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA exploration missions will require significantly more complicated<br>robots than are currently being used.  Several NASA research projects,<br>including Robonaut, K-10 and Athlete are working towards highly<br>dexterous, intelligent robots.  Our NASA applications will focus on<br>our software as much as our hardware.  While only a small number of<br>dexterous manipulators will be needed by NASA, many of NASA's research<br>robots will require coordinated motion of rover and manipulation.  For<br>example, Centaur is a four-wheeled base with Robonaut on it being<br>developed at NASA Johnson Space Center.  NASA Ames Research Center<br>(ARC) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory also have research robots that<br>combine mobility and manipulation.  We will work with all of these<br>researchers in Phase 3 to adapt our coordinated control software to<br>their robots.  In addition we expect to deliver our reconfigurable<br>manipulator to NASA ARC for permanent mounting on one of their K-10<br>robots.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Unmanned vehicles are becoming more and more common in battlefield<br>situations. The Future Combat Systems (FCS) program envisions manned<br>and unmanned vehicles of all sizes working side-by-side. In addition,<br>Congress has mandated that one-third of all military vehicles must be<br>unmanned by 2015.  Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) is the primary<br>domain in which robots are currently used.  No EOD robot on the market<br>has a dexterous manipulator.  We believe our reconfigurable technology<br>will make us the clear choice in this market.  Non-military markets<br>such as civilian EOD, urban search and rescue and hostage situations<br>are also increasingly using robots.  Often a single mobile robot will<br>have to perform many different tasks giving our reconfigurable<br>technology an edge.  Another market is the research robotics community<br>such as universities and government laboratories.  The reconfigurable<br>aspect of our manipulator is a selling point because it allows<br>laboratories to upgrade to more DOF over time and allows them to<br>reconfigure the manipulator for different research objectives.  We<br>will also generalize our mobile robot interface to allow integration<br>with commercially available robots.  We expect that the next<br>generation of robotics research will focus on mobile manipulation with<br>programs being supported by NSF, NASA, DARPA and other funding<br>agencies.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Long-term exposure to even relatively low levels of acoustic and vibration signals has been shown to be potentially harmful to humans. A new class of piezoelectric materials is proposed to provide acoustic and vibration damping for increased crew comfort and protection for long-duration space flight. The effectiveness for piezoelectric materials to damp the kinetic energy of mechanical stimuli such as vibration, impact or acoustic signals has been previously demonstrated by the applicant and others. The proposed piezoelectric materials can be incorporated into crew clothing, seating and bedding; linings for floor, wall and/or ceilings; and integrated into composite panels for use as structural members in vehicle construction. Due to the novel nature of the materials, Phase I will focus primarily on production and characterization of mechanical and piezoelectric properties for sample materials. While issues such as off-gassing and flammability are not considered problematic for the proposed materials, these will also be evaluated during Phase I.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed materials could be used in many ways to provide acoustic and/or vibration damping: incorporated into crew clothing, seating and bedding; linings for floor, wall and/or ceilings. They could also be integrated into composite panels for use as structural members in vehicle construction.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
There is much evidence from various commercial transportation industries regarding adverse medical and psychological effects of long-term exposure to noise and vibration. The proposed work therefore has significant dual-use applications for vehicle operators and passengers alike in commercial air, ground and sea transportation systems such as airlines, trains, automobiles, trucks, buses and ships.

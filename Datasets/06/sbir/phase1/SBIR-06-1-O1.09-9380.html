<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Microwave Monolithic Integrated Circuits (MMIC) provide the technology base for miniaturization of microwave payloads in spacecraft.  While MMIC chips are widely available for amplifiers, switches, converters, etc., there is only a limited supplier base for MMIC signal sources.  Hittite has recognized the need and introduced a family of MMICs for phase-locking loops and phase-locked oscillators.  Hittite's MMICs include; VCOs, frequency multipliers and dividers, programmable counters, phase-frequency detectors, and loop amplifiers.  This proposal describes and approach of integrating many of those MMIC parts into a single chip for frequency synthesis without VCOs.  This choice of the scale of integration will support the design architecture for frequency synthesizers with versatility of a wide range of operating frequencies. The selected design goals will allow signal generation from 100 MHz to 12 GHz.  The phase noise floor of the synthesizer is expected to be ?150 dBC/Hz at 100 MHz offset.  Design approaches for all component parts of the proposed MMIC are presented.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Signal sources are critical components in all communications and radar systems. Miniaturized sources with the versatility of frequency selection will be found useful in all space-borne platforms where the size/weight of component parts becomes an issue. The end product of the proposed program, therefore, will have applications in transponders, radars, radio-frequency spectrometers, radiometers, and others.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Miniaturized MMIC sources will be useful in all microwave transmitters and receivers for all applications.   Commercial systems operating in X-band frequencies and above, include point-to-point radio links, satellite down-link receivers, planned UWB communication systems (IEEE 802.15a), radar detectors, Ku-band sensors, and others.  Many of those systems require portable and un-attended terminals in which the size/weight and power drain of components become a major limiting factor.  The proposed program will lead to partial solution of those problems in all those commercial systems. . The projected number of terminals for those systems add up to millions, representing a large market comparable to cellular and personal communication systems operating in lower frequency bands.

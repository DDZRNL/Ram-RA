<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The objective of this proposal is the development of a next-generation computational aeroelasticity code, suitable for real-world complex geometries, and incorporating error-control for superior reliability and efficiency, and sensitivity analysis for aeroelastic design problems.<br>The principal enabling innovation for achieving these goals involves the development of adjoint methods for time-dependent coupled aeroelastic simulations.                                                                             The use of adjoint techniques has become widespread for steady-state aerodynamic design, and the potential of adjoint methods for controlling spatial error has been well documented. However, the extension of these methods to unsteady problems and coupled aero-structural problems has generally been lacking. Using a consistent and modular adjoint formulation, the proposed project will result in the incorporation of an adjoint methodology into an existing three-dimensional unstructured mesh aeroelastic simulation capability.                                                                             The adjoint methodology will enable revolutionary advances in efficiency and reliability for computational aeroelasticity, by providing the means of controlling temporal error through time-step control for relevant engineering outputs, such as the determination of flutter boundaries.  Sensitivity analysis will also be enabled, providing the means for performing aerodynamic shape optimization, structural modifications, as well as valuable information for guiding the placement, location and properties of flow control devices, actuators, and smart material technologies.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
On the one hand, an aeroelasticity simulation package with robust error control will dramatically reduce the computational requirements and enhance the reliability of aeroelastic simulations.  This will enable NASA projects to combine wind-tunnel testing and simulation in a more effective manner. On the other hand, a capability for performing sensitivity analysis within an aeroelastic simulation will enable NASA to determine novel solutions to aeroelastic problems through shape optimization, or through structural modifications and/or the design and placement of active or passive flow control devices. The developed software may be used in the design of novel subsonic and supersonic aircraft configurations, as well as in the design and validation of future access to space transportation architectures.<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The developed software package will be based on an existing steady-state analysis and design aerodynamics code currently marketed and supported by Scientific Simulations LLC. The proposed work will extend the capabilities of the current commercial software product to include aeroelastic effects including analysis and design, representing an innovative capability which will be unique in the marketplace. This capability will be marketed to existing Scientific Simulations customers in the fixed wing aircraft industry, as well as to new customers in other industries where aeroelasticity is of importance such as the rotorcraft industry, and the wind turbine industry.<br>

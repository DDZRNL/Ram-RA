<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
To meet the ever-increasing power demand of today's spacecraft systems, an integrated power electronics system capable of interfacing, and simultaneously controlling, three power ports will be designed and demonstrated in Phase I of the proposed project. This new proposed power electronic architecture employs a single-stage power topology, thus allowing cost-effective control of power flow with improved efficiency, power density, and reliability. This is achieved by modifying the switching patterns and control strategy of suitable conventional isolated converters, fully utilizing digital power electronics control methods. The result is multi-function utilization of converter components for increased capabilities with minimal effects on losses, size, weight and cost for such components. Moreover, existing engineering design concepts can be easily used to optimize the new proposed power topologies in a fashion similar to the conventional mother topologies including soft-switching techniques, component selection, and magnetic design procedures at higher switching frequencies. Each of these topologies is capable of performing simultaneous control of two of its three ports from battery or ultra-capacitor charge regulation, solar array peak power tracking, and/or load voltage regulation. Such converters are valuable alternative for designers of power systems requiring multiple power sources, or interfaced to power storage devices.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The ever-increasing loading demand on spacecrafts for electric propulsion, communication, instruments, and actuators, together with the trends for diversification of energy sources and storage devices are challenging the traditional design of power management and distribution (PMAD) systems. The proposed converter architecture has the potential to integrate source control, distribution, storage control, and load regulation electronics into a single modular structure. With the use of fully digital power electronics control structures, it is possible to simultaneously control sources such as solar arrays, fuel cells, and radioisotope sources, as well as batteries and flywheels. These isolated converters are further compatible with NASA's series-connected boost regulators (SCBR), and are ideal as power electronics building blocks (PEBB). This technology enables significant downsizing of bulky system components, reducing launch propulsion requirements and costs. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed power electronic architecture is suitable for applications where a steady continuous power source is not available, and where energy storage backup is required to handle the mismatch between source availability and loading patterns. Hence, this power distribution technology is valuable for mobile and remote applications with systems that are powered via batteries, solar and fuel cells. Applications such as communication repeater stations, traffic lights in remote areas, mobile chargers for laptops, cellular phones and future solar powered electric vehicles, to name few, are all viable candidates. Moreover, the new digital control technology can also be incorporated into pre-regulator stages of grid-interactive solar inverter systems that offer battery-backed stand-alone operation when the grid is absent or unstable.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The recent performance increases in graphics processing units (GPUs) have made graphics cards an attractive platform for implementing computationally intense applications.  With their numerous parallel computational pipelines and SIMD architecture, modern GPUs can outperform high-end microprocessors by one to three orders of magnitude, depending on the problem.  Most work to date at EM Photonics and elsewhere has focused on accelerating specific applications by porting core engines onto the GPU.  In this project, we propose the development of general purpose computational libraries capable of solving numerous core numerical functions on commodity graphics cards.  These solvers will be based on accepted, industry-standard interfaces and will be easy to integrate with current and future applications.  The result will be a GPU-based numerical coprocessor capable accelerating a wide range of computationally intense functions, thereby reducing processing times in applications where numerical computations are the primary bottleneck.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Virtually all software requiring extensive numerical processing could benefit from the solvers developed in this project.  Most such software is already created using BLAS or similar libraries, thus requiring very little modification to be used with these accelerated solvers.  They can have an immediate impact on numerous NASA applications such as vibration analysis for a number of multi-body spacecraft configurations such as Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV), and rotorcraft and computational fluid dynamics for space craft flight through the atmosphere and rocket design.  Other application areas of interest to NASA include mechanical and stress modeling, heat transfer analysis, and image processing.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
These solvers could be integrated into everything from specialized computational engines to general purpose tools such as MATLAB.  MATLAB currently integrates BLAS compliant routines to solve computationally intense problems.  Some versions of MATLAB even ship multiple implementations of this interface and allow the user to select between them.  The solvers developed here could simply become another option for users to select, thereby offloading processing to the system's graphics card.  Specific application areas include automotive design, civil and mechanical engineering analysis, electromagnetic simulations, computational fluid dynamics, acoustics, signal/image processing, and financial modeling.  We also anticipate being able to accelerate commercial packages such as NASTRAN and HFSS with these libraries.

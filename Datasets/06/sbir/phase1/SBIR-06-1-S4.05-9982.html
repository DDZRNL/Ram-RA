<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The proposed innovation is a robust and user-friendly software environment where NASA researchers can customize the latest HHT technologies for the LISA (and LIGO) application. The proposed technology will include the latest discoveries and inventions not available in the state-of-the-art. Its taxonomy includes gravitational sensors and sources, expert systems, portable data analysis tools, software development environments, and software tools for distributed analysis and simulation. The disturbance caused by the passage of a gravitational wave is expected to be very small and will be measured with laser interferometry. The Hilbert-HuangTransform (HHT)and related analysis technologies developed since the original concept has been used successfully in other applications to extract non-linear and transient signal comonents of very small magnitude with respect to the measured signal. The proposed research and development team has participated in the latest cycle of technology development related to the HHT at the theoretical, implementation, and application levels. Not only will the creation of the proposed software contribute to the data analysis of the gravitational wave signals in the laser interferometry measurements (for both LIGO and LISA data), but also in other applications within and outside NASA's mission.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Starodub and its team propose to develop a HHT-technology software over the first two phases that will supersede earlier HHT products with newer methods that address previous limitations. Phase I will have focused on the LISA and LIGO data. The new methods discussed in the work plan are generally applicable to most sensors data that capture non-linear, transient signal components embedded in noise and other signals. The current and potential NASA applications of the latest HHT technologies are cosmological gravity wave and planets hunting, global primary productivity evolution map from LandSat data, non-destructive evaluation for structural health monitoring, and vibration analysis of NASA equipment.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Starodub has worked with FHWA to study many problems. Based on the positive reception in the highway community known for its traditionally conservative approach, most Government agencies, in research, development,<br>and operations, may benefit from this product with a reduced learning curve with the proper exposure to this technology. Starodub shall focus its marketing effort on illustrating the software with solutions from NASA<br>applications output from this SBIR project and from a plethora of applications previously developed and revisited in the new analysis product in collaboration with Dr. Zhaohua Wu and Dr. Norden Huang. The current list of potential non-NASA application areas includes non-destructive evaluation for structural health monitoring in highway infrastructure, vibration, speech, and acoustic signal analyses, earthquake engineering, bio-medical applications, and financial market data analysis.

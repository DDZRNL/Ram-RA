<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The research team at The Ohio State University has been developing technologies to suppress jet noise using localized arc filament plasma actuators and are in the process of demonstrating this type of technology at NATR facility at NASA Glenn Research Center.  The localized arc filament plasma actuators developed at OSU are the only actuators that can be used currently for active control of flow and noise in high Reynolds number and high-speed flows, such as jets, mixing layers, combustors, cavity, etc. However, the lack of availability of appropriate plasma generator has been a hindrance to this technology development.  One of the challenges is designing and developing a power supply which can derive up to 64 actuators. The current Phase I SBIR program will explore some new technologies for the design of such a power supply.  The research team will focus on building the power supply for NASA during the Phase II program and also will make significant efforts in commercializing this product by making it much more energy sufficient, user friendly, and compact.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Feasibility tests of the proposed concept of multi-channel, energy efficient, lightweight, high voltage pulsed plasma generator with independent channel control (Phase I), as well as testing and optimization of a working prototype powering up to 64 plasma actuators (Phase II) would make possible its use for large-scale, high-speed flow control and noise control applications. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The most likely commercial application of the proposed technology would be its use for jet engine noise reduction, with a possibility of retrofitting jet engines already in operation. Associated instrumentation, hardware, and software from this technology has the potential for government, industrial, and academic organizations.

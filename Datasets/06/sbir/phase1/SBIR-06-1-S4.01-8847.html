<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Advancements in sensors/detectors are needed to support future NASA mission concepts including polarimetry, large format imaging arrays, and high-sensitivity spectroscopy. The corresponding data acquisition systems must employ high-speed, extra low power, linear analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) featuring a wide input bandwidth and reasonable effective number of bits, followed by a digital signal processor usually implemented inside a field-programmable gate array with a relatively low-speed data interface. In addition, radiation tolerance represents one of the main requirements for the space-oriented electronics. Commercially available ADCs feature high power consumption, high latency, poor linearity, and low radiation tolerance at high input bandwidths above 1GHz. To address the described needs, we propose a novel, low-power, high input bandwidth, radiation-tolerant, under sampling ADC with an output digital demultiplexer that enables direct data loading into a standard FPGA. Wide input bandwidth, low input return loss, 6-bit accuracy, low distortion and power consumption will be achieved through utilization of a proprietary adaptive matching filter and dual-output sample-and-hold amplifier followed by two reduced-rate ADCs. The digitized signals are delivered to the proprietary low-power LVDS output buffers after rate adjustment and realignment to the selected clock signal. Advanced technology featuring heterojunction bipolar transistors will provide the required radiation tolerance.<br><br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed approach will revolutionize data acquisition systems widely used in NASA experiments including space based telescope, radar, and hyper-spectral imaging and software definable radio interconnect. It will drastically reduce power consumption of data measurement/acquisition systems utilized in future Earth System Science measurements, wireless satellite communication, software definable radio, and others; as well as in multi-sensor flight control systems widely used by NASA, DOD and DOE.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The developed product will have many industrial application areas including: the next generation of wireless ground stations, long-haul fiber optic communication, ultra-high-speed measurement instrumentation, space-based radar, CDROM testing systems, and a variety of other applications. The developed system will deliver improved functionality that is required in homeland security and defense systems.

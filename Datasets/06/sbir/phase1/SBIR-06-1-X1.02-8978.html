<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
SpaceWorks Engineering, Inc. (SEI) proposes development of the Integrated Risk and Cost Model I-RaCM, as the innovation to meet the need for integrated cost and risk assessment early in the design of a new system. I-RaCM will integrate a diverse set of new and industry-standard tools used for life cycle cost, operations, reliability modeling, and estimation of technology development costs. The I-RaCM platform will provide seamless integration between tools, perform all data exchange, and interface with the performance disciplines.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
A software product for use by NASA to determine financing, long-term support costs, evaluate the impact of risk and reliability on mission success, and assess the economic case for a venture. <br><br>A spin-off software product, service, or consultancy where early consideration of cost and risk is important. Use in consultation work by SEI to support government or industry space concept design, development, and analysis.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
A software product for use by commercial space companies or financial analysts to determine financing, long-term support costs, evaluate the impact of risk and reliability on mission success, and assess the economic case for a venture. <br><br>A stand-alone software product for use by NASA, Air Force, NRO, and other government aerospace and defense agencies.<br><br>A spin-off software product, service, or consultancy for sale to other government agencies and commercial organizations where early consideration of cost and risk is important.<br>Use in consultation work by SEI to support government or industry space concept design, development, and analysis.

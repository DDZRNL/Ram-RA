<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Global Technology Connection, Inc., in collaboration with Georgia Tech (Center for Fuel Cell and Battery Technologies) and our industrial partner, Eagle Pichers, proposes to develop and test the feasibility of a Battery Diagnostics and Prognostics System for space exploration applications.  The architecture couples neural network, support vector machine, and fusion algorithms to yield battery remaining useful life predictions taking into account battery usage patterns and detected failure modes to increase the reliability of NASA's electrical power systems. This improved high fidelity architecture will be applied to fault detection and life prediction of both Lead Acid and Lithium-Ion Batteries for several space applications like MER, CEV, CLV, ISS, etc.  A multi-disciplinary team with a collaborative approach has been assembled for successful development and demonstration of Battery Life Prediction. Cycle testing of representative cells and batteries will be conducted at the Georgia Tech Research Institute to develop and validate remaining capacity and cycle life models for feasibility.  Existing work by GTC on Li-Ion battery deep discharge models and data from our industrial and research partners will be leveraged for development of commercial software that can enhance and monitor battery health and accurately predict remaining useful life. Aggressive commercialization and technology transition plans will be pursued with our industrial team partners.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA requires lightweight rechargeable batteries for future missions to Mars and other outer planets that are capable of operating over a wide range of temperatures with high specific energy and energy densities. The proposed system can be used to monitor the batteries for a wide range of space structures like Mars Exploration Vehicles (MER), CEV, CLV, ISS, GEO, MEO, and LEO etc.  The developed and validated Battery Health Monitoring System (BHMS) architecture will reduce repair and maintenance costs through automated diagnostics and prognostics that supports the current readiness, future readiness and quality of service requirements of NASA. The specific benefits are: (1) increased mission readiness (2) reduced total ownership costs (3) reduced battery maintenance parts and planning. The BHMS system will be a valuable technology to improve the safety of future space explorations including manned and unmanned missions to the Moon, the Mars, and other space missions.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
A validated Battery Health Monitoring System (BHMS) would have broad applications to batteries used by DoD systems and vehicles, hybrid vehicles, commercial aviation, road transportation, telecommunications, medical equipment, computer laptop, UPS systems, etc.  BHMS can be integrated into the vehicle or system level health management system using this open modular software framework.

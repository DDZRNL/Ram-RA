<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The modeling of NLTE hypersonic flows combines several disciplines: chemistry, kinetics, radiation transport, fluid mechanics, and surface science. No single code or model has been able to capture, with high fidelity, all the complex effects that come into play, especially at higher velocities. Spectral Sciences, Inc. proposes to create an innovative software tool to develop and demonstrate high-fidelity chemistry, radiation, and flow models for NLTE hypersonic flows that will address all the important effects in a unified way. SSI will demonstrate an end-to-end capability to simulate the kinetics and radiation transport for NLTE hypersonic flows through the development of prototype software and demonstration for a candidate hypersonic flow scenario. The software will be designed to be modular, in order that they can be used by other codes and other applications. Testing and validation will include studies of the interaction of gases in the shock layer with the ablating material making up the thermal protection system of the vehicle as well as an assessment of other available codes. It is intended that the software tool be used as a benchmark to test lower-fidelity models, or as an inexpensive substitute for laboratory or field tests.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Potential NASA applications include the accurate prediction of NLTE, hypersonic aerothermal environments near spacecraft. The software developed from this effort will have applications to spacecraft design and development for the Crew Exploration Vehicle and aerocapture missions to Titan, Neptune, and Venus. The software will potentially avoid the need for expensive measurements and/or complement existing measurements of hypersonic flow properties. The software tool will provide benchmark results to help assess NASA flow models that may be less computationally expensive, but perhaps more flexible to the geometry of the actual problem or in the ability to explore a large parameter space of trajectories and conditions. The NLTE kinetics and radiation transport portion of the model will be modular and general in order to be easily adapted for other potential uses involving other NASA hypersonic, NLTE flows, or flow-solvers. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed software tool will have wide application for Earth atmosphere hypersonic flow problems, including the development of military hypersonic vehicles and military applications involving the modeling of re-entry flows for missile defense. Other important military applications include the modeling and analysis of missile base heating, and modeling associated with the radiation signature of flows near missile bodies in rarefied, hypersonic flow regimes. The radiation signature due to NLTE flows near the missile body will be critical for development of missile defense sensors and associated algorithms. In addition, the proposed software could supplement existing commercial continuum fluid dynamics software, providing high-fidelity, NLTE physics capability.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
To be used naturally in design optimization, parametric study and achieve quick total time-to-solution, simulation must naturally and personally be available to the scientist/engineer, as easily as email or word-processing. Environments such as Matlab/IDL allow ease of use, but unless simulations are extremely fast, they cannot be used naturally.<br><br>Many large-scale numerical calculations require storage and computation that grow as the square/cube of the number of variables, including such linear algebra operations as solving dense linear systems, computing eigen-values/vectors, and others. The use of fast algorithms such as the fast multipole method (FMM) coupled with iterative methods allows many problems of interest to be solved in near linear time and memory. We have taken a leadership role in applying and extending the FMM to various problems in acoustics, fluid flow, electromagnetics, function fitting and machine learning.<br>Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) are now ubiquitous in game consoles, in workstations and other devices and are special purpose processors for graphics, that are predicted to shortly achieve performance in the hundreds of gigaflop range for specialized calculations (much faster than COTS PCs) at low price points.<br>It is conceivable now to equip personal workstations with several CPUs and GPUs, and solve problems with millions or billions of variables quickly using fast algorithms. We will take an important algorithm with wide applicability: the FMM, and implement it on the widely available heterogeneous CPU/GPU architecture, and prove the feasibility of accelerating it tremendously. A fundamental reconsideration of the algorithm that maps appropriate pieces on to the correct part of the architecture forms the basis of our approach. Developed software will be tested, and benchmark problems solved. A library of software that will support the porting of the FMM and other scientific computing to the CPU/GPU architecture will be developed.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA is fundamentally a science and design driven organization where simulation is used extensively. Scientists and contractors routinely use simulation to develop new aircraft/rotorcraft propulsion systems and mitigate the noise created by them; design new space and satellite antennas, compute electro-magnetic and other cross-sections of objects; design new lenses and masks; compute free surface flows in microgravity; solve inverse problems to design for heat transfer, or develop material properties; solve problems of stellar dynamics and molecular dynamics and others. All these computations have been shown to be accelerated tremendously by the FMM. Availability of high quality FMM software capable of being accelerated by CPU/GPU environments will help achieve NASA achieve its objectives cheaper and faster.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
At the end of Phase II and in Phase III we will have available an FMM library that can be used to accelerate various scientific simulation software. Scientific simulation is becoming an integral part of the way many companies do business. Industries where simulation is an integral part of the product development phase include:<br>?	Chip design/electronics<br>?	Drug design/pharmaceuticals<br>?	Automotive<br>?	Aerospace <br>?	Wireless/Antenna Design<br>?	Computer and Video Games<br>?	Movie Special Effects and Post Production<br>?	Financial Analysis/Data Mining<br>?	Oil/Mineral Exploration<br>?	Audio/acoustic analysis and Sound Systems Design<br>?	Naval Architecture/Ship Design<br>?	Aeronautics<br><br>The software that we propose to develop will target all these companies for license and other revenue. No comparable software offering is available that will allow these companies to easily incorporate the FMM in their offerings, and improve them dramatically. Other companies employing the FMM have targeted particular application areas such as developing optical components rather than developing general broad software libraries. <br><br>Our use of the GPU/CPU architecture, and achieving fast computations in personal workstation environments will give us a further competitive advantage.<br>

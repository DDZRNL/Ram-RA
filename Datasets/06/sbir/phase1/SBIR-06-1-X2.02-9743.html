<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Spacecraft generate huge amounts of data.  A significant challenge for<br>both human operators and autonomous control systems is ensuring that<br>the right data (and combinations of data) are available at the right<br>time for control and decision-making and ensuring that the data is at<br>the right abstraction level.  A key part of this process is data<br>abstraction -- that is converting low-level analog or digital signals<br>into higher-level data.  We are proposing a data abstraction<br>architecture that provides a provides a tool-box of components,<br>connections and development environment that allow engineers to build<br>and maintain data abstraction systems.  In addition, having a<br>well-defined data abstraction architecture allows data displays to be<br>automatically generated and updated as the architecture develops.<br>Thus, a data abstraction architecture can support both human<br>decision-making as well as providing data services to autonomous<br>control systems.  We are also proposing to build an integrated<br>development environment in which designers or operators can<br>graphically build data abstraction architectures from standard<br>components to accomplish their data tasks.  Together these provide a<br>data abstraction architecture that is a key component of NASA's<br>operational infrastructure and provides a building block for deploying<br>more advanced autonomy architectures in the future.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The new collection of exploration vehicles (called Constellation) will<br>require the integration of a variety of software components from a<br>variety of different contractors.  Managing the flow of data from<br>these components and assembling it into a coherent picture, whether<br>for human decision-makers or autonomy, will be difficult.  A standard<br>data abstraction architecture will be important.  We will target<br>markets such as the eventual Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) prime<br>contractor (either Boeing/Northrop or Lockheed Martin).  We will also<br>target NASA Mission Operations Directorate (MOD) as a customer for<br>data abstraction in ground operations.  In addition, robotic missions<br>and uncrewed space vehicles offer opportunities for deploying data<br>abstraction architectures. <br> <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Unmanned vehicles, both air and ground, are becoming more and more<br>common in battlefield situations.  Future Combat Systems (FCS)<br>envision manned and unmanned vehicles of all sizes working<br>side-by-side.  In addition, Congress has mandated that one-third of<br>all military vehicles must be unmanned by 2015.  Whether these<br>vehicles are operated remotely or are autonomous they will need data<br>abstraction architectures.  As information streams from these systems<br>to centralized command and control centers data abstraction and data<br>presentation will be key.  An architecture that allows different<br>vendors to combine data will be beneficial to the military.<br>Intelligence agencies offer other applications for a data abstraction<br>architecture.  As data is collected from a variety of assets it needs<br>to be merged, abstracted and displayed in a variety of forms.  Being<br>able to easily configure a data abstraction architecture for a variety<br>of different domains will be extremely beneficial.

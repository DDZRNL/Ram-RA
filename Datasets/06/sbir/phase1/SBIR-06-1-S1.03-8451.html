<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Advanced Scientific Concepts, Inc. (ASC) has developed a 128 x 128 frame, 3D Flash LADAR video camera capable of a 30 Hz frame rate. Because Flash LADAR captures an entire frame of data from a single pulse of light, platform motion and vibration will not affect the measurements.  This is not true for any other laser-ranging system, such as scanning LIDAR.  Additionally, with no moving parts, the system is smaller, lighter, and requires less power than traditional approaches. The proposed project will use an ASC camera in a flight test. Hazard identification, and Entry Decent and Landing applications will be investigated. Multiple data sets will be generated at various resolutions and frame rates. This data will be analyzed, and together with inputs from JPL scientists, will be used to breadboard the camera design for NASA applications. Industry inputs will define a pathway for space qualification. An optimized breadboard camera will be fabricated and delivered in Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The 3D Flash LADAR Camera developed on this project can support future EDL requirements for lunar or planetary exploration. Not only will the camera be able to support hazard mapping and navigation but it can also support other terrain mapping requirements. The camera includes a fog, dust and liquid penetration mode, which will allow landing and navigation in hazardous conditions.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The compact, low power 3D Flash LADAR Camera developed on this project will have direct applications to collision avoidance and navigation for military autonomous air and ground vehicles. These cameras will also be directly applicable to terrain mapping for military and commercial applications.

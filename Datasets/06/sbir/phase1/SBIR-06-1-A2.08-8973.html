<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
ZONA Technology, Inc. (ZONA) proposes a R&D effort to develop a Unified Nonlinear Flight Dynamics and Aeroelastic Simulator (UNFDAS) Tool that will combine proven simulation and visualization techniques to accurately match in-flight recorded dynamic behavior of an air vehicle. <br>ZONA proposes to develop the UNFDAS Tool through a blend of state-of-the-art aerodynamic model updating and control-oriented techniques. It blends mathematically sound flight dynamics and aeroelastic modeling approaches with CFD, wind-tunnel or flight-test data. The end product is a nonlinear dynamic tool capable of simulating the key aeroelastic coupling mechanism between structural modes and unsteady aerodynamic effects with classical rigid-body dynamics. Feasibility studies are proposed to validate the UNFDAS Tool using a suite of actual data from flying qualities and flutter flight tests.<br>This enabling technology will be invaluable to the flight test community by accurately simulating the air vehicle responses to different input commands, and then identifying the critical flying conditions before actual flights are performed.<br>Marketing the resulting software package will be simplified by taking advantage of ZONA's current extensive customer list. ZONA Technology's reputation and track record in supporting the aerospace industry and government with ZONA codes can assure the success of the commercialization plan.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
A nonlinear flight dynamics simulator tool with an added-on aeroelastic solver is still not available. NASA Dryden Flight Research Center and NASA Langley Research Center have been working for many years towards achieving a software package that would accurately predict the interaction between flight dynamics considering airframe structural flexibility in closed-loop with flight control laws. <br><br>The proposed UNFDAS Tool is aimed at providing an expedient multidisciplinary nonlinear flight simulator tool to perform an efficient flaw debugging for advanced control laws as well as to promote physical understanding of the in-flight observed dynamic behaviors due to evolutionary designs. It also will assist to predict the onset of instabilities prior to envelope expansion programs. The toolbox will be especially valuable during NASA's current and next generation UAV's flying qualities and envelope expansion programs, the ERAST aircraft which is highly flexible and even future RevCon projects that will introduce distributed control from active materials. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
ZONA's business plan for this toolbox will follow ZONA's flagship software called: ZAERO product/service sales strategy. The added capabilities developed in the UNFDAS Tool will strengthen ZONA's market position in the aerospace industry. The toolbox will be marketed towards the flight test applications on a wide class of aerospace vehicles such as: (a) USAF's F-22 and F-35 aircrafts at Edwards AFB, (b) UASF's Hilda, sensorcraft as well as stealth and morphing UAV/UCAV, (c) DARPA's Morphing Aerostructure (MAS) and Oblique Flying Wing (OFW) Programs, (d) Boeing 7E7 and future executive jet designs of Cessna, Raytheon, etc. The proposed toolbox can also be applied to validate health management strategies specifically designed for aircraft designs with prominent aeroelastic characteristics.

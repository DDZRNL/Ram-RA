<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
This SBIR Phase I project proposes the development of lightweight compact nanostructured catalytic reactors for air purification from toxic gaseous organic pollutants, particulate matter, and microorganisms.  Volatile organic compounds will be catalytically oxidized when the contaminated air stream is passed through high-density arrays of uniform ultra-high aspect ratio, high surface area, cylindrical nanoreactors.  Such unique architecture provides improved mass and heat transfer and ensures conversion of volatile organics into non-toxic products with unmatched efficiency.  Room temperature oxidation of formaldehyde at low ppm level has already been confirmed.  In addition, particulate matter, bacteria and fungi will be filtered out from the air stream at the reactor surface (nanopore diameter of the proposed reactors will not exceed 300 nm).<br><br>The proposed low-mass, low-volume and low-power-consumption reactors are intended to replace and extend functionality of conventional packed-bed catalytic oxidizers used currently for removal of trace organic contaminants from spaceship atmospheres.  The Phase I work will focus on fabricating the reactor prototypes and evaluating of their performance in catalytic oxidation of selected volatile organic compounds.<br>

Removal of trace organic and some other contaminants (e.g., carbon monoxide, ammonia, hydrazine, etc.), particulate matter, and microorganisms from spacecraft and spacesuits atmospheres.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Proposed catalytic filters could be used in  wide range of non-NASA applications, from gas masks and air respirators for individual protection to small- and medium-scale collective protection systems. Users of this technology will include facilities utilizing hazardous chemicals, military personnel, counter-terrorism and security forces, first responders, emergency medical personnel, and the personnel involved in chemical weapons demilitarization and chemical site remediation programs.

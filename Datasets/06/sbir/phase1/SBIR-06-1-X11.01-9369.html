<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Manned lunar exploration will require extravehicular activity (EVA) suits that surpass existing technology.  We propose an innovative thermal control system for EVA suits that uses an absorption heat pump with a flexible radiator that offers reduced size, lighter weight, conformability, rugged construction, and freeze tolerance.  The heat pump absorbs a crew member's metabolic heat and rejects it via radiation to the environment.  Innovative materials and construction enable a very lightweight and flexible system that is rugged and easily repairable.  In Phase I we will prove feasibility by assessing material suitability for lunar operations, demonstrating the critical fabrication steps for key components, then testing these components to demonstrate thermal performance.  In Phase II we will build, demonstrate, and deliver a complete prototype heat pump system.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed heat pump radiator can provide thermal control in extravehicular activity (EVA) suits designed for lunar and Mars exploration, as well as EVA suits used for zero-gravity operations such as space station or satellite construction or assembly and maintenance of space-based telescopes.  The absorption heat pump system offers light weight, flexibility and ease of integration, ruggedness, and freeze tolerance.  NASA needs this device for future, long-duration space exploration missions?such as extended stays on the moon or Mars?in which in-situ repair is vital and freeze tolerance is required for operation in extreme thermal environments.  The non-venting heat pump system is also needed for construction of scientific instruments in space that require a very clean extravehicular environment.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed heat pump can provide a lightweight, portable cooling unit to wear with sealed or heavy garments in hazardous environments, such as level A HAZMAT suits needed for homeland security missions.  The absorption cooling process can be used to provide portable, regenerable refrigeration and air conditioning for recreation, transportation, and medical applications.

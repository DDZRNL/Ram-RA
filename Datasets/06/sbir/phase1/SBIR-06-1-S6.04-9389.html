<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
An innovative, ultra low noise, single chip cavity oscillator is proposed. The oscillator is fully integrated on standard MMIC process. It operates in the frequency range of 50 ? 100 GHz with phase noise of -112 at 100 KHz offset. At the core of the oscillator is a rectangular cavity based resonator. To our knowledge, this is the first ever implementation of a waveguide cavity on standard MMIC process. This new technique, will allow the realization of ultra small high performance integrated oscillators for future market demands. In the future, a phase locked oscillator can be implemented on a single chip. The PLO will consist of a cavity oscillator, phase frequency detector, prescaler and a loop filter. All components can be integrated on a standard GaAs HBT process.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Signal sources are critical components in all communications and radar systems. Miniaturized fundamental frequency oscillators will serve the need for receivers in deep-space transponders, radars for monitoring planets and earth atmosphere,  radio-frequency spectrometers, radiometers, and others. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Miniaturized MMIC sources will be useful in all microwave transmitters and receivers for all applications.   Commercial systems operating MMW frequencies include point-to-point radio links, satellite ground stations, automotive radars, and others.  Many of those systems require portable and un-attended terminals in which the size/weight of components become a major limiting factor.  The proposed program will lead to partial solution of those problems in all those commercial systems. . The projected number of terminals for those systems add up to millions, representing a large market comparable to cellular and personal communication systems operating in lower frequency bands.

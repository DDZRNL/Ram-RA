<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate a vapor compressor driven hybrid two-phase loop technology. The hybrid two-phase loop technology incorporates an advanced evaporator design that is capable of passive separation of liquid and vapor phases at high heat flux conditions. Combining the hybrid two-phase loop technology with a vapor compressor increases the technology's operating range. The integral phase separation feature in the evaporator greatly improves the vapor compressor performance and reliability by preventing two-phase flows in the compressor. The proposed technology is particularly suited for the lunar surface systems where the cooling system size, mass, reliability and operation under widely varying environmental conditions are critically important.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA's vision of establishing lunar colony requires innovative advances in the thermal management technology to reject waste heat to much higher heat sink temperatures. Vapor compressor driven hybrid two-phase loops will provide high performance refrigeration for lunar surface systems and other NASA planetary missions where higher heat sink temperature and higher radiator temperature are required.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Non-NASA commercial applications will be the vapor compressor air-conditioning/refrigeration systems for residential and commercial applications. High performance electronics cooling and vehicle climate control where high compression efficiency and high heat flux capability are important.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
NASA's Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control (IRAC) Project, Preliminary Technical Plan Summary identifies several causal and contributing factors that can lead to loss of aircraft control.  Among these are adverse conditions and uncommanded motions which may be the result of vehicle or propulsion system failures or damage. One possible source of projectile damage is uncontained engine debris.  This proposal focuses on development of a robust methodology for predicting the damage to aircraft structures from uncontained engine debris. The two objectives of this phase of the work proposed are:<br> 1. Development of rigorous criteria and methodology for determining projectile sizes, shapes, velocities, and weights resulting from uncontained engine debris.<br> 2. Research and development of techniques to predict realistic damage sizes and shapes resulting from projectile impacts on aircraft structure.<br><br>The Phase I SBIR is intended to be a proof of concept and demonstration of the feasibility of interfacing UEDDAM with LSDYNA.  One of the main products of the effort will be to well prepared plan for proceeding to Phase II. Whereas the Phase I product will be a proof of concept, it will not be ready for commercialization.  It will be a prototype that does not have the user-friendly features such as graphical user interface (GUI).  Nor will it have the ability to account for composite materials in the target.  Thus the Phase II effort will focus on these two issues.<br><br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
This product has direct application to NASA's Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control (IRAC) Project.  As the IRAC project evolves, RHAMM feels that realistic damage states will be critical to the success of the overall program, since simulation will necessarily be a large part of it.  Furthermore, as wind tunnel testing is being planned and executed, these realistic damage states and sizes will be important in bounding the problem and in leading the fabrication of experimental models.  The UEDDAM-LSDYNA interface will be an integral part of the IRAC modeling and simulation effort.<br><br>RHAMM also believes that the UEDDAM-LSDYNA interface could contribute greatly to NASA's Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) Program.  Specifically, we believe that it would have application on the objective that states: "Diagnose coupled degradation/malfunction/failure/hazard conditions and predict their effects on vehicle safety" and the approach that states:  "Couple state awareness data with physics-based and data-driven models to diagnose degradation and damage caused by environmental hazards and electro/thermo/mechanical failures."<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Upon successful completion of the Phase II SBIR, we will have a stand alone UEDDAM-LSDYNA interface code that we will offer to International (if approved), Commercial, FAA, DHS, and DoD (and their contractors) for use in damage effects modeling of aircraft structures.  Strategies for penetrating these markets will be tailored to their specific needs.  We envision generating a CD-ROM with specific examples of how the product can benefit potential customers in both commercial and government applications.  Military, commercial, and dual use implementation will be highlighted and used as a strong selling point.<br>

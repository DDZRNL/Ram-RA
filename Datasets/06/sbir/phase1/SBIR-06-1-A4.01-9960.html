<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The combination of smart devices and embedded metadata and networked (wire and wireless) technologies present real opportunities for significant improvements in reliability, cost-benefits, and safety for remote testing, performance measurement, and facility management. Adding robust and autonomous network protocol for routing will further simplify testing installation process and increase test facility reliability.  However, the realization of a practical autonomous facility test system requires the synthesis of several technologies. One must bring together knowledge in the fields of sensors, data processing, distributed systems, and networks. Mobitrum proposes to develop "an autonomous facility health-enabled test instrumentation" for characterization and measurement of ground test facilities.  The proposed device includes: (1) facility health-enabled sensor, (2) signal conditioning and analog-to-digital (digital-to-analog) conversion, (3) microprocessor, (4) on-board memory (e.g., Flash or EEPROM) for metadata storage and executable software, and (5) embedded network interfaces to create a powerful, scalable, re-configurable, and reliable distributed test instrument. Autonomous facility health-enabled test instrumentation is built upon an open-system architecture with standardized protocol modules easily to interface with industry standards.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Ground testing of propulsion systems is a critical requirement to enable NASA's New Vision for space exploration.  The proposed visual sensor test instrumentation will enable a cost effective remote testing and health monitoring through wireless sensor network. Mobitrum anticipates the following applications that NASA will benefit from the proposed technology: 1) Data analysis, processing, and visualization for Space exploration and Earth science observations, 2) Rocket engine test, 3) Remote test facility management, 4) Field communications device for spatial data input, manipulation and distribution, 5) Sensor, measurement, and field verification applications, 6) RFID for identification and tracking, 7) Condition-aware applications, 8) Location-aware applications, 9) Biometric identification applications. 10) Data collaboration and distribution applications, and 11) Wireless instrumentation for robotic manipulation and positioning for audio and visual capture, and real-time multimedia representation.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
We believe the application of smart embedded test data acquisition device will have tremendous potential for commercial market. That is because global revenues for smart pressure, flow, force/load, and temperature sensors with signal conditioning/amplification capability collectively totaled about $3.4 billion, according to SBD's latest data. We anticipate the embedded data acquisition and health-monitoring device will enable more home applications for energy control and security monitoring provided by Internet service providers through value-add services.  Commercial applications are: 1) Home control, 2) Energy management for cost saving, 3) Security (intruder detection), 4) Safety (sensing), 5) Utility ? remote meter reading, 6) Building automation systems ? real-time monitoring and control of security and surveillance systems, alarms, HVAC, etc., 7) Manufacturing and distribution ? industrial automation using RFID, 8) Health care ? wireless monitoring equipments.

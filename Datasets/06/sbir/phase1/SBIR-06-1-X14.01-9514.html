<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
ZIN Technologies, Inc. proposes a novel Miniature Treadmill with resistive exercise capability for use in spaceflight exercise countermeasures and broad terrestrial therapeutic applications. The treadmill device we propose will offer excellent periodic impact exercise to stimulate bone remodeling and cardiovascular activity as well as an added component of resistive exercise to encourage all-body muscle maintenance. The goal of this project is to demonstrate by design and analysis that the proposed treadmill will satisfy the stringent volumetric, power, and performance requirements demanded by lunar missions and provide the active feedback necessary to control the treadmill and display Daily Load Stimulus (DLS). We along with our partner the Cleveland Clinic believe that a hybrid compact exercise device along with the direct feedback of DLS is a unique and new approach that will provide a superior in space exercise system than ones currently in use on ISS. This project will culminate at the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) level having requirements defined and performance verified through analysis and technology demonstration on existing facilities. The technical aspects of the work can be divided into three key areas: Dual Track Treadmill Technology, Resistive Subject Loading Device, and Active Feedback Bio-Instrumentation.

With the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) calling for long term extended missions to the moon and Mars, there is a pressing need to equip astronauts with an effective exercise countermeasure system to maintain astronaut musculoskeletal health and ensure mission success. Countermeasures such as cycling, treadmill, resistive exercise, and rowing have been employed extensively on the International Space Station (ISS), however the space and power requirements will be much more stringent on lunar missions than on ISS. The treadmill design of this effort will aim to address the inherent challenges of spaceflight along with the specific implementation of the Daily Load Stimulus (DLS) theory to mange musculoskeletal health of astronauts.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The aging of our population will require exercise devices that manage musculoskeletal health in particular osteoporosis.  Osteoporosis is a major public health threat for an estimated 44 million Americans or 55 percent of the people 50 years of age and older. The proposed mini-treadmill exercise device with real-time Daily Load Stimulus (DLS) measurement has the potential to provide an effective mechanism to combat or manage osteoporosis. The patient would be provided by doctors with a prescribed amount of bone loading quantified by DLS that they should try to fill by running, jogging, or walking on a daily basis. The bio feedback device (BioWATCH-Pedar) worn by the subject would give the patient an indication of when they have achieved the required dosage. <br><br>

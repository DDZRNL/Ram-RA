<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Polyethylene-based composite materials are under consideration as multifunctional structural materials, with the expectation that they can provide radiation shielding, micrometeorite shielding, and pressure containment during interplanetary missions. While ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is the hardest known thermoplastic, its impact strength and wear resistance still pale in comparison to many other known materials. We propose composites of UHMWPE with these materials, with the expected outcome of increasing its ability to perform as a micrometeorite shield.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The technology developed on this project will be immediately useful for multifunctional radiation shielding/ micrometeorite shielding, a key need for manned interplanetary and lunar missions. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The technology has terrestrial applications in lightweight armor (for soldier and policemen, e.g.) and in long-lasting joint replacement materials (hips, etc.).

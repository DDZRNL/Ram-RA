<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Innovative data measurement/acquisition systems are needed to support future Earth System Science measurements of the Earth's atmosphere and surface. An adequate system must employ a high-speed, extra low power, linear, analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with high input bandwidth and accuracy, followed by a digital signal processor that is usually implemented inside a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Commercially available ADCs with input bandwidths larger than 1GHz feature high power consumption and latency, and poor linearity. With increasing ADC sampling rates, timing difficulties within the parallel interconnects between the ADC and the following FPGA become increasingly prominent. Therefore, a monolithic ADC incorporating a data converter that performs digital data demultiplexation and retiming is desired. To address these needs, the Advanced Science and Novel Technology Company proposes to develop a novel, extra low-power, extremely linear, under-sampling ADC featuring a high analog input bandwidth (>5GHz) that can easily interface to a following FPGA through a low-speed (<750Mb/s) parallel interface. To achieve this functionality, the proposed system-on-chip will utilize a proprietary sub-Nyquist front-end analog demultiplexer, a combinational ADC structure with proprietary gain-stabilization circuitry, and a digital signal processor implementing digital data demultiplexation and the company's proprietary data alignment scheme.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed approach promises to significantly reduce the power consumption of data measurement/acquisition systems utilized in future Earth System Science measurements, wireless satellite communication, software definable radio, and others. It will also deliver improved functionality that is required in homeland security and defense systems, as well as in multi-sensor flight control systems widely used by NASA, DOD and DOE.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The developed product will have many industrial applications areas; including the next generation of wireless ground stations, long-haul fiber optic communication, ultra-high-speed measurement instrumentation, space based radar, CDROM testing systems, and a variety of other applications. <br><br>

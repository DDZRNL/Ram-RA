<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
TPL Inc. proposes to develop a novel, high performance, nanostructured cathode material for lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries.  The proposed approach will modify lithium metal oxide cathode materials using proprietary nanostructured coatings to deliver improved cycle life and lower internal cell resistance for improved power delivery.  Preliminary experiments carried out at TPL already indicate the potential of this approach to deliver the desired improvements.  This Phase I effort will optimize the materials composition, processing and microstructure to deliver optimized performance.  The surface-modified cathode materials (SMCMs) will be utilized to fabricate Li-ion coin cell microbatteries that show significantly improved performance.  The nanostructured transition metal oxide particles will also impart faradaic pseudo-capacitance features to Li-ion batteries for high power and high energy applications, and structurally stabilize the cathode materials for longer cycle life.  These novel materials will enhance the performance of TPL's microbatteries that will provide a small, light weight power source for sensors in advanced observation platforms.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Batteries are indispensable in modern life.  The proliferation of wireless communication devices, portable computers, and entertainment is placing increasing demands on portable energy sources.  Indeed, battery performance is one of the most significant factors in determining customers' satisfaction with a product.  Furthermore, the increasing use of wireless sensors in industrial, scientific and consumer environments will require improved battery performance.  Finally, as the demand for electric or hybrid electric vehicles grows, batteries with increased energy and power densities as well as improved cycle life will be essential.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Search, analysis and display of NASA science data by non-GIS experts can be facilitated using so-called "Web 2.0" technologies. Google Maps is a popular geospatial service which exemplifies the use of such technologies. Browser-based client-side mashups and overlays of various kinds of data sources using technologies such as AJAX have been demonstrated using Google Maps. We propose to develop tools that will enable integration of NASA science data with Google Maps. These tools can then be extended to other map servers.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The first application will be overlay of data from the WMS server at NASA JPL. This includes mashup of data from MODIS and SRTM. The project will then develop a NASA science server that can provide other kinds of NASA data currently not being fed through the WMS server. This server will enable mashup of legacy science data that is stored in NASA databases but is not readily accessible to Google Maps clients. Thin-client browser-based display of NASA data using Google Maps will make NASA research more easily accessible to the general public and non-GIS experts.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The tools developed by the project will be useful in many non-NASA applications. One example is homeland security. Mashup of data such as real-time movement of first responders with Google Maps will enable the public to obtain information during emergencies. Many enterprises are setting up internal Web 2.0 application servers using Google Maps mashup of enterprise data stored in corporate servers. This project will facilitate creation of such application servers. The Department of Defense also will benefit from integration of their mapping services with Google Maps.

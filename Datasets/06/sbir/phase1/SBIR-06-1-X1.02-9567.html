<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Concept phase space-systems architecture evaluations typically use mass estimates as the primary means of ranking potential mission architectures. Software does not directly have physical mass and, as a result, is often left-out of such evaluations, despite the potential of being one of the main contributors to a mission's overall cost and risk. During NASA's Concept Exploration and Refinement (CE&R) program, personnel from MIT, Draper Laboratories, and Payload Systems Inc. developed a systems architecture software assessment approach that addresses both the early concept phases of a program and the complexities of critical embedded software systems. This approach uses a series of weighted software and human-computer interaction parameters that evaluate how a system's architecture affects software. Payload Systems Inc. proposes to validate this Systems Engineering Software Assessment Model for Exploration as the next step on the path to a tool that provides early, reliable ranking of systems architectures based on software. <br>The Phase I effort will focus on validation of this assessment tool. This validation will be based on embedded spaceflight systems projects. Once validated, this assessment approach will provide a basis, during Phase II, for the development of a Systems Engineering tool for assessing the impact candidate system architectures on software.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
This systems engineering software assessment was specifically aimed at elements of NASA's Exploration Initiative, where early decisions in systems development have a significant impact on the overall software development, maintenance, and human-computer interaction cost and risk. Additionally, this model is applicable for any number of NASA programs that require embedded software development, such as Constellation-X, the James Webb Space Telescope, and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
This systems engineering software assessment model is applicable to DoD and commercial projects that require modeling and assessments of embedded software development cost and risk and human-computer interaction costs and risks. These include aircraft avionics systems, medical instrumentation systems, optical communications monitoring systems, etc.

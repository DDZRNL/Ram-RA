<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
RL Associates, Inc. proposes to conduct research leading to the development of a shortwave infrared (SWIR) range-gated LIDAR system for use in detecting external obscurants and hazards.  Working in conjunction with a database of optical properties for known obscurants, the system will be capable of identifying the type and severity of the hazard.  While several different LIDAR ranging techniques are currently employed for airborne detection applications, the RL Associates Inc. hazard detection and mitigation system is based upon our patented range-gated technique used in our FireLidar system.  This technique allows not only detection of obscurants, but can also be used to image through obscurants and thus mitigate the hazard.  RL Associates Inc. is currently leading the industry in shortwave infrared (1.5 um) active imaging systems and plans to use that technology in developing the SWIR LIDAR Hazard Detection System.  This system will be compact and lightweight and will operate around 1.5 um, which is safe to the human eye.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA has a stated need to improve current hazard detection systems, automate more of the pilots workload as it relates to hazard analysis, and combine and simplify the many available detection techniques for different types of hazards.  The RL Associates, Inc. SWIR LIDAR system will identify airborne or ground hazards in the form of hard targets/obstacles or obscurant media, and provide feedback on the hazard type to the pilot.  This technology will fill NASA needs in programs requiring atmospheric hazard detection, surveillance, hazard assessment and imaging through obscurants.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
This technology will benefit government agencies including the Missile Defense Agency, for missile guidance systems, NavAir, for both airborne reconnaissance Lidar applications and targeting systems, and Homeland Security, for in-port or aerial surveillance systems.  Private sector applications include detection systems for commercial airlines and weather stations.

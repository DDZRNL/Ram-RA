<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
We propose to improve productivity of high performance computing for applications on multicore computers and clusters.  These machines built from one or more chips that may have from two to hundreds of cores on a chip or socket, are notoriously hard to program. Interactive Supercomputing's Star-P platform has been designed to meet this need but requires more components to fully deliver the dream of high performance computing.<br><br>We will work with NASA to develop the ability to reuse existing MPI and serial codes.   Software writers can then move forward by working in high productivity interactive languages such as Mathworks MATLAB. Star-P already has this general capability, but what is further needed are functional transformations from the language as it appears on the desktop.  In this work we will identify those transformations that will benefit NASA codes, and apply them first as a prototype in Phase I.  In Phase II we will complete the prototype fully automating what might be thought of as semi-automatic transformations. We will in addition widen the scope of NASA codes that will benefit from such productivity enhancement. As a synergistic activity, visits to NASA sites including   workshops are envisioned so that the work has maximum impact.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
We are collaborating with NASA scientists interested in the Stellar Image program as a test bed. We will work with the code suite available in OSCAR, a comprehensive modeling suite of software consisting of 318 separate modules, written in C, or C with MPI (Message Passing Interface).  While OSCAR is extremely powerful it is not easy to use as there is no GUI and using it requires calling the library of functions from C or C/MPI on a workstation or cluster computer respectively.  These limitations can be improved upon by porting OSCAR into Star-P.	<br>Such codes will be hooked in and compared with MATLAB and most importantly users will be able to continue forward with existing MPI codes and build further in the MATLAB language knowing they will reap the productivity benefits of the Star-P platform by reusing old codes and obtaining performance from new codes.<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
This project addresses the needs of scientists and engineers who wish to access the speed and memory capabilities of high performance computers, but do not possess a computer science background. High performance computing is increasingly used in a diverse group of life science, engineering, physical science, and mathematical domains. The proposed research allows applications developed in high-level languages for serial architectures to be easily transitioned to parallel high performance computing architectures. Given the growing importance of high performance computing, this research should have broad and deep impact in many scientific disciplines, and the mission of NASA as a whole.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
In this program, Agiltron and the groups of Professors Rubner and Cohen at MIT propose a novel nano-porous coating for next generation NASA UV anti-reflection (AR) applications. The collaborative research leverages recent breakthroughs in nano-porous self-assembled low reflective index multilayer structures achieved at MIT, and Agiltron's recently developed mist coating processes. The proposed UV AR coatings consist of inter-connected oxide nanoparticles in the form of a 3D nanoporous network and with a rough surface morphology. This AR coating is intended to have high UV AR performance with broadband and wide acceptance angle, high transparency, long environmental stability, high scratch and abrasion resistance, high mechanical integrity, and that has not previously been attained. More ideally, this coating  can be applied on large area glass and plastic substrates (polycarbonate, PMMA) using industry scale mist coating technology and low annealing temperature, leading to low fabrication cost. The feasibility of the proposed approach will be demonstrated in Phase I. In Phase II, we will test its applicability to plastic optical components, and evaluate AR performance, and scratch and abrasion resistance.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed coating technology has a potential to produce anti-reflection coatings for regions of the electromagnetic spectrum from UV to Visible to Far-IR/Sub-MM. It has been identified to be a acute technical need for several recognized future NASA space science missions, science measurement objective or science sensor for Discovery, Explorer, Beyond Einstein, Origins, GOESS, New Millennium, Landmark-Discovery, or Vision mission. This low reflective index coating can be easily applied on plastic optical components, which potentially enables next generation NASA telescopes and teleacope arrays with significantly reduced weight.<br><br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed nano-porous coating has dual functions of anti-reflection and anti-fogging, and will have a paramount impact on a wide spectrum of industrial technologies. Potential military dual use applications include Sun-Wind-Dust goggles, laser safety eye protective spectacles, chemical/ biological protective face masks, ballistic shields for explosive ordnance disposal personnel, and vision blocks for light tactical vehicles. There is a very high probability for commercialization for applications such as sport goggles, auto windshields, windows in public transit vehicles, armored cars for law enforcement and VIP protection, and solar panels and green-house enclosures.<br><br>

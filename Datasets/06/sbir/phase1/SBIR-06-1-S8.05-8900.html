<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
This Phase 1 proposal addresses the 2006 NASA SBIR Research Topic S8.05 Science Data Management and Visualization (GSFC).  The subtopic we address is Distributed Data Management and Access: Dynamically configurable high speed access to data distributed and shared over wide area high speed network environments.  We propose a novel offload engine NIC, with network connections scaling at n x 10Gbps increments.  The application is for present (10Gbps) and next generation NASA and commercial cluster and grid computing systems requiring ultra high-speed, low-cost offload engines with rates ranging from 10 through future rates of 100 Gbps full-duplex.<br>Successful completion of this Phase 1 project will prove feasibility of our innovation through architectural models, ultra high-speed logic simulations, and experimental results.  Deliverables include system on chip core IP, initial firmware, and feasibility results showing UDP/IP from 10 - 100 Gbps full-duplex, and the maximum bandwidth for a variant of TCP/IP.  We will also have the system design for our Phase 2 prototype system.  Using a 10 Gbps NPU development system, we conduct a preliminary demonstration of offload engine performance.  <br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Our system would accommodate network bandwidth needs for host offload engines used within NASA Science Data Centers, Cluster, and Grid computing applications for present 10 Gbps full-duplex offload, and for future bandwidths scaled to 100 Gbps.  Our novel offload engine NIC will be used for access to distributed and shared data applications including:<br>-  National Lambda Rail (NLR) applications such as<br> a. Recent GSFC use of the NLR with 10 Gigabit Ethernet per wavelength.<br> b. Distributed services and data using Optiputer<br> c. Compatibility with GSFC networks and Science Data Centers that  <br>    ultimately tie into NLR.<br>-  Enabling NASA Applications across Heterogeneous High Performance Networks, where multiple 10Gbps connections to DRAGON are used.<br>-  NCCS and other GSFC Science Data facilities with CPU's linked to systems including multiple 10-GE ports, and to networks aggregated in multiples of 10GigE  <br>-  Supporting new protocol variations of UDP and TCP <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Successful completion of this project, through Phase 3, would allow us to provide an offload engine NIC product suitable for the commercial sector Grid computing market. The resulting system-on-chip intellectual property (core IP) could be marketed to offload engine manufacturers.  The IP would save existing offload engine firms design time, design cost, and provide excellent time-to-market.  Additional customers would include motherboard and systems manufacturers that require offload engine NIC's or system-on-chips for their motherboards, such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Dell.  IP distribution channels and sales could also be through system-on-chip providers.  National laboratories requiring ultra high-speed cluster and grid computing offload engines could also benefit from NASA's investment in our innovation.  Raytheon has provided a letter of endorsement, for use in their future Grid and radar systems applications.<br>

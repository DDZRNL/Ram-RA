<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
NASA will return to the IIS by 2014 and the moon by 2020.  To accomplish these missions, NASA will exploit to the maximum degree possible the Apollo architecture and especially the lessons learned and technological advances that have occurred over the intervening 40 years in building robust, cost effective, efficient, and, partly reusable launch, lander, explorer, and resupply vehicles.  In support of this effort, Technology Assessment & Transfer (TA&T) proposes to develop a magnesium metal matrix composite (MMC) for use as aerospace structural members.  This material exhibits three times the specific stiffness of the best aluminum-lithium alloys and two times that of PMCs.  TA&T will demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of a low temperature method for achieving high loading of ceramic particles in a magnesium matrix that will enable a cast or extruded structural material of non-uniform cross-section exhibiting the unusual combination of light weight, high specific stiffness and strength, radiation shielding, and low cost.  The MMC will be protected from corrosion by a unique thin film coating designed specifically to prevent corrosion of aluminum and magnesium alloys.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
	NASA went to the moon with 1960s technology.  The President's Vision program will use technology developed during the intervening 40+ years.  NASA is proposing to use technology at least TRL-6.  Thus, NASA cannot develop all the needed technology internally ? it will have to use technology developed outside of agency funded research.  Magnesium MMCs promises to provide performance characteristics in many areas comparable if not superior to advanced polymer composites, ceramic matrix composites, fiber composites, high performance light weight alloy systems, light weight refractory alloys, hybrid material systems, multifunctional material systems, nano-structured materials.  Thus, continued research to expand the global metal matrix market should profoundly impact future NASA mission.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The potential commercial market for magnesium MMCs is staggering.  The global market predicted for all MMCs predicts a growth rate of 6.3% dominated by the automotive industry as the demand for fuel efficiency compels lighter cars and trucks.  It has been predicted that China represents the fastest growing market for MMCs.  Magnesium MMCs have been restricted by the difficulty of achieving high loading and by corrosion.  The solution of those two problems removes both impediments to market entry.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
We propose to develop a compact handheld longwave infrared camera based on quantum well infrared photodetector (QWIP) focal plane array (FPA) technology.  Based on the photoexcitation of electrons out of quantum wells of GaAs sandwiched between AlGaAs barriers, QWIP FPAs have emerged as a promising new candidate for longwave infrared imaging and spectroscopy, offering superb sensitivity, pixel operability and uniformity, adjustable spectral response (3-20 microns), and extension to large formats.  We will DELIVER a prototype camera at the end of Phase 1 so that NASA can test it in the field for its applications.  In Phase 2, we will tailor the spectral response of the detector array to 8-12 microns, expand its format to 1Kx1K, and package and deliver the resulting wideband camera to NASA for spectroscopic/imaging studies in this spectral range.

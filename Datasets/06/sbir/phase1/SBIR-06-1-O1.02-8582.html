<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
This proposal is for a flexible navigation system for deep space operations that does not require <br>GPS measurements. The navigation solution is computed using an Unscented Kalman Filter that <br>can accept any combination of range, planet chordwidth, and angle measurements using any ce- <br>lestial object. The UKF employs a full nonlinear dynamical model of the orbit including gravity models and disturbance models. The filter will estimate both states and parameters. The integrated system employs a sensor that uses novel image processing to extract planetary chordwidths. The extra-solar system body sensor will employ band limiting imaging with the band selected to maximize reliable autonomous object identification.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
This system can be used for navigation of any manned or unmanned spacecraft in any orbit. The Unscented Kalman Filter can be used for any navigation system including satellite and aircraft.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
This system could be used for the orbit transfer of commercial communications satellites. The Unscented Kalman Filter can be used for any navigation system including automobile, truck, train and spacecraft.

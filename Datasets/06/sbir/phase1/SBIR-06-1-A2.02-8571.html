<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
We propose to develop a Multi-Element Lean Direct Injection, ME-LDI, Combustion concept with the following innovative features:<br>1.	Independent, mini burning zones created by containing the flame in a cylinder downstream of each fuel injector/swirler element in a multiple fuel injector array, see figure 1.  The independent burning zones will enable fuel staging the fuel injectors (turning off fuel to selected fuel injectors) to cover the operating cycle, such that at each point of the operating cycle the combustor will have high combustion efficiency (>99%) and low NOx emissions. At high power conditions the combustion efficiency should be greater than 99.9%.<br>2.	A low flow number, "Butterfly" fuel injector will be incorporated into ME-LDI that is low cost and simple to manufacture but a highly effective atomizer.  The term "Butterfly" derives from the butterfly shape of the spray.  The shape of the spray is formed by two diametrically opposed slots cut through a closed end fuel tube, see figure 2.  The fuel flow through each slot forms a fan spray.  The slot width can be varied to control drop-sizes within the spray.   <br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
In the course of the development of the concept it is planned to use laser diagnostics to measure droplet sizes from the fuel injector, fuel distribution, air and fuel droplet velocities and turbulence levels.  This data would be made available to NASA for computer model development.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
We propose that the initial application would be for small business and personal jets and regional jet aircraft gas turbine engines.  The proposed concept would provide a low emissions combustor that would be economical to build and low cost to maintain.  Small engines are particularly sensitive to cost and this concept should appeal to small engine manufacturers.  It is a developing market and should be receptive to new ideas.

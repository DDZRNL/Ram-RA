<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The objective is to develop and demonstrate the use of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) for computations of gas turbine combustor flow and transport processes, using the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations on Cartesian grids with local mesh refinement and multigrid acceleration. The basic software for the coupled multigrid algorithm will be developed and demonstrated on simple flows. A Cartesian grid generator, capable of converting complex geometry into an unstructured Cartesian mesh, will be developed. These LES and numerical methods will then be applied to representative gas turbine combustor flows.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The major outcome of the SBIR research program will be an advanced, high performance LES code that will enable detailed studies of combustor performance, with particular emphasis on combustor emissions prediction and reduction. Strong demand by the aircraft engine and power generation turbine industries is anticipated, due to the inevitable reductions in pollutant emissions for these products. This will support NASA's aeronautics programs in many aspects of simulation for aerodynamic and reacting flows.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Outside the aircraft engine and power turbine industries, a wide variety of flow aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and combustion modeling problems will be simulated using the new code. In particular, unsteady flows in bio-medical devices, automotive flows, alternate propulsion systems such as rocket, ramjets and scramjets, combustion system components such as augmentors, and pollutant dispersal are a few of the types of problems that can be solved through use of the new LES solver.

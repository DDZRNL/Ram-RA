<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Optical tracking and identification sensors have numerous NASA and non-NASA applications. For example, airborne or spaceborne imaging sensors are used to visualize and track vehicles during launch and landing operations. Existing identification and tracking sensors cannot meet some of the advanced performance requirements including wide field of view (FOV) for panoramic situation awareness, high spatial resolution for detailed object shape discrimination, high spectral resolution for object material signature recognition, and fast response for transit event or moving objects tracking and identification, as well as low weight, volume and power requirements, et al. There is a demand to investigate innovative and unconventional optical or hyperspectral imaging systems to enhance the ability of today's tracking and identification systems for NASA as well as non-NASA applications. New Span Opto-Technology Inc. proposes herein a novel optical configuration that is capable of simultaneously providing wide FOV hyperspectral imaging for object detection and high spatial resolution in areas of interest without mechanical scanning for precise object recognition, positioning and tracking. In Phase I we will establish the model, demonstrate the feasibility, and recognize challenging issues of the proposed concept.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Optical imaging sensors will have numerous applications for NASA space exploration. The proposed concept if implemented will improve performance of those existing systems including enhancing both spatial and spectral discrimination abilities. For example, direct to this solicitation topic, the performance improved sensor will be able to use for visualizing and tracking vehicles during launch and landing operations. They will provide a wealth of detailed information that can be used both in real time and in subsequent accident analyses. Object tracking and identification sensors have other NASA applications include robotic perception and mapping for unmanned space operations on satellites and space shuttles, tacking and identification of orbit or space debris or other man-made objects, remote detecting and tracking of objects movement on the Earth from space vehicles or balloons, et al. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The successful development of  performance improved hyperspectral imaging sensor will benefit to non-NASA applications include DOD and public security applications ranging from missile defense, weapon and sensor platform guidance, wide area surveillance, aero-vehicle rendezvous and docking, navigation and guidance, criminal prevention, drug enforcement and homeland defense (border control) activities, et al. Additionally, this kind of imaging sensor could support a variety of industrial applications, such as quality control, mechanical parts inspection, and non-destructive evaluation, et al.

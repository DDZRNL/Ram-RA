<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Communications security (COMSEC) is essential to satellite communications.  Its role continues to grow as the available bandwidth expands to meet the ever increasing strategic and tactical data requirements of the 21st century. NASA's exploration of planetary surfaces will require a communication architecture that supports operational capabilities in which assets can communicate seamlessly and securely to coordinate exploration as well as communicate back to Earth. <br><br>The flexibility and pervasiveness of the internet, including the transition to IPV6, is already being extended to military space assets ? e.g. the global grid. NASAs adoption of these same standards appears likely. The specific problem addressed by the Aeronix Phase I SBIR is to identify and develop modifications to our existing High Assurance Advanced Security Module (ASM) solution that satisfy the NASA networking requirements. <br><br>The innovation of the proposed solution is the development of an unclassified IP based network encryptor that is compatible with commercially available ground based HAIPE equipment operating with Suite B algorithms and the ability to operate in the presence of failures caused by the harsh environment of space.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The technology developed under this SBIR can enable multiple NASA commercial applications.  The following examples are a few of the potential applications:<br>- TT&C HAIPE compliant IP encryptor for ground to satellite communications<br>- HAIPE compliant IP encryptor for space based networks <br>- Low power encryptor for Manned communication devices for planetary and lunar exploration<br>- Un-manned wireless network encryptor device for rover and sensor applications<br>- Orbital relay encryptor for lunar to ground transmissions<br>-High altitude to ground Earth encryptor for wireless networks <br>- Airborne encryptor<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The technology developed under this SBIR can enable multiple non-NASA commercial applications including the following: <br>- DoD TT&C HAIPE IP encryptor applications<br>- DoD space based network systems such as TSAT<br>- DoD ground based (hardened) networking applications requiring radiation tolerance<br>- Radiation tolerant IP encryptor appliances for the nuclear power industry for environments in which radiation could occur planned and unplanned<br>

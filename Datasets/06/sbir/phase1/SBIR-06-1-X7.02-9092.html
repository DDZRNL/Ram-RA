<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Turbogizmo, LLC will develop new software technology for Human-System Interaction (HSI) for NASA that increases performance and reduces the risk of conducting manned exploration missions.  This HSI technology combines intelligent software agents, decision support systems and perceptual interfaces to facilitate human collaboration with robotic and autonomous systems while supporting the use of augmented cognition models. This will provide the optimal configuration of multi-modal user interfaces to improve performance and safety during critical mission operations. Future exploration missions will involve greater information availability for crewmembers and enhancements to EVA systems will provide visual information for situational awareness. HSI technology that manages the exchange of information between Human and Robotic or Autonomous systems using augmented cognition models will result in reduced cognitive load caused by inappropriate information while minimizing the effort required when interacting with autonomous systems. Turbogizmo proposes to develop a service-based architecture for configuring a suite of multi-modal HCI technologies based on operational scenarios, evaluation of perceptual interfaces with cost/value propositions for interface configurations. This framework will be validated by experimentation and demonstration This technology will close a critical technology gap by enabling improved interaction for exploration crewmembers performing routine and contingency operations.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Software Tools that Control a Framework of Perceptual Interfaces and Visual Display Systems for Human-System Interaction with Robotic and Autonomous Systems are a critical tool that has been missing from mobile, wireless and pervasive information technology. As miniaturization and wireless technology has improved and user demographics have increased, the usefulness has been limited by the requirement of using not only the hands to operate, but also the heavy cognitive load placed on the user to interact with the visual information delivered. Often the information is delivered during a critical tasks causing an interruption and lowering performance or imposing a risk to task or safety. Our technology, once developed for commercialization, will enable the use of hands-free perceptual interfaces for controlling and managing the information flow essential to mobile work task improvements and optimal efficiency with less risk than experienced today.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Most appropriate to the commercialization of technology developed for this topic will be the applications for use by first responders for homeland security and public safety officials for hazard mitigation during local emergency situations. HSI with visual information display technology can provide users with improved access to visual information such as procedures, checklists, technical drawings, images and training materials. This allows workers to access visual information even while they are engaged in demanding tasks in mobile environments.  HSI for robotic and autonomous system collaborations will enable increased use of robotic assets for dangerous tasks to provide increased public safety and industrial productivity.<br>Commercialization opportunities include the following market sectors:<br>?	Public Safety: Firefighters, Police, Military, Security, Search and Rescue, Hazard Mitigation<br>?	Industrial: Construction, Repair, Training, Inspection, Inventory, Logistics, Safety<br>?	Commercial: IT for the Office, Sales, Marketing, Insurance, Analysis, Network<br>?	Consumer: Shopping, Travel, Entertainment, Education, Security, Correspondence, Finance<br>

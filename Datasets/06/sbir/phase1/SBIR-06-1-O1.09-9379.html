<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
A novel approach is proposed for very efficient, very reliable, low weight, wide-bandgap medium power SSPAs for Space applications operating at 400 MHz and 8GHz.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Power amplifiers are critical components in all communications and radar transmitters. Improved power output and power-added efficiency will aid performance of  transmitters and reduce the size of the payload.  Such power amplifiers will be found useful in all space-borne platforms with limited allocation for size and weight for component parts. The end product of the proposed program, therefore, will have applications in space-borne transponders, earth and space exploration radars, radio-frequency spectrometers, radiometers, and others. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
WBG devices offer higher power output, higher efficiency, and tolerance to higher temperature.  Amplifiers made of WBG devices will ultimately replace amplifiers made GaAs devices used in many commercial communication systems.  Those systems include: wireless infrastructure, to satellite ground terminals, point-to-point radios, etc. The projected number of terminals for those systems adds up to millions, representing a large market comparable to cellular and personal communication systems bands.

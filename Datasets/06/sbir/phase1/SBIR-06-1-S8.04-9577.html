<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
TerraMetrics, Inc., proposes an SBIR Phase I R/R&D program to investigate and develop a key web services architecture that provides data processing, storage and delivery capabilities and enables successful deployment, display and visual interaction of diverse, massive, multi-dimensional science datasets within popular web-based geospatial platforms like Google Earth, Google Maps, NASA's World Wind and others. The proposed innovation exploits the use of a wired and wireless, network-friendly, wavelet-compressed data format and server architecture that extracts and delivers appropriately-sized blocks of multi-resolution geospatial data to client applications on demand and in real time. The resulting format and architecture intelligently delivers client-required data from a server, or multiple distributed servers, to a wide range of networked client applications that can build a composite, user-interactive 3D visualization of fused, disparate, geospatial datasets. The proposed innovation provides a highly scalable approach to data storage and management while offering geospatial data services to client science applications and a wide range of client and connection types from broadband-connected desktop computers to wireless cell phones. TerraMetrics offers to research the feasibility of the proposed innovation and demonstrate it within the context of a live, server-supported, Google Earth-compatible client application with high-density, multi-dimensional NASA science data.

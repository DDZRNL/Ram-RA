<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
This SBIR Phase I proposal introduces a fast speed bandwidth controllable tunable filter for hyper-/multi-spectral (HS/MS) imagers.  It dynamically passes a variable narrow band spectral component (li) from the visible to Infrared (IR).  The filter has the following projected specifications: >95% in-band transmittance, <0.1% out-band leakage, >1,000 nm tuning range, a few to hundred nanometer variable bandwidth, 0.05 ms/nm tuning speed, large optical aperture size (10² ' 10² possible), and excellent environment stability against temperature fluctuation, mechanical impact and vibration. These performance characteristics, particularly the variable bandwidth, are not reachable for both commercial products on-the-shelf and state-of-the-art technologies. This filter is a vital enabling component for many photonics instruments such as multi- and hyper-spectral imaging system, Ladar/Lidar, mine detector, and optical beam steerer for tracking, ranging, measure and free-space optical communication. <br><br>The Phase I objective is to demonstrate the feasibility for the tunable filter while the Phase II objective is to optimize the filter through which prototype filter(s) will be developed.  The success of this project will open a new era for manufacturing tunable band-pass filters with the desired performance characteristics.  <br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
This tunable filter will be mainly integrated into NASA spectral imaging systems as an initial attempt for NASA application in visible and infrared planetary mapping which is a complementary tool to VIMS-V, ASAS, and AVIRIS.  Because of the novel tunable filter, the resulted hyperspectral (HS) and/or multispectral (MS) imaging systems have the advantages in imaging spectral bandwidth tailoring, efficiency, speed, size, weight, and power consumption over its counter-part instruments.  The imager also helps with problems of motion blur, etc. from moving targets.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The filter will be mainly used in spectral imaging systems that have wide industrial and military applications to include the following.  Biomedical applications to map fluorescence of biological tissue; Forensics and counterfeit detection; Color inspection and sorting to spectroradiometrically accurate color measurements and color uniformity determination, which can accurately be converted to the CIE color space, pixel by pixel, for quality inspection in manufacturing and color matching of parts; Paper industry: to acquire snapshot moisture profiles across paper web in paper machine; Pharmaceutical industry: to detect foreign pills based on their chemical composition in pharmaceutical production; Earth remote sensing for geology (e.g., mineral identification) and forestry (e.g., stress detection) monitoring among the prominent usages; Agriculture for early detection of localized problems in crops that can be corrected by local treatment; Environmental monitoring to detect hazardous organic compounds within the atmosphere; and Food online inspection to detect bruises during fruit packing; inspect tomatoes, rice grains, seeds, or meats; or determine whether food products are sufficiently cooked.

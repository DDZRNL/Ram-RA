<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The proposed project consists of developing a prototype exciter/igniter unit that can operate to a subset of expected flight performance requirements.  The main focus of this development effort will be the physical integration of a small, compact exciter with a "flight like" igniter or spark plug.  This exciter/igniter prototype will represent the exciter/igniter units used to generate sparks that ignite fuels in engines and propulsion systems.  The development of this prototype unit will follow a phased approach covering design, development, analysis, assembly, test and verification.  This prototype will represent a "stand alone" integrated unit capable of providing ionizing voltage greater than 20 kV for a spark energy of 45 to 50 mJ at a rate of 200-300 sparks per second.  The proposed prototype will integrate both the exciter electronics and an igniter (spark plug) to demonstrate "end-to-end" functionality.  Additionally, the integrated unit will be as compact as possible.  The implications of the proposed project are for space and weight savings in the overall development of green propulsion systems as applicable to research projects in Exploration Systems and specifically applicable to Topic X9 Propulsion and Propellant Storage.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The potential NASA applications are for the development of fast, high energy spark exciters and spark plugs required to support any propulsion systems. Further, potential applications exist for the development of non-toxic (green) propulsion systems.  As a specific example, the proposed exciter can be used to support the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV).  The CEV has been proposed with GOX ethanol or GOX GCH4, both requiring exciter/igniter units that can produce more spark energy.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Potential non-NASA applications are reduced size & weight with improved performance of automobile, watercraft and aircraft engines.  Additionally, applications exist to support the development of Department of Defense (DoD) propulsion systems.

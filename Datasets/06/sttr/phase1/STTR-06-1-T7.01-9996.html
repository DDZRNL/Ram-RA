<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
In this proposal, we describe a program to demonstrate the technical feasibility of a high-performance, cost-effective and robust microwave receiver for the detection of laser-generated ultrasound for NDE. Our innovative receiver is based on the integration of a microwave interferometer coupled with a pulsed laser to generate the ultrasound. By using a microwave interferometer design we will be able to overcome the limitation generally associated with classical optical receiver: 1) Inability to work in harsh environment where thermal and mechanical perturbations are present; 2) Reduction in sensitivity caused by the speckle nature of the light reflected from rough surfaces; 3) High system cost due the price of the different lasers, optics and engineering to develop an optical system working in a harsh environment and 4) high maintenance cost (Lasers and optics need to be checked, maintained and re-aligned frequently).

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed system will be designed to satisfy the size, weight and power requirements for NDE systems to be embarked during space mission. The primarily target is the NDE during space flight, but it will also be applicable to on-the-ground NDE. Potential NASA applications covers a variety of NDE inspection needs, including the detection of subsurface inclusions and surface breaking cracks, the inspection of wiring and detection of cracks in the insulation, characterization of coating materials and bonding properties. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The nondestructive testing market is large and complex, with many available techniques serving a large number of industries. According to recent market surveys, the 1997 world NDT market is on the order of $1B. Laser/microwave ultrasonic testing fits an important niche in the metal forming, paper, glass and semiconductor manufacture, aerospace, automotive, chemical and power generation industries. Laser/microwave ultrasonic is an asset for process control, in-service inspection and post-processing in-line inspection. In process wall-thickness measurement of seamless tubing, approximately 910,000 tons of seamless tube was produced in US in year 2000. Recent study shows that if all the companies in US adopt online laser ultrasonic measurement system for process control, this would result in a saving of $234 million annually, equivalent to 26% savings and an annual energy saving of 5%.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The team proposes to develop an onboard, real-time health management capability that monitors a flight control system (for spacecraft, fixed or rotary wing aircraft) in a highly dynamic environment and responds to anomalies with suggested recovery or mitigation actions. The goal of the proposed capability is to take system/component level health status information and aggregate this information across all channels and subsystems to the flight control system for anomaly mitigation, failure accommodation, and control re-configuration, based on mission objectives. In Phase I, the research will be focused on a preliminary design of the component-to-system health capability correlation and the anomaly mitigation strategy. In Phase II, the team will conduct a prototype demonstration for a relevant space vehicle as the target application.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The most important NASA application of these technologies lies in the myriad of systems that encompass the Crew Exploration Vehicle, which will be reused for multiple missions.  The potential for degradation and wear for linear actuators of the sort being discussed here is real and must be accounted for in the controls design.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The underlying integrated systems health management technology is applicable to a truly wide range of potential civil applications.  SMI has been aggressive in pursuing applications of Health Management technologies, including potential applications for reconfigurable control techniques described in this proposal. Our preliminary analysis of the relevant market segments includes the following: Fleet dispatch reliability, Shipping vehicles, Construction vehicles, Power plants, Wind turbines, Solar energy equipment, Oil rigs, Refineries, Semi-conductors, Precision tooling.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The bone loss associated with extended space missions in astronaut represents a serious health threat, both over the flight period and upon returning to gravitational fields. Continuously monitoring bone qualities during prolonged space missions will lead to a better understanding of the progressive adaptation of bone loss in astronauts subject to both microgravity and aging, and the ensuing musculoskeletal complications such as osteoporosis. In this proposal, Boston Applied Technologies Incorporated (BATi), collaborated with University of Florida, proposes a portable and noninvasive ultrasound measurement apparatus for rapid assessment of human bone densities. With our unique approach and algorithm, the proposed device will have greater measurement accuracy and sensitivity than those of other noninvasive techniques. In addition, the self-calibration feature of the instrument will assure the diagnostic methodology to be accurate, fast, and simple.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Application of the proposed high performance device would find tremendous applications in NASA missions. The development effort of this program will directly result in a space applicable apparatus for noninvasively monitoring astronaut bone density that maximizes diagnostic capability during long-duration space flights or analog missions. Another potential application of the proposed technology will allow scientists to do research easier than ever on understanding and mitigating the adverse effects of space environment on astronaut health and performance by measuring bone density, because bone loss is the second highest risk factor (after radiation) of long-duration space flight. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The potential for this apparatus in commercial clinical practice is also enormous. It can be directly used to help diagnose osteoporosis. It can also be used in common families, emergency rooms in hospitals and health clinics as a quick and fast detection tool for bone assessment.

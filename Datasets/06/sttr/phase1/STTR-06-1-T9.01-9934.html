<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
We propose here to develop tunable diode laser spectroscopy as a diagnostic for the Space Shuttle main engines during test stand operations. These engines represent the state-of-the-art in rocket engine propulsion systems, and as such, they stretch available technology to the limit. The engines must be test-fired through several cycles prior to incorporation into the shuttle for flight operations. Diagnostic tests for the engines are extremely limited due to the harsh nature of the environment. We propose to develop diode laser instrumentation in order to measure temperature, velocity, surface erosion, and possibly efficiency in real time with an update rate of up to 1 kHz. The system technology will be based on wavelength multiplexed tunable diode laser spectroscopy which Zolo and Stanford have jointly developed to diagnose many types of aeropropulsion systems including SCRAMJETs, augmentors, and pulsed detonation engines. This project represents the first time that the wavelength-multiplexed technology will be tested on full-scale rocket engines.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
In addition to the specific application targeted in this proposal (SSME test stand diagnotics), the proposed system will be useful for monitoring temperature, flow velocity, and species concentrations in a number of flow facilties that NASA maintains and can be used for other engine tests as well. Examples of facilities that can use the type of diagnostic capabilities proposed include arcjet driven wind tunnels (NASA Ames and NASA JSC), and hypersonic wind tunnels (NASA Langley, ATK/GASL and AEDC). Other applications include aeroengine test facilties at NASA Glenn and low gravity combustion facilties at NASA Glenn. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed research activity involves the development of a ground test measurement system that can be used to monitor and diagnose aeropropulsion-related combustion phenomena. Similar systems have been used to monitor combustion-driven, high-speed flow facilities, SCRAMJET engines, jet angine augmentors, gas turbine and pulsed detonation engines. We are also working to miniaturize the equipment for embedded flight applications. The ultimate goal of our aeropropulsion efforts is to develop TDLAS-based in-flight sensors for feedback control of engines in order to maximize efficiency, minimize pollution, and increase engine on-wing availability by functioning as an engine health monitor. The market for such sensors will be extremely large, and the proposed program is one step along the way to this ultimate goal.

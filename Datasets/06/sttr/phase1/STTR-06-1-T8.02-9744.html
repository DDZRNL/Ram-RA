<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Science and Technology Applications, LLC's (STA) vision for a versatile space propulsion system is a highly throttleable, high performance, and cost effective Liquid Oxygen/Hydrogen engine utilizing innovative design and manufacturing processes to simultaneously meet NASA's Space Exploration requirements. To that end, an innovative injector element concept is proposed consisting of axial flow coaxial injectors with pintle center post. This element concept is expected to provide deep throttle capability while maintaining performance over the entire range. Cold flow tests will be performed to characterize mixing and atomization distribution.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA's Space Exploration program requires deep throttleable and high performance space propulsion system for moon and space station missions. Such technology can used for automated<br>rendezvous and docking infrastructure to support commercial space development. Also, it can protect docking of commercial SATs and/or payloads to the space station. Additionally, deep throttle engines may be used for descend applications either in space (e.g. landing on the moon) or on earth.<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Deep throttle engines are very attractive to reusable systems. The Affordable Responsive Spacelift (ARES) program at SMC is considering fly-back technologies for the first stage. At this time, no technologies exist for a slow, low Q return path back to the launch site. Jet engines are viable options however, add operational complexity and maintenance to the system. A high performance, deep throttle propulsion system will be a very attractive alternative for the ARES vehicle. If particular interest will be duel use of the propulsion system; boost and return to base.

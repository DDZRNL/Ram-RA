<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Coastal environments vital to our nation are strongly impacted by natural and human factors and are also sensitive to global climate change.  A need exists for innovative new field measurement technologies to support NASA's remote sensing efforts in coastal regions.  Two specific subjects of interest include the air quality in coastal regions and algal blooms.  We proposed to develop for commercialization a Quantum Fingerprint<SUP>TM</SUP> sensor based on a sapphire substrate that can be used for both even though they are not closely related.  For air quality measurement in the coastal environment we will use the flexible QF<SUP>TM</SUP> technology to simultaneously detect, discriminate, and quantify levels of SOx and NOx.  This flexibility, which arises from the unique set of energy levels created by the interaction of each species with the sensor, will also allow the same sensor to detect and monitor algal blooms by keying on their characteristic gaseous emissions.  Thus, arrays of QF<SUP>TM</SUP> sensors, both on and off shore, could simultaneously monitor coastal air quality and track algal blooms.  Our goal is to assess how well two relatively different applications might be served by a single type of QF<SUP>TM</SUP> sensor when they occur in the same geographic area.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The potential NASA and non-NASA commercial applications of the Quantum Fingerprint<SUP>TM</SUP> technology overlap significantly.  In general, the QF<SUP>TM</SUP> concept is potentially useful for the detection, discrimination, identification, and quantitative measurement of trace species concentrations in a wide variety of complex and/or difficult environments.  More specific NASA application areas might include use as a general research tool, spacecraft environmental and limit monitoring, terrestrial and non-terrestrial atmospheric analysis in extremes of temperature and/or pressure, combustion analysis, hazmat monitoring, and health monitoring of mission personnel among others.  Key to this wide range of possible applications is the compact, highly flexible and readily adaptable, solid-state nature of the QF<SUP>TM</SUP> technology.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The potential NASA and non-NASA commercial applications of the Quantum Fingerprint<SUP>TM</SUP> technology overlap significantly.  In general, the QF<SUP>TM</SUP> concept is potentially useful for the detection, discrimination, identification, and quantitative measurement of trace species concentrations in a wide variety of complex and/or difficult environments.  More specific non-NASA application areas might include automotive exhaust monitoring, urban air quality monitoring, manufacturing process analysis, environmental/weather monitoring, water quality monitoring and assessment, healthcare monitoring and analysis, food supply monitoring, system performance evaluations based on emissions, defense, homeland security, and many others.  Key to this wide range of non-NASA applications is the compact, highly flexible and readily adaptable, solid-state nature of the QF<SUP>TM</SUP> technology.

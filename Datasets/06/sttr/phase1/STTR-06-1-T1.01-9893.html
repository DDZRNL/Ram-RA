<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
In order to meet the challenges of long-duration space exploration (e.g., missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond), onboard real-time health management of spacecraft that responds rapidly to system and subsystem events is essential.  In response to this need, Qualtech Systems, Inc. (QSI), in cooperation with Vanderbilt University, proposes to develop a distributed multi-agent fault diagnosis and reconfiguration control (FDR) approach for addressing the health management problem.  The proposed solution uses "intelligent" schemes to coordinate local health assessments of multiple interconnected subsystems ("local diagnosers") to a convergent and correct global system health assessment.  In addition, the solution recommends relevant system recovery functions based on fault isolation information and fault severity estimates.  Design of local diagnosers for subsystem health assessment utilizes a combination of both model-based and data-driven diagnostic methods in an integrated development environment for accurate root cause isolation.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed solution offers distributed multi-agent fault diagnosis and reconfiguration control capabilities for mission critical systems.  The advantage of this technology is that it utilizes both model-based and data-driven techniques, hence drawing on the best of both approaches.  The solution will help NASA diagnostic system designers to experiment different fault diagnostic techniques and evaluate the system diagnostic performance, such as computational complexity and efficiency, online/offline and fault isolation rate.  It also allows the reconfiguration controller design after the fault diagnosis.  This integrated development environment will facilitate the diagnostic system design to meet the challenge of long-duration space exploration.  Important systems such as spacecraft, space stations, lunar and planetary bases, etc. will benefit from the proposed technology with increased reliability and safety.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed technology will have wide applications beyond NASA.  Such complex systems as commercial and military aircraft, ground transportation, communications systems, power generation systems, etc., could all benefit tremendously from the proposed technology.  The proposed solution offers a distributed fault diagnosis and reconfiguration control and an integrated develop environment that can provide designing and evaluating diagnostic systems for these distributed networked systems.  The integrated solution will also significantly shorten the proto-type design cycle for commercial diagnostic systems.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The innovation proposed here is a computational framework for high performance, high fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to enable accurate, fast and robust simulation of unsteady turbulent, reacting or non-reacting flows involving real or ideal fluids.  This framework will provide a state-of-the-art unsteady turbulent flow simulation capability by laying the foundation for the incorporation of Hybrid RANS-LES (HRLES) methods which are a blend of Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approaches.  This design and analysis tool will be built on a currently existing solver called Loci-STREAM which has been developed by the proposing firm under funding from NASA over the last four years.  The work proposed here will result in a state-of-the-art design and analysis tool to enable the accurate modeling of small valves, turbopumps, combustion devices, etc. which constitute critical components of versatile space propulsion engines with deep throttling capability as part of NASA's Vision for Space Exploration Mission.  Of particular relevance to NASA, this design and analysis tool will provide improved understanding and quantification of the time-varying, reacting flow environments in the thrust chamber assembly of space propulsion engines.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The outcome of Phase I and Phase II research activities will be a powerful CFD-based design and analysis tool (called LOCI-STREAM-HRLES) for propulsion engines.  At NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), Loci-STREAM is envisioned to be a powerful design and analysis tool for propulsion devices including full rocket engine simulations, injector design, turbopump and valve design, etc.  At NASA Stennis Space Center (SSC) Loci-STREAM will be very useful for the Rocket Propulsion Testing program with applications in rocket engine exhaust plumes, discharge and/or combustion of hot O2 or H2 from rocket engine components being tested, flow of liquids and supercritical fluids through piping system components such as valves and run tanks.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The computational tool resulting from this project will have wide-ranging commercial applications.  The Hybrid RANS-LES methodology can be used for a wide variety of engineering applications involving unsteady turbulent flows.  The reacting flow capability can be used for simulating combusting flows in various industrial applications, such as gas turbine engines, diesel engines, etc.  The real-fluids methodology can be used in a large number of industrial flow situations involving both chemically inert and reacting flows.  With future additions of other combustion and multi-phase models, the applicability of Loci-STREAM can be further broadened.

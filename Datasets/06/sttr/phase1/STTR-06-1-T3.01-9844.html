<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The goal of this STTR program is to employ nanostructured materials in advanced device designs to enhance the tolerance of solar cells to extreme conditions while achieving high solar electric power conversion.  By using InN-based quantum dots embedded within a higher band gap GaN barrier material, a larger fraction of the solar spectrum can be harnessed while minimizing the effects of high temperatures and high-energy radiation with this promising photovoltaic device.  The wide range of energies accessible to InN-based materials provides a unique flexibility in designing quantum dot solar cell structures.  The Phase I effort will focus on identifying, both theoretically and experimentally, the most promising device designs.  Ultimately our approach provides a pathway for realizing solar cells with over 2,000 W/kg of specific power and power conversion efficiency approaching 60%.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Future space exploration missions will require photovoltaic power systems capable of operating in extreme environments with high temperature and tremendous radiation exposures.  III-V nitrides are extraordinarily robust materials that are being vigorously developed for short optical wavelength and high RF power applications.  The near term objective of this STTR program is to build a solar cell using III-V nitride materials that matches the conversion efficiency of conventional technologies while providing enhanced radiation resistance and high temperature operation capabilities.  Thus the technology developed during this program is expected to have immediate market opportunities in the NASA and military spacecraft power markets.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The STTR project described here is part of a larger effort to address the terrestrial renewable energy market by realizing the ultimate objective of third generation photovoltaics, namely ultra-high conversion efficiency at low costs.  InN-based quantum dot solar cells offer the potential of achieving conversion efficiencies approaching 60% with a single p-n junction device.  Moreover, existing technologies reasonably suggest these ultra-high efficiency devices could be grown on silicon substrates to minimize material costs.  Even lower manufacturing costs and improved performance can be accomplished by inserting these devices into a concentrator system.  By combining high performance devices with a manufacturable plastic micro-concentrator module design, we are developing a solar electric technology that will enable unique spacecraft power generation capabilities and accelerate the adoption of photovoltaics into the renewable energy market.

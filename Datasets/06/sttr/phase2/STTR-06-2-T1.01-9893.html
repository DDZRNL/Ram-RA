      <P><B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 
      words) <BR>In order to meet the challenges of high probability of mission 
      success for space exploration, ground support system for various launch 
      operations that responds rapidly to system events and anomalies is 
      essential. In addition, the vast amount monitored parameters (around 
      50,000) for ground support system requires systematically supportablity 
      analysis and trade-off studies for sensor optimization. Qualtech Systems, 
      Inc. (QSI), in cooperation with Vanderbilt University, proposes to develop 
      an integrated ground support system for addressing the ground support 
      health management problem. The proposed solution provides supportability 
      analysis for LOX system and real-time monitoring for select target system 
      (e.g. hydraulic system). The supportability analysis uses QSI's TEAMS 
      modeling of a candidate Liquid Oxygen (LOX) system which covers ground 
      fueling facilities, mobile launcher and launch pad. An efficient sensor 
      optimization schemes is developed to evaluate current available sensors 
      and proposed upgrade sensor groups. Real-time monitoring collect sensor 
      data from candidate system to the integrated test layer (wherein advanced 
      tests are designed) and passed to the real-time diagnostic reasoner. 
      <P><B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, 
      approximately 150 words) <BR>The proposed solution offers integrated 
      ground support system for launch operations. The advantage of this 
      technology is that it covers a significant part of life cycle of the 
      ground support system, from the design (supportability analysis and sensor 
      optimization) to the deployment (real-time monitoring). The solution will 
      help NASA diagnostic system designers to evaluate the current system for 
      fault coverage, fault detection and isolation and its impact on ability to 
      launch within the window. It also allows the optimized sensor upgrade 
      options and quantifies their benefits. It releases the burden for launch 
      operators by real-time monitoring multiple parameters across system 
      boundaries with optional guide troubleshooting to detect and isolate 
      failures. This integrated development environment will facilitate the 
      diagnostic system design to meet the challenge of high probability of 
      mission success. Important systems such as spacecraft, space stations, 
      mobile launch platform, launch pad, etc. will benefit from the proposed 
      technology with increased reliability and safety. 
      <P><B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 
      characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>The most promising non-NASA 
      application is the ground support system for commercial aircraft and 
      rockets. The proposed integrated ground support system can be applied 
      since commercial aircraft and rockets share many similar components, such 
      as valves, pumps, pipes. Significant potential exists as well with 
      semiconductor manufacturing and industrial automation equipment makers who 
      need effective, real-time health monitoring with rapid fault detection and 
      isolation for ensuring their high-value assets' near 100% uptime.

      <P>NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program 
      to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&amp;D in the agency. 
      It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of 
      interest to NASA.

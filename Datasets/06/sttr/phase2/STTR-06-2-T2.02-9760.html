      <P><B>Expected Technology Readiness Level (TRL) upon completion of 
      contract:</B> 
      <P><B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 
      words) <BR>We propose to design, build and evaluate a prototype of a 
      compact, robust, optically-based sensor for making temperature and 
      multi-species concentration measurements in propulsion system ground and 
      flight test environments. This system will utilize a widely tunable near 
      infrared light source to make absorption measurements of combustion 
      reactant and products in the combustion zone (with accuracy from 100-1000 
      ppm). Although possible to tune over a very wide wavelength range, during 
      phase-II we propose to develop the light source which will be able to 
      continuously tune from 1.4 to 1.8 microns while maintaining a narrow 
      bandwidth of 0.01 cm-1 using a novel combination of acousto- and 
      electro-optically controlled devices. The rapid tunability of this light 
      source will obviate the need for dense multiplexing of multiple 
      wavelengths as signals can be multiplexed in time while maintaining fast 
      temporal response. Furthermore, the wide spectral bandwidth allows for the 
      selection of the optimum absorption transitions, without regard for the 
      commercial availability of narrow bandwidth diode lasers. The proposed 
      instrumentation will be environmentally rugged, with the ability to 
      withstand extreme ranges of temperature, humidity, vibration and shock 
      conditions. Further, the system will possess auto-calibration 
      capabilities, fast response time (few microseconds) and can be battery 
      operated. 
      <P><B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, 
      approximately 150 words) <BR>There are many commercial and military 
      applications for an accurate and rugged laser absorption system capable of 
      acting as a temperature and/or concentration sensor. The sensor could be 
      used in both new and retrofit commercial aircraft as a control sensor for 
      propulsion systems, as its capabilities easily extend to a very wide-range 
      pressure environment. The reliable and precise instrument can be used to 
      control gas turbine combustors, afterburners, and turbine optimization. 
      The system could also be used in aircraft fuel tanks to measure fuel vapor 
      flammability and oxygen concentration in OBIGGS systems. Furthermore, due 
      to the widely tunable light source, this sensor could be used to replace 
      TDLAS sensors in any application, as there is a demonstrable advantage in 
      system cost, complexity, and operation. 
      <P><B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 
      characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>This type of sensor can also be 
      used to monitor the combustion efficiency in terrestrial gas turbine and 
      high-pressure combustion systems where a rugged sensor with long operating 
      life characteristics is needed. Also it is possible to use this sensor for 
      real-time biological measurements as the system can also be used as a 
      Fraunhofer Line Discriminator Spectrometer for sub-angstrom remote sensing 
      of fluorescence emission in the Fraunhofer line wavelengths. Finally, 
      large and complex molecules that have extremely broad absorption 
      signatures could be fully resolved with this sensor, with application to 
      national security sensing of weapons and explosives.

      <P>NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program 
      to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&amp;D in the agency. 
      It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of 
      interest to NASA.

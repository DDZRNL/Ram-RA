		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Abstract<BR><BR>There is a valid scientific data paradigm where no loss of data can be tolerated.  However, transmission of raw data requires unacceptable bandwidth and storage resources such that the net data received is uncomfortably low.  Lossless data compression can be used to preserve all data with no information loss and also help meet bandwidth and storage constraints.  The current Universal Source Encoder of Space (USES) has been meeting many lossless compression needs for a decade.  However, USES is not able to successfully address higher speed instruments, beyond 20 MSamples/sec, or function at quantization levels higher than 15 bits.  The proposed work provides a new solution and presents a lossless data solution that should be valid for at least a decade or more. <BR><BR>A radiation tolerant high performance (100M Samples/second) 32-bit lossless custom processor will be delivered in the proposed work which meets the CCSDS 121-0-B 1 recommendation.  The processor will be implemented in a radiation tolerant 0.25 micron CMOS process which realizes a proven algorithm developed at GSFC and implemented in a 15-bit version 10 years ago.  The new compressor is 5 times faster and has twice the input quantization range, suitable for modern spacecraft requirements.   The net-list (design) of the processor can be used to synthesize a future 200 Msamples/sec plus data rates when a sub-100 nm radiation tolerant fabrication process is available.  <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA Commercial Applications<BR><BR>Potential NASA commercial applications include all flight programs which require real-time high-speed lossless data compression.  The previous USES processor was used in at least nine NASA missions.  The new processor, USES-32, is a single chip, high speed solution and does not require any external memories to perform lossless data compression.  Therefore, the physical characteristics of high speed, low mass (one chip) and low power when compared to an FPGA solution make the design attractive for insertion into an instrument data stream.  USES-32 can serve as a replacement for the previous processor and meet new sensor data requirements.  As with the previous USES processor, USES-32 will be made available to NASA and NASA contractors at a price very competitive with FPGA solutions achieving superior performance at a relatively low cost in terms of mass, power consumption, simplicity of interface electronics, and finally, component price. <BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA Commercial Applications<BR><BR>Other commercial space applications involve the Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial space applications which require real-time high-speed lossless data compression.  The previous USES processor was used in at least four DoD and commercial missions.  The new processor, USES-32, is a single chip, high speed solution and does not require any external memories to perform lossless data compression.  Therefore, the physical characteristics of high speed, low mass (one chip) and low power when compared to an FPGA solution make the design attractive for insertion into an instrument data stream.  USES-32 is an attractive solution for micro-satellite or UAV applications where power and mass are important.   The medical community is another application where lossless compression of medical images is important; loss of image medical data cannot be tolerated.  USES-32 can perform well in such data storage or satellite data transmission data.  For example, the Night Hawk Company in North Idaho utilizes pathologists in Australia to evaluate image data associated with U.S. emergency room medical service in the evening.  USES-32 may have an impact on data transmission time and will be explored  <BR><BR>

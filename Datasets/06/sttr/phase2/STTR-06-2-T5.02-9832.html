      <P><B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 
      words) <BR>Manned spacecraft are vulnerable to air leaks caused by 
      micrometeoroid and space debris impact. The ability to detect and quickly 
      locate and mitigate a pressure vessel breach is critical to the safety of 
      any long duration spacecraft, such as the International Space Station or a 
      proposed lunar base or mission to Mars. Current NASA protocol for finding 
      a spacecraft leak uses a handheld ultrasonic directional microphone, 
      similar to those widely deployed industrially, to detect the 40 kHz 
      airborne ultrasonic hiss generated by the downstream leak turbulence. 
      However, known limitations exist regarding the use of airborne ultrasonic 
      emissions for locating leaks in the spacecraft environment because the 
      downstream side of the leak occurs into the vacuum of space, creating 
      reduced leak noise inside the pressure vessel. Blockages of the 
      transmission of airborne ultrasonic energy by structural components, 
      avionics, and equipment racks also limit the detection range of such 
      systems. An alternative approach that we propose is to monitor the 
      spacecraft structure itself---the pressure vessel skin---for 
      leak-generated surface-borne ultrasound by means of a flexible and modular 
      electronics package with fully integrated surface sensor arrays, data 
      acquisition electronics, and radio frequency communication capabilities. 
      <P><B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, 
      approximately 150 words) <BR>The NASA program with the most risk due to 
      Micro-meteor / Orbital Debris (MMOD) is currently the International Space 
      Station, due to the prolonged exposure on-orbit and the large surface area 
      of the orbiting habitat. For this reason, it is particularly important 
      that the system be able to be installed easily in a retrofit manner behind 
      closeout blankets in easily accessible areas. Additionally, it must be 
      fully self-contained, requiring only minimal data interfaces to the ISS 
      for data transfer to the crew and ground controllers. Although the risk to 
      the Shuttle from MMOD is largely considered to be due to the RCC panels of 
      the Wing Leading Edge and Nose Cone, significant risk is still present in 
      the pressurized portions of the vehicle. Additionally, such a system could 
      be used to monitor for leaks in the airlocks and other sealed vacuum 
      interfaces. As part of the Orion Program, NASA will attempt to increase 
      safety by an order of magnitude over the current Shuttle vehicle. MMOD is 
      a major source of risk for the Shuttle, and will continue to be a risk for 
      the Orion specifically and all future Constellation Program habitats, 
      despite improved MMOD shielding. The proposed system could likely be fully 
      integrated with the Orion or habitat avionics systems, providing 
      continuous monitoring of the entire structure while requiring only minimal 
      vehicle resources and launch mass, as well as very little maintenance. 
      <P><B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 
      characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>Beyond the direct application of 
      the proposed technology for detecting leaks to vacuum in pressurized space 
      vehicles, significant opportunities exist within the more broad 
      application field of applying PZT sensor arrays to Nondestructive 
      Evaluation. Opportunities for the proposed technology in the areas of 
      Military Weapons Systems Monitoring, Industrial / Chemical Processing 
      Facility Monitoring, and Commercial Aircraft Test and Evaluation will be 
      pursued, among others.

      <P>NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program 
      to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&amp;D in the agency. 
      It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of 
      interest to NASA.

      <P><B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 
      words) <BR>The goal of this STTR program is to employ nanostructured 
      materials in an advanced device design to enhance the tolerance of solar 
      cells to extreme environments while maintaining high solar electric power 
      conversion efficiency. By using InN-based quantum dots embedded within a 
      higher band gap GaN barrier material, a larger fraction of the solar 
      spectrum can be harnessed while minimizing the effects of high 
      temperatures and high-energy radiation with this promising photovoltaic 
      device. The wide range of energies accessible to InN-based materials 
      provides unique flexibility in designing quantum dot solar cell 
      structures. Phase I work demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing 
      device quality InN-based quantum dots. InN quantum dot assemblies were 
      grown on GaN templates via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition and 
      exhibited well defined x-ray diffraction peaks with dot densities up to 
      1E10 cm-2. More importantly, strong room temperature photoluminescence has 
      been observed, with peak emission energies ranging from the infrared to 
      the ultraviolet. These promising optical properties suggest it will be 
      possible to build structures incorporating InN quantum dots within a GaN 
      p-n junction to test the basic concepts of quantum dot solar cells during 
      the Phase II effort. The principal Phase II objective is to develop an 
      InN-based quantum dot solar cell capable of high performance in near-sun 
      and extreme radiation environments. Ultimately our approach provides a 
      pathway for realizing solar cells with over 2,000 W/kg of specific power 
      and power conversion efficiency approaching 60%. 
      <P><B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, 
      approximately 150 words) <BR>Future space exploration missions will 
      require photovoltaic power systems capable of operating in harsh 
      environments with high temperature and extreme radiation exposures. III-V 
      nitrides are extraordinarily robust materials that are being vigorously 
      developed for short optical wavelength and high RF power applications. The 
      objective of this STTR program is to build a solar cell using III-V 
      nitride materials that matches the conversion efficiency of conventional 
      technologies while providing enhanced radiation resistance and high 
      temperature operation capabilities. The technology developed during this 
      program is expected to have immediate market opportunities for NASA 
      exploratory spacecraft power, particularly for near-sun missions. 
      <P><B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 
      characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>The STTR project described here 
      is part of a larger effort to address the terrestrial renewable energy 
      market by realizing the ultimate objective of third generation 
      photovoltaics, namely ultra-high conversion efficiency at low costs. 
      InN-based quantum dot solar cells offer the potential of achieving 
      conversion efficiencies approaching 60% with a single p-n junction device. 
      Moreover, existing technologies reasonably suggest these ultra-high 
      efficiency devices could be grown on silicon substrates to minimize 
      material costs. Even lower manufacturing costs and improved performance 
      can be accomplished by inserting these devices into a concentrator system. 
      By combining high performance devices with a manufacturable plastic 
      micro-concentrator module design, we are developing a solar electric 
      technology that will enable unique spacecraft power generation 
      capabilities and accelerate the adoption of photovoltaics into the 
      renewable energy market.

      <P>NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program 
      to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&amp;D in the agency. 
      It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of 
      interest to NASA.

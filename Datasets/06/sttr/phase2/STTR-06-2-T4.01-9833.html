<p><strong>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</strong><BR>
  We have designed a compact   two-color, polarization-sensitive instrument to measure cloud characteristics   from a high altitude UAV and can also be widely deployed as inexpensive   ground-based ceilometers and aerosol finders. The instrument is modular, can   operate with one or two wavelengths, and can measure depolarization or not   depending on the need. The instrument is in two pressurized boxes, an optics box   and an electronics box, each about half a cubic foot in size. If desired, the   two boxes can be attached for a single box solution. Fiber optical technology is   used to minimize critical optical alignments and permit field replacement of the   laser and detectors. Micro-optic fiber components are used to separate the   colors before detection. We propose to build, test, and calibrate the instrument   in the Phase 2 effort. </p>
<p><strong>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</strong><BR>
  Cloud   Physics Lidar has demonstrated an ability to characterize clouds and atmospheric   aerosols. However, the instrument is expensive to fly using manned flights and   the laser is difficult to replace. The proposed instrument will take data   similar to Cloud Physics Lidar, from a UAV, thus allowing extensive air coverage   over environments generally considered unsafe for piloted operations (e.g.   Antarctic regions) at a lower operating cost, which allows more coverage over   regions of interest or over flights coordinated with ground based instruments.   Sigma will draw from its vast experience in the commercial production of Micro   Pulse Lidars (MPL) in streamlining a production process for the ultra compact   cloud lidars described in this proposal. The MPL instruments are deployed in   stations worldwide for autonomous aerosol/dust/cloud profiling in standalone and   networked configurations. A similar network of UAV based instruments leveraging   production and technologies from MPL can be envisioned to provide tens of units   or more to NASA and its partner stations worldwide to provide cloud monitoring   on a routine basis. </p>
<p><strong>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</strong><BR>
  The design of   the compact cloud lidar lends itself to ground based applications as well.   Currently NOAA owns and/or operates approximately 900 ceilometers at various   monitoring stations and airports. The ceilometers have been used for severe   weather prediction and aviation assistance in and around airports. Recently,   NOAA has started a phased replacement of ceilometers while recognizing its   limitation to cloud base estimation. The ultra compact lidar proposed here   provides a novel instrument when used as a compact lidar that provides   aerosol/cloud profile information, but also particle size and cloud phase from   the polarization sensitive measurement ability. The commercial potential for an   instrument similar in size to the existing ceilometers but with advanced   capability for agencies such as NOAA and FAA would be very significant, given   the number of instruments used in their existing network. Sigma has already   established a business relationship with NOAA, and is working with their team in   cloud profile and cloud phase measurements in the DC area. </p>

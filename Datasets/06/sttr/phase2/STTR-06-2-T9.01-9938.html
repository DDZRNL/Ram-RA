      <P><B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 
      words) <BR>The objective of the proposed SBIR Phase II program is to 
      develop, deploy and deliver novel laser-based instruments that provide 
      rapid, in situ, simultaneous measurements of gas temperature, velocity and 
      mole fractions of several important species in rocket plume exhaust flows 
      at NASA Stennis Space Center. Based on proven laser absorption 
      spectroscopy techniques and successful demonstrations in Phase I, the 
      instrument will employ novel room temperature near-IR and mid-IR lasers to 
      determine the concentrations of several combustion products, pollutants 
      and flowfield parameters (gas temperature and velocity) with high 
      sensitivity. The Phase I instrument will be tested and refined in 
      combustion flows at University of Wisconsin-Madison Engine Laboratory and 
      at LGR and demonstrated in realistic flows at NASA Stennis Space Center. 
      The fast response of the instrument will enable engineers and scientists 
      to record precise measurements of several important gasdynamic parameters 
      in rocket engine (including Space Shuttle Main Engine) flows to identify 
      temperature and species nonuniformities, combustion instabilities and to 
      refine and improve computational models. 
      <P><B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, 
      approximately 150 words) <BR>The proposed instrumentation will be used for 
      reliable measurements of gas concentrations (several species), temperature 
      and velocity in flowfields generated by rocket engines (Space Shuttle), 
      gas turbine engines, arc jets, wind tunnels, engine augmentors and pulse 
      detonation engines by NASA scientists and engineers (e.g., at SSC, 
      Langley, ATK/GASL, AEDC, Ames) and thus enable design and testing of more 
      efficient, less polluting engines and propulsion systems. 
      <P><B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 
      characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>The proposed program will lead to 
      new instrumentation for reliable, non-intrusive measurements for control 
      and thus optimization of (less polluting, more efficient) 
      combustion-driven engines, power sources and incinerators based on 
      measurements of multiple gas concentrations, temperatures and gas 
      velocities. 
      <P>
      <P>NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program 
      to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&amp;D in the agency. 
      It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of 
      interest to NASA.

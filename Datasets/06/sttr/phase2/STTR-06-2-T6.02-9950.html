      <P><B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 
      words) <BR>Rocket plume impingement can cause significant damage and 
      contaminate co-landing spacecraft and surrounding habitat structures 
      during lunar landing operations. CFDRC and the University of Florida will 
      develop an innovative simulation system for predicting surface erosion and 
      debris transport caused by lunar surface rocket plume impingement. This 
      simulation system combines 1) a unified continuum-rarefied flow solver 
      capable of simulating plume impingement flow in lunar vacuum, 2) granular 
      solid-fluid interaction simulation models for developing databases for 
      lunar soil erosion and debris particle release mechanism, and 3) particle 
      tracking tools to simulate debris kinetics and dispersion after 
      liberation. During Phase I, the Unified Flow Solver (UFS) capabilities in 
      simulating hybrid rarefied-continuum plume flow, and the debris dispersion 
      tracking capabilities were demonstrated. The fluid-solid simulation tools 
      realistically simulated jet induced soil grain response characteristics, 
      clearing the path towards establishing working models of erosion and 
      particle release mechanisms. In Phase II, the individual modules will be 
      refined, validated and integrated into a coherent simulation system. The 
      solid-fluid interaction physics will be refined for the peculiar lunar 
      soil layer characteristics and consequently soil erosion models will be 
      derived. The erosion models will serve to prescribe debris initial 
      conditions for a debris-tracking module developed and integrated with the 
      flow solver. The simulation capability will be essential for predicting 
      the severity and range of dust and debris transport and for designing 
      lunar settlement layout, dust and debris impact mitigation measures. 
      <P><B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, 
      approximately 150 words) <BR>The debris simulation tool will be of first 
      order importance to the Space Exploration program for lunar robotic and 
      human mission architecture definition. The tool will be equally applicable 
      to follow-on Mars robotic and human missions. The developed technology 
      will also be applicable for analysis of solid propulsion systems with 
      embedded solid particle. 
      <P><B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 
      characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>Many potential non-NASA 
      commercial applications exist in civil and military industries. Dust, sand 
      and snow stir-up during helicopter landing and take-off in a desert or 
      artic environment result in severe visibility impairment (brown-out), 
      windshield abrasion and danger of debris ingestion. Civil engineering and 
      environmental engineering applications include wind-borne landscape 
      erosion and dust transport to populated areas. 
      <P>
      <P>NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program 
      to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&amp;D in the agency. 
      It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of 
      interest to NASA.

      <P><B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 
      words) <BR>Luna Innovations Incorporated proposes in this STTR Phase II 
      project to continue development and validation of Luna's 
      amplitude-dependent, nonlinear ultrasonic inspection technique applied to 
      friction stir welded (FSW) components. The technique was successfully 
      demonstrated in the Phase I project on samples made from aluminum-lithium 
      alloy 2195. The proposed Phase II project will focus on refining the 
      ultrasonic hardware and software needed to implement the technique on 
      materials and weld geometries with near-term application in support of the 
      Constellation launch vehicle development program. A multi-channel sensor 
      implementation is planned. Luna's results will be compared to conventional 
      NDE techniques currently used; this testing will be conducted primarily by 
      collaborators at the University of Alabama  Huntsville (UAH). The 
      project will also include a review of state-of-the-art NDE techniques 
      applied to FSW joints and early planning for comprehensive probability of 
      detection experiments needed to fully qualify the new technique. 
      <P><B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, 
      approximately 150 words) <BR>The primary NASA application is post process, 
      quality assurance inspection of friction stir welds of fuel tank and other 
      structural components for the Constellation program vehicles. 
      <P><B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 
      characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>Commercial applications of the 
      technique include evaluation of FSW joints in aging aircraft, FSW bonds in 
      nuclear waste storage containers, and FSW joints in marine and ferry 
      structural applications. Friction stir welding is also increasingly being 
      used to create suspension components and wheel rims for the automotive 
      industry. 
      <P>
      <P>NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program 
      to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&amp;D in the agency. 
      It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of 
      interest to NASA.

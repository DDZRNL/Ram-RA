      <P><B>Expected Technology Readiness Level (TRL) upon completion of 
      contract:</B> 
      <P><B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 
      words) <BR>In this proposal, we describe a program to develop a 
      high-performance, cost-effective and robust microwave receiver prototype 
      for multi-purpose Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE). Currently, NDE of 
      space transportation vehicles is primarily carried out on the ground, 
      between missions. For future space missions, as duration and frequency 
      increases, more inspection will need to be performed in space in order to 
      monitor the aging process of the structure and to insure its integrity. 
      For this purpose, NDE equipment that is compact, lightweight, easily 
      operated by human with limited mobility or robot, and that exhibits low 
      power consumption is required. Furthermore, in order to minimize the 
      quantity of embarked equipment, the inspection equipment must be able to 
      perform as many different inspection tasks as possible. Our innovative 
      receiver is based on the integration of a microwave interferometer coupled 
      with a pulsed laser to generate the ultrasound. . Based on the results 
      obtained during Phase 1, we strongly think that we will be able to 
      overcome the limitation generally associated with classical optical 
      receiver: 1) Inability to work in factory environment where thermal, 
      mechanical and optical propagation (fumes, water drops,..) perturbations 
      are present; 2) Reduction in sensitivity caused by the speckle nature of 
      the light reflected from rough surfaces; 3) High system cost due the price 
      of the probe lasers, optics and engineering to develop an optical system 
      working in a harsh environment (fumes, water drops, strong mechanical 
      vibration) and 4) high maintenance cost (Lasers and optics need to be 
      checked and re-aligned frequently). Our proposed approach will lead to a 
      cost-effective prototype with good sensitivity and performances in 
      industrial environment. 
      <P><B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, 
      approximately 150 words) <BR>The primarily target is the NDE during space 
      flight, but it will also be applicable to on-the-ground NDE. Potential 
      NASA applications covers a variety of NDE inspection needs, including the 
      detection of subsurface inclusions and surface breaking cracks, the 
      inspection of wiring and detection of cracks in the insulation, 
      characterization of coating materials and bonding properties. Moreover, 
      there is some potential application for the detection of corrosion under 
      the shuttle thermal protection system without removing the tile. 
      <P><B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 
      characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>Potential non-NASA commercial 
      applications include ground based aircraft and spacecraft inspection, the 
      inspection and characterization of thin films and coatings, residual 
      stress measurement, fatigue crack detection, and the inspection of 
      metallic and composite plates. Remote non-destructive testing where the 
      cost of the system is critical and therefore laser detection is too 
      expensive is a strong potential market. 
      <P>
      <P>NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program 
      to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&amp;D in the agency. 
      It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of 
      interest to NASA.

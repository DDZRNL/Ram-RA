		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Our objective is to develop and demonstrate a novel microfluidic device for non-destructive identification, sorting and counting of radiation damaged cells. A major thrust, using microarray experiments, is the discovery of unique cell surface markers for identification of radiation-damaged cells. A key innovative feature in the proposed device platform is a gravity-independent, optics-free, electrical cell separation and counting, leading to a very simple, compact and lightweight design suitable for space deployment. <BR><BR>The Phase 1 effor,  successfully identified a set of receptor genes as potential candidate markers for radiative damage. Ability to sort bead-labelled cells non-destructively and with high efficiency was also demonstrated. In Phase 2, whole genome arrays and DNA damage assays will additionally be used to further identify and verify a robust set of surface markers indicative of DNA damage induced by radiation. The cell sorter microdevice will be further optimized for throughput and efficiency and demonstrated using irradiated cells. A novel concept for simple, electrical counting of cells on chip will be implemented on chip. Finally, verification and demonstration of the developed technology is planned using access to resources available at NSRL. A multi-disciplinary team of microfluidic, tissue engineering and radiation biologists has been assembled for this project.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The end product of the proposed SBIR effort will be a first-of-its-kind, commercially available, compact, low-cost, integrated device for sorting of radiation damaged cells. This device will greatly aid in NASA's efforts to minimize radiation hazard, and develop countermeasures, enabled by fundamental understanding of radiation biological effects at the molecular and cellular level. The device will be of direct use to NASA's ground-based research facilities and amenable for space deployment as well (in-situ gene expression studies in space). In addition, the technology can easily be modified to benefit research efforts focused on other space-induced biological phenomena such as bone loss, immune modulation, oxidative stress among others.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		It is also expected that the developed technology will find ready applications in the following civilian markets: <BR>	Pharmaceutical and Drug Discovery Companies<BR>	Pre-clinical and Clinical Researchers (in particular stem cell and oncology researchers)<BR>	Hospital & Health Site Monitoring (for nuclear medicine, immune ex-vivo treatments)<BR><BR>

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

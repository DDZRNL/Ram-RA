TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS):<BR>
<B> Aeroelastic studies, such as the prediction of flutter boundaries and limit cycle oscillations, play a critical role in aircraft safety and design. To perform these analyses with the required accuracy, nonlinear aerodynamic, and possibly nonlinear structural, effects must be included.  Furthermore, these effects must be considered early in the design cycle in order to reduce life cycle costs.  The Volterra theory of nonlinear systems addresses the need for efficient and accurate reduced-order modeling of unsteady aeroelastic effects.  A critical problem, however, is the difficulty of identifying the Volterra kernels.  We propose a new identification method that is suitable for use with wind-tunnel or flight-test data.  The proposed innovation is a time-domain multiresolution Volterra kernel identification method which uses physically realizable inputs, is robust with respect to noise, and minimizes or eliminates the need for analytical assumptions.  The Phase I work will integrate an existing kernel extraction technique with new multiresolution signal decomposition approaches and demonstrate the combined method on experimental data.  The resulting technology is expected to facilitate linear and nonlinear system identification for aeroservoelastic analysis and design and will be applied, in Phase II, to data from the F18-AAW program. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> The market for efficient aeroelastic analysis tools is driven by new aircraft, missile, and reusable launch vehicle design and by the need for multiple aeroelastic analyses over time as a consequence of aircraft modifications and expanded/changing missions.  The proposed linear and nonlinear identification system has a broad range of applications, including but not limited to, electromagnetic pulse hardening of aircraft systems, computational electromagnetics (photopic switching devices, ultrawideband technology), noise reduction (acoustic liners), polymer processing (extrusion blow molding), and earthquake and geoenvironmental engineering. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> The proposed multiresolution-based identification system provides a unique capability that will extend the usefulness of wind-tunnel and flight-test data by producing compact, reduced-order models for use in aeroelastic analyses.  The formulation of reduced-order models in aeroelasticity is important for several reasons: (1) cost reduction and speed-up of preliminary design cycles, (2) understanding of nonlinear behavior and elimination of later surprises, and (3) real-time aeroservoelastic control applications.  The proposed technology supports NASA's goal of increasing safety and efficiency of flight testing. </B>

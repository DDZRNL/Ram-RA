TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS):<BR>
<B> AeroAstro and the University of Colorado propose to develop an autonomous satellite power control system to dynamically monitor, schedule and distribute power resources on microsatellites , while remaining sensitive to the mission objectives. The Autonomous Power Scheduler (APS) will maximize power efficiency and availability while being situationally-aware of bus conditions. The concept system would employ a component-based model to diagnose system status with embedded logic, and respond to anomalous power states and initiate recovery or mitigation actions pending further ground command, while remaining within defined spacecraft state-of-health parameters. The APS represents an innovative paradigm shift from conventional design practices. Conventionally, spacecraft power is managed using static, non-intelligent designs based on worst-case, lowest power scenarios, and subsystem operational power allocations are made with ?man-in-the-loop? decisions through transmitted commands. What is proposed here is a method to control primary power in an intelligent, semi- or fully autonomous fashion maximizing mission capability and performance. Appropriate power will be distributed when and where it is most needed. The autonomy of the APS concept and the resulting reduction in requirements for ?man-in-the-loop? decision making makes it particularly applicable to NASA?s future generation of distributed constellation missions. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> Due to the autonomous nature of APS, we envision a wide range of power-limited, mobile platform applications. This system will make better use of the available power resources to reduce weight and increase system life. Weight can be reduced by requiring less energy stores to meet basic mission objectives. Smaller batteries or less fuel may be required to meet operational goals. Weight reduction often equates to increased endurance for ground-based, autonomous systems. Two specific areas of ground-based systems that can benefit from reduced mass and increased autonomy are Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Deployable Sensors. UAVs are operated remotely or, at certain times, completely autonomously. The less weight, the further range and flight duration that is possible. Deployable Sensors are most commonly used for theater applications. They are used to track and identify the source of ground movements. Reduced weight allows the sensors to be deployed with minimum manpower in difficult areas for vehicle access. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> Over the next ten years NASA has planned numerous upcoming small satellite for near Earth and deep space missions which have a need for low mass, power efficient, survivable components and subsystems such as their electric power subsystems. The majority of these missions will be severely restricted in their ability to maintain batteries due to their limited power gathering capabilities, in particularly for deep space and constellation missions such as the Magnetospheric Constellation mission. These missions require components optimized for mass, power, and cost, while satisfying the reliability and efficiency needed for single string and deep space missions. To fulfill these requirements we feel the development of a highly efficient, semi-autonomous or even fully autonomous electrical power system based on APS which we are proposing will be beneficial and significantly contribute to life and capability of these missions. </B>

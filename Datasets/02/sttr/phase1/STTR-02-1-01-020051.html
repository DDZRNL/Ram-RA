TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS):<BR>
<B> When using autonomous systems in unknown environments, it will not be possible to anticipate all scenarios in which the devices will be involved and pre-program their response. It will be increasingly incumbent on the machines to ascertain the intent of the users and be able to learn from user actions to improve performance. Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) will explore several new algorithms that would enable a machine to learn some of the high-level strategies that humans use to control and monitor robotic devices remotely.  By collecting data from human teleoperation, we propose learning a mode controlling mixture model that would approximate the decision boundaries that human operators use to switch strategies.  This idea will take the skill and intelligence inherent in human operators and provide the basis for how the controller can adjust during autonomous operation.  In order to optimize the parameters of the controllers, we propose using optimization techniques inspired from genetic algorithms (GAs) to find globally optimal parameters within these modes. To further optimize the learned mode switching behavior, we also plan to incorporate online reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to adaptively tune the learned parameters. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> As NASA extends its reach, it will be necessary to use unmanned vehicles to facilitate autonomous exploration and to support telepresence for human personnel. Since at such great distance, human interaction will be limited, these vehicles must learn both on their own and from the limited interaction when human assistance is possible.  Learning from human demonstration can be used to automatically ?program? robots for space missions during the earth-based training periods when humans are also learning how to use the robots.  Beyond robots, as the functions of all mission subsystems become increasingly complex, forms of adaptive learning will be necessary. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> These technologies will be applicable to commercial avionics systems and control and decision-making systems.  The technology developed will provide greater integration at the system level, more affordable configurations, more efficient and supportable flight control architectures, and the ability to operate air vehicles safely and effectively in an inter-netted environment.  All commercial aircraft manufacturers, suppliers, and airline would benefit from this technology. </B>

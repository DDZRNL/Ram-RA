TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS):<BR>
<B> ORBITEC and the University of Wisconsin-Madison propose to develop a low-cost, non-intrusive, wavelength-agile optical rocket propulsion sensor (WORPS) to interrogate rocket exhaust plumes and cryogenic fluid properties.  The innovative sensor system is based on a Chirped White Pulse Emitter (CWPE).  By rapidly monitoring (1 ?Ys response time) broad absorption spectra, the CWPE can interrogate temperature, pressure, and multiple species concentrations in gases at arbitrary conditions and can simultaneously monitor cryogenic liquid properties, all with a simple design.  Along a line-of-sight with non-uniform properties, the CWPE can also record gas temperature distributions rather than just the path-averaged temperature.  These capabilities represent a dramatic enhancement of the best diode-laser sensors available just two years ago, which were not wavelength-agile.  In Phase I, a prototype WORPS system will be designed and fabricated.  The unit will be initially demonstrated by interrogating static gas cells at various mixtures and pressures, flat-flame burners, and dewars of LOX containing known amounts of trace constituents (such and N2).  Additional demonstrations will be performed by measuring species concentrations and temperature in exhaust plumes from the combustion of GOX/GH2, GOX/RP-1, and GOX/HTPB in lab-scale thrust chambers operating over a range of pressures and nozzle area ratios. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> All industries requiring non-invasive sensing of gas or liquid properties with fast-time response will benefit from the technology.  These include virtually all types of engines (rocket, gas turbine, piston, etc.) and associated systems as well as many industrial process monitoring applications (e.g., semiconductor processing).  In addition, wavelength-agile light can be used to monitor solid properties, either directly or by embedding fiber-optic sensors. Large industries that may find the technology attractive include the automotive industry for internal combustion engine monitoring and emissions control, the commercial aircraft industry for jet engines and gas turbines, and the power production industry for coal, oil, and natural gas burners. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> The goal of this work is to produce multi-purpose, rugged optical sensors from inexpensive components.  By the conclusion of Phase II, a single WORPS system is expected to cost less than $5000 and have the capability to monitor multiple gas or liquid properties with time response of 1 ?Ys.  Such devices are invaluable to propulsion system developers.  Because the WORPS technology can be applied to both combustion and cryogenic systems, the NASA market is large.  Potential NASA applications include use for propulsion system monitoring in testing facilities at NASA/SSC, NASA/MSFC, NASA/GRC, NASA/ARC, and NASA/KSC.  Because the proposed WORPS system technology is lightweight and has only a few key components, it could potentially find use as a diagnostic tool for on-orbit microgravity combustion, gas, and fluid experiments aboard the Shuttle and ISS.  Real-time, in-flight monitoring of the SSME for propulsion system health represents another applications for the mature WORPS system. </B>

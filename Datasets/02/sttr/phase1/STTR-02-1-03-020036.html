TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS):<BR>
<B> In November 1998 a network of seismic stations was deployed by S. Anandakrishnan (now at Penn State) and others in West Antarctica.  These autonomous stations returned state-of-health data via satellite, and stored high-volume instrument data for later retrieval.  The satellite links demonstrated a novel and sophisticated application of technology to the problem of retrieving in situ data from harsh remote terrestrial environments. Using these Antarctic seismic stations as a starting point, we propose to make a second innovative leap in remote instrumentation by creating intelligent, self-organizing instrument networks capable of recording, storing, processing, and returning high volumes of geophysical data from the field.  These instruments will be built from low-cost COTS components, will intercommunicate via wireless microwave protocol, and will return data through a high-rate telemetry system.  As such the proposed instrument network will drastically reduce the costs of field instrumentation and data recovery.  The notion of an intelligent autonomous array of sensors has gained in popularity and momentum in the scientific world with new technological advances.  We believe this is the opportunity to implement such a concept, with considerable but surmountable technical challenges, direct application to NASA's Earth Science Enterprise, and tremendous potential for future commercial application. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> We propose to develop an intelligent self-organizing autonomous wireless network of sensor stations.  The technology to be developed under this proposal would enhance both the reliability and cost of any distributed sensor array. Examples of commercialization potential include rapid and complete monitoring of an urban power grid or establishment of an environmental pollution/contamination warning system.  This technology could also be used for traffic monitoring in order to optimize traffic flow, and sensors could also be used in this context for law-enforcement and homeland security purposes. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> This proposed research and commercial development is directly applicable to the future exploration of our solar system.  For example, an array of sensors on Mars or Europa will have to collect data under harsh environmental conditions, including extreme temperatures and exposure to high winds and radiation.  To optimize system redundancy and data return these sensor will intercommunicate, will process and store data, and will autonomously telemeter that data to earth via relay satellite.  This scenario precisely mirrors our proposed intelligent regional sensor network in Antarctica.  The knowledge and experience gained in designing and operating the Antarctic instrument network will hence become an invaluable part of the preparation for such future planetary missions. </B>

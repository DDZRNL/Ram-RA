TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS):<BR>
<B> The proposed innovation is a solution that combines efficient dynamically
<br>reconfigurable embedded software and extensions to model-based reasoning (MBR)to enable on-board planning, real-time control, and failure management of complex autonomous systems. The solution leverages Embedded Research Solutions (ERS)'s expertise in the area of embedded real-time systems and merges recent advances by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the area of MBR. ERS has used a state-based approach to building dynamically reconfigurably software, through the creation of resource-savvy real-time frameworks and software components for control and communication applications. This technology provides the underpinnings to incorporate JHU/APL's newest results in MBR, namely expressive state definitions, into MIT's second generation MBR system TITAN, and shrinking the resulting reasoning engine to a size suitable for on-board real-time processing in autonomous systems. </B>
<P>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> Areas of application and special interest to ERS include pervasive computing, environmental monitoring and machine health and diagnostics.
<br>It is anticipated that this effort will define at least two viable commercial embodiments of the technologies: 1) a platform for embedded systems that includes MBR for planning and diagnostics and  2) tools that support the platform. </B>
<P>
POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> The solution directly addresses NASA's needs described in STTR 2002 Topic 1, subtopic, "Technologies for Autonomous Spacecraft, Rovers, and Other Complex Systems." It provides both an onboard capability for synthesizing operational plans from high-level goals, and on-board MBR methods to diagnose system health and then automatically reconfigure to respond to failures. </B>

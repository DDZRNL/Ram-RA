TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS):<BR>
<B> The purpose of this project is to develop a portable, hands free device for emergency medical decision-making support to be used in remote or confined settings by non-physician providers.  Phase I of the project will entail the development of a voice-activated device that will utilize an intelligent algorithm to provide guidance in establishing an emergent airway. The interactive, hands free software will process requests for assistance based on verbal prompts and algorithmic decision-making.  The device will allow the crew to attend to the patient while receiving verbal instruction, guidance and graphic representations where it will be helpful in performing procedures. Testing in the Johns Hopkins Department of Emergency Medicine, in a real time clinical setting, will validate the efficacy of this mode of technology. Phase I of the project will focus on validation of the proposed technology as well as development of the necessary software and hardware into a beta-type device. In Phase II, we will produce the first generation software and hardware for hands-free, interactive medical decision for use in any situation in which an algorithmic guide would be useful. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> The medical decision software, the algorithmic approach and the hands free technology will be integrated to create a product that will have wide-ranging uses in emergency situations. Following development and validation of the technology and software the product will be easily marketed and licensed to a medical/para-medical organization or medical equipment company. This technology?s greatest impact will be in the general population, with remote or mobile care environments being the target. First Aid publications may be impractical for the layperson, faced with illness or injury in remote locations and with precious little time. Cruise ships, oilrigs, reservations, remote military bases, municipalities, school districts and expeditions are obvious locations for the hands-free device. The potential of using such a system to save lives or to stabilize someone with an illness or injury prior to the arrival of trained emergency personnel is very real. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> To date, the only U.S. on/peri-orbit emergencies have been airway ones; Apollo-Soyuz inhalation injuries and explosive decompression and fire on the Mir. The frequent loss of communication events with ISS means that crews will be forced to operate more independently and a mission to Mars will necessitate a degree of autonomy never before achieved.  It is not logistically possible to make an emergency medicine physician part of every crew so NASA relies on the C.M.O. program, which, in essence, places a layperson in charge of life or death decisions. The C.M.O.s have no clinical acumen on which to base their decisions, yet they are expected to make medical judgments. The device would allow laypersons to easily, reliably and quickly treat patients using sound, validated algorithms; the mainstay of pre-hospital care. Additionally, it would free the C.M.O. from having to manually locate and then read the appropriate guide. </B>

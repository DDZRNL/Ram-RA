TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS):<BR>
<B> ZONA Technology and the University of Florida propose an R&D effort to establish a Robust Aeroservoelastic Toolbox (RASET) with emphasis on nonlinear identification, modeling and analysis. The RASET will serve the next-generation flutterometer. The toolbox augments the current mu-method analysis with nonlinear operators so limit cycle oscillations (LCO) can be predicted. Several representations of these nonlinearities, such as Volterra kernels and describing functions, are proposed.  Flight data will be used to identify optimal estimates of these nonlinear representations and associated uncertainty.  The resulting model will be used to compute stability margins that reflect both flutter and LCO instabilities.  In Phase I, the developed RASET will formulate the foundation for the next-generation flutterometer. This toolbox will allow the computation of robust stability margins associated with explosive flutter or limit cycle oscillations (LCO). A feasibility study is proposed to validate this advanced flutterometer concept. In Phase II, RASET would be updated with advanced routines for system modeling, LFT representation, identification of nonlinearity, estimation of uncertainty, and stability analysis.  The aim of the current approach is that the toolbox should be invaluable to the flight test community by extending the current modeling capabilities to include nonlinearity identified from flight data. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> ZONA envisions that the proposed research will result in a commercial product which can greatly impact the flight test community.  The work toolbox could become a standard analysis package for aeroservoelastic instability and flutter clearance.  If successful, the proposed methodology for a nonlinear flutterometer will complement and enhance the current capability for predicting instabilities during envelope expansion.  ZONA plans to package the toolbox as stand-alone software for all phases, pre-flight to post-flight, of a test.  A wide variety of military and commercial aircraft can adopt this analysis capability such as fighters, transports, UAV, and scaled-prototype versions. The potential customer base includes current ZONA customers including aerospace firms, DoD, NASA, USAF, USN, and flight test centers. Marketing the toolbox will be simplified by taking advantage of ZONA's current extensive customer network.  In addition, these tools for data-based modeling and analysis of nonlinearities are needed for automotive, manufacturing, nautical, and materials applications. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> NASA, especially Dryden Flight Research Center, invests considerable resources into flight testing.  The proposed Robust Aeroservoelastic Toolbox would increase the efficiency of such testing.  The increased efficiency would result from reducing time and cost of the testing while, most importantly, increasing safety.  The toolbox will provide an advanced on-line prediction capability for aeroservoelastic instabilities that identifies nonlinear dynamics directly from flight data. Such capability will dramatically reduce the risk of encountering unexpected instabilities associated with unmodeled nonlinearities. 
<br>Thus, the tools will be of use for aeroelasticians, aerodynamicists, and control engineers.  The proposed toolbox could support NASA and partners on upcoming envelope expansion of the F/A-18 AAW, F-15 IFF, and UCAV at NASA Dryden along with the F-22 at Edwards Air Force Base.

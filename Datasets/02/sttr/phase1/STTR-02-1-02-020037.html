TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS):<BR>
<B> Future research into advanced air vehicle designs will benefit from the continued improvement of analysis methods and software tools.  A research program is proposed to provide enhanced capabilities to the NASA STARS software package in two key areas.  These are; the addition of a control system toolbox including classical and modern control system design procedures, and the introduction of parallelization into the computational process.  Since most current and planned high performance air vehicles depend heavily on their flight control systems, and their structure is designed for low weight, and an efficient propulsion system is essential, a fully integrated analysis is required in the design process to produce overall optimized performance.  All these factors motivate the need for the newly proposed developments.  Also, as more complexity is added to the analysis software, computer throughput productivity inevitably drops, despite computer advances, and this drives the need for parallelization.  The capability resulting from this research promises significant increases in the scope and efficiency of STARS such that its use will have a greater range of application and will contribute to the assurance of safety in flight testing.  The planned reusable launch vehicle will be the initial application objective of the enhanced software. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> Multidisciplinary analysis simulation packages, such as STARS, are in considerable demand both inside and outside of NASA.  They are not confined to applications in the aeronautics and space fields, but are of high interest to many product areas.  The proposed enhancements will increase the attraction of STARS as a commercial tool for these other industries, such as marine, automotive and civil engineering.  A further spin-off benefit is the potential application to Stirling Dynamics? in-house software package, Hypac, which can use the same control and parallelization techniques, and which the company plans to offer as a commercial product. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> NASA will benefit from the expanded analysis capability and increased computational throughput made available by the addition of control systems and parallelization to STARS.  NASA Dryden conducts research into the most advanced air vehicles and must maintain software analysis tools of the highest quality to assure safety of flight testing, to which the planned STARS enhancements contribute.  The enhanced STARS tool can be offered to other NASA facilities, expanding the user base and ensuring its continued growth.  The reusable launch vehicle is a suitable first application, such that the benefit from this STTR project has an early impact. </B>

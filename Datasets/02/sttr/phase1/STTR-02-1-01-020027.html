TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS):<BR>
<B> The overall goal of this project is to develop a robust autonomous  intelligent real-time system for Uninhabited Aerial Combat Vehicles (UCAV) to achieve the desired flight performance by integrating effective  Health Monitoring and Failure Detection and Identification (HM-FDI) with optimal control strategies to accommodate unanticipated failures and multiple modes of operation. SSCI has already done ground-breaking research in this area, which will be fully leveraged to further advance the state-of-the-art in Intelligent Autonomy. In order to achieve these objectives, we plan to carry out the following tasks in collaboration with Professor Karl Hedrick of the University of California, Berkeley: (i) Formulate the HM-FDIR problem in multiple operating regimes for UCAVs; (ii) Derive algorithms for real-time calculation of  Achievable Dynamic Performance (ADP) and reachable sets; (iii) Implement an efficient robust HM-FDIR system for the X-45A as a test vehicle; (iv) Implement  higher decision-making levels including the trajectory generation, path planning and mission planning levels; and (v) Evaluate the performance of the proposed autonomous intelligent flight control and management system using a X-45A (Boeing-Darpa UCAV) simulation. NASA Ames Rotorcraft Research Center (Dr. Mark Tischler) will provide technical evaluation and flight demonstration support during Phase II of the project.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> Current applications of the proposed autonomous intelligent  flight control and management system are in the area of intelligent autonomy for single and multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and Uninhabited Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAV). Autonomous intelligent control systems will find wide applications in other programs such as  Air Traffic Control  and Intelligent Vehicle Highways. Related applications are envisioned in the areas of robotics, and unmanned ground, underwater and surface vehicles.

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> The proposed autonomous intelligent  flight control and management system and related technologies are critical for realizing the vision of  the NASA Aviation Safety Program to reduce the aviation  fatal accident rate by a factor of 5 by year 2007, and by a factor of 10 by  year 2022. The technologies developed under this project are expected to predict and prevent mechanical and software malfunctions, and reconfigure the control when they happen. Our technologies will also help  eliminate accidents involving hazardous weather and controlled flight into rough terrain. </B>

TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS):<BR>
<B> UltraSail is a complete sail system for the launch, deployment, stabilization and control of very large (km^2 size) solar sails enabling reduced mission times for interplanetary and deep space spacecraft.  UltraSail is an innovative, non-traditional approach to propulsion technology achieved by combining propulsion and control systems developed for formation-flying microsatellites with an innovative solar sail architecture to achieve controllable sail areas approaching 1 km^2, sail subsystem area densities of 1 gm/m^2, and thrust levels 20 times those of ion thrusters used for comparable deep space missions.  UltraSail can conceivably even achieve outer planetary rendezvous, a deep space capability now reserved for high-mass nuclear and chemical systems.  The primary innovation is the near-elimination of sail supporting structures by attaching the sail tip to a number of formation-flying microsatellites which deploy the sail, and then articulate the sail to provide attitude control, including spin stabilization and precession of the spin axis.  These tip microsatellites are controlled by a laser metrology system and maneuvered by a 3-axis microthruster system using solar-power to maintain low, constant velocity and proper sail film tension during deployment with negligible propellant mass. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> UltraSail is potentially useful for a range of robotic missions ranging from Mars to the Kuiper Belt.  Although inner planet transfers are achievable, UltraSail?s greatest advantages are in outer-planet/solar system exploration.  While the obvious first application for outer planet missions would be flyby missions including aerocapture, the large sail area and low density may make planetary rendezvous missions feasible.  Phase I should provide initial answers as to the rendezvous question. </B>
<P>
POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> UltraSail may have limited military applications for earth-observing missions at high orbit where stationary observing is useful ? e.g. pole-sitting missions.  Also, NOAA and NSF have strong interests in the science that can be returned using sails in non-Keplerian orbits. </B>

TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS):<BR>
<B> A lidar laser transmitter useful for profiling of clouds, aerosols, and differential absorption measurements of atmospheric trace constituents such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and ozone is proposed.  The proposed laser transmitter is based on a master tunable external cavity diode laser (ECDL) used to injection lock a series of free running laser diodes (FRLD's).  The FRDL's amplify the injected optical signal from the master ECDL so that the output of the laser transmitter maintains the tunability and narrow linewidth of the master ECDL.  The amplified output signal of the laser transmitter is easily pulsed by modulating the drive current to the FRDL's.  The innovative laser transmitter maintains the tunability and narrow linewidth of the master ECDL important for differential absorption lidar (DIAL) measurements while providing a pulsed amplified output.  Cascading four injection locked FRDL's to a master ECDL can produce a peak power of 1W.  An order of magnitude improvement in the signal to noise performance of a lidar system can be obtained using the cascaded injection locked laser transmitter compared to the state of the art pulsed flared amplifiers. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> The successful completion of the Phase I and Phase II STTR work will benefit NASA by improving the performance and lowering the cost of diode based lidar systems.  Lidar systems based on the cascaded injection locked laser transmitters have an order of magnitude improvement in the SNR when compared to the pulsed flared amplifier system.  Laser diodes needed for the injection locked laser transmitter cost about $750 per laser while pulsed amplifiers run anywhere from $20,000 to $50,000.  The savings in cost for the cascaded injection locked system (4 diodes needed) is over an order of magnitude. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> The development of the cascaded injection locked laser transmitter involves the development of a tunable ECDL, an amplified cw or pulsed tunable laser system, and a diode based laser transmitter for lidar systems.  Chemical sensing is an emerging market able to utilize the tunable ECDL.  This work is of interest to both AdvR and Montana State University.  The high power pulse injection locked ECDL and the cascaded injection locked ECDL have a potential market for pollution monitoring devices and line of sight chemical absorption measurements for process monitoring and control. </B>

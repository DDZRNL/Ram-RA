TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS):<BR>
<B> Low-density, high specific stiffness ceramic and metal open-cell foam materials may be utilized for creation of an innovative fuel matrix for use in space nuclear reactors. Highly porous structural foam may be developed for high thermal efficiency, high temperature fuel elements for both propulsion and gas-cooled power reactors. Current designs, such as annular rods or pebble beds, cannot operate at extremely high temperatures and thus limit efficiency. In this project, the foam fuel material will ultimately consist of a tricarbide, UZrNbC, composed of enriched uranium that is vapor infiltrated into a foam matrix of niobium carbide (NbC) and zirconium carbide (ZrC), although tantalum carbide (TaC) will be substituted for uranium carbide (UC) during initial development. The porous structure provides an extended surface area for highly efficient heat transfer and reduces density, reducing hydrogen turbopump power demands and increasing thrust-to-weight ratio. The foam matrix can have 80-90% open porosity for maximum convection, and the ligament dimensions can be tailored to provide either good or poor thermal conduction as needed. Recent work on porous materials has demonstrated effective heat transfer coefficients with helium near 26,000 W/m2?K. NbC and ZrC foams have several important advantages over other high temperature materials, including low density, lack of degradation in hydrogen at 3000 K (where they also retain structural integrity), and minimal neutron cross-section. The dispersed fissile material is an integral part of a high-conductivity matrix. Thus, a much lower temperature difference can exist between the fuel and the propellant. Extremely high outlet temperatures can be achieved, yielding the high specific impulse required for interplanetary exploration. Ultramet will team with Sandia National Laboratories to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating porous foam fuel elements into a new reactor concept for compact, high-performance space reactors. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> In addition to compact, high-performance space reactors, the proposed technology will assist development of ion drive, plasma thrusters, and fusion propulsion. The foam fuel matrix could also contribute to a new DOE Generation IV power system that significantly lowers cost, improves passive safety, has no carbon dioxide emissions, uses an advanced, proliferation-resistant fuel cycle, and reduces nuclear waste. The foam fuel could also be used in ground-based power or in portable power systems for military or surveillance applications and remote deployment, as well as impact other applications in electronics, aerospace, and catalysis. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> Propulsion technologies are sought that will enable dramatic improvements in space transportation safety, reliability, and cost. Key to this goal is the application of innovative, non-traditional propulsion technologies, devices, and systems that could significantly increase the structural margins of future launch systems and substantially reduce the mission times for interplanetary and deep space spacecraft. Development of such technologies is sought to enable ambitious commercial, robotic, and human exploration missions in the future. Technology innovations are sought that would provide significant advancements in space transportation capability and lead to the development of safe, affordable, high-performance propulsion technologies, specifically including high-efficiency nuclear-electric propulsion systems. </B>

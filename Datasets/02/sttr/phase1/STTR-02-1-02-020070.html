TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS):<BR>
<B> Modern airfoil design evaluation requires accurate analysis of both structural dynamic as well as fluid oscillatory response.  The level of calculation reliability has, in principle, increased significantly, so that now the opportunity exists to optimize aeroelastic behavior in the design stage. This is made possible by new high fidelity structural and CFD tools which predict airfoil steady and transient aero loading, as well as stress and vibrational behavior.  However, while single runs of the applicable COTS codes can be parallel-processed reasonably quickly, computational time becomes pacing in airfoil development due to the many iterations that must be performed in order to optimize lift/weight ratios, while ensuring that aeroelastic flutter is avoided.   Automated Multi-Disciplinary Optimization (MDO) computer algorithms can address this analysis bottleneck, but attempts to date have had only limited success, due to problems with slow convergence and local minima.  MSI will locate the true minimum of the multi-disciplinary objective function through a unique optimization approach making appropriate use of stochastic methods.   The technique accounts for design constraints, such as component thicknesses and aspect ratios, for airfoils that are practical and cost-effective.  Using MSI?s Stochastic Optimization of Airfoil Response (SOAR) methodology, time-savings of several-fold are expected in airfoil design optimization. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> The SOAR algorithm may be applied to commercial aircraft airfoil design and development, for both large and small aircraft.  The procedure may be used for winged aircraft or helicopters.  In addition, with further commercial development in Phase III, the approach may be applied to other transportation fields, as well as to engineering optimization in general. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> The SOAR approach is applicable to re-usable launch vehicles, efficient UAV development, new civilian and military aircraft, and improvement studies for existing aircraft, in particular those challenged by issues of relative weight or inappropriate aeroelastic  response.  In Phase III, other applications can be explored, such as entire airframe optimization. </B>

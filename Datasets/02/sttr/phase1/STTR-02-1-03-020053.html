TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS):<BR>
<B> This proposal will enable the most efficient integration of NASA?s semiconductor lasers into strategic optical systems.  To protect laser lifetimes and increase performance, these lasers will require isolators to protect them from back-reflections, similar to the isolators in all fiber-optic networks.  This work proposes to monolithically integrate magneto-optical isolators with semiconductor platforms in order to reduce the size and weight, as well as increase the performance, of NASA?s semiconductor laser systems.  The important elements in an integrated isolator are 1) magneto-optical waveguides and 2) permanent magnet biasing films.  Yttrium iron garnet (YIG), the strongest magneto-optical material, is very difficult to grow onto semiconductor platforms.  This work will use a novel technique, metallorganic chemical liquid deposition (MOCLD) to achieve this feat.  Preliminary results have demonstrated the feasibility, but not the optimization, of this technique.  Permanent magnet films of SmCo have also demonstrated promise as biasing magnets in waveguide isolators.  Here, SmCo films will be made using a novel in-situ nitriding technique during Sm and Co codeposition. Also proposed is the optimization of buffer layers, which buffer substrates during growth and act as optical claddings. Ridge and interferometer components will be modeled using the beam propagation method before prototype isolators are fabricated. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> Optical communications, optical signal processing, and optical data storage systems are all areas that will benefit from the realization of feasible Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs).  The proposed magneto-optical components, namely isolators, will allow this realization as they extend laser lifetimes and, in dramatic cases, prevent loss of mode lock. This work will also lead to advances in magneto-optical spatial light modulators (MO-SLMs), which when fabricated by standard photolithography have potential for ultrahigh resolution screens.  Besides decreasing the size, weight and cost, monolithic integration of electronics with magneto-optical components will also increase the speed and reliability of MO-SLMs. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> At the heart of most NASA missions is the need for high performance devices with low power and small dimension requirements.  The results of this proposal will lead to excellent photonics integrated circuits (PICs) that meet these rigorous NASA standards.  Therefore, the results will most directly apply to ?Active Optical Systems and Technology? branch of Research Topic 3: Earth Science and Physics and Astronomy.  Specifically, the photonic isolating components that emerge from this work will enable the most efficient integration of compact semiconductor lasers into Passive Remote Sensing Detector Systems. </B>

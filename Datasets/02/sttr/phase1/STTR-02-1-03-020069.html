TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS):<BR>
<B> A collaborative effort between MEMX and Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) is proposed to develop an innovative approach to enhancing LIDAR and optical communication transmitter systems and components with Micro ElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) beam steering components.  The MEMS Optical Beam Steerers  (MOBSTERs) will demonstrate a capability that is scalable to space or can be mounted on a relevant platform (UAV, long duration balloon, or aircraft) for calibration/validation of a spaceborne system.  These Optical Beam Steerers are highly miniaturized with an emphasis on low weight, small volume and low power.  The prototype system to be studied would consist of components that can be easily migrated to a space qualified design.  To date, MEMS technology has not been used in these applications, and will allow by virtue of their size and mechanical integration significant miniaturization and weight reduction, as well as the potential for multiplicity and redundancy. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> The evolving need for increases in satellite communication bandwidths is pushing the state-of-the-art beyond microwaves to optical frequencies. JHU/APL is moving forward on addressing this need by developing a multi-channel video communications paradigm that employs laser terminals in space using an open architecture and scanned optical beams, (which can be developed by MEMX) connecting both fixed and mobile users. Millimeter-wave backup will also be provided for severe weather conditions. Initial projected optical link capabilities at tera-bits per user channel are feasible, however, and they offer orders-of-magnitude improvement over existing RF systems in the near-term. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):<BR>
<B> A new multi-functional 3-D LIDAR system concept has been developed by JHU/APL that incorporates multi-channel micro-mirror arrays, which can be fabricated by MEMX. This technology can be combined with multi-wavelength fiber lasers and high-speed optical modulator arrays to support a wide variety of measurements from a single platform.  This system can adapt in real-time to measure land surface profiles, map aerosols and clouds, measure atmospheric temperature, humidity, and wind speeds, and land surface vibrations. Agile laser tuning, pseudo-random coding, and continuous-wave modulation are additional features that can be used for atmospheric spectroscopy, profiling, and Doppler or laser vibrometry, respectively. </B>

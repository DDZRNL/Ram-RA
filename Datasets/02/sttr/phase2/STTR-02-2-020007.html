TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The MAST (Multi-Application Survivable Tether) team, consisting of Tethers Unlimited, Inc. (TUI) and the Standford University Space Systems Development Laboratory (SSDL), propose to develop and fly a very low cost nanosatellite experiment that will demonstrate the deployment of a lightweight multiline tether on orbit and obtain data on its survivability in the micrometeoroid and orbital debris environment.  In the Phase I effort, we designed an experiment in which three CubeSats will deploy a 1-kilometer long Hoytether in space,  and the middle CubeSat will slowly crawl along the tether, inspecting it for damage.  We successfully prototyped and tested key components for this experiment, including a separation/ejection mechanism and avionics for communications, command, and data handling.  During the Phase I we also secured $89K in additional, non-SBIR funding that is supporting the development of the crawler and inspector subsystems.  In the Phase II effort, we will build and fly the CubeSat-based MAST experiment.  The mission will obtain data on tether survivability and tether dynamics that are crucial to the design of all future tether missions. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The Phase II effort will demonstrate a space-survivable tether structure that will enable tethers to be used for a wide range of long-duration space missions. The primary advantage of space tethers relative to competing technologies is that they can provide microsatellites with propulsion for orbit raising, station-keeping, and inclination changes with zero propellant expenditure, and can thus provide large total delta-Vs with very low mass requirements.  Other tether applications include formation flying and modification of the radiation belts. During the Phase I effort, we were awarded three non-SBIR/STTR contracts from DARPA and NASA worth over $1,115,000 to develop tether technologies and applications.  Although tether propulsion technologies will be developed specifically for the growing microsatellite market as part of this experiment, the technologies are easily scalable to application on larger spacecraft such as the next generation of telecommunications satellite constellations. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The propellantless nature of tether propulsion will result in highly capable small spacecraft for future Earth science missions that can perform many more orbital maneuvers during their lifetimes than could be achieved with a propellant-limited propulsion. This will enable microsatellites deployed from the Shuttle SHELS payload adapter to raise their orbits up to 2,000 km, allowing longer-duration missions, while maintaining high payload fractions.  Tethers will also make feasible formation flying missions, such for SAR and long-baseline interferometry studies, which require large total delta-Vs that are not feasible with propulsion systems that require propellant. Additionally, the technologies developed and demonstrated in the proposed SBIR will be scalable to much larger applications, such as orbital maintenance of the International Space Station or a momentum exchange tether facility that can reduce the cost of lunar, Mars, and deep-space missions. </B>

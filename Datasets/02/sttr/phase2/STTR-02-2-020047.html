TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>ORBITEC, working in cooperation with The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD), and others, proposes to develop TAGS II: Tether Electrodynamic Spinup and Survivability Experiment (TESSX).  TESSX is a spinning tethered space system, consisting of two end masses separated by an electrodynamic tether.  TESSX is believed to be a critically important step in the evolution of several tether applications, addressing: tether electrodynamics; tether survivability and safety; tether deployment, management and tracking; multi-amp current collection and emission; and system deployment and spin-up.  The resulting TESSX hardware, software, analysis and other technologies will have direct application to the Tethered Artificial Gravity Spacecraft (TAGS), Tether Reboost System (TRS) and Momentum-eXchange Electrodynamic Reboost (MXER) for in-space propulsion, and other tethered systems.  The Phase II program will draw on the successful results of the Phase I work and include: the development and delivery to NASA of a multi-strand computer controlled tether deployment system; detailed TESSX systems dynamics and electrodynamics analysis and experimental verification; development of a detailed and optimized TESSX architecture, compatible with ELV constraints; a Phase III TESSX cost analysis and development plan; and commercial applications planning. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>This work would have direct relevance to a variety of applications, including: tethers for in-space satellite propulsion via momentum exchange or direct electrodynamic boost; international Space Station re-boost and waste reject; generation of artificial gravity to support long-term human exploration and science; reentry of drag-decelerated tethered satellites/capsules; short-term power generation using electrodynamic tethers; tethered probes for the collection of a sample of martian atmospheric dust; and many other areas. Specific subsystems and technologies that may find application in these tethered systems include: control software; tether deployer system; tether tensiometers; spin-up and stabilization propulsion system; anode and cathode technology; and tethers. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>Specific technologies that could find non-NASA commercial applications in a variety of space systems include the: control software; tether deployer system; tether tensiometers; spin-up and stabilization propulsion system; anode and cathode technology; and tethers.  Once successfully implemented, MXER and TSR tethered systems are expected to find an abundance of commercial in-space propulsion opportunities.  A mature TAGS system will likely be utilized by industry to assist with new technology and product developments.  The deployer and tensiometer systems developed during the Phase II program could also find application in the commercial and recreational fishing, paper, and textile industries. </B>

TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The innovation, that we call ARTEMIS (Autonomous Real-Time EMbedded Immune System) is a solution that combines configurable real-time embedded software technology with extensions to model-based reasoning (MBR) to increase the level of autonomy in complex distributed real-time systems. The solution provides policies and mechanisms to detect, diagnose, and reconfigure systems in the presence of failures, observation conflicts, or unforeseen situations. The technology provides new capabilities that are especially suited to NASA?s Aerospace Technology, Space Flight, and Space Science Enterprises. The innovation directly addresses STTR 2002 Sub-topic #1, which describes a need for new technologies for ?Autonomous Spacecraft, Rovers, and Other Complex Systems.? A key objective of a Phase II award is to create a first product using the newly-developed technology. We have chosen to focus on a product that applies ARTEMIS specifically to sensor/actuator network (SAN) applications. These are networks of very small embedded processors, ranging from the dozens to hundreds (or even thousands), generally in a very localized area. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The National Research Council report entitled, Embedded Everywhere: A Research Agenda for Networked Systems of Embedded Computers, discusses the next generation of complex systems. Unlike many of today?s large monolithic computers, future application may encompass hundreds or thousands of distributed embedded computers. A common problem with all of these applications that are currently preventing deployment is the difficulty in testing, diagnosing, debugging, and repairing the large networks. The proposed innovation directly addresses this need. The first target market for ARTEMIS is the large machine health and diagnostics market. Other commercial markets that may follow include physiological and performance monitoring, environmental monitoring, and asset management and location tracking. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>As NASA space systems become increasingly complex and operate in increasingly distant occluded locations, the need for intelligent control continues to grow. Examples of systems that could benefit from autonomy include Space Flight Enterprise's International Space Station and Space Shuttle, Aerospace Technology Enterprise's launch vehicles, and Space Science's deep space missions, rovers and non-Earth orbiters. The proposed real-time modifications and extensions to a MBR engine are especially of interest to serveral researchers NASA ARC who are working on diagnostics and vehicle health maintenance applications. The key application for first deployment, namely SANs, may provide the level of reliability and robustness needed to use such networks in exploration missions, and is of great interest to several technical staff members working on the Mars rovers at NASA?s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. </B>

TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The innovation of this project is to bring the power and flexibility of a wireless computer network to harsh-environment fieldwork.  By integrating a small computer with GPS and a multi-channel digitizer we have created a network node which is low cost, low power, adaptable to practically any electronic instrumentation, and capable of storing large volumes of data over long field deployments.  The node's wireless capability permits data sharing (redundancy) and cost-saving data retrieval via telemetry. During Phase I we exceeded our research objectives by building and testing a working prototype and in consequence have enlisted the interest and enthusiasm of a host of Geophysicists for a variety of experiments.  Our baseline test plan in Phase II is a seismic experiment on Whillans icestream, West Antarctica, now supplemented by additional potential research projects. These include ice dynamics surveys on coastal outlet glaciers in Greenland, seismic monitoring of Alaskan tidewater glacier calving, bat research in Southeast Alaska, and bistatic radar sounding experiments on Antarctic ice sheets. These wireless networks are built on the open source paradigm based in our cultural enthusiasm for what we can accomplish as explorers; they will facilitate the next generation of scientific fieldwork on earth and beyond. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>Traditional oil exploration research recovers geophone echo data via fragile cables, an expensive, inefficient and labor-intensive process. The  wireless sensor nodes built in this project are designed for passive seismic experiments, using a geophone to record echoes from explosive detonations in Antarctica. These devices are directly applicable to oil exploration 'right out of the box', and this is just the starting point of their commercial application potential. This potential extends to any information-intensive human endeavor, any situation where a remote electronic instrument would be used to monitor some environmental parameter.  Examples include snow pack and avalanche hazard assessment near roads and populated areas, tracking traffic flow, flood and water channel monitoring, even counting salmon migrating up-river. By combining low-power electronics with photovoltaic power and wireless telemetry, a low-cost autonomous wireless network can be installed to operate for months or years with minimal maintenance and transparent data recovery. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>NASA's Earth Science Enterprise is dedicated to understanding our earth system, a program of cooperative research that (literally) from the ground up relies heavily on in situ data from remote and often harsh environments. Intelligent wireless sensor networks built herein are low cost, low power, adaptable to virtually any field instrumentation, and ruggedized to operate at extreme temperatures.  Based on colleague interest, we mention as application examples: Ice dynamic measurements on coastal outlet glaciers in Greenland, bat ecobiology research in Southeast Alaska, bistatic radio echo sounding measurements of Antarctic ice sheet basal temperature regimes and geothermal hot-spots, volcano infrasound and seismic measurements in Hawaii, and temperate tidewater glacier fracture-calving mechanics, among many others. Taking advantage of intrinsic computational power, wireless telemetry data retrieval, and large safe data storage capacity, the 'BRICK' wireless sensor networks provide flexibility, cost savings, and safe high-volume data recovery  to scientists with tightly constrained research budgets. </B>

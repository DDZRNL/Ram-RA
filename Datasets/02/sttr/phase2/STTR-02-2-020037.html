TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>Pilot fatigue in atmospheric flight operation is a major contribution to human error and is a serious concern.  The product under development is a small pilot-mounted device which monitors physiological reactions, such as blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature and brain activity as well as the vibration environment in which the pilot is operating.  Using these inputs as well as knowledge of the pilot?s state before coming on duty, the device will monitor the human fatigue state of the pilot.  Before a pilot?s fatigue state reaches a pre-determined threshold the pilot and/or mission planner is alerted.  Such a device allows monitoring of the fatigue state of any decision maker who is subject to stress and provides a means of alleviating fatigue-induced human error.  Development of the fatigue meter is highly dependent on simulation of the device in the flexible aircraft, such as in the STARS software package.  With a view to reducing the development time, advanced computational efficiency methods shall be investigated by the RI and implemented in the design cycle by the SBC.  The RI shall investigate structural analysis and control using piezoelectric and piezoceramic sensors and actuators relevant to the pilot?s environmental input to the fatigue meter. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The range of applications originating from government requirements will include operation of air land and sea vehicles in the various divisions the military services.  The fatigue meter device will be useful for evaluation of new vehicle types and for in-service measuring and monitoring of fatigue exposure of individual service personnel as they carry out their operational duties.  The information acquired will be useful defining new design requirements and for health and safety assessments by both the military authorities and the representatives of the operators.  The information can be used to provide evidence in support of any investigations where operator or personnel fatigue is thought to be a relevant factor.  The airlines, the airline pilots association and the FAA have been working together to reduce the potential for fatigue induced human error accidents.  A device which provides a means to measure human fatigue would have a viable market within this sector. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>Since the various divisions of NASA are involved in both air vehicle modifications and new vehicle development, evaluation and testing, it is anticipated that considerable consultancy and hardware sales would be with NASA.  Both the aircraft flight test and the space shuttle environments are well suited for application of this product.  Success in both environments is highly dependent on human performance, with respect to the test pilots and astronauts as well as the supporting personnel.  This product allows the monitoring of the human fatigue of key decision makers, giving visibility of this factor to mission planners.  In an environment where higher standards of safety are constantly pursued it is considered that this product provides a means of reducing the threat posed by human fatigue to safe aircraft and spacecraft operations. </B>

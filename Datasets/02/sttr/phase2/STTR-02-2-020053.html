TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>This work proposes to capitalize on our Phase I success in monolithically integrating magneto-optic and magnetic materials with semiconductor platforms in order to reduce the size and weight, as well as increase the performance, of NASA?s strategic optical systems.  Nonreciprocal components play extremely important role in laser systems and telecommunications. Currently all such components are discrete; there are no fully monolithically integrated nonreciprocal components available in the market. This work will use a novel technique, metallorganic chemical liquid deposition (MOCLD) to achieve this feat.  Phase I results have demonstrated the feasibility of this technique in fabricating doped and undoped magneto-optic films, as well as buffer layers, onto semiconductors.  Permanent magnet films were also grown with sufficient strengths to bias the magneto-optic films for fully integrated waveguide isolators. All of these materials will be optimized during initial fabrication/characterization tasks in the Phase II program. Also, prototype devices will continue to be simulated using the beam propagation method. These simulation results will allow a fast path toward fabricating prototype devices with minimal processing/testing iterations. Photonic circuitry with electric and magnetic drives and magnetophotonic crystals will also be designed and developed in this Phase II program. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The proposed materials and devices provide a complete solution to integrated optical isolator applications in both NASA and commercial fiber optic communication systems. These devices will extend laser lifetimes without bulky components and normal alignment issues. The new integrated devices promise substantial reduction in cost and size, as well as improvement in performance.  Therefore, it is anticipated that the success will lead to practical devices for not only space applications, but also for applications in the military and commercial sectors. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>At the heart of most NASA missions is the need for high performance devices with low power and small dimension requirements.  The results of this proposal will lead to excellent photonics integrated circuits (PICs) that meet these rigorous NASA standards.  Therefore, the results will most directly apply to ?Active Optical Systems and Technology? branch of Research Topic 3: Earth Science and Physics and Astronomy.  Specifically, the photonic isolating components that emerge from this work will enable the most efficient integration of compact semiconductor lasers into Passive Remote Sensing Detector Systems. </B>

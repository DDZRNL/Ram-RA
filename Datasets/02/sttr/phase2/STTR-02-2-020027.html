TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>Scientific Systems Co. Inc. and University of California at Berkeley propose to develop, test and implement a Multi-layer Architecture for Trajectory Replanning and Intelligent plan eXecution (MATRIX) system for fixed and rotary wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The MATRIX system
<br>architecture will consist of several layers including the on-line
<br>path planning and trajectory generation layers, and vision-based obstacle
<br>detection and identification that provides the obstacle information
<br>nedded for path replanning. The architecture also includes the
<br>Failure Detection and Identification (FDI) system and Adaptive
<br>Reconfigurable Controller (ARC), along with a module for on-line 
<br>calculation of Achievable Dynamic Performance (ADP) which determines
<br>the maximum performance that can be achieved post-failure with 
<br>the available control authority. In order to develop, test and
<br>implement the MATRIX system, the following tasks will be carried
<br>out: (i) Develop obstacle avoidance algorithms and implement 
<br>them using the RMax helicopter simulator under Matlab/Simulink.
<br>%the RIPTIDE tool; (ii) Develop vision-based obstacle detection algorithms and implement them under Matlab/Simulink; (iii) Integrate and test obstacle detection and obstacle avoidance algorithms under 
<br>suitable simulation environment such as RIPTIDE and MultiUAV simulation tool; and (iv) Develop the MATRIX software tool and pursue its commercialization. </B>
<P>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>Potential non-NASA applications of the MATRIX system
<br>are in the area of intelligent autonomy for single and multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and Uninhabited Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAV). Autonomous intelligent control systems will find wide applications in other programs such as  Air Traffic Control  and Intelligent Vehicle Highways. Related applications are envisioned in the areas of robotics, and unmanned ground, underwater and surface vehicles. </B>
<P>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The proposed MATRIX system and related technologies are critical for realizing the vision of  the NASA Aviation Safety Program to reduce the aviation  fatal accident rate by a factor of 5 by year 2007, and by a factor of 10 by  year 2022. The link to this program is through autonomous intelligent collision avoidance in the airspace shared by manned and unmanned vehicles. The techniques developed under this project are expected to contribute to technologies that will enable autonomous commercial flight in the future, such as those being developed under the NASA Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS).

TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>ORBITEC and the University of Wisconsin-Madison propose to continue the development of a low-cost, non-intrusive, wavelength-agile optical rocket propulsion sensor (WORPS) to interrogate rocket exhaust plumes and cryogenic fluid properties.  The innovative sensor system uses an amplified Chirped White Pulse Emitter (CWPE) to generate high-power wavelength-agile light for probing rocket plumes.  It also uses a high-power wavelength-multiplexed differential absorption scheme for probing LOX lines.  The plume sensor provides planar images of gas temperature and species concentrations.  Furthermore, these measurements will be continuous (one planar measurement every 62 ?Ys) and therefore useful for monitoring the evolution of rocket plume properties.  The LOX portion of the Phase II system will be capable of accurate (better than 0.1% error) measurements of LOX concentration in cryogenic fluids with 3 ?Ys time response.  The LOX sensor may also be extended to enable determination of LOX flow rates.  Phase II will begin with a focus on additional testing of the Phase I sensors.  The sensors will then be refined, tested extensively in a variety of rocket exhaust plumes and in a LOX delivery system, and assembled into a portable, user-friendly package for delivery to NASA/SSC. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>All industries requiring non-invasive sensing of gas or liquid properties with fast-time response will benefit from the technology.  These include virtually all types of engines (rocket, gas turbine, piston, etc.) and associated systems as well as many industrial process monitoring applications.  In addition, wavelength-agile light can be used to monitor solid properties, either directly or by embedding fiber-optic sensors. Large industries that may find the technology attractive include the automotive industry for internal combustion engine monitoring and emissions control, the commercial aircraft industry for jet engines and gas turbines, and the power production industry for coal, oil, and natural gas burners. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>By the conclusion of Phase II, a single WORPS system is expected to cost less than $5000 and have the capability to monitor multiple gas or liquid properties with time response of 1 ?Ys.  Such devices are invaluable to propulsion system developers.  Because the WORPS technology can be applied to both combustion and cryogenic systems, the NASA market is large.  Potential NASA applications include use for propulsion system monitoring in testing facilities at NASA/SSC, NASA/MSFC, NASA/GRC, NASA/ARC, and NASA/KSC.  Because the proposed WORPS system technology is lightweight and has only a few key components, it could potentially find use as a diagnostic tool for on-orbit microgravity combustion, gas, and fluid experiments aboard the Shuttle and ISS.  Real-time, in-flight monitoring of the SSME, and other flight units, for propulsion system health represents another applications for the mature WORPS system. </B>

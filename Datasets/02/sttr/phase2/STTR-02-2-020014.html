TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>Low-density, high specific stiffness ceramic and metal open-cell foams may be utilized for creation of an innovative fuel element for use in space nuclear reactors. Highly porous structural foam may be developed for high thermal efficiency, high temperature fuel elements for both propulsion and gas-cooled power reactors. Current designs, such as annular rods or pebble beds, cannot operate at extremely high temperatures and thus limit efficiency. In the proposed Phase II project, the foam fuel element material will consist of a tricarbide, U(ZrNbC), composed of uranium carbide that is vapor infiltrated into a foam matrix of niobium carbide and zirconium carbide (in Phase I, tantalum carbide was substituted for uranium carbide). The porous foam structure provides an extended surface area for highly efficient heat transfer and reduces density, reducing hydrogen turbopump power demands and increasing thrust-to-weight ratio. In Phase I, Ultramet teamed with Sandia National Laboratories to demonstrate the feasibility of these highly innovative foam fuel elements. This work included chemical vapor infiltration of the carbides into an open-cell foam skeletal structure by Ultramet and fabrication of a matrix of foam densities for thermal/gas flow testing at Sandia. The results of flow testing, coupled with the results of thermomechanical modeling performed at Sandia, confirmed the high potential of this design following continued development. In Phase II, Ultramet and Sandia propose to develop and demonstrate fabrication of the actual (U-Zr-Nb)C foam fuel material. Ultramet will finalize process optimization using the (Ta-Zr-Nb)C material and provide the processing conditions to Sandia which, in conjunction with the University of Florida Institute of Space Power and Propulsion (INSPI) facility, will produce and test (U-Zr-Nb)C foam in a hot hydrogen environment. Sandia will also perform comprehensive thermomechanical modeling, expanding on the modeling performed in Phase I. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>In addition to compact, high-performance space reactors, the proposed technology will assist development of ion drive, plasma thrusters, and fusion propulsion. The foam fuel elements could also contribute to a new DOE Generation IV power system that significantly lowers cost, improves passive safety, has no carbon dioxide emissions, uses an advanced, proliferation-resistant fuel cycle, and reduces nuclear waste. The foam fuel could also be used in ground-based power or in portable power systems for military or surveillance applications and remote deployment, as well as impact other applications in electronics, aerospace, and catalysis. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>Propulsion technologies are sought that will enable dramatic improvements in space transportation safety, reliability, and cost. Key to this goal is the application of innovative, non-traditional propulsion technologies, devices, and systems that could significantly increase the structural margins of future launch systems and substantially reduce the mission times for interplanetary and deep space spacecraft. Development of such technologies is sought to enable ambitious commercial, robotic, and human exploration missions in the future. Technology innovations are sought that would provide significant advancements in space transportation capability and lead to the development of safe, affordable, high-performance propulsion technologies, specifically including high-efficiency nuclear-electric propulsion systems. Specific NASA applications include the Jupiter Icy Moons Mission (JIMO), which will be the first program to take advantage of spacecraft power system development being performed under Project Prometheus. JIMO will utilize a nuclear fission reactor for propulsion as well as production of the large amount of electrical energy required for scientific instruments (including deep penetrating radar), mission design options, and telecommunications. The proposed high-value project can have a timely and direct impact on Project Prometheus goals. </B>

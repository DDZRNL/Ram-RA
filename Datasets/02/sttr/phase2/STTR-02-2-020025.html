TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>UltraSail, proposed by a team of CU Aerospace, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, SRS Technologies, and VACCO Industries, is a next-generation high-risk, high-payoff sail system for the launch, deployment, stabilization and control of very large (km^2 class) solar sails enabling high payload mass fractions for interplanetary and deep space spacecraft.  UltraSail is an innovative, non-traditional approach to propulsion technology achieved by combining propulsion and control systems developed for formation-flying microsatellites with an innovative solar sail architecture to achieve controllable sail areas approaching 1 km^2, sail subsystem area densities approaching 1 g/m^2, and thrust levels many times those of ion thrusters used for comparable deep space missions.  UltraSail can achieve outer planetary rendezvous, a deep space capability now reserved for high-mass nuclear and chemical systems.  The primary innovation presented in Phase I was the near-elimination of sail supporting structures by attaching each blade tip to a formation-flying microsatellite which deploys the sail, and then articulates the sail to provide attitude control, including spin stabilization and precession of the spin axis.  These tip microsatellites are controlled by a 3-axis microthruster metrology system to control sail film deployment. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>UltraSail may have military applications for earth-observing missions at high orbit where stationary observing is useful ? e.g. pole-sitting missions.  Also, NOAA and NSF have strong interests in the science that can be returned using sails in non-Keplerian orbits. </B>
<P>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>UltraSail is potentially useful for a range of robotic missions ranging from Sun-Earth Lagrange point L1 to Mars to the Kuiper Belt.  An attractive application is an outer planet mission such as a Titan orbiter.  Initial results indicate that high payload mass fractions are achievable. </B>

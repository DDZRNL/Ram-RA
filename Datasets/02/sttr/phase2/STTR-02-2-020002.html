TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The purpose of this project is to develop a portable, hands free device for emergency medical decision support to be used in remote or confined settings by non-physician providers.  Phase I of the project will entail the development of a voice-activated device that will utilize an intelligent algorithm to provide guidance in establishing an airway in an emergency situation. The interactive, hands free software will process requests for assistance based on verbal prompts and algorithmic decision-making.  The device will allow the CMO to attend to the patient while receiving verbal instruction. The software will also feature graphic representations where it is felt helpful in aiding in procedures.  We will also develop a training program to orient users to the algorithmic approach, the use of the hardware and specific procedural considerations. We will validate the efficacy of this mode of technology application by testing in the Johns Hopkins Department of Emergency Medicine. Phase I of the project will focus on the validation of the proposed algorithm, testing and validation of the decision making tool and modifications of medical equipment. In Phase II, we will produce the first generation software for hands-free, interactive medical decision making for use in acute care environments. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The medical decision software, the algorithmic approach and the hands free technology will be combined to provide a product that can have wide applicability to the emergency care community. Once the technology and software have been developed and tested in the clinical setting, and training programs designed for orientation, it should be an easily marketable technology to almost any medical/para-medical organization.  Any algorithm based approach could be adapted to this technology, including Advanced Cardiac Life Support, pre-hospital/paramedic protocols and decision making support for remote or mobile care climates. While it will be useful in the hospital environment, its greatest impact might be on the military and other similar organizations whose infrastructure ?in the field? is not as developed as that of the civilian world. Any isolated population, ie, ship, base, etc. could easily benefit from intelligent, hands free decision-making technology and employ it with very minimal training. This will allow for emergency services to be accessed/provided with more speed, accuracy and reproducibility. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>Hands free medical decision support in the international space station.  Potentially, medical decision support in all of NASA's ground and space facilities. </B>

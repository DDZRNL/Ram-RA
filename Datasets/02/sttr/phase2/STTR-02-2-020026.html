TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The ability to quickly estimate flight vehicle behavior in an operational environment is important since engineers from a variety of disciplines require accurate predictions in order to plan flight test experiments, expand aircraft operating envelopes safely, and have access to diagnostic methods when problems arise.  STARS is the most comprehensive multidisciplinary finite element-based software for design and analysis and as a simulation tool in flight test environment. STARS strength is in its capability to solve combined CFD, Structural, thermal and control problems. In this phase enhancements in capabilities in finite element-based computer programs with application to STARS are proposed. Enhancement of STARS capabilities are achieved through a complete and thorough evaluation of its structural FE compatibility and accuracy using NASTRAN and IDEAS for comparison; development of translator codes to seamlessly link NASTRAN preprocessor PATRAN with STARS; evaluation and enhancement of the current STARS-NASTRAN translator, NSTARS. Validations and enhancements in capabilities in finite element-based CFD with application to STARS are also proposed. CFDSOL module validation for boundary layer flow in variety of cases will be conducted. Methods for CFD-based stability and control derivative extraction will be developed and tested. Verification of newly developed STARS CFD-based ASE simulation capabilities will be conducted. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The technology developed in Phase II for enhancement in capabilities and compatibility of finite element-based software will have significant application in today?s multidisciplinary computational, modeling and simulation environment which has become critical in cutting down the design cycle time and resulting in significant savings in R&D. The proposed research has a dual commercial significance. First is its direct application to STARS and its wider commercial use in design, analysis, and simulation of all types of commercial aircraft, jet engines, automobile and engine components. Second, it creates a core competency at the SBC with significant potential for application to similar projects, and the demonstration of its application to STRAS provides a great marketing vehicle for the SBC. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>High-performance flight vehicles that are currently being designed have unprecedented levels of interactions of structures, aerodynamics, propulsion, and flight controls. This will impose considerable design margins for stability and control performance.  Therefore, an accurate simulation of flight characteristics of these flight vehicles, prior to testing, will ensure safety of the craft and the crew, relaxes design margin requirements, improve performance, and cut cost. Enhancements in capabilities, accuracy of STARS and its compatibility with widely accepted finite element codes such as NASTRAN we propos will be of immediate use for achieving these objectives within NASA, military and commercial applications. </B>

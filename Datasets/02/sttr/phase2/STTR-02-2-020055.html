TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The goal of this effort is to develop a compact, rugged, electrically efficient, tunable semiconductor laser for the purpose of injection seeding Nd:YAG lasers in NASA lidar systems for remote sensing and atmospheric profiling.  A highly stable low power seed laser plays a crucial role in these systems by keeping the high power, Q-switched, Nd:YAG laser at a fixed wavelength and single mode.  In addition, the seed laser reduces shot-to-shot intensity fluctuations due to mode beating in the YAG laser, which cause damage to internal optics and reduce the laser?s lifetime.  Current seed lasers are large, expensive, and suffer under vibration and field use.  The proposed miniature seed laser combines optical Bragg waveguide structures and new semiconductor laser technology to create a narrow linewidth laser at the precise wavelength.  The entire temperature-stabilized seed laser will be packaged in a robust one-inch-long fiber coupled housing for ultra-stable single frequency output in the face of external vibration and temperature fluctuations. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>One important aspect of the proposed Bragg-stabilized seed laser is that the approach will work equally well not just at 1064 nm but at any wavelength within the range of common laser diodes (i.e. throughout the visible and IR).  In contrast, comparable stable narrow linewidth lasers currently available exist only at discrete wavelengths (1064 nm and 1319 nm).  This capability will benefit applications in the military, sensing and environmental monitoring, and basic research.  Military applications include fiber optic sensors (also used in the private sector) including ship-based towed-arrays and static seabed-arrays.  The narrow linewidth and wavelength stability will also benefit remote sensing, precision spectroscopy, and metrology. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>NASA employs high power, Q-switched, Nd:YAG laser transmitters for high resolution topographical mapping, remote sensing of atmospheric winds, and profiling of atmospheric molecules and aerosols, that rely on being injection seeded with a stable, low power, cw laser.  Unseeded Nd:YAG lasers exhibit multi-mode behavior, wavering frequency, and a greatly reduced lifetime.  The size, reliability, and durability of this laser will make it ideal for injection locking airborne and space-based high power Nd:YAG lasers.  Other lower power NASA lidar efforts, such as wind lidar techniques and other atmospheric lidars, also need absolute single frequency operation with very high short term frequency stability.  The proposed seed laser design will prosper for these applications due to its small size, high efficiency, low thermal mass, and precise thermal control to achieve ultra-stable output. </B>

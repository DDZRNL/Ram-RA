TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The proposed project consists of the development of a three-dimensional, energy-based, acoustic sensor and related measurement techniques. This new sensor which is called an energy density sensor provides several advantages over conventional pressure microphones including significantly enhanced sound field characterizations, lower sensor count, reduced location/position sensitivity, and more global information. Although the focus of this work is in the acoustic free-field, advantages of the energy density sensor apply to both the free-field and enclosed environments. 
<br>
<br>Because the energy density sensors measure pressure and velocity, energy quantities such as kinetic energy, potential energy, energy density, and Lagrangian energy can be computed from the measurements. Software will be developed and implemented to make these computations. These quantities will allow users to improve their understanding of sound fields, surmise global sound field conditions, characterize and locate unknown sources, and conduct more efficient sound power measurements. The energy density sensors will also enable practical but comprehensive sound field assessments for environmental monitoring, noise control, and active sound field control in many free-field and enclosed field applications. It is further noted that measurement techniques involving these energy quantities have not been previously investigated or commercially developed.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>Because an energy density sensor is used to measure a fundamentally different quantity than convensional microphones the product can be extended to address many significant commercial applications.  Representative of these applications would be the computation of sound power, near-field acoustic holography, source identification, far-field directivity and acoustic equalization.  Energy density measurements have the potential to also be used successfully in the field of active noise control. Advances in any one of these applications would have a significant impact on the acoustic measurements community.  This phase II effort will focus specifically on producing commercial solutions for far-field directivity and sound power measurements. </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>Recently NASA has expressed interest in improved rocket plume measurements for which these sensors have direct application. Because of the harsh environment, it is not possible to locate conventional sensors near these sources and conventional far-field measurements are cumbersome and lack desired information. However, with an array of energy density sensors, further information can be inferred concerning acoustic radiation mechanisms in the near field of a source, based on the increased understanding of spatial field dependence available from the measurements. Although much can be inferred about the near field from the energy density measurements, high temperature and high pressure energy density sensors will also be explored in the Phase II effort. </B>

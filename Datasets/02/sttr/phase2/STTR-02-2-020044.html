TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>In this NASA Phase II STTR program Powdermet/Northwestern will fabricate a lightweight (2.4 g/cc, or equivalent to 0.8 kg/m2) thin-wall (0.3-0.5mm ) functional mirror with an angular resolution approaching one arc second. Phase I results demonstrated a composite mirror structure with a density a factor of two lower than the solid nickel with high strength , low CTE, and good optical figure.  The Phase II program is designed to develop manufacturing procedures for large (10 cm dia x 50 cm high) Wolter I mirror structures, and to generate detailed structure/property design for use with X-ray/space  telescopes. Through a teaming arrangement with Lockheed Martin and Ball Aerospace, design studies will be carried out on appropriate satellite configuration and integration design schemes, and basic studies will evaluate the new technology relative to existing applications, while identifying very near term applications/components for prototype demonstration purposes. </B>
<P>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The plasma spray free standing structures to be developed in this program will have commercial applications in sporting goods, commercial transports, industrial processing equipment, marine structures and submersibles. Sprayed sructures to be developed in this program have a unique blend of strength and density not available in any other material form. Fuirthermore, the scaleable manufacturing processes to be developed in the Phase II effort can be readily adapted to the production of other metal sprayed structures, inlcuding aluminum, steel, and magnesium for a wide range of light weight, high strength applications. </B>
<P>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The direct NASA application will be for lightweight X-ray-optics in missions such as Constellation-X and GOES. This high quality lightweight optic will be applicable for other missions too, where lightweight structures are needed. Generation-X is a mission concept for an X-ray observatory with an effective area of 150 m2 at 1 keV, and an angular resolution of ?i0.1 arc second. So light weight will be the key issue. This mission is in NASA!|s road map.
<br>
<br>Other NASA applications are:
<br>?<	Aircraft, satellite, and launch vehicle structures 
<br>?<	Engine liners
<br>?<	Acoustic Panels
<br>?<	Airframe Structure
<br>?<	Thermal barrier structure

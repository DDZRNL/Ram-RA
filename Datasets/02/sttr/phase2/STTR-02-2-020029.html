TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The Autonomous Power Scheduler (APS) being developed by AeroAstro and Los Alamos National Laboratory will significantly improve the performance of small spacecraft power management, resulting in better utilization of the limited power resources for their payloads and subsystems.  APS will dynamically monitor microsatellite power resources and then, by adaptively modifying the algorithmic solution applied by spacecraft systems, it will intelligently and autonomously schedule and distribute available power resources to the processing-intensive payloads and other spacecraft subsystems.
<br>
<br>Due to existing power management paradigms, small spacecraft are prohibited from hosting advanced processing-intensive payloads.  However, to maintain cost-effective and useful access to space, the future of small spacecraft will be to accomplish more intensive onboard processing.  APS will improve the orbital power efficiency of small spacecraft, especially those with processing-intensive payloads, by as much as 10% for an investment measured in hundreds of thousands of dollars.
<br>
<br>The overarching goal of proposed Phase II effort is to demonstrate and characterize the performance that can be achieved through implementation of the APS technology in future small satellite systems.  The Phase II effort is focused on integration and testing of the APS technology on a hardware testbed that is representative of a spacecraft platform.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>Any systems with demanding, power-hungry processing requirements are prime candidates for APS.  Theater-specific applications such as SAR, hyperspectral imaging, geo-location, and ELINT result in significant quantities of data.  Onboard data processing, often a necessity for these missions, would be enabled by APS.  UAVs, becoming more prevalent as an economical and timely method for military operations, homeland security, and SIGINT, suffer the same power demand problems as microsatellites.  Here, APS would provide the power management necessary to adaptively process gathered data into a final product.  Other potential applications are in the areas of terrestrial remote sensing, and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). </B>

POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)<BR>
<B>Numerous NASA missions can benefit from the APS technology, particularly those with processing-intensive payloads.  Sun-Earth Connection missions, with severely limited solar power collection and battery power/capacity to support the mission in its highly elliptical orbit, are perfect candidates for APS.  For interferometric spacecraft constellations using distributed data collection, APS would enable onboard data processing, reducing the volume of transmitted data.  Planetary missions with instruments deployed on a planet?s surface might have a limited opportunity to collect solar power but demanding data processing requirements.  APS would enable these missions to be accomplished in a smaller, more efficient spacecraft. </B>

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Los Gatos Research proposes to develop and test a novel medical diagnostic instrument that will non-invasively measure the ratio of the isotopic abundances of 13C to 12C in exhaled breath. The instrument, based on a new technology called Off-Axis ICOS, will be inexpensive, portable, easy to use, and report measurements with sufficient sensitivity and precision to replace mass spectrometry in 13C-labeled breath tests for diagnosis of several diseases, including diagnosis of liver fibrosis, bacterial overgrowth, pancreatitis, irritable bowel syndrome, sepsis, and infection. During Phase II, we will develop an instrument for measurement of the gastric emptying rate for diagnosis of gastroparesis and associated conditions. In addition, we will quantify the specificity and sensitivity of the instrument by incorporating it into clinical trials. The instrument will enable long-term studies of astronaut health based on non-intrusive breath analysis and thus addresses the needs of the Biomedical Research Program. The program will involve clinical testing in human subjects to demonstrate concept efficacy and thus meet Countermeasure Readiness Level 6. At the end of the program, the instrument will be available for evaluation with human subjects in controlled laboratory conditions simulating space flight environment and thus meet Countermeasure Readiness Level 7.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed instrument may be used for real-time determination of the health of an astronaut in flight and/or in ground-based studies based on the measurement of the stable isotopes of CO2 in exhaled breath.  The instrument may be applied for detection of a broad spectrum of medical conditions including gastroparesis and associated conditions (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux disease), diagnosis of liver fibrosis, bacterial overgrowth, pancreatitis, irritable bowel syndrome, metabolic stress, sepsis, and infection.  The proposed medical diagnostics instrument will be capable of achieving state-of-the-art precision, sensitivity, speed and reliability and thus compete favorably with existing technology for point-of-care measurements.  The proposed instrument will be the first compact and autonomous medical diagnostics device capable of addressing several important conditions based on the measurement of CO2 isotopes in breath including rate of gastric emptying, infection due to Helicobacter pylori, diagnosis of liver fibrosis, lactose intolerance, bacterial overgrowth, assessment of pancreatic function, and irritable bowel syndrome. Point-of-care breath analysis is attractive because it is minimally invasive, inexpensive and yields results quickly.  Present technology, based on mass spectrometry, is expensive and difficult to use.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In addition to the medical applications described above, the proposed technology may be used for real-time monitoring and control of chemical processing plants from measurements of important processes gases including CO, CO2, H2O, NH3, CH4 and various hydrocarbons, and for real-time monitoring of greenhouse gases, pollutants, and stable isotopes in the stratosphere and troposphere for validation and confirmation of atmospheric chemistry and transport models.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The main innovation is a new class of electron spectrometers with significant improvement in detector efficiency that results in a system with a 50x performance improvement over current technology. The analyzer design is based on an electric dispersion and an immersion front-end optic.  The improved performance allows a low mass, low power requirement, chemical analysis tool suitable for planetary missions. This tool is suitable for understanding the chemistry of geophysical materials and can detect signs of life or pre-biotic processes.  The ability to determine chemical state in addition to elemental composition of materials with no a priori knowledge of the materials provides a robust experimental capability for extracting information in situations where the environment is not totally known. A second innovation involves using a new sample access technology that eliminates valves or pumping from the Mars atmosphere. The XPS tool input only needs to be placed 1 mm from the sample area of interest. This greatly simplifies ease of use, makes sample introduction simple and improves reliability.  With, or without, the new sample system, the goal of the program will be a prototype XPS with a mass less than 10 kg that consumes less than 10 watts.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>

<br>The effect of the oxidants is a major question in the search for biosignatures on Mars and in special Earth locations. On Earth a small portable, field useable XPS system will provide in situ information and avoid the ever-present contamination effects that are a part of laboratory experiments.  Keeping samples in situ avoids the changing water levels and travel related contamination.  
<br>
<br>For Mars applications a mission compatible XPS will provide clear elemental and chemical state information with no a priori knowledge of the sample, which insures important knowledge is gained with XPS measurements. This tool will be suitable for understanding the chemistry of geophysical materials and provide an ability to detect signs of life or pre-biotic processes. 
<br>
<br>Measurements at Mars atmosphere conditions with the new sample system on earth will allow detail studies of the kinetics on Mars model materials,

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The small size and mass of the proposed XPS system and its potential low cost lends itself to applications as a dedicated tool in production environments.  Large markets for such products exist in the semiconductor industry for monitoring film production for gate oxides and Cu migration barriers. Similar markets also exist in the polymer industry for film surface preparation steps that lead to further processing and in the data storage media industry for media and head lubrication and corrosion protection films.
<br>
<br>The Mars Atmospheric Pressure Environment (MAPE) sample handling system being prepared can be reformatted to allow measurements at pressures up to 10 torr using conventional XPS systems.  This system modification will allow biological studies of materials with water content at sample temperatures above the freezing point and in situ studies of catalyst reactions in flowing gas streams at variable temperatures.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The need to acquire observations on oceanic and atmospheric physical and biogeochemical processes continues to increase. These data are presently being used as initial conditions for model forecasts, for creating climatological fields, for calibration and validation of remotely sensed data, for model data assimilation, and for flux estimates. Presently, autonomous sensor platforms have been designed as low cost expendables and are capable of taking measurements of temperature, salinity, wind speed, and bio-optics. Recent advances in the development of in situ ocean sensors will shortly allow these autonomous sensors to also obtain measurements of pCO2, nitrate, silicate, ammonium, and iron. However, as more sensors are included on the sensor package, the ability to use them as expendables is reduced dramatically. This proposal seeks to investigate the development and testing of a new low-cost sensor platform that would be capable of retrieval and reuse. The goal would be to develop a self-navigating, self-powered platform controlled via two-way satellite communication. This instrument platform could then be augmented with a wide variety of presently available oceanic and atmospheric sensors.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The OASIS sensor platform will allow NASA to deploy a wider suite of biogeochemical, and physical sensors in the ocean for Calibration and Validation (Cal/Val) because the OASIS is a reusable low-cost platform. NASA collects synoptic data on the oceans from space. These data are necessary for assessing annual and seasonal climatologies, intra-seasonal and climate variability, ocean prediction and weather forecasting. The sensors used to obtain these measurements require a significant amount of in situ data for Cal/Val because the installed passive sensors are sensitive to changes in the composition of the earth?s atmosphere. The use of in situ observations to calibrate all NASA products is currently not possible because high cost, and/or post-deployment calibrations requirements eliminate the possibility of installing many useful sensors on expendable platforms. The OASIS platform will enable NASA to affordably collect in-situ data for Cal/Val using a wider range of important sensors.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Development of a low cost, autonomous, recoverable surface sensor platform will provide scientific, commercial, and government organizations with the ability to obtain low-cost observations of the ocean and atmosphere.  The U.S. Global Carbon Cycle community will use this platform to obtain air-sea CO2 flux, pCO2 and wind measurements in a variety of ocean regions that are typically under-sampled by commercial and NOAA ships.  The climate community could use such a sensor platform to develop a dynamic ocean observational network for obtaining ocean data to forecast storms.  The scientific community has also expressed interest in the OASIS as a platform for the study of Harmful Algal Blooms (HAB).  Commercial use of this sensor platform would include environmental monitoring, water quality studies, oil spill tracking and nutrient dynamic studies.

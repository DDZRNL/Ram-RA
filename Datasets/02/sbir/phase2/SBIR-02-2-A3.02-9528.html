<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovation is the use of advanced GUI and underlying functionality to reduce the time and effort required for real-time air traffic simulation scenario development. Our product directly addresses efficient generation of scenarios for real-time HITL simulations which analyze NAS operational performance and economic impact. Thus, we are responsive to: next generation simulation and modeling capability; NAS operational performance, economic impact; and real-time simulations: components with different levels of fidelity, human in-the-loop - in the A3.02 subtopic. The project objectives are to field a working prototype during Phase-II that demonstrates efficient scenario generation and incorporate feedback into a range of profitable commercial scenario generation products. The Phase-II effort includes; (1) refine application requirements; (2) refine application architecture;, (3) implement and evaluate the Phase-II prototype; and (4) prepare Phase-III business plans. We anticipate the Phase-II prototype to demonstrate significant efficiency gains regarding scenario generation - initially for the ATM domain and subsequently for other domains. Our application supports NASA human factors research regarding; current and future airspace systems, human performance, human-computer interfaces, distributed human decision-making, and design/evaluation of decision support tools. Benefits include: (1) increased scenario generation efficiency by reducing both time and resource requirements; (2) usable scenario output across multiple simulation facilities; (3) compatibility with distributed simulations; and  (4) reduced need of expensive target simulation facilities for scenario development and evaluation.  The period of benefit will begin during Phase-II and continue as long as there is a need for efficient scenario generation ? we expect tangible benefits for the next 10 years.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The initial NASA application will enable scenarios used in real-time HITL simulations to be generated and changed much more efficiently than they are today. The Phase-II prototype will be the first demonstration of the collection of innovative features and is intended to provide tangible near-term benefits to NASA real-time simulation efforts such as the VAMS project. Our application will support more complex and extensive research into a variety of human factors issues regarding current and future airspace systems including:, human performance, human-computer interfaces, distributed human decision-making, and design and evaluation of decision support tools. The proposed application would enable not only increased efficiency in generating the initial scenario but would allow the scenario to be changed while preserving the salient features of the desired experiment. With some modifications to the initial application it will support additional NASA applications including: (1) scenario generation for fast-time air traffic simulators such as NASA?s Airspace Concept Evaluation System (ACES); (2) the study of integration of new vehicle concepts such as SATS aircraft, reusable launch vehicles, and uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs) into the National Airspace System; and (3) the static and dynamic visualization of air traffic research results.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The FAA, commercial airlines and fleet operators perform airspace analysis regularly. An improved scenario generation application would support; technology investment decision making, new procedure design, new operational concept robustness analysis, operations analysis, airport and airspace design and capacity studies, noise and emissions analysis, fleet response planning, and training. The FAA may use our product in connection with real-time simulations to provide quick-turnaround, human factors analysis of future operational concepts. Within commercial air traffic market, there is a growing demand for airspace operation simulation research to support: a) communication, navigation, and surveillance, and weather sensing equipment loading and placement analysis; b) UAV and commercial space launch scheduling and design; c) planning and procedure development; d) mission training and rehearsal; e) mission debrief; f) pilot training; g) safety training; h) aviation security threat analysis; i) situation re-enactment and post-mortem analysis; and j) accident/incident investigation. Our application can be used by scientific researchers as a graphical display and analysis tool for illustrating: conflict detection and resolution study result;, airport design or redesign; en route planning; and re-planning or weather avoidance research results. Adacel is interested in our application regarding generation of scenarios for non-ATM applications.

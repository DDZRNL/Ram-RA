<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovation is an integrated hybrid solid state electrochemical system providing co-generation of high purity hydrogen and electric power. The embodiment is a physical, chemical and thermal integration of three processes: (1) production high purity hydrogen, (2) electrochemical partial oxidation of hydrocarbon fuel, and (3) power generation by a solid oxide fuel cell. This highly integrated, multi-function system eliminates any need for the CO shift and cleanup process steps currently required to generate hydrogen for use in Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cell power plants being considered for aircraft electric propulsion and power needs. It also eliminates the efficiency penalty imposed by use of conventional partial oxidation reformers. Thermal integration of the endothermic hydrogen generation processes with the exothermic SOFC operation achieves several benefits, notably higher efficiency by chemical recuperation and much lower air pre-heater duty (size, weight and cost) by eliminating the need for excess cooling air. The process facilitates sequestration of fuel carbon content by segregation of product CO2 from non-condensable gases. This innovation closes a significant void in the technology required to implement efficient, quiet and clean electric aircraft propulsion and power systems.

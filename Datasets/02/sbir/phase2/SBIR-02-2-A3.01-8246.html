<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) concept envisions a dramatic change in demand on National Airspace System (NAS) resources: a significantly increased number of flights operating as needed on Point-to-Point (PTP) routes with smaller aircraft.  In addition to the increased demand on the NAS, the dynamic, ?on-demand?, nature of the SATS concept will present even greater challenges to the country?s Traffic Flow Management (TFM) system. The NAS regulates the flow of aircraft through TFM initiatives. However, the current TFM system does not perform well under uncertain demand patterns.  The innovation proposed herein creates a website marketplace for providers and consumers of SATS services. More importantly, our innovation links the information from this SATS website to the Nation?s TFM system. Critical information regarding projected demand can be provided to the TFM system to allow the necessary management of the NAS. Advanced portions of this concept include interactivity between the SATS website and the TFM system to notify consumers of small aircraft transportation services regarding projected delays due to congestion along their requested route of flight at their requested flight time. In phase II of this effort, a human-in-the-loop simulation will be conducted using a prototype system to evaluate the concept.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The SATS-VMP concept provides critical modeling and analysis elements to support further research into the SATS concept. The SATS concept will have a dramatic effect on the National Airspace System (NAS). In order to continue to refine and enhance the SATS concept itself, the interconnection with the NAS must be evaluated. As NASA continues to refine and develop the modeling and analysis efforts associated with both the SATS concept, and air transportation in general, components of the simulation and analysis conducted in this effort can be enhanced and provided for further NASA application.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A significant need exists for the SATS-VMP technology. The TFM system requires improved operational predictability, which the SATS-VMP concept provides. Metron Aviation is competing on an FAA procurement to modernize the TFM system to which the SATS-VMP concept can be applied. Commercially, a website can be created for purchasing charter travel services. The SATS-VMP website can provide public awareness of charter operations and interaction with the TFM system. The operators of the SATS-VMP website can use multiple revenue models, including transaction fees for bookings and advertising. Licensing the SATS-VMP concept to another website operator is also under consideration

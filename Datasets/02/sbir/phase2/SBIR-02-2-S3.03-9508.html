<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to develop an innovative 32x32 multi-gain readout multiplexer with the following key design features:
<br>1- Optimized for use with infrared detector arrays requiring low bias levels, such as Ge:Ga far IR photoconductors.  The unit-cell design will maintain constant bias across the detector during the integration and, thereby, will eliminate non-linearity and detector debiasing.  The design will also minimize the channel-to-channel DC variation which improves the bias uniformity across all pixels of the array.
<br>2- Capable of operation at cryogenic temperatures down to 1.5K.  Advanced monolithic cryo-CMOS technology will guarantee deep cryogenic operation with minimal impact on noise performance.
<br>3- Offers the potential of being directly hybridized to IR detector arrays using indium-bump technology.
<br>No two-dimensional readout multiplexer with these features is currently available or has been developed.  This effort fits well within the scope of the SBIR Subtopic S3.03 and will be a benefit to many large and small NASA projects including SAFIR, SOFIA, and Astrobiology missions.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Space instruments developed under Origins Program such as SAFIR, science instruments for SOFIA, upcoming projects under Astrobiology Program, balloon-borne instruments for atmospheric research, and laboratory science instruments. 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Aerospace industry: In addition to the aerospace companies that are under contract to NASA and directly participate in the space program, there are those that independently manufacture infrared detector arrays in large formats.  Some aerospace companies that would be interested in our product are Raytheon, in particular Santa Barbara Research Center, Boeing, Rockwell, and Ball Aerospace.
<br>Science groups at universities and national labs: Astronomical science instruments for observations at ground-based observatories and instruments for basic research.

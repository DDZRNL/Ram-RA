<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Distribution of International Space Station (ISS) downlink video to Remote Principle Investigators (RPIs) requires a connection to Abilene, an Internet2 high-performance research network, or a network that peers with Abilene.  Additionally, multicast network capability and four megabits per second bandwidth capacity per video channel is required end-to-end in order to receive the downlink video.  
<br>
<br>The Grid Video Distribution System (GViDS) will make ISS downlink video much more accessible to the RPI and NASA center sites by converting the downlink video to lower resolutions, unicast, and widely used commercial-off-the shelf codec formats.   Providing this video capability within a grid environment will provide additional flexibility to the experimenter, by supporting the integration of instruments, displays, and computational/information resources.  GViDS will be integrated into the MSFC Space-based Science Operations Grid.  
<br>
<br>The GViDS innovation is a cost-effective, flexible, manageable, automated scheme for routing streaming video in a standards-based computational grid environment.    Hundreds of ISS users will be involved in distributed mission operations and telescience.  NASA telescience operations will benefit from the use of innovative video streaming and grid technology.  The successful Internet Protocol-based system will be ?dual-use?: providing both telescience support to the experimenter as well as excellent Web-based education and public outreach.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The immediate commercialization market is hundreds of ISS experiment telescience users over the next decade.  Additional markets are other NASA missions requiring video streaming.  There is great interest in E/PO applications utilizing live telemetry data, audio, and video.   This is confirmed by MSFC Media Relations Department support for the WIS/PER project.  Our goal is to provide a turn-key package for use directly off of the Internet or for touch-screen kiosks at museums, Challenger Centers, etc.  GViDS education-related applications for NASA include packaging ISS science for informal education communities, formal education and multiple target audiences program uses.  This supports Goal 4 of the HEDS Strategic Plan and involves the public in live space activities.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercial application areas include development and integration of video streaming to the military, medical, and homeland security/emergency response.  AZTek has become Alabama?s only certified Osprey Reseller.  AZTek has sold approximately $52,000 in ViewCast Osprey video streaming systems in the past year.  AZTek has obtained a contract to develop telemedicine workstations for the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) School of Medicine.  GViDS-enabled video streaming expertise has been crucial in obtaining and performing this work.  AZTek is marketing inexpensive video display capabilities to Emergency Operations Center integration offerings to emergency management agencies.  AZTek, which has been traditionally a NASA support contractor, will use this business area to extend its support to the Department of Defense (DoD).  AZTek has submitted a proposal to AMTEC of Huntsville for an Army video streaming system.  AZTek is in discussion with UAH about potential Nursing School distance learning applications based on new video streaming expertise.

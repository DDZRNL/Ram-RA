<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Advanced Guidance Navigation and Control (GN&C) technologies are required to enable future NASA missions and commercial satellite programs. SiWave?s Earth horizon sensor is made possible by recently developed micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) proprietary processing techniques.  Unlike MEMS devices manufactured by our competitors, SiWave MEMS devices enable precisely moving structures with large angular deflections. A MEMS Earth horizon sensor, when compared with current state-of-the-art Earth horizon sensors provides for three orders-of-magnitude reductions in size, reduced power consumption, lower cost, and increased functionality and flexibility.
<br>
<br>In the Phase I program, the feasibility of key components of the proposed Earth horizon sensor, namely, the MEMS scanner and the beam focusing element were demonstrated separately.  In Phase II, SiWave has teamed up with a major satellite manufacturer to take the necessary steps to further develop, conduct ground evaluation, flight qualification and for possible space flight of the MEMS horizon sensor.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA applications include navigation for next generation nano/micro-spacecraft, Earth orbiting spacecraft, and planetary missions to Mars and other solar system planets. The reduction in size and mass will reduce the cost of the spacecraft as well as the launch costs. 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed device has commercial applications in telecommunications, broadcasting, surveillance, Earth science satellites, and high altitude aircraft and balloons. Markets for this technology include large satellite constellations, such as LEO One, Teledesic, ECCO, and E-Sat which alone total nearly 1000 sensors (~$100 million).

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to develop and demonstrate a key component of a laser transmitter that can meet the performance requirements of both systems. In contrast to solid state, diode-pumped, high-energy, low-pulse-rate transmitters that have been considered for ozone lidar systems, our innovative approach is to use a high-pulse-rate (1 kHz) source with similar average powers to low-pulse-rate systems, but greatly reduced energies per pulse. The resultant reduction in the number of diodes and the size of the beam-handling optics leads to a lower-cost, lighter weight system, advantages for both the satellite- and aircraft-based systems. Our approach will enable a new generation of lower-risk, lower-cost science missions, requiring lower power and weight resources. This technology will lead to high performance DIAL systems deployable on small aircraft, UAVs and satellites. This flexibility in choice of platform will greatly enhance the capability of NASA to achieve the science goals of ESE.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The work proposed here has direct application to the development of aircraft and satellite-based ozone DIAL systems, as described in detail earlier in this proposal. The pump source would drive a nonlinear conversion system to generate UV wavelengths suited for ozone sensing from different platforms. Other NASA applications for the pump source would be in precision altimetry for earth and other planetary investigations. The source, combined with other nonlinear optics, could also serve as the DIAL transmitter for probing of other species than ozone. In particular, combined with optical parametric oscillators, the source we develop could provide broadly tunable infrared for sensing of a wide variety of molecular species.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed high-energy MPS technology would be an extension of our existing diode-pumped product line and would offer a step-up in power and energy from our existing products, into the 100-W range now served by more conventional lamp-pumped Nd:YAG lasers. A MPS Nd:YLF laser with 100 mJ/pulse fundamental energy, 1-kHz rate and high beam quality, with the addition of harmonic generation for some systems, could provide a relatively low-cost solution for precision machining applications such as marking, cutting, welding and drilling, of interest to the electronics, automotive and medical-device industry. Q-Peak, as it is now doing with the MPS product line, would strive to establish OEM relationships with systems integrators who supply machining and processing tools to end customers.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Space systems involving people working with machines are becoming increasing complex to design, test, train for, and support during flight. This complexity is affecting all aspects of NASA?s programs and impacts mission viability in the critical areas of safety, cost, timeliness and effectiveness. Under development since 2000, BrahmsVE is a model-based agent architecture together with a web-based multi-user realistic 3D interactive visualization environment designed to allow NASA and other government agencies and commercial enterprises to design, train for and operate complex human-machine environments. 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Some NASA applications of BrahmsVE include: simulation for research of mission hardware and work practices, design of augmentation through agents, just in time training, VR for tele-operations, FMARS/MDRS activities modeling and re-creation, PSA/ISS design simulation, realistic rendering for Sim-Station or Sim-Shuttle, Mars MSL ?09 and Titan mission design, Virtual Digital Human project support, education/outreach. 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Some non-NASA Federal Government applications of BrahmsVE include: wind farm and alternative energy production modeling for DOD and DOE, mobile agents and human augmented system conceptualization and simulation for military and security applications. Commercial applications for BrahmsVE include: design, training and operation of automated factories, multiplayer robot games, educational spacecraft/habitat simulators for student distance team-based learning, museum installations for spacecraft mission simulations, and concept design and test of wireless and mobile devices with human users.

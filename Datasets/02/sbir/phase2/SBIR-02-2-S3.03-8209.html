<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In the Phase I SBIR, Lake Shore proved the feasibility of narrow band pass, band pass and band blocking IR filters made from macroporous silicon (MPSi). This type of optical filter consists of a three-dimensional, periodic structure in monocrystalline silicon. Due to the nature of light transmission through such a layer, omnidirectionality of the transmission was demonstrated. Due the construction consisting mostly of a single environmentally stable material, porous silicon filters do not suffer from thermal, mechanical, and environmental instabilities. In Phase II, Lake Shore will optimize the manufacturing process and will evaluate some design changes that should provide viable prototypes for testing by NASA. In particular, different silicon anodization setups will be used to provide uniform silicon anodization across up to 150mm wafers, different pore geometries will be used to maximize the transmittance, CVD pore wall coating will be developed to extend the application range of such filters beyond the transparency window of silicon, antireflection coating of the filter surfaces will be developed to suppress reflection losses and packaging will be developed in order to adapt these filters for different applications.  Such filters are expected to impact commercial, military and scientific community in many filter applications.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Mid-infrared imaging is a powerful technique to study the center of our galaxy and beyond. However, this wavelength range is difficult to work in. At these wavelengths, room temperature objects emit strongly. The strong Earth background causes weak signal-to-noise ratios. Mid IR filters are needed to separate extraterrestrial signals from this background to build a meaningful picture. Currently used filters suffer from problems stemming from the lack of materials that are transparent, stable and compatible with each other at these wavelengths. The proposed new type of filters can solve these problems. Specific applications of proposed filters include the infrared imaging of planets; studying atmospheric methane (to determine methane output from ocean life), and IR spectroscopic sensing of planetary gases, for example, water vapor on Mars.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Narrow band pass, band pass and band blocking IR filters are used in optical communications, environmental monitoring, chemical and biological analysis, imaging and other areas. Customers include manufacturers of production equipment, as well as manufacturers and users of ?consumer? optical components and equipment. All uses suffer from the angular dependence of the transmission spectra that is a characteristic of interference filters. Many of these users solve the angular dependence problem by adding additional complexity, weight and price to their products, sometimes degrading the performance as well. Lake Shore proposes a new design for optical filters that has the potential to be a disruptive technology. Hence, all these applications may be considered as potential markets for MPSi filters. As a specific example, automation in the manufacture of fiber optic communications equipment has been delayed in part by tight alignment requirements, a problem that can be overcome with this technology.

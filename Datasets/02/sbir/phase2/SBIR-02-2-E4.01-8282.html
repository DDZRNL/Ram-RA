<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal details an innovative water sensor system based on Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology. We propose to mount UWB hardware on a remote controlled or autonomous Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) for both remote soil measurements, and measurements of snowpack depth and density.  IAI has been doing independent work on UWB for several years, and is currently working on 15 contracts for different applications of UWB.  Because of this extensive experience with UWB hardware, we built a functioning prototype sensing system that will meet many of NASA?s requirements in Phase I. Recent experimental results obtained in collaboration with NIST, and detailed simulations during Phase I, demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. In addition, the recent ruling by the FCC to allow for commercial use of UWB has opened the door for mass-produced, reliable UWB hardware available at low cost in the very near future, making our approach also economically very much feasible.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary NASA application of the technology developed during the subject contract is for earth science studies.  More specifically the goal is to be able to measure the depth and density of snow from a small low cost micro-air vehicle.  This can be extended to measuring the moisture content of terrain and of vegetation from a low cost micro-air vehicle, and use of small low cost micro-air vehicles as platforms for other sensors.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary non-NASA commercial application for the moisture imaging system is for detecting and imaging moisture in walls.  This has a direct benefit to NASA in terms of measuring the moisture content in the walls of NASA facilities.  Moisture in walls leads directly to growth of mold and mildew that can have severe health consequences for the employees in such buildings.  The problem of mold and mildew inside buildings has greatly increased as modern building codes require increasingly ?tight? buildings.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Airfoil stagnation point control will significantly improve the performance of aircraft by producing a radically enhanced natural laminar flow, low-drag wing. By controlling the stagnation point location of an NLF airfoil, the range of low-drag lift coefficients can be extended by up to 100%. The objective of this Phase II proposal is to validate the Phase I design of a radically enhanced NLF airfoil design.  The new airfoil design incorporates a compliant structure trailing-edge flap system for stagnation point control.  The complaint trailing-edge is used to control stagnation point movement through an automated feedback and control system designed in Phase I.  The system will provide a significantly enhanced performance envelope for any aircraft able to utilize an NLF wing. The system will provide full lateral, spanwise lift distribution and gust and maneuver load alleviation control of the vehicle, while producing a lower radar cross-section and better battle tolerance.  The system will provide increased maximum lift in the low-drag bucket, providing better performance at the beginning of cruise, resulting in a higher altitude, or more payload to altitude, or more fuel to altitude for longer endurance.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed highly aerodynamically efficient, reliable and maintainable compliant wing system utilizing stagnation point control has significant potential application in several NASA programs. The compliant trailing-edge/stagnation point control system could be fielded in several NASA aircraft including manned and unmanned systems. NASA designers will be eager to exploit the advantages of the current stagnation point control based design. This new design approach will deliver radically enhanced performance as compared to traditional laminar flow wings in a low risk package. The system will be applicable throughout NASA's aviation community.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The commercialization potential is excellent for a highly aerodynamically efficient, reliable and maintainable compliant wing system utilizing stagnation point control with low observable potential. It is recognized that long endurance aircraft in the form of uninhabited air vehicles (UAVs) and high altitude aircraft are expected to play an increasingly important role in military and civilian operations from tactical reconnaissance and uninhabited combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) to high altitude communications relays and environmental sampling. The aviation industry will be eager to exploit the advantages of the current stagnation point control based design. This new design approach will deliver the advantages sought by the mission adaptive wing concept but with much lower weight and much lower cost of manufacture, and be applicable throughout the aviation community. Both commercial and military airframe designers will find the technology extremely appealing, allowing significant commercialization potential.

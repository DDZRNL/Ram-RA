<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In this Phase II effort, Xinetics proposes a 15 cm subscale and a 40 cm fullscale Lightweight Nanolaminate Active Mirror with Wireless Shape Control demonstrators to provide a road map for a 75 cm ~1 kg/m2 Phase III First Article. The development of a wireless actuator technology is a critical milestone enabling the ultra-low areal densities.  The nanolaminate replicated mirror substrates bonded to a lightweight stiff SiC substrate will function as the lightweight substrate.  The active elements will be wireless actuators driven by light or electron beam energies.  With our approach, the weight of the telescope design will be reduced in two ways.  First, the optical surface of the nanolaminate will replace the polished glass traditionally used in a space based telescope design.  Second, since the actuators will be driven by a remote current source, the need for wires and power supplies that drive traditional active mirrors are eliminated.  The combination of lightweight mirror technology with nanolaminate materials and integrated wireless actuator technology provide a roadmap for future very large aperture active mirror telescopes.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Wireless actuators can be used to remote control the optical surface on lightweight large aperture mirrors and as micropositioners in tightly designed spaces.  With the maturity of the technologies wireless actuators proposed, lightweight shape controlling components will be available for large space exploration missions.  The proposed wireless actuator technology is potentially the most innovative single advance to designing lightweight space observatory active components.   NASA will have technology that can be used on many Origins missions and Structure and Evolution missions where lightweight active components area required.
<br>
<br>From the wireless actuator technology, two routes to commercialization will be pursued.  The first is the wireless micropositioners where space is confined in ground based applications and the second is lightweight components for space observatories.  Since the wires and power electronic are unnecessary, no space needs to be available for adjunct equipment.  The wireless actuators can be used to control the optical surface on large aperture lightweight mirrors enabling large diameter apertures reaching 100 m. The surveillance community needs ultra-lightweight, large aperture optical systems that will provide low scatter, diffraction limited imaging in a space environment.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
UTD proposes to develop a lightweight, tethered autonomous small diameter core drill capable of reaching 10 and even 200 m in depth. The proposed approach is consistent with the planetary protection requirements and can be used to extract intact and tailings samples for biological and geological research on Mars.  While the proposed drill is optimized for Mars environment, it can be used on other celestial bodies. The main advantage of the autonomous core drill and the emphasis of the proposed research are mass saving due to the bracing, deployment, and retrieval systems that are lighter, less complex, and have smaller launch envelope than currently proposed drive stem drills powered from the surface. The latter approach is limited to depths around 10 m since its efficiency drops precipitously with depth. The proposed system should fit the envelope of 40 kg and 200-300 watt-hrs per meter advance in medium hardness rock formations.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Dry drilling is a niche technology on Earth but is a major requirement for NASA applications. Delivery of deep subsurface samples from all celestial bodies in the solar system has been identified as a requirement by most roadmap studies. Mass saving advantages of an autonomous drill is most suited for these environments. The autonomous drill offers ability to drill through a wider variety of rock formations; it permits easier hazard avoidance; and it can reach larger depths than currently proposed approaches.
<br>
<br>The system developed under this Phase II SBIR may be used by NASA as a test bed to compare performance of drilling/coring systems based on different drilling bits. The developed autonomous corer minus its drilling bit will provide propulsion, reaction forces, dry bailing, and power delivery for other drilling bit subsystems that need to be tested. 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Autonomy and bracing technologies developed under this Phase II SBIR will find wide applications in the microtunneling field on Earth. The latter is rapidly becoming the technology of choice for deployment of new infrastructure lines in urban environment.  Current techniques use either horizontal directional drilling or jacked production pipe driven drilling head assemblies (DHA) to excavate these tunnels. The existing technologies reached their limits and further improvements may require autonomous DHA?s.
<br>
<br>UTD has a long history of development and commercialization of novel technologies.  Our innovations include navigational aids for directional drilling, anchoring of the rock bolts, and novel drilling techniques.

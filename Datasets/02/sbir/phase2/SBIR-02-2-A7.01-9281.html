<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Large-scale, 3D simulations of complex configurations using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) have become increasingly critical in the design of aircraft, aerospace vehicles and propulsion systems. The CFD analysis process consists of three phases: pre-processing, solver and post-processing. Multi-disciplinary techniques, which analyze phenomena such as fluid-structure interaction, introduce additional computational complexity and require non-trivial coupling between CFD and structures codes. In designing software for each of the three analytical phases, software developers tend to look at what is optimal and necessary for their particular operation. Considerations such as data sharing, archiving and interoperability are given less attention than efficiency and accuracy of physical models. As the pace of simulation increases, the sheer volume of numerical data requires that a stable and easy to operate methodology be made available to developers and users of pre-processing, post-processing and solver tools. The offeror proposes to create a software toolkit that provides an intelligent storage and retrieval mechanism for large-scale CFD simulation data, combining software libraries, database/compression methodologies and web browser-style control and query tools. This toolkit will assist those developing and maintaining solver codes as well as the analyst/designer community and greatly accelerate aerospace vehicle synthesis by enabling data sharing, storage efficiency and interoperability.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA programs such as ASCoT, AVST and 3rd Generation RLV all have components that hope to develop new, fast tools for rapid assessment of new vehicle configurations. FAAST is one such element. The technologies proposed herein can be used by authors of these solvers and pre/post-processing tools to accelerate their development of tools. Designers and analysts can then take advantage of the benefits of the technologies in their work as well. Current NASA CFD tools that are known to the offeror are CFL3D, OVERFLOW, TLNS3D, VULCAN and USM3D.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Integration of the proposed technologies into CFD analysis codes will increase productivity and interoperability between industrial users of CFD in the Aerospace, Automotive, Propulsion and Chemical Process industries. The technologies are applicable to commercial CFD codes, those developed by the government and in-house codes as well. The technology can be extended to other forms of analysis, such as structural analysis, heat transfer and computational electromagnetics (CE). Furthermore, it can be used to assist in coupling such codes for multi-disciplinary analysis.

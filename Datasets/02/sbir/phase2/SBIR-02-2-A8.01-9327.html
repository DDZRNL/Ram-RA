<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Phase II proposal by Phoenix Integration is intended to refine and bring to market the NASA Bi-Level Integrated System Synthesis (BLISS) technology. BLISS is a method to address the above difficulty by defining engineering system optimization problems in terms of subsystems and disciplines that correspond to a natural structure of engineering team in specialty groups.  Making the BLISS method useful in industrial practice requires software that creates an environment where engineers and managers can freely interact and optimize performance and cost. Phoenix proposes innovative software to bring BLISS to industry by using Web-based integration of users in a Multidisciplinary environment combined with the automation of computer assets. The automation will provide seamless parallel computing in a distributed manner prescribed by the BLISS methodology.  In the Phase I research we defined the key system requirements, performed a design optimization test case to confirm these requirements, and completed a preliminary design for the Phase II system development.  Phase II development will include eight technical tasks covering a twenty-one month time frame. The program has been structured so that the development efforts will result in a working system after the first year with the balance of required features being incorporated during the remaining nine months

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed software will help NASA streamline program management by combining collaborative project tools with system design and analysis. Phoenix software will help integrate program management with engineering to give a total picture for optimizing the mix of performance against cost and risk. NASA will realize a significant reduction in workflow problems due to non-concurrent data and information that is not synchronized with program schedules and goals. Furthermore, the proposed innovation will allow NASA program managers to view complex system interactions. For NASA it will enhance the Advanced Engineering Environment (AEE) and find immediate application on current projects such as Next Generation Launch Technology, Orbital Space Plane, Engineering for Complex Systems, and Aeronautics.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The software can be applied to a wide spectrum of defense, electronic, and automotive industries.  Benefits will derive from significantly reducing the cost of weapons system design, making industrial products more robust, and enabling companies to use their engineering resources more efficiently.  These benefits are all based on the Phoenix Integration implementation of BLISS that will allow the combining of diverse and distributed engineering organization skills, make feasible the optimization of the design process. This evolutionary approach to development, testing, and market introduction will facilitate program management, minimize project risk, and accelerate market penetration. 
<br>
<br>The business plan details an approach to achieve sales of $13M within five years. Phoenix has partnered with The Boeing Company as a commercialization pathfinder. Boeing intends to use versions of the BLISS software on reusable launch vehicles, hypersonics, the 7E7 commercial transport, and the Army?s Future Combat System. These are all representative programs for industry.

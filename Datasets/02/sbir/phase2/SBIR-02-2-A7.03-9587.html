<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Investigation into fatigue damage precursors over the last decade has demonstrated that surface-evident defects such as cracks and slipbands evolve in a regular manner, which corresponds to the development of fatigue damage. Through examination of the evolution of such damage precursors in a component, this regularity can facilitate prediction of the component?s remaining fatigue life. The proposed Phase 2 work is to develop and characterize a sensor for in-situ examination and historical tracking of the precursor defects and to construct the analytical framework for using that data to predict the onset of catastrophic failure. Since a major application of this technology is for monitoring fatigue damage in aircraft components, the proposed system will be compact, durable, and relatively inexpensive. The Phase I results have confirmed models of precursor evolution on surfaces; and testing of several prototype surface inspection devices has shown that the technology is compatible with the restrictions on light sources, beam scanners, detection systems, and communication interfaces which this application demands. Design analysis and preliminary designs have also been completed for the in-situ sensor modules as well as their supporting communications and control systems, so that this technology is now ready to enter Phase II development.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA requires advanced sensors to inspect critical components of airframes that are subjected to low and high-cycle fatigue. If unchecked, fatigue-induced damage in airframe components can lead to formation of cracks. Crack formation is often followed by sudden catastrophic failure of the airframe component and destruction of the aerospace vehicle. By providing a timely warning, the proposed sensor will assist in identifying potentially damaged components, and in this way will improve safety of aerospace vehicles while reducing maintenance costs.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Since over 90% of mechanical failures are due to fatigue damage, the proposed sensor will be useful in many industries which employ dynamically loaded mechanical systems. Of particular significance are the commercial and military aircraft industries, where the instrument could be used to quickly verify the safety condition of many critical components, such as turbine blades, fuselage panels, and landing gear. In addition, many other industries can benefit from this diagnostic tool including the automotive, power generation, shipping and railroad industries.  Additionally, fatigue over spans of years is of interest in structural members in many construction and civil engineering contexts, and a mature form of this technology could become sufficiently inexpensive and long-lived to provide automatic fatigue monitoring capability in these as well.
<br>
<br>The two most direct applications are (a) in detecting the onset of highly premature failure of components that would not be detected in ordinary scheduled inspections and (b) in providing a new type of window into the fatigue history of a component. In this latter function, the devices will provide a rich new source of data for the highly developed field of materials engineering dealing with prediction of remaining fatigue life, reliability, and durability.

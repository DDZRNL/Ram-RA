<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Stretched Lens Array SquareRigger (SLA-SR) solar array is based on the combination of two cutting edge technologies, the SquareRigger solar array structure and the SLA optics/PV-blanket assembly.  The combined SLA-SR system produces an extremely lightweight (>330 W/kg BOL near term and ~500 W/kg BOL mid term), high efficiency, high power (10kW to 100kW+), high voltage (100VDC to 1000VDC) and low stowed volume (80 kW/m3 BOL near term and ~120 kW/m3 BOL mid term) solar array suitable for very high power applications.  The concept feasibility of the SLA-SR system has been successfully demonstrated and has achieved a TRL 3 classification during the recently completed Phase 1 program.  The primary technical objective of the proposed Phase 2 program is to increase the maturity of the SLA-SR technology to a TRL 5 classification.  This will be achieved by producing a deployable 1-Bay SLA-SR engineering model (measuring approximately 9ft X 17ft) and demonstrating/validating its performance through ground tests.  The successful completion of the proposed Phase 2 program will ready the ABLE SLA-SR system for use on advanced missions.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The SLA SquareRigger (SLA-SR) is potentially applicable to all earth-orbiting commercial high power satellites providing the benefits of high voltage operation and reduced cost, mass, and stowed volume.  The potential NASA applications resulting from the successful development of the proposed SLA SR technology primarily consists of the Space Solar Power Initiative (which is proposing to deploy mega-watts of power in space), the NASA GRC SEP-Tug, and future high power/voltage interplanetary missions (15kW to 50kW+, and >100VDC).  Other NASA missions (LEO, GEO, interplanetary, and planetary) requiring extremely high power and high voltage also represent potential applications.  Emerging applications such as future/advanced missions requiring extremely high power and high voltage operation may be enabled because of the SLA-SR technology.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The potential non-NASA commercial applications resulting from the proposed SLA-SR technology span a broad range of high power and high voltage applications (in LEO, MEO & GEO).  Two particular applications include the Air Force?s PowerSail program, which requires a low cost/mass extremely high power solar array system (50kW to 100kW), and the large GEO Comsat missions.  The projected near term doubling of high power GEO Comsats from the current range of 15 kW to over 30kW provides a very likely application for SLA SquareRigger.

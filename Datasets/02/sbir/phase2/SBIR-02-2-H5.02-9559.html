<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 NASA has embarked on an ever more ambitious path of developing modular space exploration systems, and human exploration missions. To enable missions that are envisioned for the future, advances in the human/robotic interface are required. This proposal provides a new telepresence interface, based on an ultra-wide field-of-view (FOV) HMD. This fully immersive HMD has a FOV which nearly matches the unobstructed human visual field, and maintains high resolution throughout. By combining this immersive display with a custom camera system and appropriate software, a telepresence system capable of high-fidelity depth perception, FOV and resolution is possible. This tool would be a significant benefit to human operators of robotic systems. In Phase 1 we designed a tiled, wide FOV camera array and appropriate 3D software to interface between this array and the HMD. The product of Phase 2 will be a complete working telepresence system with custom camera array and HMD. This system will be integrated into the NASA telerobotic system called Robonaut.  There are strong commercialization opportunities in the engineering services industry and various government agencies, as they are known users of telepresence systems for remote operation of robots and vehicles.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
 The proposed ultra-wide FOV telepresence system will enable a new level of operator control over robotic systems for payload manipulation, docking and similar tasks. The enhanced FOV and depth perception will also allow operators of exploration vehicles greater understanding of the remote terrain---leading to more efficient exploration and faster, safer navigation for the remote vehicle. Finally, playing back the immersive visual experience recorded on a distant planet for non-NASA personnel may provide a dramatic marketing tool for the agency.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
 The ultra-wide field of view of the proposed system will allow users a much greater sense of immersion in the displayed enviroment--be it virtual or remote. The new level of telepresence immersion will enable much more practical police, rescue and hazmat applications to emerge. It is also well known that the US military is increasing its reliance on remotely piloted vehicles and this system would work equally well in the battlefield environment. Entertainment applications will also emerge: for example, allowing individuals to "step on the field" during a professional sporting event via telepresence.

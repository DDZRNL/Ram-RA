<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This TenXsys NASA SBIR project focuses on an innovative software solution that allows complex real-time data streams to be viewed as information on devices.  The TenXsys solution allows access to data anywhere, anytime using wireless transmission to a web enabled handheld device such as a personal data assistant (PDA), laptop, or cell phone.  This will allow distributed operations of missions, will reduce cost of operations by reducing the number of required personnel in the control center, and will allow an avenue for people to view operational data in real-time.  TenXsys? ADROIT software is categorized as a middleware product with enabling specialty software specific to each command and control center.   Broadly defined, middleware enables one application to communicate with another through functions such as conversion, translation, consolidation or integration.  
<br>
<br>TenXsys innovations will allow:
<br>&#61623; Remote and mobile  real-time data display outside of the control center
<br>&#61623; Data collection & processing
<br>&#61623; Display configurability on-the-fly
<br>&#61623; Information presentation versus data
<br>&#61623; Situational and contextual awareness

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The TenXsys ADROIT solution will allow insight into flight, crew and vehicle data enabling remote operations and data monitoring.  The proposed system will have application for NASA for viewing data streams external to the active Mission Control Center (MCC) or Mission Evaluation Room (MER) environment.  For example, biomedical data could be accessed in real-time, allowing a flight surgeon the flexibility of reviewing the data without being near the control center.  NASA control centers that focus on manned or unmanned spaceflight and science operations will use the ADROIT solution to allow situational and contextual awareness as well. The ADROIT software will facilitate remote operations during these missions, reducing cost while increasing capabilities.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The innovation also will benefit wide ranging applications at other government agencies and commercial enterprises.  The military branches are all working to transform their teams to a networked force.  As a part of this effort, advanced tools that provide distributed common ground systems for intelligence data fusion, as well as visualization tools for complex data that allow for built-in alerts and pattern recognition are in demand.  Additionally, with the new emphasis on Homeland Defense and Security, the ability to quickly transmit data, share information, and receive alerts allow first responders and others to continue operations outside of normal work facilities.  As these devices become more location aware, more directed situational and contextual data can be communicated.   The commercial market for wireless PDA based applications for command and control operations is virtually untapped.  Telecommunications, power management, traffic control, or emergency management control rooms are all potential customers of the ADROIT software solution. Each of these critical nerve centers has to handle large amounts of constantly changing visual data. Although the data and the process being controlled will be different, there are a few core requirements for nearly all such facilities.  Our ADROIT middleware will be applicable to any of these centers.

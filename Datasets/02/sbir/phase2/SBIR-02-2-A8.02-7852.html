<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
As the unmanned exploration of Mars and Venus becomes more of a focus area at NASA, inflatable, rigidizable wings will become an enabling technology.  The successful development of this type of wing will also have significant military applications in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).  Rigidization of inflatable wings provides several potential advantages, including reducing the vulnerability to punctures, increasing stiffness and load-carrying capability, allowing a higher aspect ratio for high altitude efficiency and longer missions, and reducing weight by eliminating the make up pressurization supply.  In the Phase I program, rapid cure resin systems (10 sec at 0?aC) with long shelf lives (>10 yrs) were formulated and used to fabricate, deploy, and rigidize a half span wing.  Mechanical tests of the rigidized wing showed that it had attained the desired stiffness.  The Phase II program will demonstrate internal cure, tailoring the resin formulation and lighting system for more efficient rapid cure at low temperatures, determine a more optimized design for a selected application, and demonstrate improved manufacturing techniques with skinning for better aerodynamic performance.  Wind tunnel tests of the optimized wing will be conducted including deployment and rigidization with internal light cure.  Aerodynamic behavior during deployment and rigidization and of the rigidized wing will be determined.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed work will result in a new materials technology for rigidizable inflatable aero-structures.  It is expected that the ROC technology will be adopted by the inflatables community for use by NASA and its contractors for a variety of space missions involving large antennas, mirrors, radars, and Gossamer structures such as solar sails.  Rigidization of inflatable wings provides several potential advantages for planetary exploration, including reducing the vulnerability to punctures, increasing stiffness and load carrying capability, allowing a higher aspect ratio for high altitude efficiency and longer missions, and reducing weight by eliminating the make up pressurization supply.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The eventual markets for inflatable spacecraft are extremely large for communications antennas and radars.  In the commercial sector, over 200 satellites are expected to be launched in the next 10 years to meet consumer demand for cellular phones and other communication devices.  A large number of military satellites are also expected to be launched in that timeframe.  Military UAVs represent another potentially large market for UV rigidized inflatable aero-structures for munitions and survilance missions.  Inflatable shelters for military and emergency uses and field appliable splints represent additional markets as do rapid cure coatings and adhesives.  The unique features of the ROC?? technology bring a distinct competitive advantage to the marketplace for inflatables compared to competing technologies.

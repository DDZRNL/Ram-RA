<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovation is new technology to enable the visualization of large unstructured geospatial datasets, such as LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) data, within a commercial desktop Geographic Information System (GIS).  The architecture first converts the raw LIDAR datasets into the newly approved LAS LIDAR data standard. The system then creates efficient spatial indexing mechanisms to easily visualize high-fidelity models interactively within a 3D GIS environment. The efficient data model is also used to support high-performance raster and TIN creation.  All three data models (raw point cloud, raster, and TIN) are integrated with the native capabilities of ArcGIS for visualization, query, filtering, and analysis.  The technology also provides extensibility through APIs to enable third-party developers to implement algorithms for image analysis and feature extraction.  The proposed architecture also supports the use of high performance computing (HPC) platforms for resource intensive processing that may not be appropriate for a single desktop system.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
High-resolution DTM Generation ? NASA products including microaltimeter (ATM) and Mars (MOLA) datasets can be used to create high-accuracy terrain mapping applications. 
<br>
<br>Planetary Applications ? Future space-based LIDAR systems will provide mapping and understanding of other planets in the future.  Integrated support for LIDAR within a GIS system also provides opportunity for overlaying imagery data over the high resolution terrain to further explore and understand the planets. 
<br>
<br>Earth Science Applications ?Integration of LIDAR will enhance workflows for earth science applications such as change detection, vegetation characterization, feature extraction.  
<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
DTM Generation for a Variety of GIS/Mapping Related Products ? Urban modeling, urban visualization and simulation, telecommunication and cell phone coverage planning 
<br>
<br>Forestry management - Tree heights and density determination, biomass estimation 
<br>
<br>Mapping change ? Active mining operations, coastal areas, urban environments, battlefield changes 
<br>
<br>Corridor or Right-of-Way Mapping ? Linear corridors such as power utility right-of-ways, gas pipelines, stream banks, or highways
<br>
<br>Flood Plain Mapping - disaster planning and response for flood insurance purposes 
<br>
<br>Disaster Damage Assessment - Floods, hurricanes, or earthquakes 
<br>
<br>Weather Integration - The 3D point cloud model (such as LIDAR) is often used to represent weather data and the visualization techniques will be useful for weather investigations 
<br>
<br>Similar Non-LIDAR data - Other large unstructured data sources such as medical imaging, SONAR, and computational fluid dynamics face similar visualization limitations

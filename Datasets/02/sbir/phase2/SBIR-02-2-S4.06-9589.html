<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Phase II SBIR describes the fabrication and characterization of a position sensitive detector with internal gain.  Phase I research demonstrated the fabrication of several position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (APDs), including quadrant and lateral-effect photodiodes.  With position resolution equivalent to commercially available silicon detectors, but responsivity three orders of magnitude times greater, these detectors offer superior performance over existing position sensitive devices.  Using RMD?s advanced planar processing technology, the position sensitive detectors will be further optimized with emphasis on applications for free-space optical communication systems operating at near-infrared (near-IR) wavelengths.  The ultimate goal of this program is to develop a manufacturable high speed, low noise position-sensitive APD module.  The APD and electronics for readout and data logging will be included in the final module, a valuable tool for long distance communication and LADAR operation.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary application of this work is the further development of a detector for tracking satellites or other sources used in long-haul free-space optical communication systems.  Further uses to NASA include position sensitive detection for vehicle docking, navigation, and guidance.  Sensitive 3-D imaging can be realized using these detector in LADAR applications, including the geographical mapping of terrestrial or extra-terrestrial features.

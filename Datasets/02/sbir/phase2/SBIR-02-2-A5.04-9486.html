<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The development of simulation technology is proposed  for carrying out high-fidelity transient analyses of systems that support experimental rocket testing such as control valves, feed system elements, pressure regulators and other flow control elements.  The simulation technology comprises of a generalized multi-element unstructured framework (CRUNCH CFD) with integrated sub-models for grid adaption, grid movement and multi-phase flow dynamics including cryogenic cavitation.  As part of our Phase I effort, simulations were performed for a series of systems that included the 10-inch LOX service valve, split-body valve, pressure regulator valve and the cavitating LOX venturi valve, all at constant valve settings. Results indicated excellent agreement with experimental flow coefficient curves.  In Phase II, we will extend the framework to provide coupled valve motion - flow transient analyses with the development of an automated grid movement procedure to track valve motion.  Valve timing analysis for a number of high pressure valve systems will be performed and the resultant dynamic events such as cavitation and valve chatter that lead to pressure fluctuations will be simulated.  The framework will be used as an analysis support tool to generate performance metrics, evaluate design modifications and identify dominant frequencies associated with hydrodynamic instabilities and valve motion.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The software product resulting from our Phase II effort directly addresses core needs of the propulsion testing and design community at NASA as outlined in the Next Generation Launch Technology Program (NGLT).  One of the requirements of the NGLT program is to operate the system over a wide range of off-design conditions where dynamic effects and cavitation become important. The simulation technology proposed here will be directly applicable to performance evaluation and transient analyses of components of the main propulsion system such as propulsion-related ducts, valves, lines and actuators delivering fuel from main propulsion tanks to the main engine.  Analyses of hydrodynamic instabilities related to cryogenic tanks can also be carried out with the proposed technology.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The testing and design of launch systems places increased reliance on high pressure valve systems.  Our simulation software could be used as an analysis support tool in enhancing on-site capabilities at test stand facilities.  Besides the launch systems industry, the developed software product can be used in development of valves for cavitation control, design of cryogenic control valves, and fluid-transient simulations for feedback in control loops.  Such applications would encompass a broader commercial market including (a)distribution networks associated with water, waste (b) valve industry (in petrochemical, refining, chemical processing and food processing).  The proposed Phase II effort can also directly address problems in the area of biomedical devices such as the functioning of prosthetic heart valves that are sensitive to valve timing and susceptible to cavitation.

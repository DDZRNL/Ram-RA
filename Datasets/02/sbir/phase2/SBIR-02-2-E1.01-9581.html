<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Ultra-narrow bandpass tunable filters in the visible and infrared spectral regions are needed for the remote sensing industry and NASA in particular. Such filters are applicable in high-resolution spectroscopy, tunable lasers, and multi-spectral and hyperspectral imaging. During Phase I, we performed a feasibility study of an innovative ultra-narrow bandpass filter based on unique features of a photonic crystal interferometer (PCI), and did a meticulous and extensive analysis and modeling of its characteristics. We then assembled and tested a PCI breadboard and demonstrated its tunability over a 1 nm spectral range with a bandpass close to 0.02 nm and an acceptance angle close to 1o. The acquired data demonstrated conclusively that an approach based on the PCI concept provides an optimal solution for designing and constructing an ultra-narrow tunable optical bandpass filter. During Phase II we will design, build, deliver to NASA, and perform field testing of a compact and robust prototype module of a 1? diameter PCI filter with a tunability range of 1 nm and a bandpass range of 0.01 nm at 50% transmittance range. The Phase II design should allow for retrofitting the PCI to existing instruments and provide a stable performance in harsh operating environments.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed ultra-narrow tunable optical bandpass filter will expand the capabilities of NASA?s Earth Science Enterprise for high spectral resolution and high accuracy measurements of atmospheric and surface parameters from space and airborne platforms. These include measurements of biological productivity of land and ocean, measurements of climate and meteorological parameters, and terrain mapping.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed ultra-narrow tunable optical bandpass filter will find commercial applications in space-based and airborne multi-spectral imaging and remote sensing systems, including LIDAR stations and meteorological instruments. It will expand capabilities for high accuracy spectral measurements within the tunable narrow spectral regions necessary for resolving individual spectral features. Due to its high spectral resolution, wide tunability range, compactness, ruggedness and stability, the proposed filter will allow for innovative solutions in high-resolution spectroscopic instrumentation, especially when portable devices are of interest.

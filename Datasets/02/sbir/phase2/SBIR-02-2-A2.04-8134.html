<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Phase I showed that the Singular Value Decompostion (SVD) technique significantly reduces processing requirements for 3D binaural rendering using Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF) datasets.  Equally important, the Equivalent Source Reduction (ESR) experiments completed show a dramatic simplification of the problem of acoustically modeling surfaces, with little to no perceivable difference in the auralization.  
<br>
<br>While AuSIM3D? real-time binaural rendering capacity has grown from a few point sound sources four years ago to a few dozen point sources presently, largely due to gains in commodity processor speed, the performance improvement capacity shown by SVD and the simplification of the acoustic surface modeling problem demonstrated possible with ESR has been much more dramatic.  Our results show hundreds of point sources can now be realistically rendered in real-time, and that these sources can represent a relatively large surface with negligible loss of accuracy.  When these techniques are integrated in the AuSIM3D client and server applications as proposed in Phase II, it will be possible for the first time to binaurally render the sound of an acoustic disturbance applied to a surface model of considerable area.   
<br>
<br>AuSIM is also eager to optimize the ESR and SVD implementations into commercial-quality software applications to create the next generation of AuSIM3D technology.  With the newly added horsepower, AuSIM3D applications will be soon able to render directly the acoustic data generated by industry standard Finite Element Analysis (FEA) acoustics vendors such as MSC/Nastran, COMET Acoustics, and ABAQUS.  These firms have already signed Letters of Intent to provide whatever technical support, collaboration, and marketing resources we need to become fully interoperable with their systems.  Soon designers will be able to regularly hear the acoustic performance of the surfaces they've designed while the models are still on the electronic drawing board.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
AuSIM's end product will import acoustic data from major commercial FEA packages, allowing NASA to use computer models of aerospace surfaces for airplanes, rotorcraft, and space vehicles.  NASA applications that have a need to perceive the acoustic characteristics of aerospace surfaces range from assisting the design phase and the design promotion phase to, in the worst-case-scenario, assisting in the accident analysis phase.  
<br>
<br>In the design and redesign of new and existing aerospace vehicles, it will be very useful to hear the effect of airflow on external surfaces.  Although noise levels alone can be quantified fairly well with existing technology, the spectral coloration that gives each sound its distinct characteristics can also determine how pleasant or unpleasant the sound will be to listeners.  The acoustic comfort level of the crew and passengers inside the craft is an important design factor, as it will affect the flight crew's level of fatigue, which will affect their ability to operate the craft safely.  
<br>
<br>Another factor of concern to NASA engineers is the sound generated by an aircraft or spacecraft that reaches the ears of people on the ground.  Our end product will enable a design to be simulated under a range of normal operating conditions, and enable the completion of a perceptual study that will help determine which designs will have the minimum negative psychological impact on passengers, ground crew, and the general public.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The largest commercial applications of the technology would be in the aircraft and automobile industries, where millions of dollars are spent yearly to get new vehicles to operate with a more comfortable noise level. The real-time acoustic data rendering capabilities that would be enabled with the development of the SVD/ESR-enhanced 3D audio binaural simulation software could be applied widely throughout the automobile design world by licensing it to be integrated with existing and broadly used industrial acoustics analysis packages. Such a combined package would offer significantly more display versatility to engineers designing to optimize acoustic performance than any other package available today.
<br>
<br>Existing FEA packages with acoustics analysis modules do well at quantifying the noise levels and spectral characteristics of vehicle surfaces in the presence of an acoustic disturbance, but determining which frequency distributions plotted on a view graph will produce a negative visceral human response, versus which ones will sound pleasant or unobtrusive, is still an inexact science at best.  Therefore, vehicle designers are required to produce multiple prototypes and test them acoustically before bringing a product to market.  Our Phase II product will give these designers, and even their decision-making managers, the ability to hear prototypes in service before they ever leave the electronic drawing board, saving significant costs in the product prototype mockup stage.

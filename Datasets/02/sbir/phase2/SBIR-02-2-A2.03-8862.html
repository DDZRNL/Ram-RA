<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Lattice block structures are innovative periodic cellular materials that derive their outstanding mechanical performance from a structure of highly ordered internal triangles, rather than the properties of the parent material.  They are innovations that can provide tremendous opportunities for weight and cost reduction in future aerospace and non-aerospace systems.  To date, lattice block structures have been successfully fabricated for a number of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, but not extremely difficult to cast reactive metals such as titanium-based alloys.  As titanium is one of the most important metallic materials in existence today, with growing importance in aerospace systems due to its superior strength-to-density, high temperature strength, and corrosion resistance, titanium alloy lattice block structures offer significant benefits to NASA and the industry if they can be successfully produced.  Consequently, the purpose of this SBIR Phase II effort is to demonstrate the feasibility of casting full scale lattice block structures from titanium alloys using a proprietary investment casting process.  A successful Phase II project paves the way to manufacturing actual lattice block structural components in Phase III and beyond, providing the necessary foundation for a more widespread acceptance of this unique technology in the industry.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Titanium-based alloys, including gamma titanium aluminides, are high temperature materials that can meet the ever-increasing demands for more robust, higher temperature-tolerant, and lighter weight hypersonic vehicle airframe components for commercial and military systems.  Titanium and gamma lattice block materials can be used as low weight structures within these applications.  For example, gamma lattice block structures could be considered for sandwich structures for thermal protection system for the reusable launch vehicle.
<br>
<br>Other potential NASA commercial applications include aircraft engine components such as fan blade and compressor casings, nozzle flaps, and engine tiles for next generation aircraft gas turbines.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Essentially, any application and/or industry that need superior strength-to-density within relative affordability while retaining the physical properties of titanium and gamma alloys could use lattice block structures.  Furthermore, those that require potential replacements for Ni-based superalloys at lower temperatures and for titanium alloys at higher temperatures could consider gamma alloys.  Potential commercial applications include aero engine components, automotive engine components, and aircraft and spacecraft structural applications.  Other possible uses of lattice block materials include components for furniture, shipboard structures, building structures, automotive vehicle frames, and a potentially limitless number of other possibilities.

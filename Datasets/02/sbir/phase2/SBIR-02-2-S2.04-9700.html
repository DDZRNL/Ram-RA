<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>

<br>This work further developed a highly promising Variable Emittance technology for spacecraft thermal control based on Conducting Polymer (CP) electrochromics developed earlier by this firm  with the Air Force, NASA and JPL, with: Extremely thin (< 0.2 mm), flexible (plastic), lightweight (0.176 kg/m^2), extremely durable, variable area (0.5  cm^2 -  0.5 m^2), flat-panel construction; high Delta Emittance (DE) (> 0.4); cyclability > 10^4 cycles, switching < 5 s; power 40 iW/cm^2; proven space durability; low cost  (est. < $5K/m^2). A key technical barrier of this earlier-generation technology was the need for a hermetic seal and bulky CsI windows/frame, problems associated therewith, due to the gel electrolyte used needing some moisture content to be ?sealed in?.  In  Phase I, use of newly discovered, ?true? solid, room  temperature molten salt electrolytes (?IonEls?) eliminated  the hermetic seal. Devices showed:  DE > 0.5; excellent space durability (> 23000  electrochromic, > 90 thermal cycles over 23 days in space vacuum, > 500 h UV, operating temperature -45 to +100 C, no outgassing). Alpha(s)-lowering and ITO coatings were demonstrated. Phase II will complete a much more rigorous space durability testing regime, optimize devices, demonstrate intelligent control of device arrays, start pilot-scale production and costing, and initiate flight tests.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Once full space durability testing is completed in Phase II, this technology may displace mechanical louvers and heat pipes. The potential market is 1 to to m^2 thermal control area in each of > 100 spacecraft /year the U.S. alone launches. Military space uses include space-based radars.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Once full space durability testing is completed in Phase II, this technology may displace mechanical louvers and heat pipes. Military uses which this firm is already pursuing at an advanced stage include battlefield IR camouflage countermeasures for the entire armed forces, a potential multi-billion$ market. Commercial uses include sunglasses for older patients and displays/billboards.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Electronics circuits that can function in very high temperatures (> 450?C) are needed for a number of applications including automotive and turbine engine control, industrial high-temperature processing, geothermal and deep-well oil drilling, satellite power management systems, and future planetary missions to Venus and Mercury.  The key electronic components for these applications include 1) an instrumentation amplifier to be used in conjunction with different probes and transducers, and 2) a power amplifier for driving motors and actuators. We propose to develop AlGaN-based electronics grown on low-defect substrates for operations at temperatures > 450?C and pressures > 100 atmospheres.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA has been pursuing the development of electronic systems for operation under severe conditions, from the extreme cold of deep space to searing heat at the surface of Venus and Mercury.  The proposed GaN-based high-temperature amplifier can provide the required power for different actuators on future NASA landing-vehicles for exploring the surface of these planets.  The high-temperature electronics will also benefit NASA in space based power management systems. 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed wide-bandgap high-temperature amplifier, in combination with high-temperature transducers, light emitting devices, and actuators, will have great impact on many industries including, automotive, avionics, nuclear power plants, combustion system, and oil and geothermal well drilling.

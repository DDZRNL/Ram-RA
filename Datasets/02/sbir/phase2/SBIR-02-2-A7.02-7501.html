<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Fracture mechanics capabilities based on finite element multidisciplinary analysis will be designed and developed. Incorporating finite element based fracture mechanics analysis will enhance the power and strength of the MDFEM software.  An in depth literature survey will be conducted to assess the appropriate finite element methodology for modeling crack tip stress regions and associated material constitutive relations. In order to characterize fracture behavior, crack tip finite elements, crack tip opening displacement and J-integral methods will be implemented. Software to perform these fracture related parameters will be developed and tested with benchmark problems.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The development of fracture mechanics capabilities enhances the strength and applicability of existing finite element multidisciplinary engineering analysis software such as  STARS software. Such capabilities enable application to monitor and perform risk assessment of flight vehicle structural integrity in NASA?s shuttle programs, Flight Testing of Research flight vehicles, extending flight envelope of test flight vehicles. The structural integrity and safety monitoring of NASA's shuttle programs, Flight Test Research vehicles, lauch vehicle structural integrity risk assessment will be potential beneficiaries. 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The development of fracture mechanics capabilities enhances the strength and applicability to monitor and perform risk assessment of structural integrity in such areas as commercial airplane structures, nuclear power plants, and other fracture and damage critical structural components in rail-roads, off-shore structures, and automobiles. Other applications include home land security related issues with nuclear power plants, and other fracture and damage critical structural components of national security interests.

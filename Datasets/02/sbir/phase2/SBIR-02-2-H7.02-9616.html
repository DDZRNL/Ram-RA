<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In recent decades, NASA?s interest in spacecraft rendezvous and proximity operations has grown. Additional instrumentation is needed to improve manned docking operations? safety, as well as to enable telerobotic operation of spacecraft or completely autonomous rendezvous and docking. To address this need, we propose a suite of active sensors that will provide range and bearing information to a docking craft at distances of kilometers, and will provide 6-degree-of-freedom information at distances of hundreds of meters. The suite of sensors will include NASA?s Advanced Video Guidance Sensor (AVGS) for short-range operations, and will build on that sensor?s flight heritage by adding a laser range and bearing finder (RBF). There is a need for a laser RBF that can operate to distances of 5 km; currently, no such space-qualified RBF exists. For this reason we propose building a wide-angle laser RBF. The wide angle removes the need for scanning systems such as gimbals, eliminating moving parts and making the sensor simpler and space qualification easier. The RBF will work from 5 km in to distances on the order of tens of meters, an operating range that will allow it to mesh with AVGS, and with a range accuracy of 1 m.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
During Phase I of the project, we developed and distributed a survey that documented several potential NASA-related applications and programs where our sensor suite might play a role. The Orbital Space Plane will be non-crewed for its first two years, making docking sensors such as our Rendezvous and Docking Sensor Suite (RDSS) a vital part of the program. Orbital Express plans currently call for use of AVGS, demonstrating the program?s need for docking sensors such as our proposed laser rangefinder. A similar need exists for the Alternate Access to Station project. RDSS could be used in the Mars Sample Return Mission for docking and landing. Finally, RDSS could be used for docking with satellites.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Range measurements and autonomous docking are not solely NASA requirements. The ability to bring two objects together autonomously has several potential applications in the military. RDSS could be used in autonomous cargo loading and unloading, for in-air or at-sea fleet refueling, and for long-haul transport. The booming UAV/UGV (Unmanned Air/Ground Vehicles) market is in desperate need of docking/landing solutions that the RDSS application is perfectly suited for. Non-military commercial applications include docking a yacht at a pier or in a berth, tractor/trailer docking, and robotic delivery.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to develop a formal modeling software tool, Networks in Organizational Risk Management (NORM), that allows mission planners and organizational designers to create and experiment with organizational structures that minimize risk throughout the lifecycle of a system. The core of our approach is a computational organizational model of the network of interrelationships among people, knowledge, tasks, technology, organizational goals, system failures, and the surrounding environment. In Phase I we defined a simulation and optimization model of organizational safety and illustrated the use of NORM as applied to Team X, a concurrent engineering design team specializing in unmanned space missions. In Phase II we will develop the NORM modeling software, develop a customized Team X application, and perform a comparative analysis of Team X using NORM and several additional computational modeling tools.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Formal modeling of organizational risk management is critical to a variety of NASA applications, including launch operations, the Mission to Mars, and the International Space Station (ISS). Failures such as the Challenger launch and the Mars rover illustrate the need for tools to design organizations that minimize rather than induce errors, and to identify latent errors introduced during design and construction before they manifest themselves as operational failures providing little opportunity for recovery. The challenges of constructing, maintaining, and continually expanding the ISS demand cost-effective methods for predicting the impact of new technologies on system safety prior to installation. 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The capabilities of NORM are most likely to appeal to customers who have the need to analyze and improve organizational safety or design organizations for safe operations. Examples of potential applications include air traffic control, supervisory control systems, command and control systems, ground and maritime transportation, hospital administration, construction, and manufacturing. In addition, management consulting firms provide a potential market for software licensing and consulting services. Business analysts that advise corporate management on safety issues require a deep understanding of the risks present in the organization, but are typically unacquainted with scientific methods for rigorously modeling and analyzing organizational risks.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Remote On-demand Networked Distributed Operations (RONDO) is a set of Web-based transformational technologies that provides situation awareness to distributed Space Station operations and support personnel.  RONDO consists of: (1) an incident/event monitoring and alerting subsystem that autonomously monitors for and logs ?events of interest,? wirelessly sends (alerts) the event data to the appropriate personnel, and performs all notification, roll-over, and tracking functions, and (2) a real-time collaboration subsystem that enables remote personnel to become members of a distributed ?virtual? team by providing secure and reliable access to data, products, systems, and personnel located in the MCC, providing a ?window into the MCC.?  By enabling personnel to perform their work where they are most efficient and effective, small distributed teams can perform the same high level and quality of work as today?s large teams.  In its Phase I SBIR, mobileFOUNDATIONS proved the feasibility RONDO by building, testing, and demonstrating a RONDO prototype.  In Phase II, mobileFOUNDATIONS will build RONDO, tailor its capabilities to the needs of the users, and perform the integration and testing to ensure that RONDO will work in the current and future Web Portal architectures.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary NASA use of RONDO will be for mission operations.  RONDO has received positive feedback from NASA personnel from JSC, GSFC, and Ames.  While RONDO is being funded for human exploration missions, it will be equally useful for all types of spacecraft.  Outside of mission operations, NASA can use RONDO for network monitoring, help desk support, base security, search and rescue, distributed science and sensor monitoring, distributed training, and facilities management. 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Some non-NASA RONDO applications include: homeland security, public safety, equipment monitoring, network monitoring, cybersecurity, military command and control, and building monitoring.  Initially, mobileFOUNDATIONS plans to transfer the RONDO technologies into its homeland security application, IncidentPortal, to improve wireless communications interoperability and interagency collaboration.

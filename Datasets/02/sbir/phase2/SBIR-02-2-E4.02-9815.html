<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to develop EarthTutor, an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that extends NASA Image2000, and an accompanying authoring tool used to create new tutorials. The system will be innovative in that it delivers a learning experience that is more visual, interactive and adaptive than experiences offered by current remote sensing learning materials. EarthTutor aims to offer the benefits of a one-on-one human instructor. EarthTutor will demonstrate image processing and earth science skills and concepts, ask questions, offer challenges, monitor and assess the student, and provide contextual guidance. EarthTutor will run tutorials created with a separate authoring tool. The tool will be basic enough to allow teachers to construct tutorials to fit one's curriculum, but also powerful enough to allow advanced authors to create highly-interactive tutorials that engage students in unprecedented ways. During Phase I, Stottler Henke developed a prototype of the EarthTutor ITS, authoring tool and sample content. The deliverables have been evaluated by remote sensing instructors and students; the resulting trials demonstrate that EarthTutor is an effective and stimulating means of teaching remote sensing. During Phase II, Stottler Henke will work with researchers and educators to develop four earth science modules intended for advanced high school and undergraduate students.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
EarthTutor will provide NASA Image2000 with a cutting-edge educational component. As EarthTutor finds a place in America's classrooms, the technologies introduced will advance the sophistication of NASA's educational products, help promote existing education tools, and incorporate earth science and NASA satellite imagery into classrooms. New NASA satellite research can be passed along to students through EarthTutor tutorials. Remote sensing tutoring technology can also be applied to other image processing tools used by NASA. 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
EarthTutor will be site-licensed to schools through education catalogs. In addition, we will apply our technology to other image processing tools  used for civic and industrial purposes. Remote sensing plays an increasingly important role in city planning (roads, dams, reservoirs, utilities, pipelines), agriculture, resource exploration, and many other areas, and we will approach established GIS and remote sensing training institutes to incorporate our technology with their software. The military is another audience for EarthTutor. Finally, we will extend the reach of our tutor to other image processing domains such as medical imaging, chemical imaging and homeland security screening.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The ABLE ESCA designs use flight proven materials/processes to create an ideal ESCA system that yields low cost, low mass, high reliability, high power density, and is adaptable to any cell type, coverglass thickness, and panel contour.  The successfully completed Phase 1 program has proven concept feasibility for two ABLE ESCA designs (baseline and optional technologies).  These ESCA designs have been successfully demonstrated at a coupon level in a relevant environment and have achieved a TRL 3-4 classification.  The next challenge for our team, and the primary technical objective of the proposed Phase 2 program, is to increase the baseline and optional ESCA technologies to a TRL 6 classification and accelerate their insertion into a flight program, such as the upcoming NASA GED and MMS missions (or other commercial missions).  During the proposed Phase 2 program, high fidelity flight-like engineering model ESCA panels (of the baseline and alternative designs) will be engineered, produced, and tested.  The ESCA designs will be demonstrated and validated within radiation (UV, e- & p+), plasma, LEO thermal life cycling, and GEO thermal life cycling environments, and will achieve a TRL 6 classification.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The potential NASA applications resulting from the successful development of the proposed ABLE ESCA technology are primarily for advanced spacecraft of NASA?s Sun-Earth Connection Initiative, such as the NASA GSFC MMS and GED spacecraft, and high voltage/power solar array applications (for LEO, MEO and GEO).  Many future NASA Sun-Earth Connection missions, and other missions that measure charged fields and particles or require high voltage/power, will need ESCA systems in order to pursue mission objectives.  An ideal ESCA system, as proposed by ABLE, will enable these missions to be achieved. 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The potential non-NASA commercial applications resulting from the proposed ABLE ESCA technology span a broad range of high voltage/power applications (in LEO, MEO and GEO), particularly for GEO ?Comsat? missions.  Electrostatic interaction and discharge (ESD) as it relates to array performance is of great concern for these applications and for the survivability of the solar array system.  Features and/or the entire solution of ABLE?s ESCA design developed for NASA applications are easily implemented to achieve electrostatic and magnetic cleanliness for use on these non-NASA applications.  As such, development of ABLE?s ESCA technology serves the non-NASA (i.e., commercial and military) markets as well.

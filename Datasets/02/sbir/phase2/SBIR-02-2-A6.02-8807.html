<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Future NASA programs will utilize solid-state devices (e.g., detectors, processors) that require cooling. Thermal management is of critical importance for a variety of solid-state devices. As the size of solid-state devices continues to shrink, device performance and reliability is limited by the ability to remove the increasing density of heat generated within these components. Furthermore, other devices such as solid-state lasers and infrared cameras require cooling and active temperature control. We propose two complimentary approaches to address these issues. The first approach is to develop thermoelectric (TE) coolers using nanotechnology. Thermoelectric materials require high electrical conductivity, but low thermal conductivity. Using nanotchnology it should be possible to significantly suppress the thermal conductivity without a corresponding reduction in electron transport. The second approach we propose is to enhance the thermal contact conductance at interfaces by taking advantage of nanotechnology.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
 There are several NASA applications for both proposed approaches to thermal management in solid-state devices. The thermoelectric devices could be used for refrigeration and cooling from cryogenic to room temperature for a variety of devices such as microprocessors or detectors. The same thermoelectric materials could also be used for power generation in the presence of an external heat source. A variety of heat sources could be utilized including waste heat from engine exhaust or heat from a radioactive isotope. The technique for enhancing thermal conductance at interfaces could be used for the thermal management of space-borne microelectronic and nanoelectronic packages and systems. The concept could be integrated with current device technology and packaging and it would allow for an efficient method to manage excess heat generation without requiring any additional power.

 There are several potential commercial applications for both proposed approaches to thermal management in solid-state devices. The thermoelectric devices could be used for refrigeration and cooling from cryogenic to room temperature for a variety of devices such as high-performance electronics and IR/visible CCD/CMOS imaging cameras. The same thermoelectric materials could also be used for power generation in the presence of an external heat source. A variety of heat sources could be utilized including waste heat from engine exhaust or heat from a radioactive isotope. The technique for enhancing thermal conductance at interfaces could be used for the thermal management of microelectronic and nanoelectronic packages and systems.

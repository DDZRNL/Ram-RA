<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to develop a novel high temperature PMR-RTM polyimide resin with a low melt viscosity (<5 Poise at 288 ?C) that will address the NASA-GRC need for advanced materials for lightweight propulsion systems for reduced emissions.  Triton?s proposed innovative research will focus on developing a novel PMR-RTM polyimide resin that has a very low melt viscosity (1-5 Poise), excellent thermal stability and mechanical performance comparable to PMR-15.  This resin will allow out of autoclave manufacture of complex shaped parts, and the size of the part will not be limited by the size of the autoclave

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Development of new low melt flow viscosity (RTM/VARTM), environmentally friendly high temperature polyimide resins would allow ?out-of-autoclave? manufacturing of large structures such as large composite tanks for the next generation Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLVs).  Currently the size of the autoclave predicts the size of the components that can be fabricated, which is a limitation for development of the next RLVs 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Triton has teamed with end users to evaluate the development of the new RTM/VARTM high temperature resins for compatibility with their current composite manufacturing.  This teaming arrangement will assist Triton to develop the resin within the manufacturer production specifications.  The potential commercial applications are aircraft jet engines, rocket and turbine engines, and auxiliary power in aircraft and space vehicles.

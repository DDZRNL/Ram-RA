<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes to develop a high barrier, biodegradable food packaging system that will address the issues of extended-life food storage and waste disposal in space.  On long-term space missions, on board the International Space Station, or on future lunar or planetary facilities, a biodegradable food packaging plastic could be disposed of in hydroponic environments that support agricultural production.  Several biodegradable polymers are commercially available, but they lack the barrier properties needed for food preservation.  TDA proposes to improve the barrier properties of biodegradable plastics by forming a multi-layered laminate film containing biodegradable polymers modified with our proprietary nanocomposites.  Much of TDA?s nanocomposite research has focused on the careful design of surface treatments to produce nanocomposites compatible with and dispersible in targeted host polymers.  In Phase I, we demonstrated that we could improve the barrier properties of several individual films of biodegradable polymers.  In Phase II we will meet high barrier packaging requirements by combining layers of biodegradable nanocomposites to achieve protection against both oxygen and water vapor permeation.  We have shown that we can form well-dispersed nanocomposites with several biodegradable plastics and, in one example, have demonstrated improved barrier properties without a loss in biodegradation rates.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The high barrier multi-layer laminate films developed in this project could be used in extended duration space missions that would require a significant amount of packaged, shelf-stable food.  A high barrier packaging material that was biodegradable would be a critical part of the Advanced Life Support system and would decrease the amount of food package waste that would be stored on board until re-entry or incineration is possible.  Biodegradable food packaging materials could be recycled in-flight in hydroponic baths as a supplement for crops grown inside the spacecraft.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
As a bio-based polymer, PLA can be produced domestically at low cost, eliminating dependence on foreign petroleum supplies with their corresponding demand and price fluctuations.  PLA is also biodegradable - an additional important feature that realistically addresses the problems of plastic waste generation. Successful development of high barrier PLA would find application in a variety of areas including consumer packaging applications, packaging for food and food service applications, and medical packaging.   PLA nanocomposites also have the potential to replace several commodity thermoplastics like polyolefins and PVC in certain applications.

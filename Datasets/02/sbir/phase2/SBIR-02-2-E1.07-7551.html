<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Multilayer thermoelectric coolers offer a great promise in the refrigeration field. These solid state coolers have great advantages over the conventional Peltier coolers and compressed based units, these include compact size, high cooling rates, high power densities, no working fluid,  lightweight, and cost effectivness. In Phase I, Sigma developed the technique for making multilayer Peltier. In Phase II, Sigma proposes to scale up the Phase I process. Sigma proposes here a cost effective, vacuum based, solvent free batch process to manufacture the new generation of multilayer coolers in one single pass. An inline monitoring system assures a high reliability. At the end of Phase II, Sigma will produce hundred of parts for field testing. Sigma will collaborate with major refrigeration companies to take the product to the market in record times.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The new multilayer Peltier cooler is expected in a multitude of NASA applications that include the cooling of  infrared detectors, laser Ddodes, fiber optics switches, heat sensitive sensors, biosensors, reference sources, imaging devices(CCDs), telescopes, blood analyzer, fiber optics, gyros, guidance systems, and computer processors 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercial applications for the new Peltier include portable coolers, temperature controlled wear,  beverage dispensers, small refrigerators , heating and cooling pads, crycoolers, IR imaging (night vision goggles), genomic chips, environmental and medical instrumentation

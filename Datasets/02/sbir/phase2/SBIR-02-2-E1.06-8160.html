<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The diamond based backward wave oscillator (BWO) proposed here introduces novel slow wave circuit and fabrication concepts and makes use of silicon microfabrication and liquid crystal display technologies that have not previously been applied to the manufacture of vacuum electron devices to provide a miniature, energy efficient, electronically tunable and mass producible signal source in the sub mm wavelength regime.  The structure of the BWO is fabricated from a monolithic body of chemically vapor deposited diamond.  The technologies of fabrication and design that are proposed here for use in the development of the BWO have been pioneered by the offerors or are readily available from competent vendors.  In Phase I a design has been completed for two versions of a 300 GHz oscillator, with 10% and 20% bandwidth, respectively.  A fabrication plan has been proposed and a team of credible technical experts has been assembled to carry the work to the demonstration of a prototype oscillator in Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Conventional Backward Wave Oscillators are prohibitively large, and energy inefficient to be space borne.  The current design proposed will enable the cost effective incorporation of BWOs on satellites for space-based radio astronomy.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
It has recently been reported that remote detection of spectral signatures from biological warfare agents has been achieved using a differential absorption radar (DAR) technique in the 300 GHz - 1 THz frequency range.  Also the detection of hazardous gases in industrial settings is viable.  A ?handheld? version of the BWO proposed here could enable the detection and protection against chemical, biological warfare agents and dangerous industrial gases.  Such a device dedicated to Homeland Security, Military Defense and safety would have enormous commercial potential.

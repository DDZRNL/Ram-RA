<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In this SBIR program,  Nanohmics is developing an ultrahigh efficiency MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS) cryogenic cooling system.  The cryocooler is based on a Stirling Engine that is operating in reverse mode (mechanical-to-thermal) transduction.  These devices show particular promise as MEMS coolers for integrated circuits and other planar detection arrays.  This program improves on past work to develop a MEMS-based Stirling cryocooler that will dramatically improve the cryocooler performance and simplify device construction.  The improvements to be included in this program are replacing the silicon heat exchanger plates and flexible membranes with high thermal conductivity diamond and monolithically constructing the gas impervious walls and regenerator portion of the device using quartz (SiO2).  In Phase I of this program, Nanohmics examined the effects of introducing these materials into Stirling cryocoolers in the MEMS setting.  This included thermal modeling of the proposed structure and examination of the operating parameters to produce optimum performance.  Nanohmics also developed the process steps necessary to fabricate the device.  In Phase II Nanohmics proposes to fabricate and test a prototype device based on the Phase I design.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
To fulfill NASA?s Earth Science Enterprise mission objectives, Nanohmics plans to develop an ultrahigh thermal efficiency MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS) cryogenic cooling system.  The system will be designed to decrease the cost and size of cooling devices for instruments that perform Earth Science measurements and thus lead to compact electromagnetic detection and microelectronics platforms for integration into miniature probe spacecraft.  Additional NASA applications include dependable long term cooling for detectors on deep space satellite missions.  The proposed MEMS cooler will be highly reliable, light weight, have low vibration, and energy efficient.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Miniaturized coolers have many military and commercial applications. The largest commercial application is cooling of microprocessors and detectors. Currently, speed of microprocessors and the efficiency of detectors are limited by the amount of power that can be removed from the devices. Chip scale heat pumps will allow efficient cooling of devices enabling operation at greater speeds / power densities.  A number of examples exist where a MEMS-based cryocooler integrated into compact environments would be useful.  These include: IR and other electromagnetic radiation detector cooling and cooling of packaged microelectronic chips.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
3DGeo will implement a graphical user interface (GUI) built on top of the Globus Toolkit 3.0 (GT3) middleware and complying with the Open Grid Services Infrastructure (OGSI) standard.  This GUI will be a convenient interface for computational resource discovery, computational resource monitoring, and workflow submission to the Grid.  These features will be built into 3DGeo?s Java-based INSP system - a generic interface for scientific computing, applicable to any compute task.  With this innovation, INSP Explorer will become a window to the Grid, allowing transparent submission of computationally intensive jobs to the Grid rather than to individual compute servers.  This essential productivity tool will free the end-user from the burden of searching for compute resources or from explicitly splitting up large computational tasks between compute servers, thereby allowing the user to focus on the scientific aspects of his task.
<br>
<br>3DGeo?s first commercial application of this technology will be in the seismic imaging market, an industry that is a natural fit for Grid usage because of its specific requirements for large processing capacity and large data storage requirements ? which is exactly what the Grid (and OGSI) are designed for.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Specific to NASA?s technology requirements, the proposed Grid-enabled processing system will provide a convenient graphical user interface for the detection of available remote resources, for workflow submission and application execution, and for the continuous monitoring of those resources being used. The Phase II product will offer an infrastructure which will allow NASA scientists and engineers to easily and efficiently harness system-wide and third party resources in order to accomplish their computational tasks. 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed implementation will be dedicated initially to one of the most computationally demanding commercial endeavors that exist: the 2 billion dollar seismic imaging market for energy exploration and development. This constitutes one of the largest private-sector compute and data intensive marketplaces, and a perfect fit for Grid technology.  The proposed project, however, has a wider range of applicability and is not limited to seismic imaging alone. It has relevance to resource-demanding applications, for example:  the numerical simulation of wind-tunnels (CFD), the design of new pharmaceuticals (Computational Chemistry), DNA sequencing, the modeling of world economies, high-energy physics, and many others.

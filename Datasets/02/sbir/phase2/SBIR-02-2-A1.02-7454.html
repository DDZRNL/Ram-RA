<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The goal of this program is to mature the FRF sandwich panel design for the engine fan case application.  Toward this goal, the following technical objectives will be pursued.  This program will demonstrate how critical structural details are incorporated with TYCOR technology, leading to unitized structures that require less post-processing than composite laminate approaches.  The work will be focused on a commercial jet engine application using WebCore?s relationship with aircraft engine manufacturers to identify the best application.    Structural and physical properties will be verified in each component structure as well as the final, integrated fan case.
<br> 
<br>The manufacturing processes used in the production of the engine case will be evaluated and refined. These include technologies to aid in the production of preforms, the methods for processing and molding the bodies of revolution.  Of particular importance will be the molding of full-circumferential bodies and the production and molding of non-uniform cross-sections.  Using the data collected during this program, a cost model will be generated to document the cost advantages of TYCOR/Resin Infusion Process technology vs. current baseline composite and metallic components.  Finally, a full-scale demonstration article will be produced in which the components are integrated into the design.  This fan case will show a full body of revolution with integral hard points and flange attachments.

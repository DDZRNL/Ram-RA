<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Current and future thrusts within NASA call for the availability of high efficiency, high reliability, space-hardened energy supply systems.  NASA will benefit from availability of these systems in its push towards expanding mankind?s understanding and place in space.  One technology having the most potential for serving NASA objectives is thin-film photovoltaics.  Great advances have been made over the past 20 years in photovoltaic technology, and thin-film devices are no exception.  However, these advances have not led to the realization of the combination of high efficiency and high power density required for future NASA applications.  One shortcoming has been the substrate material.  In this Phase II program, Foster-Miller proposes the continued development of a substrate that will enable the realization of NASA?s long-term goals.  Among commercially available polymeric materials, PBO is the only material exhibiting the high temperature stability and high mechanical strength necessary to achieve the high efficiency and high power density required for these missions to come to fruition. This Phase II effort will address the space-stability problem - common among polymeric substrates - for PBO by identifying and optimizing coatings to impart a space-hardened nature.  Devices will be fabricated and an array will be supplied to NASA. (P-030625)

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A mature space-hardened CIGS-on-PBO PV system will find application in many current and future thrusts at NASA.  The provision of low density power generation systems such as CIGS-on-PBO PV?s will present a means of increasing mission payload or decreasing mission budgets.  This will have specific implication in Space Science Missions such as a Mars Outpost SEP Tug where increased payloads are desirable.  Assessment of the effects of combining PV?s with electronic propulsion systems for solar system missions such as Jupiter and Venus orbiters has indicated significant potential for launch cost savings and increases in mass margins.  Additional NASA applications include: large size satellites, microsats, deep space solar electric propulsion arrays, planetary surface power generation, and deep space outpost power generation.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Space-hardened CIGS-on-PBO technology could be readily transferred to several commercial and government applications outside of NASA.  Commercial applications include the remote terrestrial power generation (i.e., roofing shingles), battery trickle charger, and cell phone chargers.  Government applications include military personnel power supply, structurally-integrated power for deployable tents and shelters, and drones.

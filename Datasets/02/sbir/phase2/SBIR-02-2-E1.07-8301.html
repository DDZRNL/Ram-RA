<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
MicroEnergy Technologies, Inc. (MicroET) is proposing to develop a self-contained and autonomous thermal management system for distributed cooling of microelectronics.  The problem of managing the heat load from multiple discrete heat sources within electronic systems is becoming a growing problem and receiving attention not only at NASA but at DoD and within the commercial sector.  In this project, we have demonstrated the feasibility of developing a state-of-the-art autonomous cooling module that could be used in a network for thermal management of discrete and distributed electronics.  The cooling module takes advantage of liquid cooling, pumped with a highly efficient built-in micropump integrated within the cooling module, to deliver more than 100 W/cm^2 of cooling.  The two critical components, the heat sink and the liquid transport pump, were tested, integrated in a single package and independently for phase I feasibility demonstrations.  For Phase II, MicroET is teaming with the University of Washington and Technology Assessment and Transfer (TA&T) to develop and demonstrate a breadboard prototype during the first year followed by a brassboard prototype made of a ceramic monolith structure during year 2 of the project.   Our team brings to the table expertise in system engineering and development, fluid dynamics and heat transfer, and ceramic microfabrication.  As described in the commercialization section of this proposal we have developed necessary partnerships and intellectual property to successfully manufacture and commercialize our electronics cooling products during phase III.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
MicroET?s mission is to develop an autonomous, highly efficient, hermetically sealed cooling module.  Our longer term goal is the development of thermally-actuated autonomous cooling modules that eliminate the use of external power to drive the liquid in the loop.  As part of this mission, we are being funded from various sources to develop various components of our technology.  However, our product during the NASA SBIR Phase II project will be two different prototypes targeted to meet specific needs within NASA.  We expect that our product will have its highest impact in the following NASA programs: FPGA chip, micro/nano spacecraft, high density avionics, expandable and planar lidar/radar arrays, and miniature fuel cells.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proliferation of consumer microelectronics and the relentless progression of Moore?s Law offer numerous market opportunities for advanced thermal management systems. The waste heat fluxes from consumer-grade microprocessors are approaching 100 W/cm^2 and this trend shows no sign of slowing down. A mass-produced version of the MicroET cooling module could be cost-competitive with today?s most advanced cooling solutions, but would exhibit significantly better performance than the current state-of-the-art. There are extensive application opportunities in personal computers, network servers, supercomputers, embedded computing devices, and a wide range of telecommunications equipment.
<br>Wide band gap semiconductors have been the subject of a great deal of research and development work in recent years. The Department of Defense has a number of ongoing programs to use these semiconductors in phase array radar and similar high-energy applications. While wide band gap materials have some distinct advantage, they also generate large quantities of waste heat, with fluxes approaching 1000 W/cm^2. A high-performance distributed cooling system is imperative for the operation of such systems.  High power lasers are in use in numerous military, scientific, and industrial applications ? some with extremely large waste heat fluxes (1000 W/cm^2 and greater). As with wide band gap semiconductors, a high-performance thermal management system is absolutely necessary.

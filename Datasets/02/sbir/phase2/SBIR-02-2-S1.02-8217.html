<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This SBIR Phase 2 project shall develop sputter-resistant materials for use in electric propulsion test facilities and for plume shields on spacecraft using electric thrusters.  A critical need arises because NASA is developing higher impulse, higher power thrusters for deep space science missions.  Such thrusters will erode chamber walls ten-times more aggressively than before and create unacceptably high levels of contamination in the life test facilities. Without new materials that are ten-times more resistant than graphite, the only alternative may be installation of larger vacuum test chambers at huge facility cost.  
<br>The proposed sputter-resistant materials are based on carbon fibers in a highly textured configuration that allows deep penetration of incident ions and trapping of sputtered secondary atoms.  Phase 1 testing has demonstrated a 5x reduction in sputter backflow toward the ion source, consistent with modeling predictions. It appears feasible to extend the use of existing test facilities at least into planned near term testing of next generation ion engines.  
<br>Phase 2 will develop thicker low-contamination chamber liners intended for long duration exposure, and modeling tools will be developed to aid in the design of baffled chamber liners. Lightweight rigid plume shields for spacecraft using EP will be demonstrated and offered for testing. Removable, cleanable, liner configurations will be demonstrated for use  with condensable liquid metal propellants. Sputter testing will be performed by CSU using hemispherical witness plates to rapidly acquire directional yield data. Low-contamination chamber liner materials designed for use in testing high current, high voltage ion sources will be delivered under the contract for evaluation by NASA.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Sputter-resistant materials have immediate application in NASA ground test facilities devoted to life testing high current, high voltage electric propulsion thrusters. 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Sputter-resistant materials have broad applications where ion sources are used. Plume shields are needed to protect spacecraft surfaces from sputtering by An immediate application is as plume shields shields on spacecraft using electric propulsion, fusion reactor first walls, pulsed power diodes, ion current probes, and broad commercial application in facilities that perform materials processing with sputter sources.

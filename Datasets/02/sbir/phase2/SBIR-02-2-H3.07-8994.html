<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
  Our research program is focused on achieving high thermal performance in a high temperature carbon-carbon (C-C) radiator especially designed to fulfill present and future challenges in outer space applications. The radiator is one of the key parts in heat rejection systems, in both power conversion technologies for solar and space nuclear electric propulsion. An advanced radiator must provide high thermal performance with minimum mass while satisfying launch and deployment considerations. Traditional metal based radiators and single phase pumped heat transport loops are inadequate for the emerging demands; metal based high temperature radiators usually are over 8 ~ 10kg/m2.  C-C composite materials are ideal candidates to solve this challenge because of their series of advantages, such as very low density, high thermal conductivity, good mechanical properties, high flexibility and variability in thermal and structural properties by tailoring their composite constituents.  In combination with heat pipes, two-phase Capillary Pumped Loops (CPL) and Loop Heat Pipes (LHP) or other two-phase heat transport loops, overall thermal performance and reliability of the space radiators can be significantly improved and realized by reducing radiator mass, which is a big portion of overall spacecraft mass.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Power systems currently under development for deep space exploration are a prime example of an application that would benefit significantly by this research and development.  A five fold reduction in radiator specific mass is achievable and needed to meet the demanding challenge of space exploration.  The proposed C-C radiator design has wide ranging application in both low and high-radiated temperatures, as well as for small and large power conversion systems.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Carbon-carbon radiators in the form of heat exchangers are expected to emerge in aerospace applications, particularly in high performance military aircraft, and hypersonic vehicles where high temperatures pose severe design issues.

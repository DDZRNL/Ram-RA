<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In recent decades, there has been significant progress in the fields of biotechnology, molecular biology, and genetics. These efforts have enabled deciphering of the human genome, and have fueled the development of microarray technologies for studying the very basis of life; how genes and proteins develop, function, and how they can change under certain conditions. Commercially available microarray readers are not suitable for space use. To perform experiments in space, NASA needs a portable, lightweight, sensitive microarray reader.
<br>In Phase I, Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) demonstrated a lightweight, low power, compact, gene microarray reader for monitoring gene expression. The high sensitivity was achieved by utilizing nanoparticles as labels, and evanescent field ellipsometry for detection. The Phase I results showed an attractive alternative to fluorescence as a microarray readout method. The sensitivity, resolution, measurement speed, and simplicity of IOS?s system exactly match NASA's requirements.
<br>In Phase II, IOS will design and construct a compact portable microarray reader for NASA?s use. The biochip preparation and testing procedures will be optimized and the prototype device?s performance will be optimized. At the end of Phase II, IOS will deliver to NASA an effective, working prototype device, along with 20 gene chips for testing.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The evolution of life on earth has occurred under the influence of gravity. Therefore, all biological processes are influenced by and have evolved in the presence of gravity. IOS? proposed reader system could be used for gene expression studies beyond earth's gravity, in a microgravity environment. Astrobiologists, microbiologists, and others interested in medical, pharmaceutical, and research applications will use this reader. Genetic engineering studies for waste remediation, studying the effects of radiation, and genetic engineering of food to enhance value are other possible space applications. 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary application of the proposed device will be as a gene chip microarray reader for expression monitoring. Any application that involves genetic engineering will benefit from this reader system. Such a device will be useful to research laboratories, universities, and the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. Modified versions of this device could serve as a sensitive biosensor for homeland defense applications, and also for clinical diagnostics and proteomic studies. Secondary applications for this device include industrial, environmental, and process monitoring.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
BasinTools is designed to facilitate the use of remotely sensed data by users who are not remote sensing specialist. Information from remotely sensed data would be used by a wide variety of engineers, planners, and scientist except they lack the expertise, sophisticated software, or high-end hardware to make use of the data. Federal, State, and Local Governments all have need of information derived from remotely sensed data, yet when faced with the overwhelming cost of implementation they invariably opt for more affordable, less accurate alternatives. 
<br>
<br>The proposed study prototypes the implementation of a Web-based application that is user friendly, affordable, and accurate. The prototype will provide ?canned? push button analysis of imagery a user is viewing through the Web portal and viewing results of the analyses on the fly through the custom online viewing tools. 
<br>
<br>This Web based approach limits the amount of requisite user expertise, software, hardware, and computing power necessary to perform these analyses. Commercial manufacturers have employed the use of just-in-time inventory control for decades, this innovation applies the same cost saving 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Users of the system will be able to view and analyze remotely sensed data and download the derivative products they produce. All through a Web site that does not require downloads plug-ins, nor access to expensive, sophisticated software or hardware. Users need only have access to the Web to make use of this system. Standardized algorithms available via push buttons on a Web-based graphical user interface (GUI) provide access to remotely sensed information in support of BasinTools or any other Geospatial software regardless of a users experience level. This Web based approach limits the amount of requisite user expertise, software, hardware, and computing power necessary to perform these analyses. Commercial manufacturers have employed the use of just-in-time inventory control for decades, this innovation applies the same cost saving logic to remotely sensed data; products are created and delivered on the fly with no human intervention via the Web. Data vendors will need to store only the source data; derivative products will be produced on the fly as they ordered by on-line clients and delivered in near real time via the Web.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are three areas where this prototype may have immediate impact on markets. 
<br>?	Education
<br>?	Commercial data vendors
<br>?	Application Services (Precision Ag, facility management, forestry)
<br>
<br>
<br>Commercial data vendors will be able to provide per kilometer sales with no minimum order using automated sub-setting and customized data delivery systems. Custom derivative products will be created and delivered in real time with little or no additional overhead cost to the vendor. 
<br>
<br>This system will enable profitable application services to fully mature, Precision Ag in particular stands to advance substantially, where the time between data acquisition and delivery of custom derivative products is reduced or eliminated entirely. Forestry is another market where real-time availability of processed or value added imagery is of great importance. The need for producers to maintain additional high-tech staff to interpret or process data is reduced or eliminated entirely. No need to store large data files, or maintain on-site geo-spatial information. No need to wait 24 hours for data to post. Value added data can be processed inline and can be available immediately after the data are downloaded. High resolution aerial or satellite data vendors will be able to produce regional data sets and market to large groups rather than to large commercial farms alone. In addition to the commercial farms, Precision Ag will become viable for moderate sized farms as well.

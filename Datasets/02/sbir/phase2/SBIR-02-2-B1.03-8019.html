<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The overall objective is to develop a ?mixed-methodology?, drag and drop, component library (fluidic-lego)-based, system design and optimization tool for complex lab-on-a-chip systems.  Experiments-based design is expensive and time-consuming.  Full multiphysics simulations, while successful in designing components, are computationally infeasible for system design.  The proposed tool will accelerate (days to minutes) and simplify (non-expert vs. expert) biomicrofluidic system design.
<br>
<br>Simple representation of complex, interacting physico-bio-chemical processes is a formidable challenge.  Our innovative ?mixed-methodology? solution seamlessly exchanges information between vastly different methodologies, (Artificial Neural Network, Differential Algebraic Equation, Analytical and High-fidelity).  In Phase I, we have developed a hierarchical software consisting of System Designer (GUI), System Solver and component models.  Proof-of-concept was successfully demonstrated, (compared to high-fidelity simulations), by characterizing a candidate biomicrosystem in a fast (350 fold reduction, 1.5 hour to 15 seconds), intuitive manner, while retaining accuracy (~10% difference).
<br>
<br>Phase II will feature enhanced component models and system solver for multiphysics phenomena (electrokinetics, biochemistry, capillary and hemodynamics), augmented GUI functionalities and extended library of microfluidic components.  An expert advisory board (NASA, academia, industry) will guide the multidisciplinary development team.  CFDRC is committed to developing simulation tools for biotechnology, and will leverage its considerable expertise and resources toward successful commercialization.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Microfluidic technology is inherently advantageous for space applications due to the reduced size/weight and power requirements as well as the capability for multiplexed analysis without user intervention (automated).  The proposed software tool will directly benefit NASA?s endeavors to develop lab-on-a-chip systems for use in space (e.g., NASA GRC Biomedical Engineering Consortium?s efforts to deploy biodiagnostic chips on-board the International Space Station; NASA MSFC effort in growing protein crystals in space using microfluidic platforms; NASA JSC?s microfluidics-based biosensor for their rotating cylinder bioreactor; as well as NASA Ames focus on automated bioanalysis systems for medicine and space exploration). 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
CFDRC will also market the software to biotechnology companies.  CFDRC has an already established client base in biotechnology sector such as Agilent, Dupont, Micronics, Sandia (see enclosed support letters), Applied Biosystems, Caliper Technologies, etc.

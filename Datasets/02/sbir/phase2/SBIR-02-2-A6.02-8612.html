<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary goal of Phase II is to produce an X-ray tube with a small focal spot suitable for an X-ray Diffraction instrument that can be used for in situ  analysis of materials in industrial and planetary exploration environments. A base model, based on a previously developed miniature, carbon nanotube X-ray tube, was designed and fabricated during Phase I.  Four tubes will be delivered at intervals during Phase II. Each tube will incorporate improvements converging on the objective specifications, 40 kV operating voltage, 100 microamps of current and a focal spot of 40 microns.  Design improvements will be achieved with electron optics simulation computer code that was modified to model emission from CNT cathodes and the electron beam analyzer that was design and constructed during Phase I.  Improvement in the emission stability and uniformity will be sought using the cathode test and evaluation station that was constructed and operated during Phase I.  The cathode evaluation system has already been used to select cathodes and develop CNT cathode processing regimens that resulted in improving the acceptance rate, from 50% to 90%,of CNT cathode X-ray tubes being produced at Oxford X-ray Technologies for hand held XRF Spectrometers.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Cold cathode x-ray tube provide the source for very small x-ray fluorescence and diffraction instruments that are suitable for hand held and portable applications on earth as well as space. These tubes are well suited to withstand the rigors of space travel and mounting on small rovers.  The improvements in CNT cathode technology and electron optics design tools that we are developing to meet the space based requirements, are key to utilizing CNT emitters in vacuum electron devices for microwave amplifiers and electron beam sources for air purification, environmental remediation, sterilization, and space base manufacturing.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Development of the focused beam x-ray tube will immediately extend the utilization of CNT cathodes to x-ray diffraction instruments and imaging that require small focal spots and higher intensity.  Improvements in emission stability and uniformity resulting from this project will be exploited for electron beam generators for use in drying inks on high speed presses, for non-burning destruction of toxic and odoriferous hydrocarbons in the environment, for sterilization of surfaces and powdered materials in industry and pharmaceuticals and for brachytherapy in medicine. Integrated arrays of microwave amplifiers based on cold cathode vacuum electronics technology are currently being investigated.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to create model-based simulation and analysis tools for
<br>risk management throughout the system life cycle.  Rather than using
<br>traditional approaches based on failure events in static engineering
<br>designs, we will treat a system as a dynamic process that is
<br>continually adapting to achieve its ends and to react to changes in
<br>itself and its environment.  The original design must not only enforce
<br>appropriate constraints on behavior to ensure safe operation, but the
<br>system must continue to operate safely as changes occur.  The process
<br>leading up to an accident (loss event) can be described in terms of an
<br>adaptive feedback function that fails to maintain safety as
<br>performance changes over time to meet a complex set of goals and
<br>values.  Using this definition of risk management, we will extend our
<br>commercial system engineering tool set to include model-based
<br>simulation and analysis of risk throughout the system life cycle,
<br>including complex human decision-making, software errors, system
<br>accidents (versus component failure accidents), and organizational risk
<br>factors.
<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The results of this SBIR research will be potentially applicable to
<br>every NASA project where significant losses can result from the
<br>operation or lack of operation of the system.  It should be
<br>particularly important in systems with significant software and human
<br>automation interaction components and in large projects where
<br>management decisions about risk are critical and need to be supported.
<br> 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The results of this SBIR project will be applicable to risk management
<br>in any safety-critical system.  SpecTRM-RL, the modeling language as
<br>well as the more SpecTRM requirements specification and analysis
<br>tools, are currently in use in the automotive and aerospace industries
<br>and being evaluated for use in the medical device industry as well.

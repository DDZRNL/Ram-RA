<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The paradigm shift of using a multiple-satellite cluster rather than a large, monolithic spacecraft has been fueled by the objectives of increased robustness, greater flexibility, and reduced cost. It should be understood, however, that these objectives are not automatically met. The operational costs of monitoring and commanding a large fleet of close-orbiting satellites is likely to be unreasonable unless the onboard software is sufficiently autonomous, robust, and reconfigurable. A decentralized, agent-based guidance and control system has been designed in Phase I to help meet these challenging software requirements.
<br>
<br>The proposed concept is a decentralized guidance and control system, organized in a multiple-team framework, and implemented within the Princeton Satellite Systems? (PSS) ObjectAgent? architecture. In the ObjectAgent architecture, Agents may be remotely added, removed or replaced post-launch to increase mission flexibility and robustness. This level of reconfigurability exceeds the state-of-the-art in traditional flight software. The reconfigurable, decentralized system will enable the number of spacecraft in the cluster to change post-launch, will be capable of supporting clusters with large numbers of satellites, and will allow significant software modifications to be made on-orbit in a robust manner.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Two potential NASA applications include the MMS and SIRA missions being planned at Goddard Space Flight Center.
<br>
<br>The objective of MMS is to identify the basic plasma processes which control the structure and dynamics of the Earth's magnetosphere. The mission involves 4 spacecraft in HEO, with relative distances ranging from 1 km to several earth radii. The formation control objective is to form the spacecraft into a tetrahedron at apogee. 
<br>
<br>The purpose of SIRA is to obtain high-resolution measurements of transient phenomena in the solar corona. The proposed mission involves 16 close-orbiting spacecraft, placed either in an Earth-centered DRO or at a libration point. The formation control objective is to provide sustained formations in which the cluster fills the u-v plane perpendicular to the sun-line. Because this mission involves a large number of spacecraft, it seems an ideal candidate for the Decentralized Formation Flying system.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Any mission involving formation flying of cooperative spacecraft is a potential application for this product. While most of the planned formation flying missions known to the public today are research related, the Department of Defense has shown a continued effort to advance formation flying technologies. Potential military applications include stereoscopic imaging of space-based targets and redundant multiple-satellite architectures for missile defense.
<br>
<br>A specific example is the TechSat 21 mission, for which PSS has developed a centralized formation flying control system under SBIR funding. Although this program was recently cancelled due to budget issues, the inherent benefits of distributed satellite systems continue to fuel the military interests in formation flying.

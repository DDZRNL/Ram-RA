<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Our overall goal for this project is to develop the technologies necessary for fabrication of efficient cryogen-free superconducting magnets that can operate at temperatures of 6-10K. In the Phase I program, we demonstrated that an efficient solenoid magnet system may be built using small diameter Nb3Sn wires employing the react-and-wind approach. In the Phase II program we will fabricate model 3T magnets operating at 10K with currents of 8A, 5A and 3A. The magnet will be tested and then used by NASA in an ongoing R&D in the area of Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigeration.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Highest efficiency adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators useful for achieving very low temperatures in space missions require superconducting magnets with low operating current that workat temperatures in the range of 6-10K. This program is geared toward the development of technologies for manufacturing of such magnets. 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This program will establish practical and economical technologies in the areas of superconductor, and superconducting magnet technologies for operation at 6-10K. The results will impact the design, fabrication, and use of superconducting magnets for applications in space, high energy physics, medical, low temperature physics, spectroscopy, imaging, and chemistry.

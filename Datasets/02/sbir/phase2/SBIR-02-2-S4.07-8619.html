<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Phase I demonstrated a new lithium ion anode material based on nanotechnology that exploits the high rate capability and excellent cycle life of a carbon fiber material and the high volumetric and gravimetric capacity of tin-based systems to yield a high capacity material. Phase II objective will be to further optimize the modified carbon fiber anode to a level where a practical gravimetric capacity of 500-700 mAh/g can be delivered.  The combination of this anode with the mixed oxide cathode material in a lithium-ion battery packaged in a soft-pack aluminum laminate material should exhibit energy density ranging from190-230 Wh/Kg. The carbon fiber will act not only as an electronic conductor but also as a cushion that will accommodate the volume changes during lithium intercalation and deintercalation.  In addition, because of the metallic character of the modified composite anode, the overall cell impedance is expected to decrease.  Such a decrease in cells impedance should give rise to much improved rate performance and excellent cyclability than existing commercial cells. This proposed lithium-ion technology promises to revolutionize the world of space batteries in terms of cost/performance factor.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The lithium-ion batteries using our novel LPT's anode technology can be exploited for broad range of NASA applications, from planetary orbiters and landers to reusable launch vehicles and small aircraft. This battery technology can also be incorporated in unmanned Aerial Vehicles that require capacities up to 200 A-hr.  They can be used for missions to outer planets Jupiter, Pluto (e.g. Europa Orbiter and Pluto Fly-by) Planetary orbiters and the earth satellites (e.g GEO and LEO). The scale-up of these batteries should meet or exceed the battery requirements for space applications where cycle life of more than 30000 cycles for low earth orbit (LEO), high rate applications (> 4 kW/kg) and rapid charge/discharging (ten of seconds) and calendar life of more than 10 years for geosynchronous orbits (GEO) are needed.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Widespread use of a variety of portable consumer electronics such as portable computers, cellular telephones, camcorders and handheld power tools, as well as continued demand from other future potential applications such as electric bicycles, scooters and cars have resulted in large markets where our new lithium ion battery technology could be used. The commercial viability of electric vehicles is still primarily limited by battery technology. The successful development of novel lithium-ion batteries should meet and exceed the performances of commercial lithium-ion batteries and should be able to capture new markets such as the high rate applications (e.g. power tools, underwater vehicles, high-tech gadgets, PDA).  They could be also be used in wearable batteries for the military and load-leveling applications. These new and conventional applications are placing growing demands on existing battery technologies to deliver increasing amount of electricity through smaller and lighter batteries.

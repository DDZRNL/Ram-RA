<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This research involves the adaptation of an aircraft based runway incursion advisory and alerting system for general aviation applications.  PathProx is a runway incursion advisory and alerting system developed by Rannoch Corporation for air carrier operations.  The work under Phase I of this SBIR included the definition of the developmental needs for adapting the PathProx conflict detection and alerting collision avoidance algorithms to General Aviation (GA) operations.  Systems currently being deployed by the FAA are based on a ground infrastructure where runway incursion conflict alerts generated by the system are provided to ATC.  Under this operational scenario the pilot is not provided with conflict alert information in the cockpit, leaving the aircraft dependent on the ground ATC infrastructure and human response. A General Aviation runway incursion advisory and alerting system will provide the following safety benefits:
<br>
<br>?Reduction in the likelihood of near collisions resulting from runway incursions.
<br>?Improved pilot response in taking evasive actions following incursions.
<br>?Provision of runway incursion alerting at airports not equipped with surface surveillance systems
<br>?Provision of runway incursion alerting at uncontrolled (non-towered) airports
<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are two current NASA programs where GA runway incursion alerting has application ? Aviation Safety and the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS).  The Aviation Safety program includes the Runway Incursion Prevention System (RIPS), which has been addressing runway incursion prevention for air carrier operations.  This program also includes General Aviation operations, however there has no work done to date on the GA application.  The PathProx GA implementation would fulfill that role.
<br> 
<br>GA runway incursion alerting would be an augmentation to the SATS program.  Although the SATS operational concept does not include runway incursion alerting, it does include conflict detection and alerting in the terminal area ? under the High Volume Operations (HVO) part of the SATS program.  PathProx runway incursion alerting would extend the alerting to include the airport surface.

<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The ultimate product that would result from this research has potential application to general aviation, because runway incursions are a significant problem at all classes of airports.  A runway incursion alerting system is currently not available to any class of aircraft.  It is envisaged that the PathProx alerting algorithms would be a supplement to several other technologies that are currently under development.  These other technologies are GPS, ADS-B, and CDTI.  As the infrastructure for these technologies is established, it will be easy to integrate aircraft based PathProx into the avionics.

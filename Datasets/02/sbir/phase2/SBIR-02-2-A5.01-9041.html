<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The need for low density, high temperature materials in space has driven evaluation and implementation of carbon-carbon, ceramics and ceramic matrix composites (CMC) for structural applications.   The thermal, mechanical, and chemical properties of ceramic matrix composites make them attractive both for next generation and retrofit applications.  CMC?s require a fiber matrix interface coating to impart toughness, but the high cost of current interface coatings ? from 30 to 70% of the cost of a CMC part - has severely limited overall adoption of CMC?s.  Low cost oxidation resistant coatings are the third leg of the CMC material triad (fiber-interface-matrix) needed to realize full commercial potential.  Starfire polymer based coatings can reduce interface coating costs by 95%. 
<br>In Phase I, these coatings exhibited desirable  interface properties (thin, uniform, debonding).  The phase II effort will optimize these interface coatings such that they will protect the fiber from oxidation and support an oxygen sealing feature against both matrix micro-cracking and impact damage.    The interface coatings will be validated for  hypersonic, rocket, and turbine engine applications.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Key NASA applications are expected to include virtually all CMC applications such as thermal protection systems, turbo-pumps, cryotanks, nozzles, thrusters, and even space structures that would take advantage of the light weight and low thermal expansion properties of CMC?s.  Specific programs may include: Integrated High Performance Turbine Technology (combustors, turbine rotors, exhaust nozzles); Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (turbomachinery, nozzles, thrust chambers); Reusable and Expendable Launch Vehicles (thermal protection, thrust chambers, nozzles, brakes); In-Space Propulsion (maneuvering thrusters).

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Low cost, oxidation resistant fiber interface coatings will enable ceramic composites to be utilized in a wide range of applications where they are currently considered too costly. Specific applications that have been identified as potential markets include: brakes for commercial and military aircraft; brakes for automobiles, trucks, heavy equipment and trains; hot gas filters for pressurized fluidized bed combustion and integrated gasification combined cycle systems; furnace hardware such as pipe hangers for petroleum refining; reverberatory screens in porous radiant surface burners used for drying, curing and process heating, components for melting and handling metals; non-rotating components in ground-based gas turbines, especially combustion liners and shrouds; heat exchangers for externally-fired combine cycle (EFCC) power systems, thermophotovoltaic power systems for household appliances and quiet generators, reforming tubes for the chemical processing industry; and exhaust manifolds and high temperature engine components for diesel and gasoline powered auto engines.

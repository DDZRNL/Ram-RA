<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The project will investigate and develop a seamless vacuum insulated box (VIB) technology based on Aspen?s unique polymeric/silica aerogel alloy blanket technology. This new blanket material is ideally suited for VIP and VIB use with low density, high compression modulus, low thermal conductivity, and flexibility sufficient to form tight corners without failure. Two sets of prototypes will be developed in the project. The first will focus on a passive, seamless insulated box. The second will focus on a patent-pending technology that will allow for active cooling without the need to perforate the inner wall of the VIB. The resulting product will fit well into Aspen?s existing aerogel blanket manufacturing process. Its unique qualities will increase the number of markets Aspen can address with its aerogel composite insulation materials.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In order to perform on-orbit scientific research, NASA utilizes cryogenic freezers to maintain the specimens at the required temperatures.  As such, NASA is continually searching for lighter, more durable, and more efficient means for space vehicle refrigeration systems.  Rectangular enclosures provide more efficient packing within the vehicle payload than round enclosures.  Success of the current effort will enable highly thermally efficient and space efficient cryogenic freezers for NASA missions.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The rectangular refrigerator/freezer enclosure technology can easily be applied to refrigerated transportation (via truck, train, etc.), as well as household refrigerators and cryogenic dewar insulators for hospitals.  Similarly, the insulator technology will equally act to keep internal items warm, such as is the case for bread proofing ovens or pizza delivery bags.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
SSG Precision Optronics proposes the development and demonstration of a new optical fabrication process for the production of EUV quality Silicon Carbide (SiC) optics.  The process combines three technologies to provide a cost and schedule effective solution for lightweight, thermally stable precision optics for EUV applications.  First, near-net-shape cast SiC materials for monolithic lightweighted, SiC mirror substrates with minimal machining required.  Second, a thin CVD SiC sputter deposition process applied to the mirror facesheet.  This enables a low-scatter surface as well as high reflectance in the EUV band.  Third, the application of Tinsley?s computer controlled optical surfacing (CCOS) grinding and polishing makes it possible to generate aspheres with extremely accurate surfaces.
<br>
<br>The manufacturing process proposed allows production of state-of-the-art SiC aspheric mirrors with numerous benefits compared to competing technologies and traditional processes:
<br>
<br>?Excellent Surface Figure Accuracy (<0.01 waves RMS, over low and mid-spatial-frequency measurements);
<br>?Ultra-low micro-roughness (<10 Angstroms RMS routine, <1 Angstrom RMS achievable); 
<br>?Improved yield;
<br>?Very low areal densities (~10 kg/m2 at an aperture of 1 meter);
<br>?Superior thermal stability (SiC bulk material properties);
<br>
<br>In Phase 2, SSGPO will demonstrate an optimized optical fabrication process by producing a SiC EUV flight-ready optic.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The optical manufacturing process to be developed and demonstrated in the Phase II program is ideally suited for EUV applications as well as for optical instruments which are exposed to high thermal loads.  NASA applications that will benefit from this process development include Solar Physics, soft and hard x-ray optics, and large aperture lightweight mirrors (JWST). 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
High precision, low-scatter SiC optics have a number of non-NASA applications including X-ray optics for synchrotron sources and next generation EUV lithography for the semiconductor industry.

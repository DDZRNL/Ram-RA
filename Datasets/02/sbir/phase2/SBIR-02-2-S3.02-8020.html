<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Alameda Applied Sciences Corporation has demonstrated the feasibility of a new type of electric propulsion device dubbed the Magnetically Enhanced Vacuum Arc Thruster (MVAT).  This thruster is itself a variant on the Vacuum Arc Thruster that has been demonstrated via a recently concluded Phase I SBIR contracts from NASA. The VAT was verified to be a throttleable low mass (ca. 150g) high efficiency (ca. 10% measured), high Isp (1000-3000s) electric propulsion device that can be remotely adjusted to deliver individual impulse bits from 0.25?Ns to 50?Ns with repetition rates varying from 1?1000 Hz while all the time providing an Isp of >1000s. The MVAT approach has shown to improve thruster performance and control contamination while keeping the system mass low (<300g). AASC proposes to team with Aerojet to further develop and low level qualify the MVAT to TRL 5.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary application of the specific electric propulsion thruster to be developed in the proposed work will be for optical interferometry mission. However, beyond this immediate application, the thruster could find use for larger or smaller spacecraft used in precision pointing and attitude control. The MVAT will become the enabling technology to use micro-, and nano-spacecraft for more challenging but cost-effective missions.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercial applications might be found in communcation satellites. GEO-satellite location and bandwidth allocations are limited.  Bandwidth on these satellites is currently limited and expensive.  Future projections indicate that as more third-world countries enter the information-age, prices will increase with demand.  A solution seems to be to find or create new and innovative ways of providing bandwidth for example the use of constellations of small satellites. These satellites will require precise, low mass propulsion systems like the MVAT.

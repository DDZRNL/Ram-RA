<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Los Gatos Research proposes to develop a novel, flight-ready, instrument based on a new technology called Off-Axis Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy and continuous-wave, mid-infrared quantum cascade lasers to simultaneously measure the concentrations of CO, CH4, and N2O in the stratosphere and troposphere. These species have been identified as strong greenhouse gases, have very long atmospheric lifetimes, and thus play an important role in climate change. The proposed multi-laser Off-Axis ICOS instrument will measure all three of these species simultaneously while on board a NASA aircraft. In Phase I, we have demonstrated feasibility by building a laboratory prototype Off-Axis ICOS instrument and measuring CH4 in the near-infrared and CO in the mid-infrared. In Phase II, LGR will perform a series of scientific studies to characterize the selected absorption features, engineer a flight-ready, multiple-species analyzer, and test the analyzer aboard an aircraft before delivering the final system to NASA.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
CH4, CO, and N2O are critical atmospheric species that have been implicated in the greenhouse effect, stratospheric ozone depletion, and pollution transport.  Due to the importance of these species, NASA has developed a wide array of instruments to measure these gases including ALIAS, ARGUS, ATLAS and DACOM.  These instruments have provided precise concentration measurements but have been limited in their utility by their sensitivity to alignment and lack of robustness.  
<br>
<br>In this SBIR effort, we propose to circumvent these limitations by combining our novel Off-Axis ICOS technique with continuous-wave quantum cascade (QC) and DFB diode lasers.  Off-Axis ICOS surpasses the traditional multi-pass methods currently employed by NASA because it provides a longer sample pathlength and is far less sensitive to alignment.  Moreover, QC lasers are poised to replace Pb-salt lasers in many future applications due to the imminent possibility of room-temperature operation.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Beyond NASA, the proposed multiplexed, ultrasensitive gas analyzer has several commercial applications.  These applications include industrial process control, emissions monitoring, and the scientific instrumentation market.  During the Phase I research effort considerable progress has been made in developing an industrial process control monitor in collaboration with Dow Chemical Company.  Los Gatos Research is actively pursuing such commercial ventures and support through the SBIR Program would greatly bolster our efforts.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Next generation Far Infrared (FIR) Space Telescopes such as NASA?s SAFIR, SPIRIT, and SPECS require the entire mirrors, which can be as large as 10 meters in diameter, to be cooled to the temperature range of 4-40K.  To meet the challenging cooling requirements of the missions mentioned above, TTH Research proposed the development of an advanced capillary pumped cryocooling transport system capable of providing temperature control for a large area in the 4-40K temperature range.  Two-phase capillary pumped heat transport technology including Capillary Pumped Loops (CPLs) and Loop Heat Pipes (LHPs) offers many operational advantages over mechanically pumped counterparts.  CPLs and LHPs contain no moving part to wear out or to introduce unwanted vibrations to the optical components.  The transport lines can be made flexible (i) to accommodate the deployable mirror concepts and/or (ii) to isolate shocks/vibrations induced by mechanical cryocoolers from the telescope optics.  For Phase II, an demonstration test unit shall be designed, built, and tested to show that cryocooling over a large area of the telescope mirror at 2.5K-4K can be achieved with the proposed concept of He-LHP.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed He-LHP concept for large-area crycooling was designed and tested specifically for NASA's next generation FIR telescopes.  Its potential use is to provide 4-40K cooling to a large structure/mirror of the telescopes.  The cooling system must be lightweight and easily integrated/embedded into the telescope structure.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Cooling a large telescope structure to ~4K is just one of the potential applications of the He-LHP.  Even though it was originally designed for space-based systems, the proposed concept could be easily adapted for used in terrestrial electronic devices.  The He-LHP can be charged with any working fluid to operate in a chosen temperature range.  For example, with Nitrogen as the working fluid, the loop can provide 77K cooling for a large structure that contains high-temperature superconductor (HTS) electronics.  Another potential application of the proposed concept (with water as the working fluid) is to provide cooling for consumer electronics cabinets (e.g. high-power servers).  Due to its relative insensitivity to gravity, other terrestrial cooling applications onboard ships and airplanes are possible.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA, through several technology and concept development projects, is developing simulation/evaluation tools to assess the capacity and efficiency of alternative airspace/operational concepts.  Missing from the current tool suite, however, is the ability to evaluate concepts from the perspective of environmental impact ? a key missing piece required to move a promising concept from simulation to implementation.  To fill this gap, Metron Aviation develops a NAS-wide environmental impact modeling (NASEIM) service and fully integrates access to this service within the Advanced Concept Evaluation System (ACES), a fast-time simulator being developed as a national resource for evaluating NAS concepts.  NASEIM not only spares researchers from the computational burden and data requirements associated with environmental modeling, but provides innovative tools for interpreting modeling results.  The design of NASEIM allows fast-time noise computation ? consistent with the needs of the simulation it is supporting.  In addition to noise modeling, NASEIM integrates air quality impact assessment in the form of emissions inventories, providing a more complete environmental impact picture.  Using NASEIM, researchers can, early in the development cycle, identify concept elements that are significant contributors to specific impacts.  Further, NASEIM allows comparison across multiple concepts.  Phase II concludes with an integrated demonstration of NASEIM with ACES.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed NASEIM service is initially targeted for application to the Advanced Concept Evaluation System (ACES) simulation environment being developed under the Virtual Airspace Modeling and Simulation (VAMS) project.  By generalizing the interfaces and services designed in Phase II and leveraging existing web-based protocols, we open up access to NASEIM to other simulation environments.  Another particularly viable NASA application is the Future ATM Concepts Evaluation Tool (FACET).  Other potential ?clients? include CTAS tools such as FAST and EDP ? where NASEIM could assess impacts of a given window of traffic or, alternatively, provide real-time support for the CTAS decision logic.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In direct response to the globalization of air travel and increasing environment concerns, potential commercial applications of NASEIM include:
<br>?	State and local governmental bodies that need low-cost access to environmental modeling that across many airports and large regions;
<br>?	Transport providers that need the ability to see what impacts their evolving business strategies may have on the environment, and where their strategies may potentially conflict with environmental concerns;
<br>?	Aerospace firms and other contractors interested in airspace concepts that need a nationwide modeling capability to reduce the need for duplication of data, model elements, and analytical effort.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In Phase I, IFOS designed, built, and demonstrated a novel type of compact, lightweight, fast, ultra-high- resolution wavelength spectrometer. The central element of the spectrometer is based on innovative photonic crystal designs. These types of materials or structures can possess ultra-high dispersive properties and thus yield high levels of spectral resolution (picometer), in a very compact volume (1mm2 x 0.5 mm) and lightweight package (<100 grams).  In Phase II, we will optimize the design to miniaturize the packaging for enhanced performance and more design flexibility, enabling new and improved NASA missions and science measurement capabilities. Extensive reliability testing will be performed to validate the capability of the proposed spectrometer to NASA standards. By tailoring the thickness of each layer, numerically according to design specifications, the spatial dispersion of the device is maximized.  Going a step beyond the periodic photonic crystal approach, IFOS will obtain the decisive technical advantage to make this revolutionary spectrometer a superior product. IFOS will integrate all sub-components into an ultra-compact, lightweight and robust package, yielding ultra-high performance.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Photonic devices are robust and able to survive hostile environments. The compact, lightweight, and rugged nature of the proposed photonic-crystal spectrometer is ideal for aerospace applications, minimizing impact on vehicle payload, such as in-flight monitoring systems without vehicle performance degradation. These spectrometers have a variety of onboard applications, providing critical elements in the signal analysis for physical and chemical sensors, including the fast detection and super-high-resolution spectrometry of various gases (e.g., ammonia, hydrogen, hydrazine, carbon-dioxide, oxygen) with a fast response time. The IFOS spectrometer enables new scientific instruments, fitting into NASA?s Strategic Goal of ?Enabling revolutionary capabilities through new technology.?

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The developments of this proposal will result in the commercial availability of a revolutionary, ultra-compact spectrometer. The small size, lightweight and ruggedness will make the spectrometer an ideal candidate for all mobile applications, such as environmental monitoring, plasma, gas and other material analysis, biomedical and forensic studies, and safety needs (such as detection and analysis of biological agents or explosives). In addition, this effort will establish photonic crystal technology itself as commercially viable and thus open the door for additional photonic crystal devices. Commercial applications of this technology also include high-speed telecommunications and optical data processing.

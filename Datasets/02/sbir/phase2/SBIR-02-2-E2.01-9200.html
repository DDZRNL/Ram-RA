<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA requires dramatic advancements in material properties to improve launch vehicles, spacecraft, and the space station?s performance. Our plan is to provide: 1) Continuous carbon nanotube (CNT) composite fibers stronger than 10 GPa and tougher than any known material. 2) CNT fiber composites stronger than 6 GPa.
<br>
<br>We propose to develop hierarchical composites comprising continuous CNT composite fibers in CNT-reinforced matrices (CPMs).  We plan to: (1) Produce continuous CNT fibers with tensile strength >10 GPa and toughness >1000 J/g; (2) Develop CPMs optimized for application with CNT composite fibers; (3) Integrate continuous CNT fibers with CPMs to produce CNT fiber/CPM composites with tensile strength of > 6 GPa, twice the specific strength of carbon fiber/epoxy composites, and a toughness higher than any known material.  
<br>
<br>This program builds on two recent breakthroughs. Zyvex?s CNT solubilization technique dramatically increases organic solubility of CNTs without degrading their properties. A 5% loading of CNTs triples the tensile strength of cast epoxy. The UTD group produced continuous CNT composite fibers having quadruple the specific strength and double the modulus of the best steel wire and 20 times the toughness. These fibers provide a toughness of 600 J/g, much higher than any previously known material.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
*Lightweight, multifunctional structural components for aerospace vehicles that will enable increased strength and longevity, improved energy efficiency, and improved vehicle payload mass to lift-off mass ratios.
<br>*Multifunctional structural components for the space station (examples include skins, struts, and other structural members that combine strength, insulation, and shielding).
<br>*Advanced materials for fabrics and coatings used in space suits and other space applications.
<br>*Coatings and bonding agents for high-value components and equipment (examples include EMI shielding materials, ESD protection, ultra-strong adhesives, and conductive coatings for aerospace systems and components).
<br>*Composites for satellite armor.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
*Advanced materials for medical applications such as fabrication of prostheses and splints. 
<br>*Structural components for high-value civilian transportation applications (for example, more extensive use of composites for airframes, helicopter rotors, and skins).
<br>*Lightweight, multifunctional fabrics for soldier uniforms, armor, and helmets. Current technology for soldier armor relies on a combination of Kevlar layers and ceramic inserts. We believe that CNT composite fabrics with strength properties exceeding Kevlar can be exploited to reduce the reliance on ceramic inserts, thereby reducing the overall weight and bulk of soldier armor.
<br>*Professional sports and leisure equipment such as golf clubs, fishing rods, and tennis equipment.
<br>*Advanced flywheels capable of significantly higher rotational speeds
<br>*Materials for competitive yachting and car racing

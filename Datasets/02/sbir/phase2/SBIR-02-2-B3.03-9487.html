<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Exposure to microgravity results in a number of physiological changes including loss of bone and increased risk of kidney stone formation.  Long duration spaceflight requires a near real-time of monitoring bone loss during flight to alert astronauts to the potentially debilitating problems and direct the use of countermeasures.  Present technology requires post-flight measurement of urinary calcium on stored urine samples.  The Creare Urine Analysis System (UAS) provides a unique solution to this problem by enabling spectrophotometry (a proven technique in clinical chemistry) to provide real time measurements of urinary calcium loss to serve as a marker of bone loss and risk of kidney stone formation. The Creare UAS can be fully integrated into the International Space Station Urine Monitoring System to provide astronauts with running totals of total urinary calcium loss during the past day, week, and entire mission.  The real-time nature of the system will provide a non-invasive biosensor capable of early detection of excessive calcium loss, identification of crew members with elevated risk for kidney stone formation, and effective application of in-flight countermeasures.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Urine Analysis System will permit, for the first time, real-time monitoring of urinary calcium during spaceflight. The data provided by our system will allow astronauts to evaluate the extent of their bone loss during extended periods in microgravity, determine when more aggressive countermeasures are needed to prevent or limit bone loss, monitor the effectiveness of bone loss countermeasures, and assess risk of renal stone formation.  Data collected by the system will provide a valuable database for guiding continued research in bone loss prevention.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The technology developed under this program has direct application to clinical monitoring of the ten million Americans suffering from osteoporosis each year.  Present clinical monitoring techniques must be performed in the physician?s office or require expensive test kits.  The technology being developed under this program has the potential to permit cost-effective, continual home monitoring.  Low-cost, unobtrusive home monitoring of calcium loss could be extremely beneficial for many patients including those at greatest risk for rapid disease progression and those just starting therapy.  In addition, the frequent data points provided by a home-based monitor could provide the detailed data required to detect the subtle changes encountered in clinical application on earth without dietary control and facilitate research efforts aimed at development of new therapies.

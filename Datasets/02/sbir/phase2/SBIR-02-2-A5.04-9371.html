<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed development will integrate data acquisition electronics with a relatively high performance processing capability and a large amount of memory, all in a miniature package, yielding a miniature, intelligent, sensor electronics module.  This combination allows embedding of intelligent functions on sensors, providing the capability to implement data pre-processing and health monitoring of the system.  The data acquisition electronics will provide programmable, analog I/O and digital I/O, including programmable gain, filtering, and voltage or current source, and auto-calibration.  With the included processing power and memory, this system could operate autonomously, reporting to a higher level system only when queried or when specific conditions occur.  With an included Ethernet interface, the system can use a standard network to communicate with a higher level system or other intelligent sensor modules.  This system will simplify the task of data acquisition from remote locations or within a large, distributed data acquisition system.  Implementation of health monitoring within the intelligent sensor module increases confidence or trust in the data that comes from the module.  Maintenance is also simplified when the sensor node is able to report on its own health status, indicating when there is a fault or other need for maintenance.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The intelligent sensor module is being developed for use in ground testing of rocket engines, including monitoring of related support systems.  The programmable sensor interface will allow the system to be used with a wide variety of different sensors.  The Ethernet network interface and health monitoring capability allow the system to be conveniently deployed in remote and/or hard-to-reach locations.  Because of the systems versatile interface and programmable processing capability, the system could be applied to other test and monitoring applications.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Other potential commercial applications for the intelligent sensor module include automotive and industrial testing and monitoring, which are similar to the target NASA application.  Again, the flexible sensor interface, standard network interface, and processing capability, including the ability to monitor system health, allow the module to be applied in a broad range of situations.  With the ability to include complex data processing at the sensor level, the module could be used to distribute the processing load in an industrial process control system.  Similarly, the module would prove useful in automation and control applications that are not well served by traditional Programmable Logic Controllers, due to inadequate processing power or sensor input flexibility.

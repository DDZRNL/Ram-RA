<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercial microprocessors are challenged for use in satellite computers due to the damaging effects of radiation, particularly single event upsets (SEU) and functional interrupts (SEFI).  Space Micro has developed innovations for mitigating SEU/SEFI, enabling the use of high-speed microprocessors (>1,500 MIPS) with improved SEU tolerances (>1E-5 errors/day).  Time-Triple Modular Redundancy (TTMR) applies traditional triple modular redundancy on a single microprocessor.  TTMR improves SEU rates substantially.  SEFI is solved through the use of a SEFI ?Hardened Core? circuit, external to the microprocessor, along with SEFI recovery software embedded into application code.  It monitors the ?health? of the processor, and if SEFI occurs, forces the processor to return through a series of escalating events (interrupts, reset).  Space Micro successfully demonstrated monitoring and recovery of Pentiums from SEFI, 100% of the time, using a prototype of the H-Core in a proton environment. This is significant in being the industry?s first (only) demonstrated solution for SEFI in microprocessors.  
<br>
<br>In Phase II, the H-Core will be advanced into a radiation hardened IC that operates with any advanced microprocessor, allowing automatic return to operational status after a SEFI event.  Additionally, software recovery algorithms will allow applications to recover part or all of their lost data.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This SBIR provides enabling technology for several key NASA developmental areas:
<br>
<br>?	-Intelligent Distributed Spacecraft
<br>?	-Ultra-High Data Rate Communications
<br>?	-High Performance Spectrometry
<br>?	-Autonomous Reconfiguration
<br>?	-Complex Multi-node Heterogeneous Networks
<br>?	-Network Scalability for Incremental Network Growth 
<br>
<br>As high lighted in the Earth Science Enterprise Technology Workshop, drastically enhanced on-board processing is needed for data compression, event recognition and response, and hyperspectral and radar data processing
<br>
<br>With more computing power in space, we can also develop more efficient onboard real-time multisensor\multisource\multiresolution algorithms to perform target recognition, image deblurring, noise filtering, motion compensation, guidance and navigation, surveillance and reconnaissance, data compression and transmission for more effective earth resource monitoring as well as law enforcement and homeland security.  Programs such as Jupiter Icy Moons, Living With a Star, New Millenium and Mars missions will greatly benefit.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The same benefits as NASA missions apply to commercial and DoD military applications, both for communication and imaging.  As evidenced by the Air Force letter in the proposal, the Air Force is funding a low power space computer program to reach the same goals as desired by NASA and commercial satellite manufacturers (high speed, low power and radiation hard/tolerant).  Vastly increased performance over traditional radiation hardened processors enables lower cost systems, plus enabling new capabilities.  Spacecraft such as Lockheed Martin?s A2100 and Boeing?s 702, plus programs such as Echostar, Spaceway, Galileo, Direct TV, XM Radio and all GEO communication satellites will be customers.

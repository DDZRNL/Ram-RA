<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The purpose of this Phase II SBIR is to design a software product that transparently integrates SINDA/G into the MSC.Patran FEA modeling system.  This product is oriented towards both the beginning thermal analyst and the advanced SINDA user.  The transparent integration allows a new user to use advanced features involving convection, surface-to-surface radiation, heaters, and other advanced thermal features without knowing the format of SINDA/G or thermal radiation codes.  Experienced SINDA users will not be limited by the simple boundary conditions typically associated with FEA thermal codes, but will have the full power of SINDA/G.   Because of the popularity of MSC.Patran in the aerospace world for building MSC.Nastran structural models, this graphical modeling environment is ideal for producing SINDA/G thermal models in order to enhance the concurrent engineering processes of aerospace hardware design.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Because of the widespread use of Patran at NASA centers and the popularity of SINDA as a thermal design tool a combined product should be well received.  
<br>Some potential applications at NASA centers are as follows.
<br>?	Modeling turbo machinery associated with rocket motors
<br>?	Ablation of rocket nozzles and components
<br>?	Modeling of a solid rocket motor and it?s casing
<br>?	Modeling of reentry ablation and non ablative tiles
<br>?	Spacecraft thermal design using traditional radiation and orbital heating codes
<br>?	Thermal modeling of electronic components, PC boards and entire electronic systems including those with thermoelectric cooler?s (TED?s)
<br>?	Coupling GFSSP fluid code to graphically build thermal models
<br>?	Utilizing CAD geometry from common CAD systems in thermal models at both the part and assembly level.
<br> 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are 1000?s of thermal engineers who have access to Patran and use more entry level products such as Nastran for thermal design.  By making this product fully compatible with NASTRAN thermal, these engineers can transition to a SINDA based product that has more capabilities without significant training or downtime.  Not only does the SINDA/G solver have more capabilities, but it is extensible via programming logic or subroutines allowing the end user to add custom features and reports.
<br>In addition to the above potential applications, the following applications are encountered by non-NASA customers.
<br>?	Industrial furnaces
<br>?	Manufacturing processes such as heated injection molds
<br>?	Commercial aircraft
<br>?	Avionics
<br>?	Nuclear reactor cooling
<br>?	Nuclear waste disposal
<br>?	Food processing equipment
<br>?	Automotive applications, including exhaust systems, radiators and engine components
<br>?	Air Conditioning equipment
<br>?	Military missiles and munitions
<br>?	Thermal design of consumer electronics such as copy machines and laptop computers with integrated heat pipes

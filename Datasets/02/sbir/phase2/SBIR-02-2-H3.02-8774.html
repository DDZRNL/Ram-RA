<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 For the future spaceport and storage of liquid hydrogen NASA requires cryocoolers that can provide more than 10W of cooling at 20K. The closed-cycle cooling alternatives currently available for such applications are not well suited to their requirements. In many cases reliability is low and vibration high. In other cases coolers are too massive and inefficient. This proposal describes a two-stage pulse tube cooler (PTC) that combines a bootstrap staging configuration with an innovative second-stage regenerator design and a unique load-interface. The proposed cooler contains three innovative concepts that together will overcome the limitations of current cryocooler technologies: (1) the matrix for the second stage regenerator will be made from a newly-patented material having a heat capacity in excess of all other known materials, including lead (Pb), over a wide range of low temperatures (85K down to 15K), (2) the material for the second-stage regenerator will be formed into a novel matrix geometry, and (3) a unique load-interface will be an integral part of the cooler giving it the capability to cool distributed loads efficiently. The proposed pulse tube will be lightweight, efficient, reliable, vibration free, and easy to integrate into cryogenic dewars.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
  Missions to Mars that involve the in-situ manufacture of propellant which will require the capability to store seed hydrogen for long periods of time. To accomplish this, a small lightweight cryocooler mounted on the storage vessel that is capable of sub-cooling the liquid, intercepting parasitic heat leaks, and re-liquefying hydrogen vapor will be required. The proposed two-stage pulse-tube cooler is ideally suited to such applications. For missions that will involve transportation or in-situ liquefaction of liquid cryogens such as hydrogen, neon, and oxygen, the proposed two-stage pulse-tube cooler is again ideally suited. The presence of two stages allows cooling at two temperatures. The proposed cooler is easily modified to liquefy both hydrogen and neon at the low temperaturestage, and oxygen, for example, at the higher temperature stage. To improve the ultimate signal to noise ratio obtainable from cryogenic IR focal plane arrays (FPA), it is desirable to have on-focal plane, high-resolution, analog-to-digital (A/D) data converters. Such A/D converters, based on the Josephson effect, together with supporting technology, are currently in various stages of development. The proposed two-stage pulse-tube cooler is ideally suited to these applications as well.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
 There are a number of commercial applications. A partial list includes: ?Superconducting electronics ?Superconducting magnets for MRI systems ?Superconducting magnets for power generation and energy storage ?SQUID magnetometers for heart and brain studies ?HTS filters for the communication industry ?Liquefaction of industrial gases ?Cryopumps for semiconductor manufacturing ?Radio astronomy As an example, a market of about $100 million/year currently exists for G-M cooler-based cryopumps for sputtering systems used in the semiconductor industry. Sputtering systems normally have several cryopumps per unit with each cryopump costing $20-25,000. The more reliable PTC package will cost about the same as current G-M units and will be less expensive to maintain due to the lack of oil and rubbing surfaces.

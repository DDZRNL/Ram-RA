<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II program addresses the development of a Proton Exchange Membrane Unitized Regenerative Fuel Cell (PEM URFC) stack and system for energy storage. The concepts of reduced cell stack weight, developed in Phase I, will be applied to the concept of static water feed/removal being developed by Proton Energy Systems in another program. The Phase II will result in a working 0.5-1 kW brassboard prototype unitized regenerative fuel cell system with significantly reduced weight of the major system components.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Non-conventional technologies are needed to revolutionize space propulsion. Development of materials with improved properties is essential to increase performance and reduce cost. Advancements are needed for components in solid and hybrid rocket, high powered electrical, beamed energy, and nuclear propulsion systems. Innovative processes for fabricating net shape, tungsten-rhenium-hafnium carbide alloy components are proposed. Tungsten is being used for its high melting temperature (6170?F) and chemical stability. However, conventional tungsten materials have to be forged to get adequate properties. Forging tungsten into complex shapes is difficult and has limited its application. Small additions of rhenium improve the ductility of tungsten without significantly decreasing the melting point. Also, dispersion hardening by additions of HfC increases the high temperature strength and creep resistance by pinning grain boundaries. In Phase I, W-Re-HfC materials and processing parameters were developed, and W-Re-HfC samples were fabricated for characterization and hoop tensile testing. In hoop tensile tests, Phase I W-Re-HfC was stronger than baseline W-Re or W.  Solid rocket nozzle inserts were fabricated and are being hot fire tested at ATK-Thiokol to demonstrate non-eroding nozzles. Development of these materials will allow the production of components with unique properties and reduce the size, weight, and cost of propulsion systems.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The results of the Phase I effort clearly demonstrate the ability to fabricate improved tungsten alloy components. Development of these advanced materials will produce robust components with unique properties and reduce the size, weight, and cost. Potential clients for these components are NASA, DOD, ATK-Thiokol, and Aerojet. PPI will develop and transfer the SBIR technology to other applications such as: rocket nozzles, Ballistic and tactical missiles, gun barrel liners, Arc-jet thrusters, Heat exchangers, welding electrodes, plasma facing components for nuclear reactors, gas turbines, automobile engines, incinerators, thermal control coatings, oxidation protective coatings, coatings for composite parts and structures, thermal barrier coatings, structural jackets on tubular combustors and nozzles, crucibles, tubes, valves, and storage vessels.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commerical applications are solid and hybrid rocket nozzles, high powered electrical contacts, crucibles, heat pipes, fuel cells, components for solar thermal propulsion, valves, liquid rocket motors, nuclear power containment, furnace parts, armor penetrators, heat shields, electronics, incinerators, protective coatings and other high temperature applications.
<br>Over $300,000.00 of commercial investment has been obtained for Phase III development.

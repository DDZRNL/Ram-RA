<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The purpose of this program is to develop a compact and efficient ultraviolet laser system for ozone sensing from space.  The basis for this system will be a diode-pumped neodymium-yttria (Nd:Y2O3) laser which is frequency-tripled to generate uv light at either 305nm or 315nm.  The ability to generate both uv wavelengths from a single frequency-tripled Nd:Y2O3 laser makes this approach potentially 4x more efficient than other approaches.  In Phase I, diode-pumped operation of Nd:Y2O3 at 915nm and 947nm was demonstrated for the first time.  In Phase II, these preliminary results will be extended and combined with efficient harmonic frequency conversion to develop an efficient and compact ultraviolet laser system.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In addition to ozone monitoring applications, an efficient 947nm Nd:Y2O3 laser could be used for NASA water vapor Lidar programs.  A frequency-quadrupled laser at 237nm could be used for uv resonance Raman spectroscopy for NASA?s search for signs of life in our solar system. 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Frequency-doubled Nd:Y2O3 lasers in the 450-475nm range can be used for display applications and in bio-medical instruments such as cell sorters, flow cytometers, and DNA sequencers.  Frequency-tripled lasers in the 305-315nm range will be used for stereo-lithography and materials processing such as micro-machining.  Frequency-quadrupled lasers near 237nm can be used for detection of chemical and biological agents, remote detection of explosives, and semiconductor inspection.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In response to NASA?s need for miniature sensors to detect and measure electrostatic potential and charge distribution on payloads, spacecraft, and landers, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) in Phase I developed and demonstrated an innovative Differential Electrostatic Optical Sensor (DEOS) to overcome the current sensor problems of electrostatic shock and EMI vulnerability.  POC proved the feasibility of the DEOS concept, and demonstrated sensitivity to an induced charge of ~15 mV/nC, which not only meets but exceeds the NASA requirement.  This sensitivity to charge enables DEOS, to remotely measure voltage with a sensitivity of 40 V per mV of output signal at a distance of 4 in., exceeding the sensitivity of commercially available sensors by a factor of 2.5.  In Phase II, we will optimize the DEOS design and complete the development of DEOS, greatly advancing the accuracy and reliability of electrostatic charge and field measurements for many NASA applications. In the process, we will develop two key components: the photo-acoustic modulator (PAM), which will transform induced charge to alternating electric current; and the electro-optical converter (EOC) which will transform that electric current into an alternating optical signal.  Phase II will culminate in testing, demonstration and delivery of a prototype.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The successful Phase II DEOS project will produce a device that will find a number of applications in NASA facilities and NASA missions.  It will be used in NASA spacecraft assembly and testing facilities, and during fueling to prevent electrostatic discharge.  It will continuously measure electrostatic potential during spacecraft docking and during planetary exploration.  It will be used in electromagnetic physics measurements in the Human Exploration and Development of Space (HEDS) Enterprise, and will contribute to the JPL New Millennium Program, notably ?Geospace Electrodynamic Connections (GEC).?

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The DEOS sensor will be useful for preventing electrostatic discharge in the semiconductor industry, in the printing industries and in chemical plants.  DEOS can also be used for mapping electrostatic fields and for measuring ionization and triboelectric charges in the transportation and power industries.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In Phase I of this SBIR project, DMI demonstrated the feasibility of fabricating a new class of lightweight, heat-resistant Diamonite(TM)-bonded C/C composites for thermal protection of re-entry vehicles. DMI?s nano-carbon structure is produced by pressure-assisted polymerization of mixed fullerenes/nanotubes to create a new high specific strength carbon material called Diamonite-B(TM), which has mechanical properties closer to diamond than to graphite, but thermal stability closer to graphite; thus combining the advantages of graphite and diamond. Two methods for making Diamonite?-B bonded C/C composites were demonstrated. In Phase I, DMI focused on proof-of-principle development of the C/C composite, conducted experiments to confirm properties, viability of the material, fabrication techniques, and the hot pressing equipment. In Phase II, we propose to develop, in collaboration with established end-user companies, the technology for large-scale manufacture of Diamonite-B bonded C/C composite parts for thermal protection and the design of equipment necessary for full scale manufacturing. The deliverables of the Phase II project are samples of the created lightweight, heat-resistant Diamonite&#61652;-B bonded C/C composite thermal protection materials; methods of making C/C composite parts for thermal protection of re-entry vehicles, which should improve the reliability of the system, and the design of equipment for full-scale manufacturing of parts at NASA and commercial request. In Phase III, we will work with large companies to build experimental pilot production facilities for the thermal protection of spacecraft by Diamonite-B-enhanced carbon composites.

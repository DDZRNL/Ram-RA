<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Second-order Augmentation of Lattice Trusses (SALT) is a unique configuration that promises to alleviate many constraints on the design of large deployable space structures, enabling more mass and packaging-efficient structures due to the effect of multi-tiered (higher-order structural hierarchy) latticing.  In the Phase I SBIR study, ABLE Engineering performed analyses, design studies and testing to successfully demonstrate concept feasibility of the SALT system.  The primary technical objective of the proposed Phase II program is to focus on hardware development and system implementation with the design, manufacture and build of a working multiple-bay Engineering Model (EM) of a CoilABLE boom that incorporates the SALT technology.  Additionally, system-level analytical models will be developed that leverage off of the validated component-level models generated in Phase 1.  These models will be used concurrently during the boom design process to allow system optimization, and will also be used to correlate the prototype performance testing.  The EM hardware development and the validated analytic models of its behavior will effectively demonstrate system-level function and stiffness/strength performance, increasing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) to 5.  The successful completion of the proposed Phase II program will ready the SALT CoilABLE system for use on advanced missions.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed SALT technology is envisioned to have broad applicability for any space mission requiring the capability to deploy stiff, stable and extremely mass and volume efficient structures.  The unique configuration of SALT promises to alleviate many constraints on the design of large deployable space structures, increasing the range of application and degree of optimization possible, allowing more mass and packaging-efficient structures to be used for many commercial and NASA missions.  The ability to rapidly configure large, single-mission structures capable of being launched from a single vehicle will have commercialization opportunities for a wide variety of future communication and imaging spacecraft.  The SALT technology is directly applicable to large sensor array structural platforms, such as the large deployable SAR applications currently being planned by NASA.  Potential applications include: large SAR structures and antennas for imaging for weather, land mapping, ecology, natural resource management and other scientific endeavors.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The potential non-NASA commercial and military applications resulting from the proposed SALT hardware development effort span a broad range of large space deployable structure applications.  SALT has applicability for any space mission requiring the capability to deploy stiff, stable and extremely mass and volume efficient structures.  In particular, the high-resolution SAR imaging data enabled by the application of this technology can be used commercially for city planning, irrigation, mineral exploration and transportation; and for military surveillance and planning.

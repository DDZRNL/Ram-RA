<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Within Phase 2, Williams-Pyro has designed, developed, and demonstrated a system for locating arc faults along aircraft cable.  This fault localization is performed using signal reflectometry, in which an electrical waveform is transmitted through a length of wire.  After the reflection is received, the characteristics of the reflected signal will be used to determine how far away the arc fault is located.  After miniaturizing this system, it will be possible to integrate this functionality within a Texas Instruments' arc fault circuit breaker.  In this manner, TI's AFCB's will be able to tell maintenance personnel where to look in order to perform repairs on the aircraft cable 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This system will be able to reduce the maintenance time and effort involved in repairing faulty electrical cable on NASA aircraft.  After an arc fault has occurred, the Smart Wiring Infrastructure Fault Tester (SWIFT) will activate, using signal reflectometry to determine where the arc fault is located.  Then, the SWIFT-enabled arc fault circuit breaker (AFCB) will be able to display the fault's location to the maintainer, saving hours of hunting for the damage within the wire.  Texas Instruments has agreed that, given effective operation of the SWIFT functionality, they will be willing to consider integrating a SWIFT application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) within their Klixon family of aircraft circuit breakers

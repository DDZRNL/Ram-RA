<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Currently, no method exists for continuously, noninvasively monitoring flow in the vascular and other biofluidic systems. The proposed effort will ultimately develop a stent-based, telemetric, implantable flow monitor.  Once implanted, flow data may be read noninvasively through magnetic telemetry, using a compact readout unit.  This system will take advantage of state-of-the-art Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) technology to develop a highly stable device for real-time, noninvasive collection of flow data.  The core technology will be based on a high-sensitivity capacitive MEMS pressure sensor developed by ISSYS.  The system will be fully spaceworthy, itself being immune to the effects of both microgravity and hypergravity as well as shock and vibration. Phase I for this project demonstrated the feasibility of calculating relative flow rates from measured pressure gradients and provided the framework for obtaining absolute flow. Phase II effort would develop the complete implantable monitor and the associated readout unit capable of measuring both  relative and absolute flow rates.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Los Gatos Research proposes to develop a new Bragg grating-based acoustic emission (AE) sensor technology consisting of optical fibers, integrated optical waveguides, and an on-chip optical demodulation device system. Compared with conventional optical fiber based sensor systems, our technology offers substantially higher sensitivity.  We achieve this by combining the mature Bragg grating technology with the inherently high sensitivity of polymer waveguides to stress waves.  Using a hybrid silica/polymer Bragg grating multiplexing scheme, the sensor system is capable of simultaneously measuring temperature and strain/stress.  By integrating optical waveguide filters and couplers with the Bragg grating array sensor, the sensor system offers increased dynamic range for simultaneous detection of both the high and low energy AE signals arisen during impact or crack formation.  The Phase I research has demonstrated the feasibility of the integrated polymer waveguide and Bragg grating fabrication technology and the use of Bragg gratings for static and dynamic stress sensing.  In the Phase II research effort, the polymer waveguide and Bragg grating designs will be further optimized.  Hybrid polymer/silica Bragg grating array and an on-chip wavelength filter demodulation prototype system will be developed for temperature, stress/strain, and AE detection and location measurements.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In typical aerospace environments, both weak and strong AE signals are present. Crack formation and low-energy impact such as bird strike and tool-drop during maintenance typically generate weak AE signals.  High energy impact such as on-orbit collisions with micrometeoroids, ice, and space debris, often result in very large AE signals.  Both of these AE sources can lead to serious structural damages of aerospace structures.  Therefore, detecting and locating both high and low energy AE signal sources is essential for aerospace applications. The on-chip Bragg grating array sensor device LGR has demonstrated and proposed to further develop for Phase II will greatly enhance NASA efforts to develop state-of-the-art, compact, waveform-based, quantitative AE sensing technology for crack monitoring and impact detection facilitated by measuring and locating both high and low energy stress waves, from DC to MHz frequency range.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Advances in high-resolution, high sensitivity, and large dynamic range AE sensing technology has immediate applications in civil engineering for monitoring weak AE signals in steel and concrete structures such as bridges, freeways, and buildings.  High frequency ultrasonic signal detection  method development can be utilized in ultrasonic testing, medical ultrasonic imaging, and other non-destructive testing (NDT) technology. LGR?s integrated optical polymer waveguide and Bragg grating technology development can be readily incorporated into current fiber optics and optical cross-connect technology for next-generation telecommunication applications.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to design and fabricate advanced SiC power switch aimed at up to several kilowatt power system applications. The power switch is expected to lead to (i) substantially reduced volume and weight of space power systems, (ii) greatly expanded operating temperature range, and (iii) drastically improved power efficiency and enhanced radiation tolerance. Based on the success of Phase I program, we plan to push the SiC power switches to higher voltages and substantially increase the total current capability. We plan to optimize the power switch structures in three categories. We plan to fully develop the fabrication processes and apply the processes to fabricate the optimized power switches. DC and high-speed transient characteristics will be systematically studied over a wide temperature range. Concentration will be focused on achieving operations with highest possible power density, efficiency, and speed over a wide temperature range. We plan to quantify the ranges of operating temperature and frequency, and power.  We also plan to demonstrate system applications of the SiC power switches up to 5 kW. Privately funded Phase III will be concentrating on solving any remaining issues identified in Phase II so that prototype devices can be commercialized within one year after the completion of Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are numerous applications for the advanced power switch including the mass market of switch-mode power supplies (SMPSs), power factor correctors (PFCs), power converters, and motor controllers. The power switch is ideal for all the medium power level systems where volume, mass, minimum passive cooling, high frequency (smaller capacitor/ inductor) with dramatically improved power efficiency are important for order-of-magnitude improvements in system level performance. It also has important applications for deep oil drilling due to its high temperature capability. At higher frequencies, the device would find additional industrial and commercial applications in semiconductor IC fabrication instruments, RF heating, wireless communication base stations, TV station transmitters and satellite links.

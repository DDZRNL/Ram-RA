<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The objective of the proposed Phase II effort is to transfer proven sensor technology from the laboratory breadboard to a functional flight-ready prototype for installation in an aircraft fuel tank. In the Phase I effort, a novel spectroscopic technique was shown to be an effective method for measuring oxygen concentration in harsh environments with sufficient accuracy for use in an OBIGGS system. This system utilizes rapidly scanned Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Diode Lasers (VCSELs) to measure oxygen concentration by molecular absorption. This system can measure 1000 ppm to 100% oxygen in ambient temperatures from -60 to 150 F utilizing as the wavelength agile spectral-harmonic (WASH) technique. The wavelength agile aspect of the laser source/detection technique allows for temperature insensitive measurements of oxygen concentration over a wide range of pressures (0.3 atm to 2 atm) with high accuracy as well as with auto-calibration capabilities. The Phase II effort is focused on packaging this sensor technology in a form that is able to be inserted into an operational aircraft fuel tank and conform to a set of environmental and operational requirements as defined by both the OBIGGS needs as well as the fuel tank environment. Furthermore, achievement of the Phase II goal requires the miniaturization of the laser driver, data collection, and data processing functions into flight-scale electronic hardware.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are many commercial and military applications for an accurate and rugged fuel tank oxygen concentration sensor. The fuel tank oxygen sensor could be used in both new and retrofit commercial aircraft as a control sensor for fuel tank protection systems. The reliable and precise instrument can be used to control onboard inert gas generation systems (OBIGGS) for cargo compartment fire suppression, fuel tank inerting, and emergency breathing oxygen systems (OBOGS) for passengers and crew. The key to the commercial viability of this product is the accuracy of the sensor, its ability to handle harsh environments including highly variable temperatures and pressures, and its reliability and lifetime, which we have engineered into the system. The long operating lifetime and stability of this measurement system in challenging operating environments are superior to existing oxygen measurement strategies.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This type of sensor can also be used to monitor the air/fuel ratio in terrestrial gas turbine and high pressure combustion systems where a rugged sensor with long operating life characteristics is needed. Also possible using this sensor is a real-time measurement of oxygen tension in respiratory gases and respiration monitoring. The absorption based technique has no biofouling effects and is nearly independent of scattering environments such as heavy droplet sprays or moisture making the sensor useful in biological measurements.

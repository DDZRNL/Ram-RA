<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Space transportation and other vehicles entering the earth?s atmosphere at hypersonic speeds undergo aerodynamic heating which necessitates thermal protection systems (TPS) on exterior surfaces.  Future reusable launch vehicles (RLVs) will require TPS durable over several missions with rapid turnaround between each flight.  Advanced metallic TPS are under development that utilize a honeycomb structure with thin face sheets (typically 7-10 mils) that are coated to provide high emissivity, oxidation protection, and low catalytic efficiency.  Currently-available TPS coatings are not adequate and do not have the durability required for use with RLVs.  Thus, a new coating system with suitable and environmentally-friendly formulations are required that meet the basic property requirements and also have the ability to withstand the harsh acoustic and aerodynamic thermal environments during reentry over several missions.  Phase I results demonstrated technical feasibility of an innovative approach utilizing a nanocomposite material (Cerablak) that contain carbon as nanosized inclusions to provide emissivity.  The coatings are deposited using low-cost, simple, easy-to-apply, and stable formulations.  High emissivity properties after heat treatment and excellent protection against oxidation protection were demonstrated.  Phase II effort will include further optimization of precursor formulations and coating properties with the primary objective to meet the durability requirements.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Direct use of the proposed technology will be with metallic TPS which are being developed by several companies for both NASA and DoD. ATFI intends to commercialize the technology through strategic partnerships with these companies.  Black pigmented high emissivity paints are currently used on various parts of NASA?s space shuttle fleet.  The proposed coating product offers many advantages including low-cost, durable high emissivity, ease of applicability, relatively thin, and oxidation protection.  The proposed formulations contain no VOCs, have extended shelf stability (years), and require short curing times.  The coating can be applied using brush/spray/flow/dip coating methods.  With these attributes and relative low-cost, the proposed technology has excellent potential for insertion.  Excellent oxidation protection has been demonstrated with thin hermetic glassy films (200-500nm) with excellent adhesion properties on alloys that will be useful for turbomachinery components, seals, and other components exposed to high temperatures during service.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
High emissivity coatings are being widely used to limit heat transfer in furnaces, boilers, ducts, and other components and to improve thermal efficiency and performance of IR radiant burners used in the energy industry.  The proposed product will help improve performance and will be durable that will result in lower maintenance costs and downtimes for production.  In addition, oxidation protection will also be beneficial in both protecting the components as well as to prevent cracking and spallation of the high emissivity coating.  Due to the large volumes of formulations used, environmental concerns are more relevant for these commercial applications.  Hence the zero VOC and environmentally-friendly formulation offered by the proposed technology will serve as a distinct advantage over currently-used products.  The ease and flexibility of application of the coating and short curing times will be especially beneficial as minimal training or skills will be required to perform the function.

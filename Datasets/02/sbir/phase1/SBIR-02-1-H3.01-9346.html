<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposed work will develop a new pump design, which is based on a uniquely generated orbital motion.  The pump is intrinsically sealed and mechanically balanced, resulting in quiet, safe operation.  The pump design has no seals, valves, bearings, complex mechanical linkages, or drive motor.  Its simplicity promises to provide a pump, which is compact and reliable, has low mass, and possesses quiet, safe operation, ideal for long-term, space-based, microgravity applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A large market for this design applies to pumping liquid chemicals in the chemical industry.  Key features for this application are its monolithic structure and hermetic seal.  These features would result in increased safety and reliability for handling toxic or otherwise hazardous fluids.  A related market is a compressor for industrial gases.  Again, the safety and reliability features are expected to give it advantages over other designs.  An interesting consumer product application is a portable air compressor for use with pneumatic tools.  This product would be marketed for construction work as well as home use.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The unique features of this pump design make it potentially useful for a variety of applications for NASA.  These include liquid pumping for liquid transfer operations in microgravity environments.  Pumping cryogenic liquids is among these applications.  Other space-based applications include gas compression and pumping for gas transfer and storage operations.  Gas compression for space-based refrigeration, heat pump, and cryogenic cycles also may be of great value to NASA.

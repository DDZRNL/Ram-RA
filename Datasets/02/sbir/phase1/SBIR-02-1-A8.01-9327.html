<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Phoenix Integration proposes a Phase I SBIR project to commercialize the BLISS methodology within the popular integration and optimization framework, ModelCenter?. This work will be significant, because a powerful and flexible algorithm will be provided to industry in a user-friendly and open integration environment. The research and modifications required to ModelCenter will revolutionize the way industry approaches optimization because of the benefits of parallel subsystem design optimization coupled with flexible, distributed code integration.
<br>Further, the research will advance the field of engineering design by introducing commercially-available methods for hierarchical decomposition and optimization, making more complex analysis easier. The significance to industry is that more complex problems can be solver faster and easier by applying the BLISS approach to multidisciplinary problems. 
<br>The return on investment for companies will be substantial because hierarchical decomposition and optimization makes it possible to run subsystems in parallel. The benefits is better utilization of hardware cycles.
<br>Overall, integration of the BLISS approach into Phoenix Integration?s tools will result in:
<br>? Better integration of multiple disciplines for complex industry problems
<br>? Easy to use interface allows end users to create BLISS optimization problems
<br>? Better hardware utilization due to increased parallel computing

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The short-term benefit to the manufacturing industry is the reduction of the cost of ownership and the ability to deploy collaborative design tools across the enterprise. This new breed of tool will be offered with low maintenance and streamlined deployment so large organizations can be productive quickly. 
<br>Long-term benefits are the reduced cost of goods and services provided by the large manufacturers using the collaborative environment. Engineering risk will be reduced as multi-site, multi-vendor teams will be able to share design information more effectively and make better-informed decisions. 
<br>US airframers are hungry for ways to make engineering more economical as they  continue to compete with international manufacturers. Engineering costs will be reduced as cycle times are shortened. The effect of reducing engineering costs will be increased competitiveness such as the ability to offer more aggressive delivery schedules.
<br>Phoenix will work with Boeing and NASA on the Phase II portion of the proposed work to develop innovative optimization techniques to improve the efficiency Boeing?s products. It is expected that by applying BLISS within ModelCenter for Boeing that significant performance enhancements could be realized along with fuel and range efficiency for Boeing?s platforms. This will make Boeing and the entire US aerospace market for commercial transports more competitive.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Phoenix Integration software is currently being used as the Advanced Engineering Environment (AEE) developed for the Space Launch Initiative (SLI ). ModelCenter is the defacto standard for performing multidisciplinary trade studies and optimization. 
<br>The proposed research will benefit NASA because the BLISS approach will be beneficial the the dozens of engineers currently using ModelCenter for preliminary design. It is expected that with the next cycle of analysis for SLI, that more complex analysis tools will be introduced.  
<br>This provides an excellent opportunity for NASA to benefit from the proposed research because more engineers will be needing tools and methods support for complex analysis. BLISS as integrated with the ModelCenter interface will provide engineers the ability to easily formulate complex problems and then execute on an optimized computing grid taking advantage of parallel subsystems.

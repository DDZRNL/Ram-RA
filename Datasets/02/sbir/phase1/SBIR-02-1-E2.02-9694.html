<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
SSCI, in collaboration with Swales Aerospace, proposes to develop
<br>an Intelligent Fault-Tolerant (IFT) control system to enhance the
<br>performance  of  spacecraft  Attitude Determination  and  Control
<br>Subsystems (ADCS) in the presence of environmental torque  disturbances, sensor  noise variation,  parametric and/or
<br>structural uncertainties, and  low control control authority, and
<br>will be  capable of automatically compensating for a loss  of
<br>sensors,  actuators, or  a  combination of  both through  on-line
<br>failure    detection/identification,    and   adaptive    control
<br>reconfiguration. In particular, during the Phase I effort we plan
<br>to demonstrate the capability of the proposed IFT-ADCS subject to
<br>two degraded  operating conditions that  are commonly encountered in  satellite missions:  (1) Partial  or total  loss  of on-board
<br>gyros, and (2)  Partial or total loss of  Reaction Wheel Assembly
<br>(RWA)  actuators. In  the former  case, we  propose to  develop a
<br>scheme  based on  a well  established Interacting  Multiple Model
<br>(IMM) estimator for improved  rate estimation accuracy and smooth
<br>and  robust  operation  subject   to  rate  swapping  (from  gyro
<br>measurement to gyroless rate  estimator) or high rate slewing. In
<br>the  case  of  RWA  failures,  Magnetic Torquer  Bars  (MTB),  or
<br>Thrusters,  or  a  combination   of  both  will  be  employed  to
<br>accommodate   for    the   failure.    The    proposed   adaptive
<br>reconfigurable  control  system   will  result  in  substantially
<br>increased spacecraft on-board autonomy that will have a potential
<br>to  rescue  the  entire  mission  at  its  early  stages  despite
<br>unexpected failures of critical components such as gyros, RWA, or
<br>star tracker.    Swales Aerospace will provide technical
<br>and commercialization support during all phases of the project.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Higher  controller   autonomy  is  one  of   the  major  enabling
<br>technologies  in  the  rapidly-growing  commercial  and  military
<br>satellite markets  and will result in  substantial cost reduction
<br>due  to:  (i)  Reduced   human  intervention  for  operation  and
<br>maintenance;  (ii) Increased  reliability  and mission  lifetime;
<br>(iii)  Decreased up-link  and  down-link bandwidth  requirements;
<br>(iv) Reduced testing and  implementation costs; and (v) Decreased
<br>software and hardware  complexity.  Hence the proposed autonomous intelligent   fault-tolerant  controller   design  has   a  great
<br>commercial  potential in both  civilian and  defense applications
<br>including  commercial and  military satellites,  and can  also be
<br>applied to  aircraft, autonomous underwater  and ground vehicles,
<br>"smart"   missiles,   ships,    robots,   process   control   and
<br>manufacturing systems.
<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The end  result of the  proposed work will  be the
<br>development of  a reusable flight  code that captures  the entire
<br>IFT-ADCS  architecture. Either in  its entirety  or in  part, the
<br>individual subsystem of  the proposed IFT ADCS can  be applied to
<br>both  current and  future  missions. An  important  part of  this
<br>effort will be the  design, development, and commercialization of
<br>a software  design toolkit for  the design and  implementation of
<br>IFT-ADCS for spacecraft.

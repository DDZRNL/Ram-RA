<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is the primary tool of 
<br>aerodynamic design, and the ability to reduce and quantify
<br>uncertainties in CFD results is essential.  Efforts throughout the
<br>CFD community are aimed at improving the accuracy of CFD methods.  
<br>The proposed work will develop computational algorithms and software
<br>that yield comprehensive estimates of uncertainty in CFD results.  
<br>The methods involve error modeling, in which specific sources of
<br>error, such as truncation error, and error in the transition and
<br>turbulence modeling, are related to the errors and uncertainty 
<br>in the solution via solutions of an error equation.  These methods
<br>will be relatively comprehensive, accounting for the dominant sources
<br>of uncertainty in typical CFD analyses, and yielding the 
<br>uncertainties in all data predicted by the CFD solution.  For example, the uncertainty in distributed aerodynamic heating can be computed. 
<br>The techniques to be used in the work have been demonstrated in predictions of uncertainty due to truncation error in structured-grid
<br>CFD data.  The proposed work will extend these methods to
<br>unstructured-grid CFD and to transition and turbulence modeling 
<br>errors.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed technology will have commercial benefit wherever CFD is
<br>used to assess aerodynamic performance in critical applications.  
<br>This includes the design and analysis of all commercial, NASA, and
<br>military aerospace vehicles.  The technology developed will be 
<br>represented as a set of software modules that can be used with existing and new CFD solvers.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed technology will yield an improved ability to design 
<br>and optimize aerospace vehicles, including conventional flight
<br>vehicles and launch vehicles.  This will benefit NASA s core 
<br>missions.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This is a proposal to build an innovative procedure tracking and
<br>assistance system for application to space station.  Space station
<br>crew members are currently hindered by a lack of integration between
<br>procedures and telemetry.  We propose a software system that will
<br>probabilistically track the execution of a procedure using telemetry.
<br>In addition to tracking, the software will also assist in executing
<br>the procedure by prompting for missing steps or handling routine
<br>verification.  At the core of the software system is a probabilistic
<br>reasoning technique that can track multiple possible outcomes
<br>simultaneously.  We also propose a crew proxy that will mediate the
<br>flow of information between the procedure tracking and assistance
<br>software and the crew member.  A crew interface will be developed for
<br>a hand-held computer.  This will free crew members from their control
<br>stations and allow for procedure assistance at any place in the space
<br>station.  In developing this system, Metrica will be working with
<br>consultant Reid Simmons of Carnegie Mellon University.  Metrica's
<br>previous experience in procedure tracking and assistance and crew
<br>interface design combined with Dr. Simmons' experience with the Task
<br>Description Language and probabilistic reasoning techniques creates an
<br>ideal team to complete this project successfully.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Increasingly complex electronic devices and software require equally
<br>complex procedures to operate them effectively.  Procedure tracking
<br>and assistance systems that can be deployed in a light-weight fashion
<br>and that can intelligently assist users in their nominal and
<br>off-nominal operations would be of enormous commercial significance.
<br>Embedded in a hand-held device (and downloadable from a WWW site)
<br>could be procedures for everything from fixing a car to setting up a
<br>home theater.  We will initially work with procedure oriented
<br>industries where there is telemetry feedback such as health care and
<br>machine diagnosis and maintenance.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA currently has no automated way to track or assist crew members as they execute procedures on space station or space shuttle.  Ground controllers and other crew members are used.  This is costly and not safe because of delays.  Also, crew members are currently limited to viewing procedures in PDF format at a workstation, even if where they execute procedures is remote from the workstation.  Tis project will give NASA the capability to track and assist in crew procedure executing, enhancing safety and reducing cost.

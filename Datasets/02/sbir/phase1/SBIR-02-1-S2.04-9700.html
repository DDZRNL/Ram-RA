<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This firm has, in ongoing work in collaboration with the Air Force, NASA and JPL, developed a unique Variable Emittance technology based on the electrochromism of unique Conducting Polymers. This  comprises thin (< 0.5 mm), flexible, lightweight (0.16 g/cm^2), variable area (0.5 cm^2 to 0.5 m^2), very low cost flat panels. Delta Emittance (DE) of 0.33 in space-qualified devices, and 0.53 in vacuum-durable unsealed devices, has been demonstrated. All space durability tests e.g. thermal vacuum, gamma-radiation and solar wind have been passed. A 90 cm2 panel and Controller are scheduled to fly on NASA?s ST5 microsatellite mission in 2004. A key technical barrier of this technology has however been the need to encapsulate and hermetically seal devices in CsI windows, due to a semi-solid electrolyte that does not function when completely desiccated. This causes the DE of > 0.53 in unsealed devices to fall to < 0.35 in sealed devices. The use of a just-discovered, truly solid, room temperature molten salt electrolyte compatible with our electrochromic system will permit the use of unsealed devices, allowing DE of 0.53. Intelligent design,  with embedded sensors reading Emittance directly, and coatings reducing Solar Absorptance to < 0.2, are also planned.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
With proven Delta Emittance > 0.5, this technology may displace mechanical louvers and loop heat pipes in the > 100 spacecraft/year the US alone launches, each with several m^2 of  thermal control area. Terrestrial military uses include IR camouflage countermeasures for the entire armed forces (air/land craft, soldiers), a multi-billion dollar market this firm is actively pursuing. Commercial uses include displays/billboards.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
With proven Delta Emittance > 0.5, this technology may displace mechanical louvers and loop heat pipes in the > 100 spacecraft/year the US alone launches, each with several m^2 of  thermal control area. This new Variable Emittance technology is thus applicable to all spacecraft launched by NASA, but especially micro- and nano- spacecraft where extant technologies may not work, and for niches like space-based radars.

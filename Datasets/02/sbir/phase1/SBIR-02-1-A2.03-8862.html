<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Lattice Block Materials (LBM) are innovative periodic cellular materials that derive their outstanding mechanical performance from a structure of highly ordered internal triangles, rather than the properties of the parent material.  To date, they have been successfully cast for many ferrous and non-ferrous metals, but not reactive metals such as titanium and gamma titanium aluminides.  As titanium is a critical aerospace material, and gamma is a key candidate for many future aerospace systems, TiTech International, Inc. proposes to use its unique casting production technology to manufacture prototype titanium-based LBM in this SBIR Phase I effort.  The goal is to produce titanium and g-TiAl LBM as near-net shape and affordably as possible, while meeting performance and properties requirements for future aerospace systems.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Essentially, any application and/or industry that need superior strength-to-density within relative affordability while retaining the physical properties of titanium and gamma alloys could use LBM structures.  Furthermore, those that require potential replacements for Ni-based superalloys at lower temperatures and for titanium alloys at higher temperatures could consider gamma alloys.  Potential commercial applications include aero engine components, automotive engine components, and aircraft and spacecraft structural applications.  Other possible uses of LBM include components for furniture, shipboard structures, building structures, automotive vehicle frames, and a potentially limitless number of other possibilities.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Titanium and gamma alloy LBM can be used as low weight structures for numerous applications for the engine and frame for next generation space launch and hypersonic vehicles.  For example, gamma LBM could be considered for engine tiles and sandwich structures for TPS.
<br>
<br>Other potential NASA applications include aircraft engine components such as casings and nozzle flaps for next generation aircraft gas turbines.

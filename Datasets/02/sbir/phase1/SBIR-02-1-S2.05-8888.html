<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Tinsley Laboratories, a subsidiary of SSG Inc., has developed a deterministic Computer Controlled Optical Surfacing (CCOS) process.  Over the last 25 years, this process has demonstrated the capability to produce state-of-the-art aspheric optics, including extensive work with bare Beryllium aspheric reflectors.  The objective of the work proposed here is to optimize and improve this process for bare Beryllium optics, with a goal of reducing the aspheric optical polishing time by > 2x.  Increased efficiency, and reduced costs, are key drivers as next generation astronomical and earth observing applications are being driven to larger and larger telescope apertures.  Beryllium optics are a key technology for these large aperture system designs, due to the material?s high specific stiffness and aggressively lightweighting capabilities.  The process optimization that we propose will make Beryllium optics more cost effective for these applications, in this way allowing system designs to benefit from the superior bulk material properties associated with the material.  In the Phase I work proposed the CCOS process optimization will be demonstrated by the polishing of a number of bare Beryllium witness samples.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The development of a time/cost effective process for producing bare Be optics has a number of commercial and military applications.   Cost and time savings will enable the introduction of Be optics into smaller aperture Military systems for space-based EO sensor missions and tactical Be scan mirrors.  Commercial applications include high speed scanning systems where Be superior specific stiffness and lightweighting capability make Be the material of choice.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The reduction on time/cost facilitated by the processing changes proposed here will be critical for a number of future space based applications.  The primary benefit will be to large aperture deployable telescope concepts such as NGST.  These missions require Beryllium (from a weight standpoint) but need to find cost/time effective ways to produce state-of-the-art Be optics.

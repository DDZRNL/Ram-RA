<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Application of ceramic matrix composites (CMC) reinforced with carbon fibers can potentially enhance the efficiency and performance, reduce the weight, improve the durability, and lower the cost of rocket engine combustion devices and turbomachinery components used in high temperature, high-stress environments. Meeting these objectives requires improvements in fiber-reinforced CMC materials and fabrication processes, particularly improved fiber/matrix interfaces, interface deposition processes, and oxidation protection. Although carbon fibers are most desirable as CMC reinforcements, their low oxidation resistance has prevented their use in high temperature oxidizing environments. In previous work, Ultramet developed a unique and innovative process, ultraviolet-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (UVCVD), which allows deposition of dense, strain-tolerant oxides at room temperature, thus avoiding heat-induced material degradation and providing excellent material performance, including enhanced oxidation protection. However, identifying a single phase that best performs the two key functions of the interface coating, oxidation protection and interface slip, simultaneously has thus far proven elusive. In this project, the UVCVD process will be developed specifically for deposition of multilayered interface coatings in which separate components will perform these two functions, resulting in optimum composite performance.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The composite materials to be developed in this project using innovative interfaces and novel UVCVD processing will have broad commercial applicability to a range of products, including fuel-rich turbomachinery components, aircraft engine components, recuperators, ducts, and other hot gas path components, process industry components requiring high temperature capability and corrosive environment resistance (e.g. hot gas and liquid handling equipment), furnace structures, and high temperature filter elements.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Ceramic matrix composite materials are projected to significantly increase safety and reduce costs simultaneously, while decreasing weight for space transportation propulsion. Innovative material and process technology advancements are required to enable long life, reliable, and environmentally durable materials. Specific areas of technology development that are of interest include low-cost, rapid, scalable, repeatable CMC fabrication process development for multiple space transportation propulsion applications.

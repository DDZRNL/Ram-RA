<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Technanogy Air and Space and Rockwell Scientific propose a novel approach to manufacturing a low density high-performance aluminum based metal matrix composite (MMC) by consolidating nano-aluminum powder.  Depending on the application, Technanogy?s nano-aluminum powder can be tailor made in terms of size and oxide shell thickness.  For the current project, powders having ceramic weight contents of 15, 25, 35, 45, 55 and 65 percent will be provided to Rockwell Scientific for consolidation.  During the consolidation process Rockwell will determine the ideal processing parameters for each ceramic concentration so that the process can be further developed to produce large quantities of bulk nanocrystalline Al/Al2O3 metal matrix composite material.  It is expected that the consolidated Al/Al2O3 composite will have nearly theoretical density and a submicron- sized distribution of ceramic and metallic grains, and that this ultra-fine microstructure will produce a high specific strength and specific stiffness at all temperatures and excellent compatibility in hydrogen environments.  The specific goal is to produce aluminum based MMCs with specific strength superior to 414MPa at 260?C.  Improvement in the high temperature properties of aluminum MMCs will allow their use in many applications where they have not been used previously in NASA or commercial applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Technanogy Air & Space and Rockwell Scientific are collaborating to produce Al/Al2O3 composite materials by combining Rockwell?s consolidation expertise with Technanogy?s nanoparticulate composite.  The projected improvements in high temperature strength and lower CTE would impact the following NASA applications: ducting and duct flanges for carrying warm gases, wave guides, struts for airplanes or satellite structures, airplane fins, and thermal management supports.

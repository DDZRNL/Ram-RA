<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Makel Engineering Incorporated (MEI) proposes to design, build and demonstrate a prototype unit to significantly improve water recovery for Advanced Life Support System (e.g. International Space Station, Moon and Mars long duration manned missions, etc.).  The current ISS Life Support System includes an adsorption based regenerative carbon dioxide removal system, and a water electrolysis system to produce oxygen.  The hydrogen from the water electrolysis is vented to space in the life support system such as that which has been developed for Node 3.  Carbon dioxide removed from the environment and hydrogen produced as a byproduct of the water electrolysis will be the reactants for our proposed water recovery system.  Our proposed system will focus on two major areas of improvement: 1) the miniaturization of the system by use of microchannel reactor technology, and 2) the improvement of water recovery efficiency by the production of ethylene instead of methane.  The technology developed for this project can be easily adapted for other Life Support and ISRU applications.  In addition, for long term applications, the production of ethylene enables the production of other useful products, such as ethanol, nutrients, and polyethylene for habitat structures, which will increase the cost savings even more.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
	There are at least four markets which exist for our microchannel chemical reactor technology.
<br>1. Hydrocarbon Reformer for Fuel Cells
<br>2. Natural Gas Upgrading
<br>3. Processing Of Green House Gases
<br>4. Other Microchannel Reactor Applications
<br>These markets include the following customers:
<br>- Off-grid Data Systems
<br>- Homes Served by Rural Electric Cooperatives
<br>- Urban ?Load Pockets?
<br>- High-Income/High-Consumption Households Seeking Secure Backup Power
<br>- Dissatisfied Utility Customers
<br>- Premium Power Customers, UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) Systems
<br>- High-Cost Residential Power
<br>- New Homes
<br>- Grid-Challenged Customers
<br>- Developing Markets
<br>- Fuel Cell Vehicles
<br>- Gas to Liquid (GTL) Production
<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Affordable planning and execution of prolonged space missions depend upon the utilization of the waste products which are formed in manned spacecraft and surface bases. The technology developed for this project can be easily adapted to make maximum use of recycled materials, fully regenerative life support systems, and local indigenous materials. Processing of these materials can yield propellants, power generation (ethanol), life support consumables (nutrients), radiation protection, construction materials (polyethylene), and advanced habitation systems for other Life Support and ISRU applications. The technology is directly applicable to advanced regenerative life support systems by providing major savings in resupply. The NASA/government market is estimated to be $10M to $50M over the next ten years.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
MeltroniX Inc proposes to research and rapidly develop radiation hardened non volatile memory microelectronics, based on commercial ferroelectric technolgy. These FRAMs designed by Ramtron exhibit excellent radiation performance in the memory cell but are extrememly sensitive in the peripheral circuitry. We will apply hard-by-design techniques, with the support of Ramtron, to develop a rad hard version for space and military applications.In Phase II this design will be fabricated on one of Ramtron's licensees wafer fab. To address the high density needs, MeltroniX will design several MCM and stacked memory configurations using advanced packaging technology.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A Radiation hardened high density non-volatile memory device is a key component for any commercial system in a radiation environment. These applications include commercial space platforms, both GEO and LEO. Telecommuncation satellites and sensing applications (NOAA)require this memory to store critical data and support on board data processing. Terrestial applications are nuclear power plants and research accelerators (Fermi Lab). A potentially large market are commercial aircraft avionics which are becoming increasingly sensitive to single event effects as commercial IC feature sizes and voltages decrease.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Virtually all NASA space programs have a demand for dense, rad hard non-volatile memory. These applications range from shuttle, space station, earth sensing missions and deep space probes. The world's most common 1 megabit EEPROM just became obsolete, creating an immediate demand for radiation guaranteed non-volatile memory ICs.    Some of the NASA missons which will benefit are Mars Surveyor missions, solar system exploration e.g. (Titan, Europa landers,comet nucleus return), New Discovery Program, and Living with a Star.

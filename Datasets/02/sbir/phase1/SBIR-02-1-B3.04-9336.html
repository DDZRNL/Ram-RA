<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The innovation proposed through the SBIR is ?Fortification of Shelf Stable Formulated Foods with Antioxidants?.  The addition or incorporation of isolated antioxidants into a processed food does not insure delivery in an appropriate amount and form in the final product.  Multiple chemical reactions and physical changes initiated during processing and storage could deteriorate the functionality and/or bioactivity of these antioxidants in the foods. Experiments will be conducted in existent prototype food products developed previously for NASA?s food program. Selected antioxidants from the following categories:  Phenolic Compounds, Vitamins, and Carotenoids will be incorporated in the food products during the pre-preparation/mixing phase of production.  Products will be sealed and thermally processed to achieve commercial sterility.  All pre-processing and thermal processing parameters will be optimized to aid in retaining appropriate levels of residual antioxidants.  Food Samples will be analyzed for their antioxidant content and characterization by HPLC analysis. Antimutagenic tests will be conducted to define the bioactivity of the antioxidants.   The ultimate goal of this proposal is to apply the knowledge gained from the sample products to further develop a full commercial product line of antioxidant enriched Shelf Stable Foods.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Market data indicates that the Healthy Food Market represents a substantial segment in the commercial food industry.   Recent characterization of anti-inflammatory, anticancer and antioxidant activities of phytochemicals such as carotenoids, phenolic compounds and some vitamins demonstrate the potential for developing functional foods with well-established scientific proof of reported health claims.  Newtrition Foods has also identified funding sources to support marketing and commercial production of these foods during future Phases of this project.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Long Term exploration will require foods that remain palatable, nutritious, and safe to eat for a 3 ? 5 year period.  This concept is highly supportive to the NASA food program due to its directed dual benefit to aid in extending the shelf life of the formulated foods, and in aiding in the protection of astronaut?s health by counter balancing some of the effects of long term exposure to low dose radiation, which can cause free radical formation in biological tissue.  The formation of free radicals may compromise the quality and nutrition of the food supply during extended storage.

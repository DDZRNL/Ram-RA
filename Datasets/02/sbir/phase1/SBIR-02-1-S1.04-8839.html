<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
SiWave proposes to develop a novel Earth horizon sensor that is made possible by recently developed MEMS (micro electro mechanical systems) processing techniques.  SiWave?s MEMS devices enable a precise location of the Earth horizon with large angular range. A MEMS Earth horizon sensor, when compared with current state-of-the-art Earth horizon sensors provides for three orders-of-magnitude reductions in size, reduced power consumption, lower cost, and increased functionality and flexibility.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed horizon sensor has commercial applications in telecommunications, broadcasting, surveillance, Earth science satellites (such as weather), and high altitude aircraft and balloons. Markets for this technology include large satellite constellations, such as LEO One, Teledesic, ECCO, and E-Sat which alone total nearly 1000 sensors.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA applications include navigation for next generation nano/micro-spacecraft, Earth orbiting satellites, and planetary missions to Mars and other solar system planets. The reduction in size and mass will reduce the cost of the spacecraft as well as the launch costs. Perhaps more importantly, the proposed horizon sensor will enable new science missions for NASA not previously possible due to cost, size, or mass constraints.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The overall objective of this project is to develop a drag and drop, component library (fluidic lego) based, system simulation and optimization software for entire lab-on-chip systems.  Current approaches for biochip system design are either very inefficient (trial-and-error based) or time-consuming (high-fidelity simulation-based).  The proposed tool will benefit the biochip community by tremendously shortening design optimization times (minutes).
<br>
<br>Representation of complex, interacting physico-chemical processes of a biochip in a system design tool is a formidable challenge.  Our innovative solution seeks to use state-of-the-art high-fidelity simulations to develop and train Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based models for different components of a biochip.  The Phase I effort will focus on proof-of-concept by (a) Development of multiphysics simulation-based ANN models for typical components of a biochip; (b) Demonstration of capabilities of the developed ANN model through optimization of a micromixing biochip.  In Phase II, we will further develop and refine ANN models to account for additional multiphysics effects (electrokinetics, biochemistry, etc.) and dynamic response.  The final product will feature a comprehensive library of components along with a user-friendly graphical user interface.  CFDRC is the technology leader in multiphysics simulations for the biochip industry, and very well placed to successfully undertake this challenging task.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
CFDRC will also market the software to biotechnology companies.  CFDRC has an already established client base in biotechnology sector such as Aclara Biosciences (see enclosed support letter), Applied Biosystems, Caliper Technologies, Sequenom, etc.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Microfluidic technology is inherently advantageous for space applications due to the reduced size/weight, reduced power requirements as well as the ability to process multiple analyses in a standalone mode.  The ANN based system simulation and optimization software will serve as a powerful aid to NASA's own biochip development initiatives.  An example is the collaboration between NASA Marshall and Caliper Technologies to create macromolecular crystals aboard the
<br>International Space Station using Caliper's LabChip technology. The tool will also be an invaluable asset for NASA's efforts to create a customized microfluidic chip specially designed for use in the microgravity environment of space. The software also enables the transfer of CFDRC's extensive expertise in the biochip design field to NASA teams.

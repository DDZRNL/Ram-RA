<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In NASA?s SBIR solicitation S4.06, a pulsed fiber laser requires a weight of smaller than 1kg, high pulse repetition rate, <30 ns pulse width, 1-3 W output power at 1.5 micron region, and overall efficiency higher than 20%. PolarOnyx proposes a novel approach targeting to resolve the issues of pulse distortion and nonlinear effects such as stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), SPM, and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) by employing our proprietary technologies in specialty fibers and mode-locked fiber lasers. The high power conversion efficiency is achieved by optimization of the EDF. The overall fiber cavity is designed to compensate nonlinear effects and signal chirp caused by the modulation and obtain a quasi-transform limited pulse shape. In Phase I term, PolarOnyx will demonstrate the design in experiment.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
On the other hand, fiber lasers represent the next generation of critical optical components needed to build the local optical networks of the future and cable TVs that will deliver increased communication bandwidth and improved Quality of Service (QoS) to local access users. The market for the application is growing and will be of great potential. RHK reported the high power lasers will have a potential market of 800 millions dollars in 2006 as a result of applications of local optical networks and cable TVs. With successful development of the fiber lasers, the technology proposed by PolarOnyx will provide a vital tool to solve the existing and potential issues and merge with the huge market of optical fiber communications.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In addition to NASA?s application in optical communications, the proposed pulse shaping fiber laser can also be used in other applications such as space, aircraft, and satellite applications of LIDAR systems. The technology developed in PolarOnyx will ensure the pulse laser quality for both communications and LIDAR systems. PolarOnyx will develop a series of products to meet various requirements of NASA applications.

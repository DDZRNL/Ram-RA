<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Many biological systems depend on fluid flow and pressure to achieve their intended functions.  Tools are needed that allow noninvasive, real-time collection of pressure and flow-related data to study the impact of different environments and gravity ranges on biofluidic systems.  To meet this need, ISSYS proposes to develop an innovative implantable, biotelemetric, batteryless pressure monitoring system.  ISSYS will take advantage of state-of-the-art Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) technology to develop a highly stable device for real-time, noninvasive collection of fluid pressure data.  Once implanted, the device requires no additional maintenance or calibration.  This space-worthy system provides sensing technology that is miniature, requires minimal power, and is tolerant of vibration and acceleration.  It will facilitate our understanding of gravitational effects by supporting animal studies of fundamental biological processes in the cardiovascular, neurological, urological, and gastroenterological systems, in space and on the ground.  Phase I of this project will develop a prototype implantable sensor and demonstrate basic functionality using ISSYS' existing readout technology.  A subsequent Phase II effort would customize the implant for specific in vivo applications (per NASA specifications), develop implantation methods as appropriate, and refine the readout to add user-friendliness.  A complete system would then be validated in an animal model.

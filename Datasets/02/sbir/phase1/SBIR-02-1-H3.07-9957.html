<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to design and fabricate advanced SiC power switch aimed at up to several kilowatt power system applications. The power switch is expected to lead to (i) substantially reduced volume and weight of space power systems, (ii) greatly expanded operating temperature range, and (iii) drastically improved power efficiency and enhanced radiation tolerance. In Phase I, we propose to design, optimize, and compare different SiC power switch structures. DC and high-speed transient characteristics will be systematically studied over a wide temperature range. Concentration will be focused on achieving operations with highest possible power density, efficiency, and speed over a wide temperature range. We also propose to perform experimental work to develop all of the critical process technologies in Phase I. In Phase II, we shall apply the developed technology to fabricate the advanced 4H-SiC power switches up to 5 kW and use them to demonstrate the operation of a motor control system showing the true advantages of an all-SiC power converter.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are numerous applications for the advanced power switch including the mass market of switch-mode power supplies (SMPSs), power factor correctors (PFCs), power converters, and motor controllers. The power switch is ideal for all the medium power level systems where volume, mass, minimum passive cooling, high frequency (smaller capacitor/ inductor) with dramatically improved power efficiency are important for order-of-magnitude improvements in system level performance. It also has important applications for deep oil drilling due to its high temperature capability. At higher frequencies, the device would find additional industrial and commercial applications in semiconductor IC fabrication instruments, RF heating, wireless communication base stations, TV station transmitters and satellite links.

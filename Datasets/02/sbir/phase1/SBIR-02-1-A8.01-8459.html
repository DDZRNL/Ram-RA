<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
When a spacecraft enters a planetary atmosphere with a velocity of 6-8 km/s, gas temperatures behind the bow shock can reach 7,000 ? 20,000 K, and the hot gas is ionized: the electrical conductivity of several hundred mho/m or higher exists behind the shock. The conductive fluid can interact with electromagnetic fields. Specifically, with a magnet and a set of electrodes at or near the surface, a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power generation would be possible. The generated power, estimated to be on a multi-megawatt scale for the future Mars mission, can be useful during the mission. Additionally, asymmetric MHD configuration can provide   body forces for aerodynamic maneuvering and stabilization.
<br>
<br>A successful development of this technology must be based on a comprehensive and reliable set of theoretical and computational models. Although extensive CFD codes for planetary entry exist in NASA and academia, for the planetary-entry MHD application those codes and models must be improved and enhanced, especially with regard to ionization mechanism, ionization enhancement, MHD coupling with the flow, and low-density phenomena such as ion slip. We propose to develop models that would incorporate the relevant physics, and to predict potential performance of the planetary-entry MHD power generators and aerodynamic control devices.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
While the eventual goal of understanding MHD effects in re-entry environments would be applicable to an aerospace vehicle and redefine the possible mission profiles in future space endeavors, RSI will pursue more near-term commercialization efforts. There is a clearly identified need and opportunity to develop reliable models of planetary-entry MHD power generators and aerodynamic control devices, and to make predictions of their performance. The algorithms developed in this program will find application in design efforts in next-generation re-entry vehicles (without MHD effects), in new hypersonic vehicles involving MHD power generation or control, and in terrestrial MHD power generation.  Existing codes can cover the areas of MHD effects, hypersonic flow, and partially ionized flow, but they do not consider MHD effects coupled with aerothermochemically nonequilibrium flow and Hall and ion-slip effects.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The effort will create a foundation for a breakthrough technology to help future NASA Mars and other planetary missions, and will potentially create a new power technology for Earth satellites and Trans-Atmospheric Vehicles.  The tools developed in this program would be used to assess power generation performance of MHD system mounted on a Mars entry ballute, and to study force moments that can be created by an asymmetric placement of the MHD device.  The results will be applicable to new NASA aerospace vehicles, and will redefine the possible mission profiles in future space endeavors

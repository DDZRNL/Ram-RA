<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal addresses the special needs of NASA facilitating the use of space for commercial products and services. With regards to space communications antenna array systems are regularly installed with spacecrafts and satellites to transmit electromagnetic signals at high power. As such, circulators/isolators are needed to separate signal paths in T/R modules, providing protection over the receiver circuitries avoiding high-power incidence. When applied at high power, nonlinearity sets in at the ferrite junction area causing communication channels to couple with each other. This is called intermodulation which ultimately limits the usefulness of a ferrite junction to be applicable at excessive power levels. In the past we have analyzed this nonlinear problem and have identified the origin for intermodulation. We envision two techniques to be effective. The first technique is based on the DC consideration ensuring circulation action to occur without activating the adverse terms in the equations of motion responsible for intermodulation. The second technique is AC in nature, demanding the circulator operation to induce minimum excursion in the transverse component of the magnetization vector. Temperature compensated ferrites will be considered in Phase II, giving rise to stabilized operation of the circulator applied at high power.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Phase I research admits immediate and unique applications of power circulators/isolators to be applied for communications over distances, for example, a relay station in the continent, a ship in the ocean, an airline jet in the sky, a satellite outside the earth?s atmosphere, and a spacecraft in space. To ensure high-quality communication intermodulation interference has to be immune from a circulator/isolator junction, and to our knowledge there is no such device existent in the current market. The success of this proposed SBIR research will no doubt fulfill the need of the market, and hence its commercial potential is tremendous

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal addresses the NASA's needs in using space for commercial products and services. More specifically, this proposal addresses the NASA's goals in Space Commercialization Infrastructure for which high-quality communications are pursued to enhance commercial operation in space or commercial satellites. Antenna systems are regularly deployed with spacecrafts and satellites to allow communications with radio stations on earth. Circulators and isolators are thus needed in the T/R modules to protect the receiver circuits from high power incidence. Due to the large distances involved in space communications, the transmitters allocated in space or satellites are required to operate at high power. However, the performance of a ferrite device degrades as power increases, resulting in considerably amount of noise in communications. The proposed SBIR research is to improve circulator/isolator performance at high power, thereby enhancing the quality of communications in space or commercial satellites.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In travel, for those affected by it, motion sickness is a syndrome with adverse implications for performance and reduced quality of life. In addition to space motion sickness, simulator and Virtual Reality (cyber) sickness are modern forms of the malady that have become a great concern for those that use simulators for training and for the theme-park industry that uses like devices for entertainment.  Thus, being able to identify those who are susceptible to motion sickness and under which circumstances, and predicting the occurrence and severity of motion sickness episodes would be of great societal benefit. Using the extensive data collections and assessment tools developed by us, and combining them with modern, on-line, and real-time analysis software, a hand-held screening tool will be created for researchers, practitioners and industrial applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The NASA applications of the proposed Hand-held Computerized Prediction Tool and Data Base (HandyQuest) would be in the areas of training, screening and science/research.  This device will be designed to evaluate persons for susceptibility to motion and cybersickness, as well as evaluate for severity once symptoms emerge. This will be useful for research, as well as safety and human use applications.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The commercial applications of the proposed Hand-held Computerized Prediction Tool and Data Base (HandyQuest) would be in the areas of training, entertainment, health care, and science.  Those involved in the study, prediction, prevention, and treatment of space/motion/simulator/VR sickness would be able to access a powerful tool that would combine a rich data set with modern, easy-to-use analytical applications. This will be useful for research and safety/human use applications as well.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The design of the panels of future reusable launch vehicles will represent a particularly challenging task as these structural components will be subjected to some thermal effects, potentially severe random acoustic excitations and will support a complex thermal protection system (TPS). The structural dynamic behavior of the combined system is expected to display a significant nonlinearity arising not only from the combination of the acoustic and thermal effects but also from the yielding character of the TPS. A methodology for the fast and accurate prediction of the fatigue life of such nonlinear structures, involving full finite element solutions, reduced order modeling, and random response and fatigue life prediction, is rapidly maturing. The focus of the present effort is then to take these important analysis capabilities to the next level, i.e. to an efficient design tool. This task will be accomplished through the formulation and implementation of the sensitivities of the fatigue life of the panels to their geometric/material properties, boundary conditions, TPS characteristics, etc. The Phase I effort will represent a proof-of-concept on panels without TPS. The Phase II will then proceed with the structural modeling/reduced order modeling of TPS and a complete validation of the proposed design sensitivity methodology.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed design-oriented software (FRANVAL) will become the only available tool for the prediction of the response, fatigue life, and their design sensitivities of panels subjected to thermo-acoustic loads. Additionally, it will include the TPS structural modeling and its interaction with the panel. Thus, FRANVAL will cover two separate markets (panels and TPS) thereby increasing its distribution potential. ZONA intends to market FRANVAL as a standalone package. It can be adopted by structural engineers for a wide class of aerospace vehicles ranging from JSF, UAV/UCAV, supersonic transports, reusable launch vehicles, RLV/TAV and other new hypersonic aerospace vehicles.  It will be an ideal design tool for the current NASA projects under its space initiative.  Other than NASA, potential customers include R&D and design arms of DoD Government and private industry such as ZONA?s ZAERO software users in the structures community. With ZONA?s user/customer network, the marketing of FRANVAL is relatively straightforward.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Design/Analysis FRANVAL software will occupy a unique niche as there is currently no software to predict the response/fatigue life of panels subjected to thermo-acoustic loads nor evaluate the response/life design sensitivities. It will play an important role in the design of many flight vehicles including supersonic transports, reusable launch vehicles, RLV/TAV and other projects of NASA?s space initiative that are experiencing severe thermal, acoustic, or both types of excitations. The inclusion of the TPS modeling and of its interaction with the panel will provide a common platform for the development of these components and will help transition from component design to system design. Further, the reduced order modeling core of FRANVAL will lead to expedient sensitivity computations. Thus, Design/Analysis FRANVAL will also naturally support the NASA multidisciplinary optimization efforts.

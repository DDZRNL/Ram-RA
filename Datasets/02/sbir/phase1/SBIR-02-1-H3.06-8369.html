<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
HyPerComp Engineering proposes to conduct a series of material tests to evaluate the performance of standard and experimental filament winding materials in cryogenic pressure vessel applications.  The need for high performance lightweight storage of cryogenic materials only intensifies.  Some obvious aerospace applications include cryogenic fuel storage for liquid propellant rockets and satellite systems; for commercial applications there are requirements for a new generation of liquefied natural gas containers (LNG) for the ever increasing demand for improved and more efficient energy transportation systems.  
<br>
<br>Attempts have been made to expand the limited knowledge of basic material properties and capabilities at extremely cold temperatures through testing with various forms of material coupons.  The difficulty with this approach is in being able to apply the biaxial stress/strain state that the material will see in an actual pressure vessel to any degree of certainty.  By testing the candidate materials in actual filament wound pressure vessels, in typical cryogenic pressurization sequences, the data gathered will be exactly representative of the performance that can be expected.  This is the data required to design and qualify high performance filament wound composite pressure vessels for safe and reliable cryogenic applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Improvements in commercial filament wound composite pressure vessels are constantly being sought after.  Any advance in technology that can make these products lighter, safer, or more cost effective to fabricate is readily incorporated into their design and fabrication.  HyPerComp Engineering believes the information what will be obtained through this SBIR will prove very valuable in the development of filament wound composite pressure vessels for use in the storage and transportation of liquefied natural gas as well as other commercially valuable gases stored or transported in liquid form.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The technology obtained from this proposed study will be of special value in the development of high performance filament wound composite pressure vessels used in aerospace and defense applications.  Liquefied gaseous fuel storage for booster systems as well as satellite systems are prime candidates to benefit from the information that will be gathered in this proposed effort.  The data is expected to significantly effect the design and successful qualification of high performance (light weight) pressure vessels for all cryogenic applications.

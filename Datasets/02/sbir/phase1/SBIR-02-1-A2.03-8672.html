<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This SBIR will determine the feasibility of an innovative gas turbine engine concept which has a turbine in front of the compressor.  This engine concept, referred to as the "Front Turbine Engine Concept" (FTEC), has the potentials for extending the flight speed at which turbomachinery can operate.  At hight flight speeds the front turbine extracts sufficient energy from the incoming air thus reducing the air temperature into the compressor and enabling the turbomachinery to operate at high flight speeds (up to Mach 5).
<br>Engine simulations will be conducted on the FTEC to determine the requirements of the components to match the cycle requirements over the complete flight path (takeoff to Mach 5 cruise). The most feasible engine configuraton (one or two spools) will be determined.
<br>Preliminary design will be conducted on the front turbine to identify a prelininary turbine configuration to meet cycle requirements.
<br>Technology requirements for all of the engine components will be assessed.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The FTEC has potential applications for hypersonic propulsion systems up to Mach 5. The most immediate applications would be in the military arena for manned or unmanned hypersonic aircraft (cruise missile). However, It also has potential in commerical
<br> applications in the high-speed transport arena.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The FTEC has potential application in the high-speed transport.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This SBIR phase I project will substantially improve III-Nitride photovoltaic detector quantum efficiency by real-time control of fundamental material properties.  Specifically, minority carrier diffusion length in (Al)GaN photodetectors will be manipulated to achieve up to 10-fold increase in photodetector efficiency in the range 20-300 nm. The innovation builds on recent discovery of increased minority-carrier diffusion length and lifetime following brief forward-bias electron injection into p-(Al)GaN in p-n junctions or Schottky barriers.  Consistent long-term improvements were observed in the optoelectronic properties, including spectral and temporal photoresponse.  Increased diffusion length improves minority-carrier collection and eliminates "dead space", where carriers recombine before collection.  The practical significance of the innovation is a lasting (days), remarkable (10-fold) quantum-efficiency enhancement for (Al)GaN-based photovoltaic detectors achieved through short time (seconds) electron injection.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Zaubertek product concept consists of a proprietary biasing method and electronics package for commercial (Al)GaN UV photodetectors, which have a cutoff wavelengths near 300 nm.  This innovation will significantly impact NASA relevant UV photodetector applications in the 20-300 nm range, such as remote imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetry of the Sun-Earth environment.

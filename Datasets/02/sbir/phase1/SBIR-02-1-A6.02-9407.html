<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses problems of the synthesis and separation of carbon nanotubes for a wide range of nanotechnology applications. We propose to use unique capabilities of Laser Desorption Ionization - Ion Mobility Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry for identification and selective deposition of carbon nano-materials produced by High-Pressure Gas-Phase Catalytic Disproportination of carbon monoxide. 
<br>We will evaluate the capabilities of the LDI-IM TOF MS system for the identification and separation of different carbon nano-phases by obtaining the mass-mobility information.
<br>Once we have demonstrated the viability of the LDI-IM TOF MS for the identification of carbon nanophases in a wide range of masses including short nanotubes, the task of the Phase II of the project be will to use a modified LDI-IM setup for the rapid preparation of thin films of pure nanophases for testing as electron emitter surfaces, catalysts, or biologically active selected areas. 
<br>As a result of this project novel efficient technique for the characterization and synthesis of carbon nano-materials will be developed.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The area of applications for these materials extends from high brightness electron sources to advanced polymers, bio-nanostructures and many others. Nanotubes demonstrate extremely high levels of field electron emission at low applied fields due to the concentration of electrical field around their tips. Another very likely application of nanotubes - electromagnetic shielding for electronic devices and radar absorption for stealth aircraft. Giant fullerenes have been demonstrated to achieve superconducting properties if doped with alkali ions. Fullerene materials are of interest as MALDI matrices because they efficiently absorb the laser light and can be readily functionalized with OH, CH3 and NH2 groups that provide a source of protons for charging of adsorbed biomolecules.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The success of the project will signify a significant improvement of the improved characterization of synthesis, separation and functionalization of carbon nanotubes for applications in nanoelectronics including molecular computing and artificial quantum-structure systems.

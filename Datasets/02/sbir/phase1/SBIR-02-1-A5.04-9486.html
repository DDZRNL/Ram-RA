<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Computational analyses aiding experimental testing of rocket propulsion systems have very rigorous requirements relating to turnaround time and fidelity of analyses. The performance of rocket propulsion systems is intricately tied to the functioning of valve and feed systems, since feed systems exert flow control, regulate pressure and suppress instabilities. CFD based analyses of such systems is difficult because of their structural complexity, dynamic motion of valves, coupling with related systems, the large variation in flow conditions and the inadequacy of models in handling multi-phase flow regimes that include cavitation based instabilities. Most current CFD tools based on structured grid methodology are cumbersome and inefficient to use for such problems and fail to meet the stringent requirements to support testing. The innovation proposed here is to utilize a multi-element based unstructured framework for analyses of valve based feed systems. The technology has been proven to handle geometrically complex configurations efficiently and is complemented by a suite of adaption and grid movement capabilities that allow localized high fidelity resolution and identification of important physical phenomena. Furthermore, the technology being proposed here, has evolved from a generalized multi-phase framework that allows specification of variable thermodynamic properties and physical equations-of-state appropriate to cryogenic working fluids.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Our proposed effort will focus on the application of a multi-element unstructured code (CRUNCH CFD) to help support design methodology and testing for propulsion systems. There is currently a need for a support tool for the evaluation of performance losses due to complex flow patterns or the onset of instabilities and prediction of unsteady pressure loads for systems with moving parts that function in harsh fluidic environments.  Potential customers for this commercial product include companies currently involved in designing systems for space applications such as Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, and Aerojet.  In addition to these companies, a broader market exists, comprising of industrial pump companies who would be interested in using this product for designing high energy systems such as boiler feed pumps and aircraft fuel injection systems.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed Phase I effort followed by subsequent Phase II will result in a commercial CFD tool that will address some of NASA?s needs towards developing a capability for advanced analysis in support of ground testing of rocket propulsion systems.  Since the framework for the CRUNCH CFD code has a moving grid capability with grid adaption, real-time analysis of valve motion is possible.  A detailed analysis of valve response and flow modulation will also be possible and an estimation of feed system response to cavitation surge and other instabilities can be predicted.  Furthermore, the estimation of unsteady pressure loads will provide valuable information from a structural standpoint, thereby improving the life cycle of the propulsion system.  We anticipate this tool to be used in conjunction with other design procedures, especially in its capacity to provide high-fidelity analyses in helping refine preliminary designs and identifying anomalous behavior in existing designs.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Novel polyethers doped with insulating oxides are used to prepare solid polymer electrolytes for high energy density lithium batteries.  The electrolytes are characterized for conductivity and electrochemical stability. Prototype lithium-polymer cells with high voltage cathodes will be fabricated and feasibility demonstrated for rate capability and cyclability.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Lithium-polymer solid state batteries with high energy density and power with low cost and enhanced safety have applications in consumer products.  Some of these are Laptop computers, Cellular phones , Camcorders and Personnel Digital Assistants (PDAs).
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
These advanced technology based batteries will find applications in LEO and GEO spacecraft operations. Achieving this with lithium-polymer batteries with long operating life and specific energy densities of > 100 Wh/kg is well within the range of feasibility.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed objective is to develop a nanostructured self-assembled biomedical device whose function is mediated by device design at molecular, meso- and micron scale levels.  The dominant innovation is a rapid ?single-pot? microsphere self-assembly process that features biomolecule-nanoparticle attachment.  Syntheses of distinct nanoparticles functionalized with different organic moieties provide means for nanoparticle-biomolecular interac-tions not previously possible, first for amplified, localized specific therapeutic delivery, second for specific cell population targeting.  These functionalized hybrid moieties are cooperatively assembled into hollow microspherical units in a highly controllable process, resulting in dual-function high therapeutic capacity delivery vehicles using biomolecular recognition principles.  A therapeutic agent resides on an array of functionalized nanoparticles on the interior of hollow microspheres, while an antibody or short peptide is selectively assembled on nanoparticles on the microsphere?s exterior, permitting loading of therapeutic molecules and delivery.  Based on principles of hierarchi-cal self-assembly, this system?s advantages include: 1) biocompatible reagents, 2) compatability with aqueous environments, 3) functionalized nanoparticle variety permitting multifunctional device delivery systems, 4) surface-attached proteins to provide a steering mechanism, and finally, 5) an ion-based opening mechanism, consequently amplifying targeted therapeutic treatment.  These innovations enhance therapeutic agent delivery and molecular imaging in numerous medical applications, including those in space.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Serializer/Deserializer (SERDES) components are the key components for high speed serial data transfer. Low latency, high bandwidth communications between processor nodes with upgrade ability within a box is of utmost importance in advanced NASA communication systems. Parallel architectures represent a bottleneck in terms of bandwidth and pin count.  Several new standards such as Infiniband, Hypertransport, 3GIO, and RapidIO are evolving with a common direction towards serial system interconnect for next generation back-plane developments. Commercially available SERDES to support new standards have well known bit ambiguity at the deserializer output thereby requiring additional circuitry as well as software to solve this problem.
<br>
<br>In order to overcome the bit ambiguity problem, Advanced Science and Novel Technology (ADSANTEC) proposes a novel ternary SERDES technique. The technique uses a ternary signal at the Serializer (SER) output to mark a reference bit position. The marked bit positions are used to recover a low-speed clock signal for receiver word alignment using a clock multiplier technique. The proposed concept will lead to the development of a new generation of serial data interconnect. ADSANTEC?s innovative solution will offer high throughput (up to 50Gb/s) and eliminate latency introduced by the switching fabric of existing digital interconnect approaches.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The ternary SERDES concept can be integrated into network test equipment.  According to Frost & Sullivan, the optical testing market is currently estimated at $2.3 billion and expected to grow to nearly $4 billion by 2004.  ADSANTEC has an ongoing discussion with the market leader in this type of network test equipment, IXIA Inc., who potentially will be willing to support ADSANTEC with additional funding at Phase II in order to license ternary SERDES for use in a new generation of network test equipment. 
<br>
<br>Fiberspace Inc. is willing to commit Phase II fast track support in order to accelerate the development of multilevel SERDES technology and expand the total available market (TAM) of Fiberspace components. In addition, Fiberspace is willing to support ADSANTEC with laboratory space and equipment.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The success of this program will result in commercialization of the most advanced processor interconnect back-plane, based on ternary SERDES.  Its potential range of application will include a new generation of computer systems for spectral image data processing, homeland defense and a variety of digital conferencing networks. ADSANTEC?s data rate transparent and expandable interconnect will be adaptable to various types of communication networks.
<br>
<br>Introduction of new system applications demanding the virtually unlimited throughput provided by the ternary SERDES interconnect will guarantee significant advantages with increasing interconnection network speed demands by large scale computer systems, and supercomputers.  This will help the computer and system designers to increase processing power of future large conputer systems, both in NASA and industrial applications.

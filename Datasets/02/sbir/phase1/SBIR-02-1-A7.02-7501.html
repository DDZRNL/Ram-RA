<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Fracture mechanics capabilities based on finite element multidisciplinary analysis will be designed and developed. Incorporating finite element based fracture mechanics analysis will enhance the power and strength of the STARS software.  An in depth literature survey will be conducted to assess the appropriate finite element methodology for modeling crack tip stress regions and associated material constitutive relations. In order to characterize fracture behavior, crack tip opening displacement, J-integral method, and virtual crack extension methods will be assessed for implementation. Feasibility of including these methods in the present software design of a multidisciplinary finite element program will be investigated.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The development of fracture mechanics capabilities enhances the strength and applicability to  monitor and perform risk assessment of structural integrity in such areas as commercial airplane structures,  nuclear power plants, and other fracture and damage critical structural components in rail-roads, off-shore structures, and automobiles.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
 The structural integrity and safety monitoring of  NASA's shuttle programs, Flight Test Research vehicles, lauch vehicle structural integrity risk assessment will be potential beneficiaries.

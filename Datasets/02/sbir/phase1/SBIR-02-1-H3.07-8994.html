<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
As one of two key parts of heat rejection systems in power conversion technologies for solar or nuclear electric propulsion, radiators reject the waste thermal energy generated in the power conversion process to space. An advanced radiator should provide high thermal rejection performance with minimum mass while satisfying the structure requirements. Traditional metal based radiators and single phase pumped heat transport loops are inadequate for emerging demands in near and far term space explorations; metal based radiators usually are over 8 ~ 10kg/m2. Carbon-Carbon (C-C) composite materials are ideal candidates to solve the above challenges in new generation space radiators because of their series of advantages, such as very low density, high thermal conductivity, good mechanical properties, high flexibility and variability in properties by material construction et al.  In combination with heat pipes, two-phase Capillary Pumped Loops (CPL) and Loop Heat Pipes (LHP) or other two-phase heat transport loops, overall thermal performance and reliability of the space radiators can be significantly improved and realized by reducing radiator mass, which is a big portion of overall spacecraft mass.  Hence, we propose to research and develop advanced high temperature C-C radiators for space solar or nuclear power conversion and other space systems.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Power systems currently under development for deep space exploration is a prime example of an application that would benefit significantly by this research and development.  A five fold reduction in radiator specific mass is achievable and needed to meet the demanding challenge of space exploration.  The proposed C-C radiator design has wide ranging application in both low and high-radiated temperatures, as well as for small and large power conversion systems.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Carbon-carbon radiators in the form of heat exchangers are expected to emerge in aerospace applications, particularly in high performance military aircraft, and hypersonic vehicles where high temperatures pose severe design issues.

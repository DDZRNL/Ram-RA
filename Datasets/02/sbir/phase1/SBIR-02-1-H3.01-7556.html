<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The purpose of this project is to produce a transparent integration of SINDA/G into the MSC.Patran FEA modeling system.  This product will be oriented towards both the beginning thermal analyst and the advanced SINDA user.  The transparent integration will allow a new user to use advanced features involving convection, surface-to-surface radiation, heaters, and other advanced thermal features without knowing the format of SINDA/G or thermal radiation codes.  Experienced SINDA users will not be limited by the simple boundary conditions typically associated with FEA thermal codes, but will have the full power of SINDA/G.   Because of the popularity of MSC.Patran in the aerospace world for building MSC.Nastran structural models, this graphical modeling environment is ideal for producing SINDA/G thermal models in order to enhance the concurrent engineering processes of aerospace hardware design.  The popularity of Patran makes it available to a high percentage of thermal engineers in the aerospace community.  Also many thermal engineers already know how to use Patran, reducing the learning curve for this product and eliminating the need to learn another modeling system.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The SINDA/G integration into MSC.Patran has application for all areas of thermal design within the aerospace community.  This product will integrate advanced thermal features such as radiation and ablation into a popular graphical modeling environment for the design of spacecraft, propulsion systems, electronic equipment, reentry vehicles, aircraft, and various other aerospace hardware.  The integration of SINDA/G into MSC.Patran will help in the concurrent engineering process by allowing thermal engineers to use the same modeling tools that many structural engineers use in the aerospace industry.  It will also allow CAD data to be directly incorporated into thermal models.  In addition, it will allow thermal models to be radiation independent so models can be more easily exchanged between companies that use different thermal radiation and orbital heating codes.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The SINDA/G integration into MSC.Patran has application for all areas of thermal design within NASA.  This product will integrate advanced thermal features such as radiation, ablation and the GFSSP (Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program) into a popular graphical modeling environment for the design of propulsion systems, reentry vehicles, electronic equipment, and various thermal design projects associated with the International Space Station.  The integration of SINDA/G into MSC.Patran will help in the concurrent engineering process at NASA centers by allowing thermal engineers to use the same modeling tools that structural engineers use for building MSC.Nastran models. It will also allow CAD data to be directly incorporated into thermal models.   In addition, it will allow thermal models to be radiation independent so contractors or different NASA centers can run the same Patran based thermal model utilizing different thermal radiation and orbital heating codes.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
TPL proposes to develop a novel MEMS power supply employing volumetric lithium ion microbatteries and micro-supercapacitors for miniature satellites.  This configuration will provide high energy density and rechargeability for longevity and high specific power capability for handling both steady state and transient high power demands in an electrochemical micro-power system.  The proposed design is unique because it embodies volumetric energy storage in cells that are ~1mm3 in extent.  Existing MEMS microbatteries are area/planar designs that require large footprints (tens of mm2) to achieve useful capacities.  The proposed space power system is area conforming and can be integrated with minimum volume systems.  No existing satellite power system can make this claim.  
<br>These innovative devices will exploit TPL?s novel soft lithography microcontact printing (?CP) fabrication process to construct components that have both high power and high energy densities in an electrochemical device.  
<br>The PI has pioneered the use of soft lithography ?CP as a novel microfabrication process for non-silicon materials for advanced packaging and has excellent capabilities to achieve the project objectives.  The effort will build on ongoing relationships with space and defense OEMs to deliver a product suitable for immediate insertion into space-based defense systems.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In the future, miniaturized power supplies will be incorporated into emerging microsystem technologies for use in medical, industrial, and defense applications to improve patient outcomes, improve control over industrial processes for improved efficiency, and for numerous discrete sensor applications.  The potential impact of microsystems on daily life promises to be very exciting.  New functionality is being integrated into chip structures enabling the chip to think, sense, act and communicate.  These microscopic systems are finding application in surgical instruments, sensors for biological, medical, environmental and pollution monitoring, for storm tracking, and for disposable games.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed volumetric power supply will enhance the viability and capability of not only miniaturized satellites, but also numerous airborne and space based-vehicles where weight and size are of prime importance.  Such platforms could include high altitude balloons, and even air-borne smart-dust sensors.  The proposed small form factor devices, which weigh less than a gram, will be critical to realizing an integrated, small volume, small footprint power system.  Furthermore, realization of small form-factor batteries that can be included in implantable or ingestible devices will enable remote monitoring and treatment of humans in space.

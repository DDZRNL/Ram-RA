<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA has embarked on an ever more ambitious
<br>path of developing modular space exploration systems, and
<br>human exploration missions. To enable missions
<br>that are envisioned for the future, advances in
<br>the human/robotic interface are required. This
<br>proposal provides a new telepresence interface, based
<br>on an ultra-wide field-of-view (FOV) HMD. This fully
<br>immersive HMD has a FOV which nearly matches the unobstructed
<br>human visual field, and maintains high resolution throughout.
<br>By combining this immersive display with a custom
<br>camera system and appropriate software, a telepresence
<br>system capable of high-fidelity depth perception, FOV and
<br>resolution is possible.  This tool would be a significant
<br>benefit to human operators of robotic systems.
<br>In Phase 1 we will design a tiled, wide FOV camera array
<br>and appropriate 3D software to interface between this
<br>array and the HMD. The product of Phase 2 will be a
<br>complete working telepresence system with custom camera array
<br>and HMD. There are strong commercialization opportunities in the
<br>engineering services industry and various government
<br>agencies, as they are known users of telepresence systems
<br>for remote operation of robots and vehicles.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The ultra-wide field of view of the proposed system
<br>will allow users a much greater sense of immersion in the
<br>displayed enviroment--be it virtual or remote.
<br>The new level of telepresence immersion will
<br>enable much more practical police, rescue and hazmat
<br>applications to emerge. It is also well known
<br>that the US military is increasing its reliance
<br>on remotely piloted vehicles and this system
<br>would work equally well in the battlefield
<br>environment. Entertainment applications will
<br>also emerge: for example, allowing individuals to "step
<br>on the field" during a professional sporting
<br>event via telepresence.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed ultra-wide FOV telepresence system will
<br>enable a new level of operator control over robotic
<br>systems for payload manipulation, docking and similar
<br>tasks.  The enhanced FOV and depth perception
<br>will also allow operators of exploration vehicles
<br>greater understanding of the remote terrain---leading
<br>to more efficient exploration and faster, safer
<br>navigation for the remote vehicle.  Finally,
<br>playing back the immersive visual experience
<br>recorded on a distant planet for non-NASA
<br>personnel may provide a dramatic marketing tool
<br>for the agency.

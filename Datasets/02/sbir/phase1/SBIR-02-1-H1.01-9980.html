<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The NASA vision for the spaceport of the future entails the transition over time from very high-cost, research oriented space launches with a relatively low frequency of launches to an environment where spaceports are commercialized for the space transportation industry and are required to support multiple launches per day in a safe, cost-effective manner. The spaceport of the future may resemble, from an operational perspective, our current airports and seaports of today and will need to resolve many similar issues to these transportation hubs. These issues include (1) safe and secure spaceport operations, (2) efficient movement of machinery and people through the spaceport, and (3) cost-efficient, affordable, and timely spaceport operations.  Discrete event simulation has been used to assess detailed processes at modern day seaports. Like seaports, spaceport operations are labor intensive and require extensive use of personnel and machinery. The ability to conduct seaport operations efficiently has been improved significantly through proper utilization of seaport assets. This foundation provides a solid footing from which research for efficient spaceport operations can be based. An object-oriented discrete event simulation system is proposed that will address spaceport operations in the context of aerospace safety, mobility, and efficiency. The simulation system will be built upon the Java programming language to provide for maximum portability and will utilize XML for standards-based data interchange. Development of the simulation model will provide the underlying basis for follow-on activities such as 2D and 3D animation and visualization capabilities. Technology transfer of lessons learned in the development of seaport simulation models will be utilized. The overall goal of the spaceport simulation model is to maximize throughput, operational safety, and resource utilization and minimize overall cost of operations.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The potential commercial applications for the SPACESIM model are limitless. As the spaceport industry is commercialized and our society accepts space transportation as a common mode of transportation, SPACESIM will be able to be used at spaceports worldwide to ensure that operations are conducted in a cost-efficient manner. In addition, the SPACESIM model has potential integration possibilities with other transportation simulations to provide macro level ?end-to-end? simulations of an entire transportation grid including all modes of transportation. The benefits to society are that cost will be driven down over time to the point that space transportation is affordable to the overall at-large population.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The results of the Phase I and Phase II research activities will be a powerful, flexible, object-oriented discrete event simulation system for spaceport operations. The simulation model will provide spaceport planners with the necessary tools to conduct ?what-if? scenarios to facilitate decision-making and to improve throughput, minimize operational bottlenecks and delays, and maximize resource utilization.

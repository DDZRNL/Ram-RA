<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Extended exposure to microgravity during spaceflight can result in excessive bone loss.  Efforts to monitor bone loss during flight, to monitor astronaut health and guide the development and use of countermeasures, are limited by the lack of real-time biosensors for bone loss.  This proposal addresses development of a novel system for noninvasive, real-time measurement of urinary calcium-a key marker for bone loss.  The Urine Analysis System (UAS) developed under this program will rely on a colorimetric technique that is well suited for use in conjunction with the NASA Urine Monitoring System, as well as integration into an automated "smart toilet."  We have established a uniquely qualified team for this project that includes expertise in biomedical engineering, optical measurements, construction of novel biomedical devices, and an STS-90 NASA payload specialist astronaut and physician with firsthand experience in the problems associated in measurement of bone loss during spaceflight.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The technology developed under this program has the potential to be used for home-based monitoring in patients suffering from osteoporosis.  Osteoporosis affects more than 14 million American women.  Current technology requires them to make periodic visits to their physician to monitor the progression of their disease and determine the effectiveness of their treatment regime.  This requirement leads to problems with bed-ridden patients and reduces compliance with ambulatory patients.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Urine Analysis System will permit, for the first time, real-time monitoring of urinary calcium during spaceflight.  The data provided by our system will allow astronauts to evaluate the extent of their bone loss during extended periods in microgravity, determine when more aggressive countermeasures are needed to prevent or limit bone loss, and monitor the effectiveness of the countermeasures.  Data collected by the system will provide a valuable database for guiding continued research in bone loss prevention.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Using standard spacecraft attitude determination sensors, in particular a star sensor and planet sensors, an autonomous navigation system will be developed for planetary orbiters, offering absolute navigation accuracy on the order of ?100 m.  This capability directly supports automated rendezvous and docking missions in Earth orbit as well as at other solar system bodies, such as Mars.  The navigation solution depends only on measurements of the distance to the center of the central body, determined by measuring its angular diameter, and the direction to the center of the body in inertial space.  These measurements are made by imaging the planetary disk, determining its centroid and angular diameter, and simultaneously imaging the star background.  Relative navigation between chaser and target spacecraft is achieved via intersatellite communication of each individual vehicle?s absolute navigation solution. Microcosm offers substantial experience in autonomous space navigation, including our development of an optical autonomous navigation system for the Air Force, which was flown on the TAOS spacecraft in 1994.  Microcosm is also involved in ongoing work through the USAF to develop an autonomous rendezvous and docking capability for on-orbit servicing of Earth orbiters.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Non-NASA applications for this autonomous navigation system would be communications satellites, like GEO satellites.  They could reduce ground operations costs substantially by eliminating the need for ground tracking.  Implementing autonomous navigation on GEO satellites would also enable the application of autonomous stationkeeping maneuvers as well, since the spacecraft would now be able to determine its own drift, it could also enact autonomous orbit control to maintain the desired orbital position.  Ground commanding would not be necessary to stationkeep the satellite.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This technology is applicable for autonomous spacecraft navigation for Earth orbiters or orbiters about any other solar system body.  Mars mission orbiters would be direct beneficiaries of such a technology.  Rendezvous and docking applications in Earth orbit or in orbit about other planets would also benefit.  Relative navigation could be achieved with communication of the real-time absolute navigation information between two vehicles.  Close formations could also make use of the relative navigation information.  Distributed constellations of satellites could save on operations costs substantially, eliminating the need for ground-based orbit determination for all satellites in the constellation.

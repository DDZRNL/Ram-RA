<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Los Gatos Research proposes to develop a novel, flight-ready, instrument based on a new technology called Off-Axis Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy and continuous-wave, mid-infrared quantum cascade lasers to simultaneously measure the concentrations of CO, CH4, and N2O in the stratosphere and troposphere.  These species have been identified as strong greenhouse gases, have very long atmospheric lifetimes, and thus play an important role in climate change.  The proposed multi-laser Off-Axis ICOS instrument will measure all three of these species simultaneously while on board a NASA aircraft.  In Phase I, we will demonstrate feasibility by building a laboratory prototype Off-Axis ICOS instrument that is capable of simultaneously measuring the target species in ambient air using multiple quantum cascade lasers.  We will test the performance of the instrument over extended periods using calibrated gas samples to verify measurement accuracy, precision and stability. In Phase II, LGR will deliver to NASA a multi-laser Off-Axis ICOS instrument optimized for airborne studies.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In addition to the atmospheric monitoring applications described above, the proposed technology may be used for detection of explosives, real-time monitoring and control of chemical processing plants, and for medical diagnostics based on breath analysis.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed novel instrument platform may be applied for accurate measurements of a wide range of important atmospheric gases for validation and confirmation of atmospheric chemistry and transport models.

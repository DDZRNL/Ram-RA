<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A gel propellant booster engine to provide delta-v orbital maneuvering to microspacecraft in the range of 25 to 100 kg is proposed.  It offers significant innovation in that it has the same performance in terms of specific impulse (Isp) as a solid motor but with less mass and the ability to be throttled and restarted.  It is also safe from detonation and will not leak like a liquid propellant system.  Its propellants are also of low toxicity.  It can be used to boost a microspacecraft into a final orbit for a number of NASA, commercial or military missions.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercial microspacecraft missions for Earth resource observation, formation flying for communciations systems and large spacecraft health and status monitoring are enabled by this motor.  Also, capbility to launch such payloads from the cargo bay of the shuttle orbiter is available due to the safety of the propellants.
<br>
<br>Military missions include missile defense warning and propulsion for space-based interceptors.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Microspacecraft with large propulsive capability enabled by this motor can perform NASA missions such as Earth's magnetic field or cometary nucleus and tail mapping armadas, observations of Earth's ocean temperature, air pollution and missions to asteroids.  Also free-flying microspacecraft can be deployed from the shuttle or space station to perform microgravity missions such as biotechnology or materials processing and then return to the shuttle or station for retrieval.

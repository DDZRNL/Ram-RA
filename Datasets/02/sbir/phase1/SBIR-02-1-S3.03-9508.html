<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to investigate the feasibility of developing a 32x32 multi-gain readout multiplexer with the following key design features:
<br>
<br>1- Optimized for use with infrared detector arrays requiring low bias levels, such as Ge:Ga far IR photoconductors.  The unit-cell design will maintain constant bias across the detector during the integration and, thereby, will eliminate non-linearity and detector debiasing.  The design will also minimize the channel-to-channel DC variation which improves the bias uniformity across all pixels of the array.
<br>
<br>2- Capable of operation at cryogenic temperatures down to 1.5K.  Advanced monolithic cryo-CMOS technology will guarantee deep cryogenic operation with minimal impact on noise performance.
<br>
<br>3- Offers the potential of being directly hybridized to IR detector arrays using indium-bump technology.
<br>
<br>No two-dimensional readout multiplexer with these features is currently available or has been developed.  This effort fits well within the scope of the SBIR Subtopic S3.03 and will be a benefit to many large and small NASA projects including NGST, SOFIA, and Astrobiology missions.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The basic product resulting from the proposed project will be a 32x32, multi-gain CTIA readout multiplexer suitable for far IR detector arrays.  Such a device can be interfaced with a 2D detector array that is assembled from linear arrays or hybridized directly to a 2D array designed for this purpose.  Future products could include expansion of this design to larger formats and can be customized to have added features specifically required for a particular instrument.  Being the critical components of many instruments in NASA's space program, the principle market for these readouts will be NASA.  Aerospace companies -- such as Raytheon, Boeing, Rockwell, and Ball Aerospace -- that either directly participate in the space program or independently manufacture infrared detector arrays are our secondary customers.  Other customers would be science groups at universities and national labs engaged in developing science instruments for observations at ground-based observatories and for basic research.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Potential applications for NASA includes: space instruments developed under Origins Program, science instruments for SOFIA, upcoming projects under Astrobiology Program, balloon-borne instruments for atmospheric research, and laboratory science-instruments.

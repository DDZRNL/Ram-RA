<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The present invention provides an inexpensive and low loss fiberoptic manifold for lightweight, high-efficiency, electronically steerable, phased-array antennas. Our approach is sate-of-the-art in design and closely coupled with proven volume fiber optic component manufacturing techniques, holding a promise of realizing practical optical digital delay with performance and cost that have not been achieved before. By using all solid-state inorganic magneto-optic material construction, the proposed switch overcomes the limitation in speed and long-term reliability associated with other approaches.  The proposed compact, light-weight, ultra reliable, and low power consumption photonic digital beamforming phase array antenna can potentially be part of spaceship?s skin eliminating the need for complex out-space antenna deployment mechanisms.    The advanced technology also potentially addresses the development of next generation critical radar components for optically fed transmit/receive, signal up/down conversion, RF and DC signal distribution, and phase shifting.  A high-speed and fault tolerance fiberoptic 4 bit reconfigurable true time delay device will be demonstrated in Phase I.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are many applications need high switching speed of less than 1 microsecond with carrier-class reliability. The proposed AGILTRON?s high-speed optical device can be a key building block for high-performance, cost-effective solutions for managing aggregated OC-192 and above optical bandwidth networks in metro environments. It provides for data rate, protocol and data format transparency and its high-speed logic interface enables unique capabilities.  With a speed of less than 1 millisecond, the proposed switch supports unique light management functionalities such as multicasting and broadcasting. This dynamically controllable, intelligent switch enables virtual port expansion of previously limited high-speed communications systems, such as 10 Gigabit Ethernet Switches, high-speed Routers and OC-192 SONET Multiplexers.  The proposed technology holds a promise of extending switching to dynamic reconfiguration, performance monitoring, and traffic management while power balancing, attenuation and equalization management that are inherent in the switch fabric

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Radar is undergoing a significant change in status as a sensing instrument.  New systems must accomplish more with fewer resources: power, equipment mass and volume, operating and maintenance personnel, and cost. .   For NASA applications, microwave radar based sensors have proven to be ideal instruments for many Earth science applications. Examples include global freeze/thaw monitoring and soil moisture mapping, accurate global wind retrieval and snow inundation mapping, global 3-D mapping of rainfall and cloud systems, precise topographic mapping and natural hazard monitoring, global ocean topographic mapping and glacial ice mapping for climate change studies. For global coverage and the long-term study of Earth's eco-systems, space-based radar is of particular interest to Earth scientists.

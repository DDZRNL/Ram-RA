<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Composite structures with complex curvature and reinforcement features frequently require assembly of 2D laminate and 3D woven structures to effect the appropriate load transfer.  A very limited range of assembly methods has been available to date.  RCI has developed an assembly concept that promises to reduce load concentration and assembly costs relate to the state of the art techniques.  While RCI plans to demonstrate this concept on ceramic composites, the technique can bring significant improvements to organic composites.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Complex composite structures such as aerostructures will benefit from this technology through improved technical performance and reduced assembly costs.  The potential exists for complex composite aerostructures to break out into markets that are 3-5 times larger than the present markets.  This composite assembly technique is applicable to commercial jet transport aerostructures and hypersonic vehicle hot aero structures.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This innovation was created in response to low shear interface performance of C/SiC materials for RLV control surface applications but will apply to OMC, MMC and CMC aerostructures.

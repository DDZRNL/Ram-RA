<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The objective of the proposed project is the development of technology for more efficient and effective human-computer supervision of complex systems. Systems that combine humans and robots in a cooperative manner may be termed hybrid systems. Hybrid systems offer advantages over both purely automated systems and purely manual systems in many circumstances. However, future hybrid systems will be asked to perform in more challenging environments than existing systems. This gives rise to a serious need to develop methods for integrating humans more closely?and more efficiently?than is now possible. We propose to develop Achievability Control Theory (ACT), which synergistically combines human and machine capabilities and enhances the flexibility and effectiveness of hybrid robotic and automated systems. This innovation is generally relevant for the development of future hybrid systems in several applications and particularly for NASA space construction, maintenance, and exploration activities. These activities involve humans interacting with automated assets in situations that are dynamic and unpredictable. The proposed research encompasses the development of a theory and an analytical approach to achieve synergistic performance in dynamic environments along with the collection of supporting data through basic experiments.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Many potential non-NASA applications also exist. On the civilian side, these include Transportation assets routing & scheduling, hybrid-automated air traffic control, robotic search & rescue (mobile robots), flexible manufacturing system control, hybrid-automated project management for complex system development, and robotic assembly line planning and control. There are also potential academic and educational applications, including: industrial engineering training and research, robotics & automation research, computer science, and human factors & cognitive sciences.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Given the broad use of computer control schemes in the modern economy, it seems that there may be a many applications for a new, more flexible automation control model. A few potential applications specific to NASA include: (1) Human-telerobot interaction in orbital or planetary missions including construction, maintenance, and exploration; (2) mission planning for human-robot interactive tasks like EVA; and multi-robot supervision during construction, maintenance, or exploration

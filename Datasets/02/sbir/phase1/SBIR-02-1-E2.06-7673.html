<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I program addresses the development of a Proton Exchange Membrane Unitized Regenerative Fuel Cell (PEM URFC) Energy Storage System.  The PEM URFC provides all the advantages of a primary fuel cell but can recharge itself from an electrical power supply providing very high-density energy storage. Configured with reversible cells, this system is the functional equivalent of a battery yet has the attractive features of a fuel cell such as high specific energy, high energy density, and long cycle life.  The specific development having a significant impact on optimization of the URFC for advanced NASA missions is a lightweight cell stack design. We will rapidly transition the results of the successful Phase I into Phase II prototypes of energy storage products suitable for development into flight hardware or into commercial products.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal responds to the solicitation for methods to capture features from one dimensional sensor signals.  We exploit a combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) to capture the required features.  This can be used to diagnose a wide variety of systems using sensors which are monitoring the various parameters of the system.  We will also describe an innovative one dimensional test probe we have developed that is synergistic with the PCA and LVQ algorithms to yield a very powerful diagnostic tool.  The goal of this work is to develop a toolbox of PCA and LVQ implementations optimized for equipment diagnostics.  The toolbox will also include software optimized for use with our innovative one dimensional test probe signal concept, but would be equally useful for interpretation of any one dimensional signal.  We will also show examples later of the PCA and LVQ algorithms used for a wide range of other applications where the input data set has thousands of degrees of freedom so our toolbox will not be limited to one dimensional signals.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercial customers for our toolset will be developers of advanced equipment which requires comprehensive diagnostic means for testing, for external maintenance tools, and for built-in diagnostics and prognostics.  A first non-NASA application we are pursuing is hydraulic systems for the US Army Future Combat System.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Our past success with the algorithms we will include in the toolbox suggest that with further optimization and generalization, this could be a very useful tool for engineers developing automated health monitoring, fault detection, and diagnosis capabilities, especially for interpretation of complex one dimensional signals.  The one dimensional test probe concept described in the proposal offers new capability in structural health monitoring and the toolset will assist users in applying that innovative new technology as well.  Engine diagnostics would be a good first NASA application.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The spaceflight instrument community has a need for sub-miniature high voltage connectors that are capable of being used in spacecraft electronic applications such as transmitters, modulators, ion propulsion and other instrumentation.  These connectors should be rugged, exhibit low outgassing, have different configurations matched to particular needs, and be rated to reliably operate at voltages exceeding 5,000 volts. 
<br>Existing high voltage connector designs are used for TWTAs, radar, aircraft cockpit displays, physic experiments and other applications with excellent reliability.  Although these specialized high voltage connectors have been successfully adapted to similar spaceflight applications, the unique demands of space create a need for improved designs that are small and extremely reliable when operated in a vacuum environment.  The proposed interconnection solution, described herein, meets this need. 
<br>NASA specifications impose requirements for selection of parts and design of spacecraft wiring systems nevertheless they do not address specific requirements for high voltage connections in spacecraft. Therefore, a need exists for a series of miniature high voltage connectors that are immune to the rigors of the space environment as well as associated application data on the derating, testing, maintenance and assembly of the high voltage interconnection systems.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercial spaceflight instruments where high voltage power will be used. Other non-NASA applications would include the European Space Agency (ESA) using similar instruments, as well as, commercial applications where miniature high voltage components are used.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Spaceflight instruments and space avionics where high voltage power will be used.  High voltage connectors and cables are used in a wide variety of high reliability spaceflight instruments such as UHF and S-Band Transmitters, Space Radar Modulators, Intensified Optical and UV Cameras and Telescopes, Gamma Ray Instrumentation, Mass spectrometer Systems, Intensified lights for spacecraft docking and Ion propulsion.

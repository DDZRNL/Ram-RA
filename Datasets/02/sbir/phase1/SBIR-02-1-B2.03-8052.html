<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Intelligent Optical Systems, Inc. proposes to develop a fluorescence detection based miniature multisensor probe and detection system to monitor cell nutrient parameters in zero gravity.  The proposed sensor system can be integrated into NASA?s bioreactor hardware to enhance performance. Luminescent nano-particles will be used as fluorescent indicators to provide greater signal intensity and to reduce photo-degradation.  The ultimate optical nutrients monitor will be capable of detecting and monitoring vital nutrient parameters such as pH, temperature, dissolved carbon dioxide, dissolved oxygen, and glucose.  The device will provide a continuous, unmanned measurement of the bioreactor?s parameters.  The optical monitor will require no reagent replacement and is projected to be capable of long term unattended real-time monitoring of cell culture media.
<br>In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility and sensitivity of the optical monitoring device and the single source fluorescence system using buffers and cell culture media (lacto bacillus).  In Phase II, we will construct and test a field deployable prototype monitor to be used in a NASA bioreactor project.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In addition to space applications, the proposed sensors will find immediate use in pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.  Fermentation monitoring, cell culturing, and tissue culturing are other important applications.  The food processing, water processing and beverage industries are also candidates for these sensors.  The medical diagnostic and monitoring fields also have a need for blood gas sensors and glucose sensors.  Bioreactors of all types will have enhanced performance through the use of the IOS sensor suite.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Use of the proposed sensor suite will enhance the results of bioreactors to be flown in space.  In the future, the bioreactor will be used for biomolecule production, natural vitamin D3 production, culturing infectious diseases, and the development treatment devices for liver-disease.  Other potential space/ medical applications include be studies in bone growth, cardiac tissue growth, drug efficacy, pancreatic tissue for transplantation.  The IOS sensor suite will increase the controllability and performance of bioreactors

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In the Phase I effort, Tai-Yang Research Corporation (TYRC) proposes to design and perform analyses on state-of-the-art High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) coils for the Variable Specific Impulse Magneto-Plasma Rocket (VASIMR) experiment. Using the design results obtained in the Phase I effort, TYRC proposes in Phase II to fabricate, test, and install HTS coils (VX-2 and VX-3) in the existing VASIMR experiment. Replacing the conventional copper coils with state-of-the-art HTS coils in the VASIMR experiment will allow for greater design flexibility, electrical power consumption and increased operational performance.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Superconducting magnets have found commercial markets in various industrial applications. Industrial applications range from the practical such as MRI/NMR magnets to the high-tech such as high-energy particle accelerators. More common for superconducting applications are high-tech devices such as: magnetic levitation and transportation (MAGLEV), magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD), energy storage (SMES or flywheels), and power transmission/generation technology, etc.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Anytime there is a need for lightweight, low power consumption, and high-magnetic field, superconductivity will be the logical choice. NASA is presently studying the feasibity of: a) superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), b)superconducting flywheels for energy storage, c) VASIMR plasma propulsions, d) MAG-LIFTER for low-cost boost to orbit, d) adiabatic demagnetization for cooling, etc. High-field superconducting magnets are even finding applications in Department of Defense (e.g. active denial non-lethal standoff weapons)

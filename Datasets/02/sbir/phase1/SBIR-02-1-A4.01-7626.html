<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A computational technique that utilizes an innovative tightly coupled combination of CFD, 6-DoF and blast wave simulation methods is proposed for the analysis of crew escape systems for future launch vehicles.  An existing high-fidelity simulation program, well validated for military crew escape systems, will be leveraged to meet the challenges of simulating escape system operation for launch abort across the flight envelope, from pre-launch to the hypersonic regime.
<br>
<br>In Phase I, computationally efficient blast wave effect models will be integrated to simulate launch vehicle propellant explosion effects.  Analytical models and available explosion test data will be combined into reduced mechanism blast wave models simulating the explosion event.  The value of the improved coupled simulation capability will be demonstrated through sample computations, with and without blast wave effects, for individual and simultaneous crew member ejection, and for the escape separation of a crew vehicle.  
<br>
<br>The newly developed physical and dynamic simulation models will be further refined and validated in Phase II.  In particular, the speed and accuracy of staging and escape simulations using the new blast wave models will be improved.  Recent CFDRC experience in complex urban blast wave flow field modeling will be leveraged to implement a solution adaptive overset Chimera grid approach.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Additional application areas include analysis of store release and missile launch from future hypersonic transcontinental military aircraft and crew escape systems for such vehicles, and multi-stage kinetic projectile boost and staging.  Other potential new markets for the coupled CFD/6-DoF/blast wave modeling include analysis of missile proximity warhead effectiveness, explosive warhead application against chemical/biological agents, and armored vehicle protection designed to deflect incoming warheads through the initiation of blast waves in the warhead path.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed simulation technology will find direct and immediate applications with NASA and contractors in the development of NASA's Second and Third Generation Reusable Launch Vehicles. The software provides accurate and cost effective escape system simulation technology not available to NASA today.  It provides significant capability advances in crucial areas of launch vehicle development: 1) definition and screening of escape strategies in the concept phase, 2) verification of escape system functionality across the flight envelope, and 3) blast wave impact on escape system functionality and safety margin. It offers risk mitigation of crew safety and survivability not available from ground or flight tests. The technology is cross-cutting for all potential architectures, and for all crew escape systems ranging from individual ejection seats to crew vehicles.

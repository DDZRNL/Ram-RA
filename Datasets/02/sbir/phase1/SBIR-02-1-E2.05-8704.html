<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A low cost, high performance propulsion system does not exist that can support small and micro-satellite requirements, that is not burdened with severe hazard and toxicity issues. The VACCO Micro Propulsion System (MPS) represents a leap forward in the application of ChEMS? (metal MEMS) propulsion technology for nanosat and picosat missions, however its capability is limited by reliance on low-Isp, low-density butane propellant. AeroAstro proposes to more than triple the performance of MPS by upgrading it to incorporate decomposing nitrous oxide (N2O) technology. This increase in total impulse of MPS from 33 N-s to over 100 N-s is made possible by a combination of factors including, the liquid density of N2O being approximately double that of butane, allowing twice as much propellant to be stored within the MPS volume, and the exothermal decomposition of N2O produces a hot gas with an Isp that is over two times that of cold butane. By applying AeroAstro?s nitrous oxide technology to VACCO?s MPS, it is possible to triple its performance (200% increase in delivered &#8710;V/unit mass) providing an enabling technology for nano-spacecraft by allowing them to perform orbit modification and formation flying that is far beyond the current norm.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Both AFRL and DARPA have identified applications for small, highly maneuverable spacecraft that fit with AeroAstro?s Escort mission framework. Escort is a small maneuverable satellite that can be used to monitor, inspect, or service a larger host satellite.  Typical DoD Escort missions applications include the ability to monitor a friendly target satellite?s environment in order to detect attacks, to actively defend a friendly target satellite against attacks by enemy satellites, to inspect a friendly target satellite in order to aid its deployment, monitor its performance and investigate any anomalies it may experience and to attack an enemy target satellite in order to temporarily or permanently disable it, possibly in a stealthy fashion. Commercial versions of the ESCORT satellite can be used to monitor high-value geosynchronous communications satellites for anomalies, assist in on-orbit testing of the communications payload, with the assistance of a tunable RF-probe, and provide imagery for marketing purposes.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A high-performance and modular small-scale propulsion system can be very effectively incorporated on NASA science missions. Examples of this might include distributed constellation of magnetospheric sensing satellites, such as MagCon, formation flying missions, such as a distributed synthetic aperture interferometer, and as a platform for any instrument package that requires precise pointing requirements (such as PIMI, TechSat-21, and ST-5).

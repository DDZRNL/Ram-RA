<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The innovation in this proposal is a new class of electron spectrometers that provide a significant improvement in detector efficiency and result in a system that can provide at least a 50x improvement over current technology. The analyzer design is based on an electric dispersion and an immersion front end optic.  The improved performance will allow a chemical analysis tool with low mass and power requirements that will be planetary mission suitable. This tool will be suitable for understanding the chemistry of geophysical materials plus provide an ability to detect signs of life or pre-biotic processes.  The ability to determine chemical state in addition to elemental composition of materials with no a priori knowledge of the materials will provide a robust experimental capability for extracting information.  A previous study (NAS#-02052) showed a low mass and power instrument is expected with good detector efficiency, with the use of low power x-ray sources and the exciting pump technology now being developed in a NASA SBIR program.  The final goal of the program will be to deliver a prototype XPS with a mass less than 10 kg that consumes less than 10 watts.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Increased detector efficiency of the  electron energy spectrometer will have a major impact in electron spectroscopy applications.  Major commercial techniques are X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES).  The largest market will be in the semiconductor industry using AES for Defect Review of particles with dimensions < 100nm.  This market is rapidly approaching $1B per year.  A company supplying the AES analyzer system can expect to sell $100M per year at maturity.  We expect $3M in commercial sales in the year of Phase III or the following year.  
<br>
<br>The next application will be to concentrate on smaller and more cost effective  XPS and AES instruments that can be used in production environments.  The efficiency will lower the cost and size to open up new applications.   Bryson Consulting has a commercial development program under way for  thin film analysis in semiconductor production.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are three areas of applications within NASA missions. 
<br>
<br>One major question in the search for biosignatures is the effect of the oxidants present on Mars and some Earth locations, such as the Atacama preserve, Chile.  A small XPS system that can provide in situ information will avoid the ever present contamination effects that will be a part of laboratory experiments.  The ability to keep samples in the same environment avoids the effect of changing water levels.  
<br>
<br>Further,  XPS provides clear elemental and chemical state information with out a prior knowledge of what is present.  For non-Earth applications, this feature will insure knowledge gained with XPS even when the situation is different from the planed situation.  
<br>
<br>A small XPS is also a tool for understanding material changes.  In orbiting manned stations this feature will help in diagnostics and material studies.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Space Micro will research an innovative concept for enabling use of commercial microprocessors and system on a chip(SOC). The problem for these chips in space is Single event functional interrupt (SEFI),where the space radiation environment causes the chip to enter a hang or locked state. Our concept is for a SEFI reset chip which will automatically sense and restore funtionality via an intelligent sequence of instructions. This SEFI controller chip will be fabricated in a rad hard process and conceptually can be packaged with its companion processor IC.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The same benefits as NASA missions apply to commercial space platforms, both for communications satellites and imaging. An average of 32 satellites per year are projected using over 15 complex ICs needing SEFI protection. Vastly increased performance over traditional rad hard processors enables cheaper systems plus enabling new capabilites. Programs such as Echostar, Spaceway, Galileo, Direct TV, XM Radio, and all GEO communication spacecraft will be users.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Every NASA space mission uses microprocessors and complex ICs. There is a compelling reason to utilize the high performance COTS ICs, but single event effects such as SEFI dramatically limit their usage. The SEFI controller chip enables breakthrough computing performance without sacrificing reliability due to this severe radaition effect. Typical NASA satellite averages over 10 processors plus other complex devices for imaging. Both earth sensing, solar system, and deep space probe missions will benefit due to use of inexpensive COTS micrelectronics availability.

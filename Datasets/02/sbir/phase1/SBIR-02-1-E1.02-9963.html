<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A complete synthesis of semiconductor, solid-state as well as fiber laser technology for the mass production of miniature solid state lasers is proposed. The adaptation of micro-chip technology to semiconductor fabrication processes enables the implementation of automatic manufacturing techniques to the construction of solid-state lasers for the first time. The micro-chip is pumped by a diode laser, where both lasers are fixed onto a single heat sink using only one automatic tool involving automated vision equipment. 
<br>Pulsed operation of the micro-chip lasers is enabled by additional micro-crystal elements inside the micro-chip laser cavity, allowing also for single frequency operation.  Nonlinear frequency conversion can further be implemented to cover the whole spectral range from the UV to the far IR. The micro-chip laser pulses are amplified to the sub J energy level in large core fiber amplifiers pumped by high brightness diode lasers. 
<br>The proposed micro-chip fiber laser system addresses the component need for advanced lidar instruments. By synthesizing semiconductor, micro-chip and fiber technology, a superior laser source is constructed. This novel laser source can be deployed in a variety of NASA applications, such as the measurement of planetary surface topography, general altimetry, cloud and aerosol mapping as well as mapping of wind fields.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The eventual aim of the project is the mass production of miniature solid-state laser packages. The availability of high power coherent light at a variety of wavelengths from a mass-producible component has the potential to truly revolutionize laser technology in multiple areas. In conjunction with nonlinear frequency conversion techniques ultra-low cost RBB sources can be constructed, promoting cost competitive laser display technologies for mass markets. In conjunction with fiber amplification, laser marking and machining application traditionally covered by Nd:YAG lasers will be targeted.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The miniaturization achievable with the unique synthesis of diode laser, solid-state laser and fiber laser technology is ideal for any air born applications. The elimination of organic materials in the construction of the proposed laser is further ideal for space born systems. Basic fiber amplified Q-switched micro-chip lasers can be used in planetary surface topography as well as general altimetry. Fiber amplified single-frequency Q-switched micro-chip lasers are further compatible with cloud and aerosol mapping. Frequency-shifted systems can further be deployed in wind laser transmitters.

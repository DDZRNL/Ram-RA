<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose the development of an innovative software tool that will permit developers with little or no human factors training to produce user interfaces that are well suited to the end-users and their needs, as well as to the situation in which the software will be used. Developing such a tool represents a significant challenge; thus, we suggest an integrated approach drawing upon a broad range of AI techniques. An intelligent, visually-based knowledge elicitor based on decision-centered design will guide the developer through the task capture and analysis process. The resulting task model and a battery of intelligent design advisors, assisting in everything from modality selection to graphical element distribution, will allow the system to collaborate with the developer in constructing a user-centric interface. To leverage the results of usability testing, the system will be able to automatically modify and expand this set of advisors, insuring a consistent and highly usable interface. The combination of human factors and interface design expertise supplied by Klein Associates Inc., and SHAI's Artificial Intelligence expertise will guarantee the success of this project. We will absolutely demonstrate the feasibility of our ideas through the development of a Phase I system prototype.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed system can be marketed as a tool for interface development for small and medium-sized companies that cannot maintain an in-house human factors expert.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed system can be used to help produce the array of interfaces necessary for manned missions. It will insure that these interfaces are high-quality, intuitive, and user-centric.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Triton Systems, Inc. proposes to develop novel low melt flow viscosity, environmentally friendly high temperature polyimide resin that can address the need for low cost, lightweight, complex geometry composite manufacturing.  Triton has teamed with composite manufacturer and end users to assist in evaluation of its new RTM/VARTM high temperature polyimides.  The proposed program will develop resins with melt flow viscosity lower than 10 poise at greater than 280?C processing temperature.  High temperature RTM/VARTM resins would allow ?out-of-autoclave? manufacturing, which reduces manufacturing cost and allow for large, complex shape designs.  The new high temperature resin will be applicable to propulsion systems such as aircraft gas turbines, rocket and turbine engines, and auxiliary power in aircraft and space vehicles.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Triton has teamed with end users to evaluate the development of the new RTM/VARTM high temperature resins for compatibility with their current composite manufacturing.  This teaming arrangement will assist Triton to develop the resin within the manufacturer production specifications.  The potential commercial applications are aircraft jet engines, rocket and turbine engines, and auxiliary power in aircraft and space vehicles.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Development of new low melt flow viscosity (RTM/VARTM), environmentally friendly high temperature polyimide resins would allow ?out-of-autoclave? manufacturing of large structures such as large composite tanks for the next generation Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLVs).  Currently the size of the autoclave predicts the size of the components that can be fabricated, which is a limitation for development of the next RLVs.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
PSS proposes an integrated multi-range rendezvous control system written in our ObjectAgent distributed software architecture. The control system will use different algorithms at different ranges from the rendezvous target. Rendezvous maneuvers are achieved using a Lambert planner with genetic algorithm optimization for large orbit changes and using a Simplex planner with path constraints for maneuvers at close range to the target. Orbit determination is achieved using a continuous discrete Kalman filter which uses different sensors depending on their availability. For relative sensing, these are: radar for long range; vision for intermediate and close range; intersatellite-link (ISL) when available. For absolute sensing, these are GPS and ground ranging. The vision system, a single camera system developed by PSS or a selected existing system, will provide relative attitude in addition to relative position at intermediate range. PSS has the capability to perform high-fidelity simulations using MultiSatSim, allowing this project to move quickly into software testing. ObjectAgent is an inherently modular software architecture, allowing the resulting control system to be easily adapted, even on-orbit.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Autonomous rendezvous capability is required for satellite inspection and servicing. PSS has previously conducted economical analysis which indicates refueling satellites can be profitable in some cases. Additionally, elements of the rendezvous control system may be applied to more general problems in formation flying. An autonomous systems are key to keeping the costs of such complex systems in check. Commercial interest in these applications is widespread internationally judging from interest in PSS' new autonomous guidance, navigation and control toolbox module for MATLAB.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA spacecraft, being very valuable, are particularly suited to autnomous rendezvous applications. Expensive spacecraft such as Hubble could prolong their useful life with on-orbit refueling. Inspection capability can help diagnose problems with malfunctioning spacecraft. In general, autonomous maneuver planning such as used in PSS' rendezvous control system saves money by reducing operations costs.

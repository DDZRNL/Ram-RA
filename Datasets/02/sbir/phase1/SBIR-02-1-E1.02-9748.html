<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The purpose of this Phase I program is to demonstrate the feasibility of a compact, frequency tripled Nd:Y2O3 laser system to generate 305nm and 315nm for global tropospheric ozone sensing from space.  Because Nd:Y2O3 can generate output on both the 915 nm transition and the 947 nm transition, the desired ozone UV DIAL wavelengths of 305 nm and 315 nm can be generated using a SINGLE laser device that incorporates 3rd harmonic conversion.  The current laser transmitter for UV DIAL monitoring of ozone from satellite platforms is relatively large and requires 2 DPSS laser sources in addition to 5 non-linear conversion steps, whereas the Nd:Y2O3 based system may require as few as 1 DPSS laser source and 2 non-linear conversion steps. The minimal component count, small size and weight, and reduced power requirement makes a DIAL laser transmitter based on Nd:Y2O3 a very attractive choice for space based remote sensing.  The proposed technology would allow NASA to continue to make rapid and dramatic technological progress in global ozone mapping.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Aculight has a strong commitment to commercialize the 900 nm laser source proposed here as the "laser engine" for several emerging commercial markets.  Commercial applications for ultraviolet versions of the laser proposed in this work include; UV sources for memory repair and UV Resonance Raman spectroscopy,  remote detection of explosives (i.e. TNT), production of Fiber Bragg Gratings for Telecom and fiber sensors,  as well as compact sources for stereolithography (rapid prototyping).

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In addition to NASA's need for a compact and low-cost UV laser transmitter for ozone sensing, various harmonics of the basic infrared laser can be used for remote sensing of water vapor, aerosols in the atmosphere using Lidar or DIAL, detection and monitoring of NO & NO2, and space-based UV Raman Spectroscopy instruments.  Aculight will continue to develop diode-pumped solid-state laser technology for NASA's future remote sensing needs.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Starfire systems proposes a pre-ceramic polymer based interface coating for CMC applications. Starfire Systems specializes in the development and manufacture of SiC and SiOC based pre-ceramic polymer chemistry and will leverage its? developments related to ceramic forming polymers used for coating oxide filter structures with thin SiC coatings and apply these coatings to ceramic fibers for applications in CMC?s.    Typically the fiber and the interface coatings account for over 70% of the cost of a high temperature CMC composites.  Through the use of this simple dip coating process, the cost of the interface coating will be reduced by an order of magnitude and this may also enable the use of lower cost ceramic fibers as a second level of cost reduction.    Cost advantages aside, the pre-ceramic polymer coating will also result in enhanced CMC performance and oxidation stability.   The liquid pre-ceramic polymer based coating method is suitable for coating fibers, fabrics, or performs.  The interface coating thickness can be varied from 5 microns thick down to sub-micron thicknesses.   Preliminary work has demonstrated coatings that are smooth and continuous. This research will be aimed at optimizing the coatings for oxidation protection and composite toughening on ceramic fibers.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Low cost, oxidation resistant fiber interface coatings will enable ceramic composites to be utilized in a wide range of applications where they are currently considered to costly, such as radiant burners, hot exhaust sections on aircraft and motor vehicles, power generation equipment such as gas turbines and even diesel engines (as the exhaust filter, in exhaust system components and the engine itself).  The polymer-derived fiber coating process will also permit any of the composite fabricators to coat their own performs.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Key NASA applications are expected to include virtually all CMC applications such as thermal protection systems, turbo-pumps, cryotanks, nozzles, thrusters, and even space structures that would take advantage of the light weight and low thermal expansion properties of CMCs.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The development of portable systems for use in a zero gravity environment provides both NASA and astronauts with improved response in life-threatening crisis or prevention and/or ongoing treatment of a disorder.  Portable systems for astronauts include a large range of devices including biosensors and drug administration devices.  Current methods for administration of therapeutic molecules to treat illness or injuries to an astronaut while in space include the use of hypodermic needles and oral ingestion.  Thus there is a great need to develop a therapeutic molecule delivery system that is non-invasive, painless, and accurate (within ?10%).  In this project, we will develop a non-invasive, painless, transdermal therapeutic molecule delivery device.  The device will uniquely combine microencapsulation of molecules and iontophoresis into a wearable system.  The Phase I research will demonstrate the feasibility of iontophoretic transfer of microencapsulated drugs through a model skin sample using a microfluidic system.  In Phase II, a pharmacological study of the release rate of the therapeutic molecules from microencapsulation will allow for further optimization of the microfluidic system to produce the complete delivery device.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
As a result of Congress passing the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act in 2000, there has been a high need to develop a non-invasive drug delivery system to replace currently used hypodermic needles.  Our transdermal delivery device can be used by healthcare workers in hospitals or by patients at home to administer needed medications.  This device could help drive down the high cost of healthcare (currently $1.5 trillion in the U.S.) by eliminating costs associated with treatment of accidental needlesticks.  In the future the delivery device could be linked to a non-invasive monitoring device to create a closed-loop system.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The transdermal drug delivery system will provide NASA with a device for administering accurate doses of medication to astronauts while in space that is both non-invasive and painless.  This wearable device will allow astronauts to continue their duties while receiving the needed medications to prevent or treat a disorder.  The device is also beneficial to NASA by providing a lightweight wearable device that is battery powered and requires minimum training to use.  In the future the delivery device could be linked to a non-invasive monitoring device to create a closed-loop system.

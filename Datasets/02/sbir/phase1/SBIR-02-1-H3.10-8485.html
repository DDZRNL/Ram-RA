<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Polymeric photovoltaic devices are attractive for NASA?s space and terrestrial applications because of their light weight and low production cost.  However, current devices suffer from instability and short lifetimes.  The stability and lifetime of polymeric photovoltaic devices can be extended by increasing the charge mobility through the conjugated polymer.  This increase in mobility reduces the opportunity for device degradation through trapped charges.  Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) proposes to increase the charge mobility by developing a three-component blend of conjugated polymers and fullerenes which will simultaneously increase the efficiency and stability of the device by increasing the hole mobility of the composite.  The photovoltaic devices constructed with the polymer are predicted to have a tenfold increase in stability compared to devices fabricated with a blend of a single conjugated polymer and fullerenes.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed approach to increasing the stability of conjugated polymer photovoltaic devices will greatly improve the feasibility of these devices for use in NASA space missions as well as in the private sector.  Potential non-military applications include photovoltaic appliques for tents, backpacks and large outdoor shelters.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
By increasing the stability and efficiency of lightweight polymeric photovoltaic devices, NASA will be able to utilize them for applications such as satellites, space suits, and rovers.  The potential specific power of > 1000 W/kg will allow much greater feasibility for the use of conjugated polymers in photovoltaic devices.

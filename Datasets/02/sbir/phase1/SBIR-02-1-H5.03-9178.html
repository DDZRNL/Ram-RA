<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Small Business Innovation Research project proposes to utilize the emerging technology of Photonic Crystals to realize novel optical components. These devices will help pave the road towards commercially viable, high speed, large bandwidth, and miniature all-optical circuits. In particular, the Phase I portion of this project will focus on development of devices based on the ultrarefractive effect in photonic crystals. One such device is an Ultracompact Wavelength Spectrometer. The ultrarefractive effect in photonic crystals enables this and other devices by producing angular deflection of optical beams that is both extremely large in magnitude and also a very strong function of the input wavelength, as compared to standard materials. The expected result of this work is that IFOS will offer some of the first commercially-viable photonic-crystal-based components and modules. Collaboration with leaders in this field at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, will help IFOS accomplish the objectives of this project.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The developments of this proposal will result in commercial availability of novel products based on photonic crystal technology, such as an ultracompact wavelength spectrometer. This product will find applications throughout the field of optical sensing. In addition, this effort will establish the photonic crystal technology itself as commercially viable and thus open the door for additional photonic crystal devices, such as high-performance miniature optical circuits, to be developed during Phase II of the project. Commercial applications of this technology include high-speed telecommunications and optical data processing.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Fiber sensor networks are robust, and can survive extremely hostile environments such as those found in aerospace applications. Despite the small size of optical fiber, it has demonstrated excellent mechanical durability and corrosion resistance. Unlike conventional electronic-based technology, optical fibers are extremely secure from outside interference. Additionally, the small size and low weight of the proposed wavelength detector, and optical sensors and photonic crystal devices in general, are ideal for aerospace applications, as they exhibit minimal impact on the vehicle payload. This allows for the possibility of in-flight monitoring systems with negligible vehicle performance degradation.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Using existing technology, high-accuracy precision 2-axis fine-steering mirror (FSM) applications are limited to position sensors with 0.4 to 1.0 urad resolution.  A number of applications, such as JPL?s optical communication programs require 0.1 urad resolution.  
<br>Three recently developed commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors have inherently better resolution, but have not been proven in FSM applications and are not qualified for space flight.  
<br>In most cases these devices are sufficiently compact to be integrated with even the smallest FSM with reasonable size increases.  
<br>The proposed innovation involves the use of one or more of these advanced sensors to achieve a factor of 2 to 5 improvement in resolution for space-based FSM applications.  
<br>The proposed innovation is an approach to integrate these recently developed advanced base-referenced position sensors into space-qualified FSM designs.  The significance for NASA involves achieving reduced cost and risk for high-accuracy JPL applications like
<br>high-rate inter-planetary optical data transmission and interferometry with improved resolution.  
<br>LHDC will complete integrated sensor FSM concept designs for the FO15-61, FO35-52 and FR150-35 FSM suitable for use in engineering model manufacturing and testing in Phase II along with estimates of manufacturing capability.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
	Solar sails that have the inherent stiffness to greatly reduce or eliminate the need for tensioning while retaining low areal densities and compact stowage offer enabling capability for multiple missions in the Sun-Earth Connection Space Science theme.  Polyimide film materials that are resistant to the space environment will be used to demonstrate and quantify the effectiveness of novel structural design and manufacturing approaches to produce scalable solar sails with areal densities below 15 g/m2.  The benefits of this scalable technology to different sail designs including square riggers, heliogyros, and disks will be analyzed and quantified in terms of mass reduction and performance improvement.  Alternate polyimide materials with higher surface smoothness and lower coefficients of thermal expansion will be evaluated using the new design and manufacturing approaches.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
	Commercial space applications include support structures for solar concentrators used in solar thermal propulsion systems and large communication satellite antennas.  Ground commercial applications include emergency shelters in extreme environments and lightweight articles exposed to long-term weathering conditions.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
	This membrane structures technology has propulsion applications in NASA near-earth and Mars-class missions.  It can also be applied to support structures in high resolution earth science platforms, large light collectors for precision secondary optics, and solar concentrators for electric propulsion systems.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
MPT proposes to construct a simple electron beam analyzer specifically for measuring the angular dispersion of the emitted electrons.  With this information in hand we will then make the required adjustments in our simulation software to set the initial conditions for electrons emitted for CNT cathodes.  We will then use computers to investigate candidate electrode configurations for electron guns and x-ray tubes that will provide convergent beams that can be focused to a fine spot. A model will be built to validate the computer simulations.  We intend to continue this work into Phase II  to develop a miniature X-ray tube operating at 40kV to 60kV with  2 Watts or more of beam power that is focused to produce a spot less than 20um in diameter. Microwave Power Technology has been researching cold cathodes and developing vacuum electron devices using carbon nanotube cathodes for 5 years. We have developed an X-ray tube that is currently being produced for hand held x-ray fluorescence spectrometer. Cold cathodes can be hard mounted to the structure of any vacuum electron device thereby reducing the part count and improving the robustness compared to devices using thermionic cathodes. Ruggedness, efficiency and projected long life make CNT powered vacuum electron devices ideal for space travel and employment in space and lunar based applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Development of the focused beam x-ray tube will immediately extend the utilization of CNT cathodes to X-ray diffraction instruments and imaging that require very small focal spot and higher intensity. The ability to focus the beam from a cold cathode will also be exploited to improve the efficiency of electron beam generators that are being increasingly used in industry. Current applications include drying ink on high speed presses, non-burning destruction of toxic and odoriferous hydrocarbons, sterilization of surfaces and radiation therapy in medicine.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Cold cathode X-ray tube provide the source for very small x-ray fluorescence and diffraction instruments that are suitable for hand held and portable applications on earth as well as space.  These instruments are well suited to withstand the rigors of space travel and mounting on small rovers.  . This work goes beyond the immediate exploitation for x-ray tubes and lays the foundation for employing CNT cathodes in vacuum electron devices that require focused electron beams. Future applications include other instruments using electrons as ionizers, microwave tubes for communication and electron beams for environmental control and space based manufacturing.

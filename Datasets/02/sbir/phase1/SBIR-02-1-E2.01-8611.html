<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Dynamic loads can cause big problems for satellites both during launch and during on-orbit operation.  The best solution for attenuating these dynamic loads is to incorporate vibration isolation either at the launch vehicle-to-satellite interface or at the satellite-to-component interface.  Conventional passive vibration isolation systems have been successfully flown at both of these interfaces.  It is believed, however, that much greater isolation performance is achievable with a new type of isolation system.  The innovation is to develop a passive vibration isolator that provides low-frequency axial isolation without the attendant low-frequency ?rocking? or lateral modes.  In other words, the ratio of axial stiffness to rocking stiffness would be very high compared to that of a conventional isolation system.  This is desirable because for whole-satellite isolation, very low rocking modes can cause guidance instabilities and for component isolation, the rocking modes can increase optical jitter.  This isolation technology will be of great use in future NASA Earth Science platforms because it will provide dynamically stable structures utilizing integral vibration control.  Earth-sensing instruments will perform better with significant reduction in jitter due to the non-rocking isolation systems.  Similarly, NASA satellites will be better protected from launch loads with lower frequency whole-satellite non-rocking isolation systems.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Passive non-rocking vibration isolation systems have many potential commercial applications.  These applications all have a common need for low-frequency axial vibration isolation systems that do not also produce low-frequency rocking modes.  Typical applications include sensitive equipment mounted on satellites such as telescopes, cameras, and other sensors whose scientific performance is very susceptible to jitter caused by dynamic loads.  Ground-based applications include isolation of optical equipment on semiconductor manufacturing machines, isolation of components on optical benches, isolation of sensors on medical imaging equipment, etc.  Launch isolation applications for this technology include enabling much lower frequency whole-satellite vibration isolation on small launch vehicles like Taurus and Minotaur, enabling whole-satellite vibration isolation on medium and large launch vehicles like EELV, Delta II, Atlas, etc., and enabling whole-satellite vibration isolation on Pegasus.  Virtually all equipment that requires axial isolation but is inhibited by low-frequency high-amplitude rocking motion will benefit from the new technology.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Passive non-rocking vibration isolation systems have many potential NASA applications.  Similar to the potential commercial applications, these all have a common need for low-frequency axial vibration isolation systems that do not also produce low-frequency rocking modes.  A primary NASA application of this technology is the large assortment of sensors to be deployed on future satellites for either Earth Science or other space missions.  Most of these sensors will greatly benefit from operating in a reduced-jitter environment enabled by the use of passive non-rocking vibration isolation systems.  NASA satellite missions that mount their sensors using this new isolation technology will produce better scientific data.  Another large application area for NASA is to mount the entire satellite to the launch vehicle using a passive non-rocking whole-satellite vibration isolation system.  This will protect the entire satellite from launch loads and add margin to ensure mission success.

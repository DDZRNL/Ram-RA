<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A Microwave Powered Solid Waste Stabilization (MPSWS) system is proposed as the primary step in the treatment of solid waste materials generated during extended manned space missions.  The proposed system will recover water initially contained within the wastes and stabilize the residue with respect to microbial growth. The dry waste may then be safely stored or passed on to the next solid waste treatment process. Using microwave power in a closed system, the MPSWS will selectively and rapidly heat the water present in solid wastes. Liquid phase water will flash to steam and superheat.  The steam will contact all exposed surfaces and provide an effective thermal kill of all microorganisms present, in a manner similar to that of an autoclave.  Both water and heat will be recovered in a condensing heat exchanger. Applicable solid wastes include, but are not limited to, inedible plant biomass, food scraps and fecal matter.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercialization opportunities exist within both governmental and private sectors. For the private sector, the primary commercialization opportunity will be in the areas of biohazard containment and elimination and environmental remediation. The proposed technology offers many attractive features which can be utilized for the safe mass reduction and stabilization by disinfection and dehydration of solid hazardous wastes. Two private sector opportunities are immediately apparent: [1] hardware for the stabilization and disinfection of hospital waste, and [2] hardware for the destruction of biohazardous materials generated during biological, pharmaceutical, and biomedical research.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary NASA application of the proposed technology will be as flight hardware required by NASA and its international partners to support future long duration manned missions in space, including Mars transit, Mars base, and lunar outpost missions.

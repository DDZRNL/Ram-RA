<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Soar Technology, Inc. proposes to develop a human-error modeling tool that can be used by designers and engineers early in the design process to identify likely causes of human error and engineer them out of the system. This tool will combine the strengths of an accurate high-fidelity model of human performance with a simple behavior description language for hierarchical task decomposition, and a usable developer interface. This tool will facilitate rapid modeling and analysis of interface candidates allowing a broader exploration of the design space and a deeper understanding of the design tradeoffs. This tool will result in lower development and operational costs for resulting designs, and safer, more effective, and more error-tolerant systems. Although some tools exist for analyzing designs for usability, and techniques exist for identifying human error, no tool or associated technique exists that is easy enough to be used by normal engineers on a regular basis. If successful, this work will represent a significant innovation in the areas of human-system interaction and error-tolerant design.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The tools proposed here could also support the development of new civilian command and control systems such as those used by government agencies such as the FAA, and FEMA and private sector organizations using industrial, manufacturing, and process control systems, medical information systems, transportation logistics and safety systems, and emergency response systems. The design of these systems shares with NASA applications complex domains and a high reliance on optimized human performance.
<br>
<br>Finally, there is a strong need for such tools in education. Every university that offers classes in human-computer interaction based on the ACM SIGCHI Curricula for Human Computer Interaction includes at least one course unit on quantitative evaluation methods. This unit is typically formed around a GOMS technique. Educators need the ability to teach the concepts and techniques of cognitive modeling and quantitative evaluation without wasting time conducting evaluations by hand. The more time saved doing tedious calculations, the more time that can be spent learning the fundamental concepts.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA's Strategic Plan 2000 describes a key NASA mission, to 'Maintain U.S. preeminence in aerospace research and technology' One goal of this mission, to 'Pioneer Technology Innovation,' specifically calls for NASA to develop 'virtual design processes' to 'enable air and spacecraft designers to know with a high degree of confidence that their revolutionary designs will be safe and will achieve their mission objectives before they begin the costly process of fabricating and testing prototypes'.  This tool is designed to answers that need by providing an early and automated human-system interaction evaluation system.
<br>
<br>This tool could support the development of safe and cost-effective aerospace command and control systems for robotic & human-robotic exploration, operation of launch vehicles and Earth-orbiting satellites, and the National Airspace System (NAS).

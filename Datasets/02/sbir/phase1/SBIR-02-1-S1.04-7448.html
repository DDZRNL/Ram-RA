<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The work proposed herein is the development of a Radiation Tolerant Processing node with built-in reconfigurable logic and standard interfaces.  
<br>
<br>Microelectronics for Nanosats require efficient architectures to make the best use of precious area, power, and mass allocations.  PicoDyne is currently developing a Radiation Tolerant FPGA for space use, and separately, microcontrollers and processors.  We propose combining the functions of a software-programmable processor with programmable hardware on a single chip.  The FPGA architecture we are implementing as a stand-alone chip will be scaled down to allow insertion onto this Reconfigurable Task Processor(RTP).  The same commercial design tools used for the larger device will be applicable here.
<br>
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This device is applicable to many consumer electronics, where microcontrollers and microprocessors control functionality.  This ranges from hand-held games and PDAs, to cell-phones, to microwave ovens.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Micro and Nanosat avionics, instruments, and communications circuitry.  This is also applicable to standard spacecraft electronics, where the same benefits of smaller size and increased functionality are desired.

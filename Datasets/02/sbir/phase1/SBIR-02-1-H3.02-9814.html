<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This program builds on prior R&D contracts of which some are completed and some are ongoing by Wilson Composite Technologies (WCT).  The principal support area will be from a contract entitled ?Long Term Storage of Liquid Hydrogen in Space?, which has a goal of 20 year storage with a 2% boil-off loss.  This program will build upon the results of that prior contract by utilizing foam insulation technology and blanket multiple layer insulation (MLI) techniques.  The program will design cryogenic tanks and pressurized containers for use both in the transport environment from Earth to Mars and also for location on the Mars surface as part of a permanent installation.  Design of a suitable cryocooler will be included in the container technology for conversion of cryogenic vapors back to liquids.  Detailed thermal analysis will be conducted to create optimum insulation.  Mounting systems and connections will be analyzed and designed for minimal thermal input to the storage containers and overall mission loads will be considered for structural design.  A complete matrix of tank sizes and shapes will be provided as a result of a thermal and design analysis.  This will enable future selection of final sizes for these transport and storage containers.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercial applications are also considered for non-NASA uses.  There are various commercial launch vehicles such as the Pegasus, Aquarius and Scorpius vehicles, which will require cryogenic tanks, both for launch and for application in earth orbit and for potential geo-synchronous orbital use.  Government programs, such as the near term Airborne Laser project, the potential Space Based Laser project, the IHPRPT advanced liquid propulsion system and the Air Force Space Initiative and future launch vehicle programs will all require long term storage of cryogens.  The more basic commercial applications will apply to cryogenic and corrosive chemical transport and storage.  Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) requires storage and transport from LNG tankers.  Food transport with flash freezing and long haul containers has also initiated the use of cryogenic cooling with consequent storage and dispensing systems.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA commercial applications are considered to relate to anything other than a military application.  This will involve two series of programs.  The first is the NASA commercial applications for future requirements of interplanetary missions, comet fly-bys, and international space station requirements.  The matrix of applications for both size and shape of cryogenic containers will be important for these NASA missions.  The NASA program entitled Human Exploration and Development of Space will be an obvious future application for this technology.  Plans for replacement of the existing space shuttle vehicle with a new design of reusable launch vehicle (RLV) will also include this technology.  As the International Space Station expands and its space life and mission expand, long-term storage will become a requirement.

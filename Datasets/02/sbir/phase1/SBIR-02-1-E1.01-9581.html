<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
MetroLaser proposes to design and develop an innovative ultra-narrow tunable optical bandpass filter (UNTOBF) based on the properties of a dielectric photonic crystal structure with a resonant cavity. Such a structure can exhibit an ultra-narrow high-transmission band in the middle of a wide low-transmission stop-band. During Phase I, we will demonstrate experimentally the proof-of-concept for an UNTOBF with sub-angstrom bandpass and a tuning range of at least 2 nm in both visible and infrared (IR) regions. We will also develop a complete model of the functional characteristics, based on specific features of photonic crystal structures with a resonant cavity, and develop a strategy for building a prototype of the instrument. Fine-tuning of the filter will be accomplished by varying the optical cavity length. The proposed filter is expected to have an acceptance angle of at least 1? and an aperture of about 2 inches. During Phase II the compact UNBTOF prototype module will be demonstrated with an expected tunability range of 10 nm and a bandpass range of 0.01 nm. A compact, low-weight, single-assembly design of the filter will allow it to be retrofitted to existing instruments and provide a stable performance in harsh operating environments.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed ultra-narrow tunable optical bandpass filter will find commercial applications in space-based and airborne multi-spectral imaging and remote sensing systems including LIDAR stations and meteorological instruments. It will expand capabilities for high accuracy spectral measurements within the tunable narrow spectral regions necessary for resolving individual spectral features. Due to its high spectral resolution, wide tunability range, compactness, ruggedness and stability, the proposed filter will allow for innovative solutions in high-resolution spectroscopic instrumentation, especially when portable devices are of interest.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed ultra-narrow tunable optical bandpass filter will expand the capabilities of NASA?s Earth Science Enterprise for high spectral resolution and high accuracy measurements of atmospheric and surface parameters from space and airborne platforms. These include measurements of biological productivity of land and ocean, measurements of climate and meteorological parameters, and terrain mapping.

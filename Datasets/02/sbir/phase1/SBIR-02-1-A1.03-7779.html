<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This SBIR describes diagnostic and reasoning approaches that are applicable in a wide set of domains, specifically the design and development of Embedded Dual-Function Arc Fault Circuit Breaker/ Locator based on Open Systems Architecture for Aircraft Wiring Systems.  An Embedded Locator And Breaker (ELaB) will be designed that will not only identify arc faults before they occur, but also provide a precise location of potential causes, such as insulation damages, that could lead to an arc.  The ELaB will be a self-contained, portable test set based on open systems architecture, thus allowing state-of-the-art technologies such as Reflectometry Techniques to be integrated with existing Arc Fault Circuit Breakers (AFCB).  Each ELaB will be based on VLSI/MEMS technology and will incorporate several systems on a microchip: a wiring testing and fault location system based on RF reflectometry techniques, a dynamic on-line wire failure analysis and diagnosis system based on Artificial Neural Network combined with signal processing techniques, and a switching system that automates the testing process for large bundles of multiple wires.  Electromechanical adaptability of existing systems will allow on-board data transfer capabilities from wires under test to an on-board Automated Test System (ATS).

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
WPI?s proposed Embedded Dual-Function Arc Fault Circuit Breaker/ Locator based on Open Systems Architecture for Aircraft Wiring Systems will further efforts to extend the life of aging aircraft as well as reduce maintenance related costs by using Embedded Locator and Breaker (ELaB) to locate arcing conditions and determine insulation degradation within electrical wiring. ELaB will also improve safety by identifying and preventing arcing conditions before a fire can occur. Significant commercial applications exist outside of the aerospace industry including ships, vehicles, manufacturing equipment, and electrical equipment where arcing can cause fire and loss of life.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
WPI?s proposed Embedded Dual-Function Arc Fault Circuit Breaker/ Locator based on Open Systems Architecture for Aircraft Wiring Systems will further efforts to extend the life of aging aircraft as well as reduce maintenance related costs by using Embedded Locator and Breaker (ELaB) to locate arcing conditions and determine insulation degradation within electrical wiring. ELaB will improve maintenance efficiency and reduce maintenance costs by reducing the amount of maintenance time spent inspecting wire for microscopic cracks that could lead to arcing. For NASA, ELaB will also improve crewmember safety by identifying and preventing arcing conditions before a fire can occur and enhance operational readiness.

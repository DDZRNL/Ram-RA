<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Next generation of high performance networks supporting reconfigurable computing, paralellel/cluster computing, optical computing as well as the Next Generation Internet (NGI) will require significant upgrades in data transport capacity, reconfigurability and survivability
<br>Responding to NASA?s increasing need for high performance computing and networking, IFOS proposes developing a novel high performance optical network using IFOS?s innovative Intelligent and Dynamic Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer (ID-OADM). The ID-OADM combines the features of the tunable OADM with intelligent operational algorithm to minimize the ?tunability service disruption? while selecting a specified wavelength. This feature can significantly reduce the cost of deploying and operating future generations of NGI optical networks with ring topology. This approach facilitates the rapid reconfiguration of networks without the need for restructuring the network protocols or topologies. 
<br>The main goal of this Phase I project is to fabricate and demonstrated a prototype of a programmable ID-OADM using tunable BG filter based on magnetostrictive materials. For the features and performance evaluation of this prototype, a demonstrative optical ring network will be used.
<br>In Phase II the results of Phase I will be extended towards commercialization. For this purpose, a production grade ID-OADM will be fabricated and its applications and performance in larger networks will be demonstrated.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Low-cost, high volume production of advanced photonic components and systems is of vital importance if the US is to achieve the proliferation of Fiber-To-The-Home or Desk (FTTH or FTTD), as well as potentially distance-independent terabits-per-second (Tbps) global interconnectivity, without relying on foreign suppliers for optoelectronic components. 
<br>	
<br>IFOS is committed and well positioned to actively promote and support the commercialization of any products developed under this project. The company is dedicated to bringing products from conception into the market. Our plan is to carry products through four key stages: engineering prototype, manufacturing prototype, pilot line and mass production. In addition to government projects, IFOS is collaborating in the private sector to support current commercialization and future product development through joint ventures and licensing agreements.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed intelligent dynamic optical network technology can have numerous applications in NASA?s future advanced high speed reliable and survivable optical communication and sensor networks, future Advanced Computing Technology (ACT) including high performance computing with reconfigurable architectures and optical parallel/cluster computing. Communications systems and sensors wide area networks supporting highly survivable data transport systems. The NASA/Langley Research Center could employ the IFOS solution to handle the bandwidth-intensive communications problems. Furthermore, the success of this project will lay a solid foundation and sets the stage for development of advanced intelligent optical technologies, guaranteeing the success of NASA?s Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) in its important mission and national priorities. .

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
        For long duration exploratory space missions, reclamation of water for potable and hygiene uses from waste water is of vital importance.  Approximatesly 230 kg of waste water are generated from four person crew during course of normal daily activities.  Physicochemical methods presently in place (e.g. phase change and/or membrane processes) reduce total organic carbon (TOC) to 30-300 mg/liter.
<br>	Compact Membrane Systems (CMS) will introduce a novel passive membrane polishing system to remove most of remaining TOC.  In Phase I, CMS will first fabricate this innovative polishing system for laboratory use and demonstrate removal of typical organics (e.g. ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol) from 5000 mg/liter to 500 mg/liter.  CMS will also develop key basic data associated with membrane transport, system design, and energy consumption to provide key economic evaluation for Phase II optimization.  With no moving parts and projected enhanced performance compared to existing systems, CMS system should provide significant value for waste water clean-up.
<br>	CMS has large commercial partners in other membrane applications.  Once CMS demonstrated feasibility in Phase I we are well positioned to work with these partners in Phase II in subsequent NASA and non-NASA commercial areas.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
     This novel technology has broad dual use capability.  In addition to removing trace organic compounds, it has the ability to biological growth (e.g. E-coli) and biological by-products (e.g. pyrogens).  Therefore, this technique can be used to remove pyrogens and related materials for water for injection.  It can also be used for oxidizing materials in ultrapure water in other applications including water used in semi-conductor applications.  Our close working relationship with two major membrane companies will assist our non-NASA commercialization once Phase I feasibility has been demonstrated.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
     Polishing of reclamation water and overall space shuttle disinfection are both of significant importance.  This program focuses on introducing passive systems for removing trace quantities of organics from reclamation water.  While this program is focused on water reclamation, the technology has broad potential and should also be of value (beyond this Phase I program) for air revitalization for removing trace gas contaminants.

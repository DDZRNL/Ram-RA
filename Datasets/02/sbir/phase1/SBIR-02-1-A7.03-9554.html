<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Nielsen Engineering & Research (NEAR) is proposing to develop a robust, nonintrusive aerodynamic shear stress sensor for use in aircraft flight testing.  This sensor is based on technology developed by NEAR under a previous SBIR contract.  In the proposed Phase I contract, NEAR will take this established sensor concept and refine it to create an instrument which can withstand the rigors of the flight test environment.  Numerical simulations, analysis, and laboratory experiments will be used to 1) advance the design of the transducers and electronics to permit accurate shear stress measurements up to 100 Pascals, 2) improve the correlation algorithm to account for large variations in speed of sound, density, and viscosity, and 3) environmentally harden the sensor to withstand the temperature, pressure, and atmospheric conditions encountered in flight.  The resulting Phase I sensor design will be evaluated through environmental and wind tunnel testing.  Results from this research effort will be used to develop a second generation prototype in the Phase II contract.  Wind tunnel results from this second prototype will then be used to further refine the design and to generate the final sensor which ultimately will be flight-tested towards the end of the Phase II effort.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are many commercial applications for a robust, accurate, nonintrusive, flight-ready shear stress sensor.  The U.S. Army is interested in NEAR's sensor for use in detecting the onset of dynamic stall on helicopter rotor blades.  Commercial interest and a pledge of financial support for this proposed contract have been received from Goodrich Sensor Systems.  Their objective is to develop shear stress sensor-based products for transport aircraft including stall warning sensors and ice/contamination sensors.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The present proposal defines the tasks necessary to develop NEAR's shear stress technology into a flight test research instrument.  The ability to generate real-time shear stress measurements accurately and reliably over a wide range of flight speeds and ambient conditions will help researchers at Dryden FRC to evaluate and expand the flight envelope of modern aircraft.  Researchers at NASA Langley have also expressed interest in NEAR's technology for use as a wind tunnel instrument, and for incorporation into closed-loop flow control systems.

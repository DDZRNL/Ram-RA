<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
DMI has produced functionally-graded nanostructured diamond materials that are able to machine lightweight silicon carbide optics with high precision and with minimal wear of the cutting edge. The goal of this project is to increase the tool life of a diamond cutter and to develop a technique for ultra-smooth polishing of the cutting edge as well as ultra-smooth machining of curved silicon carbide mirrors. It will enable the optics industry to enhance the performance of large size telescopes and interferometers.  In Phase I, we will design a special diamond cutting tool for silicon carbide, manufacture samples of such cutters, and conduct research on mirror machining. In Phase II, ultra-smooth diamond tooling and fabrication techniques will be developed.  In Phase III, we will machine ultra-smooth silicon carbide mirrors and other lightweight parts by DMI-developed diamond tools according to NASA?s needs.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Developed ultra-smooth diamond tooling and silicon carbide mirror techniques will also benefit the machining of other optical materials and increase the performance of optical devices.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The developed fabrication techniques for diamond cutters and for optical parts machining will enable industry to increase optical performance, structural performance of large space telescope and interferometers and discover new details about the Universe.

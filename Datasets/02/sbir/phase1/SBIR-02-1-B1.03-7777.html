<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Currently, no method exists for continuously, noninvasively monitoring flow in the vascular and other biofluidic systems.  To facilitate the study of short- and long-term effects of gravity on biofluidic systems, ISSYS proposes to develop an innovative technology for direct, chronic measurement of flow in the vascular system.  The proposed effort will ultimately develop a stent-based, telemetric, implantable flow monitor.  Once implanted, flow data may be read noninvasively through magnetic telemetry, using a compact readout unit.  This system will take advantage of state-of-the-art Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) technology to develop a highly stable device for real-time, noninvasive collection of flow data.  The core technology will be based on a high-sensitivity capacitive MEMS pressure sensor developed by ISSYS.  The system will be fully spaceworthy, itself being immune to the effects of both microgravity and hypergravity as well as shock and vibration.  Once the wireless, batteryless, stent-based flow sensor is delivered by catheter, flow data may be taken continuously by means of noninvasive magnetic telemetry.  Phase I for this project will demonstrate the feasibility of calculating flow rates from measured pressure gradients, after which a subsequent Phase II effort would develop the complete implantable monitor and associated readout technology.

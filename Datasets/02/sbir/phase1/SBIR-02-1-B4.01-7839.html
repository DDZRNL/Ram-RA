<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Operations on the International Space Station (ISS) currently require 24/7 support from Ground Operations personnel due to the relatively new establishment of that facility on orbit.  As ISS activities become commonplace, the need for continuous monitoring by Ground Operations will wane.  Automated and teleoperated systems as well as ISS crew experience will allow the Flight Controllers to leave their consoles for extended periods.  The expertise of those persons will still be required but on an on-call basis.  Wireless hand-held devices tied into the Mission Control Center?s live voice, video, and data systems can be used by the Flight Controllers to remotely access their consoles when the need arises.  With such devices, these experts can be tied-in at a moments notice to handle both routine and emergency issues.  Wireless transmissions can easily be intercepted so media encryption must be integrated into the devices.  Commercial wireless hand-held implementations exist that can handle streaming audio, video, and data but not in real-time, not at the same time, and not in a secure manner.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There is a huge non-NASA market for a wireless hand-held device capable of receiving live, encrypted audio, video, and data.  Military officers on the battlefield can transmit field conditions and receive orders from a commander behind the lines.  Business persons can extend a virtual presence at meetings they can not attend personally.  Medical professionals can check on patients or be tied into the patient room in an emergency.  Spectators at sporting events can use the device to hear announcer commentary, see close-ups of players and instant replays, and monitor player stats.  This market is only in its infancy and there are no clear leaders.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Initial applications will be directed at NASA and primarily ISS.  Distributed Ground Operations is the focus of this SBIR but the principles and technologies developed can be extended to other ISS operations.  Devices can be marketed to Principle Investigators (PI) and Remote Principle Investigators (RPI) to allow them to remain tied into their mission/experiment while away from their control center.  As emergencies arise, they can use the devices to quickly diagnose and correct the problem.  The innovative technologies discovered through this SBIR can be applied to other NASA non-ISS applications.  Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), Glenn Research Center (GRC), Johnson Space Center (JSC), Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), and others each have some form of Mission Control Center that can be distributed wirelessly in the same manner.

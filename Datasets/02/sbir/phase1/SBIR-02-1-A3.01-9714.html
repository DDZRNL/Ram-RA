<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal describes the adaptation of an aircraft based runway incursion advisory and alerting system for general aviation applications.  PathProx is a runway incursion advisory and alerting system developed by Rannoch Corporation for air carrier operations.  The work proposed under Phase I of this SBIR includes the definition of the developmental needs for adapting the PathProx conflict detection and alerting collision avoidance algorithms to General Aviation (GA) operations.  Systems currently being deployed by the FAA are based on a ground infrastructure where runway incursion conflict alerts generated by the system are provided to ATC.  Under this operational scenario the pilot is not provided with conflict alert information in the cockpit, leaving the aircraft dependent on the ground ATC infrastructure and human response. A General Aviation runway incursion advisory and alerting system will provide the following safety benefits:
<br>
<br>?	Reduction in the likelihood of near collisions resulting from runway incursions.
<br>?	Improved pilot response in taking evasive actions following incursions.
<br>?	Provision of runway incursion alerting at airports not equipped with surface surveillance systems
<br>?	Provision of runway incursion alerting at uncontrolled (non-towered) airports
<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The result of the Phase I research proposal here would be the definition of the approach to adapting the Rannoch PathProx runway incursion alerting algorithms to General Aviation operations.  During Phase II the development would proceed, which would result in the system being available commercially.  The intended market is all General Aviation aircraft that are equipped with the Global Positioning System and a minimal map display.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The availability of PathProx runway incursion alerting algorithms for General Aviation would enhance the development of Small Aircraft Transportation Systems (SATS).  Specifically, it would enhance pilot situational awareness and provide improved aircraft safety in a cost-effective manner.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We plan to use Laser Chemical Etching (LCE, or also called Laser Microchemical etching, LMC), a "direct etch process" capable of true high resolution 3-D etching with micron resolution, almost arbitrary depth, high aspect ration, and extremely smooth surface finish (less than 40nm RMS), to produce convex gratings for use in Offner spectrometers.  LMC is vastly superior to Excimer Laser Micromachining in essentially every aspect, from LMC's much higher control, uniformity of etch, and reproducibility to LCE's ultra-clean etching with only gaseous by-products (no debris).  It has a number of attributes that can make it a better choice than e-beam lithography if production is an issue.  We will demonstrate that LMC will allow the production of convex infrared gratings without the fabrication limitations of e-beam/optical lithography and without the limitations of ion milling, conventional etching, excimer laser micromachining, mechanical ruling, or conventional replication processes.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Laser Chemical Etching will allow the production of non-flat (e.g. convex), as well as flat, gratings without the limitations of e-beam /optical lithography and the limitations of ion milling, conventional etching, excimer laser micromachining, mechanical ruling, or conventional replication processes. In addition, since this is a high-throughput "direct write" technology, it can not only be used for more rapid production of gratings, it can produce unique prototypes equally quickly.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
All of the NASA imaging spectrometer projects can benefit (or could have benefied) from LMC made 3-D gratings, be they conventional, convex, or holographic. Examples are:
<br>AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer)
<br>AIS-2 (Airborne Imaging Spectrometer)
<br>HIRIS (High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer)
<br>MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer)
<br>SSTI HIS (Small Satellite Technology Initiative Hyperspectral Imager)
<br>VIMS-V (Visible Infrared Mapping Spectrometer)

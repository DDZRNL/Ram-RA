<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovation is new technology to enable the visualization of large unstructured geospatial datasets, such as LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) data, within a commercial desktop Geographic Information System (GIS).  The proposed architecture uses a high performance computing (HPC) platform to process the datasets and create visualization models, and then integrates 3D visualization into a GIS environment.  For this research, cluster computing (a collection of interconnected commodity PCs implementing parallel processing techniques) will serve as the ?back-end?, with visualization and GIS integration provided through an extension to the ArcGIS system.    
<br>  
<br>The significance of the innovation is that it would:	
<br>* Provide users new ability to visualize large datasets at their full resolution at varying scales;
<br>* Be implemented as a commercial GIS software extension, thus:
<br>  - leveraging geospatial data and geoprocessing techniques supported by GIS systems
<br>  - extending capability without requiring users to learn a new software interface;
<br>* Enable users to process the data faster and more efficiently, using real-time data browse within the GIS?s display window;
<br>* Incorporate the necessary computing power to process the large unstructured datasets for visualization (for now, through the use of cluster computing?future hardware improvements would provide additional high-performance computing platforms).

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are numerous applications of the proposed innovation for commercial organizations and non-NASA agencies.  Some of these applications include:
<br>* Weather Investigations: The 3D point cloud model often represents weather data.  This extension could greatly facilitate the modeling and predicting of weather phenomena.
<br>* Defense Applications:  This extension has great potential in the defense market.  Much research has been conducted regarding feature extraction and target identification of high-density data.  For example, DARPA is currently working on a project called Jigsaw, which is aimed at target verification and identification.  This extension could greatly advance that endeavor.  
<br>* Disaster Response:  This extension could be very useful for disaster response agencies like FEMA.  FEMA requires high-resolution terrain models and is very interested in LIDAR data.  This extension could enable FEMA to process the large dataset in a fast efficient manner. Fast processing is critical for effective response to natural disasters.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Some applications for the NASA organization include:
<br>* Planetary applications: This extension can be used to generate terrain from satellite-based LIDAR systems for Mars exploration.  The spatial analysis capabilities will enable NASA to accurately choose optimal landing sites or base stations.
<br>* Outreach: A variation of the proposed extension could be used in museums or classrooms as a way to teach non-technical personal about different types of remote sensing data and their uses.
<br>* Earth Science Applications: This extension could enhance the wide variety of Earth Science investigations conducted within NASA.

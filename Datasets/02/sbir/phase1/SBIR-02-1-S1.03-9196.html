<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In this project, MetroMEMS determines the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of an innovative, high performance inspection and calibration method for dynamic testing of microfabricated deformable mirrors. Deformable mirrors are a key component in most adaptive optics systems. They compensate for wavefront distortion introduced by the medium between the object and the image. Hence, precise inspection and calibration of deformable mirrors are required for optimal performance. This innovative approach utilizes an array of microfabricated position sensing grating interferometer (?PSGI) with electrostatically actuated flexible fingers. Each sensor is capable of measuring displacement with high resolution and bandwidth (MHz). A 4x4 array of ?PSGI will be fabricated to inspect a deformable reflective target (<=10 mm in diameter) at 500 kHz maximum sampling rate. The proposed technique is general and can be applied to inspect various types of microfabricated structures.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
For most MEMS, critical device dimensions (10-1000 mm ? 10%) fall between silicon IC (<10 mm ? 10 ?) and conventional machining (>1000 mm ? 10 mm). As a result most commercially available measurement solutions cannot be used for quality inspection of MEMS. The proposed technology converts a large-scale metrology system into a miniaturized scale using a patented technology. It can be customized to the inspection needs of MEMS manufacturers to reduce manufacturing costs, lead-time and waste of material, and to increase product reliability. Potential customers may include MEMS manufacturers such as Texas Instruments, Analog Devices, Hewlett Packard and Motorola.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA and its partners are developing the Next Generation of Space Telescopes (NGST) to reveal distant structures of the universe in similar details at infrared wavelengths. The small cryogenic Deformable Mirror (DM) is an enabling technology for NGST scientific objectives.  It allows eliminating the blurring of astronomical images due to turbulence in earth?s atmosphere. As a result ground base telescopes can create clear images as if they were in space. If successful, the proposed technique allows high speed deformation measurement/feedback, inspection, calibration and health monitoring of microfabricated deformable mirrors.

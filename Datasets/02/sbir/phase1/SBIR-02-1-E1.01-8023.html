<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Spectral detection and recognition employing optical filter is an important tool for NASA?s mission on studying atmospheric and surface parameters and analyzing/monitor global environment changes. It can acquire information of biology and biogeochemistry of ecosystems, global carbon cycle, global water and energy cycle, atmospheric chemistry, and natural hazards. It is particularly important that the optical filter should be narrow passband, high transmission, high out-of-band rejection, accurate tuning, large tuning range, relatively wide field of view, and large aperture. Developing extremely narrow bandwidth (sub-angstrom) tunable filters can improve measurement capability of ground-based or airborne/space-borne remote sensing systems and can benefit terrestrial and space based LIDAR for weather sensing. New Span Opto-Technology Inc. proposes herein a new all-optical controlled Fabry-Perot double-cavity filter. The cavity structure of the filter is specially designed to simultaneously achieve narrow bandpass and large free spectral range. Highly control-light sensitive photochromic material as tuning medium makes all-optical control tuning practical and attractive. Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed all-optical controlled double-cavity filter. Phase II will optimize the device design, fabrication, and result in a compact packaged tunable optical filter for NASA and commercial applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The successful development of Fabry-Perot double-cavity optically controlled narrow tunable bandpass filter will benefit military applications including terrestrial and space based LIDAR for space weather sensing, ground-based and airborne remote sensing, and target identification and tracing. Commercial applications include optical network communications, optical remote sensing for weather forecast, agriculture, and astronomy observation. The tunable bandpass filter can also be used to construct an imaging spectrometer for medical diagnostic applications.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In NASA?s Earth science measurement program, developing extremely narrow bandwidth (sub-angstrom) tunable filters for ground-based or airborne/spaceborne remote sensing systems is very significant for improvement of current measurement capability. The proposed double-cavity F-P filter when realized can benefit greatly to NASA applications, such as analyzing and monitoring global environment changes. It can acquire information of biology and biogeochemistry of ecosystems, global carbon cycle, global water and energy cycle, atmospheric chemistry, solid Earth and natural hazards.

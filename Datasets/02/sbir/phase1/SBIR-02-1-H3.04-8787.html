<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to demonstrate the feasibility of using a distributed fiber-optic sensor system to monitor high electrostatic voltages and surface electrical charge density on spacecraft components. Based on functional material jacketed FBG sensors and WDM technologies, the sensor system features noise immunity to electromagnetic interference, good electrical isolation, and is compact and lightweight. A unique multi-channel demodulation approach is proposed, which allows tens or hundreds of sensors to be integrated through an optical fiber and to share a single light source. This system will be particularly useful for detection/monitoring of hazardous electrostatic potentials and/or large surface charges on spacecraft surfaces. It also provides real-time multi-points measurement of surface charge, which could benefit scientific research in understanding surface charging in the plasma environment.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The distributed fiber-optic voltage sensing system will find great applications in military, industrial, and consumer sectors, such as aerospace and power transmission. The resultant WDM demodulation approach can be used in many similar multi-sensor monitoring systems, such as multi-point temperature and/or pressure monitoring for ships, trains or airplanes.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The technology developed in this program will provide secure, safe and multi-point monitoring of spacecraft surface charging. This will be of benefit to NASA? technologies on Electromagnetic Physics Measurements, Control, and Simulation.  It is particularly useful for NASA missions where there is relative high plasma density and ease of electrostatic charging and sparking.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
One of the primary factors inhibiting the practical use of next-generation electromagnetic electric propulsion (EP) engines at high power levels (50-100 kW) is the current lack of thermally and mechanically stable insulators. Insulator materials for high-power Hall thrusters can erode rapidly as a result of use in high power density plasma environments and/or fail as a result of mechanical or thermal shock. Boron nitride (BN), currently the material of choice for EP engines, is presently fabricated from pressed and sintered powder that is unreinforced and, in the sizes required for high-power engines, is highly susceptible to failure due to thermal and mechanical shock. In addition, powder-derived BN is very difficult to fabricate in complex, thin-section components, and scaleup of part size and the required mass remains a significant problem. Substantial improvements in these areas can potentially be achieved by fabrication of fiber-reinforced BN via chemical vapor infiltration (CVI). Composite ceramics produced by CVI exhibit higher density, smaller grain size, higher purity, and far greater strength and toughness than unreinforced ceramics produced from powder. In this project, Ultramet proposes to fabricate erosion-resistant, mechanically stable, carbon fiber-reinforced pyrolytic BN (Cf/PBN) insulators for use in Hall thrusters. CVI Cf/PBN composite performance will be demonstrated through testing in a plasma environment.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Improved high temperature insulating materials are directly applicable to commercial satellites. This EP technology improvement will lead to enhanced satellite capability via increased performance and lifetime and reduced system mass, which combine to greatly reduce mission cost. The automotive industry and engine manufacturers also have near-term applications for toughened ceramics in areas such as low heat rejection diesel engines. High temperature ceramic heating element performance will also be enhanced.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Spacecraft propulsion technology innovations are sought for upcoming deep space science missions. Propulsion system functions for these missions include primary propulsion, maneuvering, planetary injection, and planetary descent/ascent. Innovations are needed to reduce spacecraft propulsion system mass, volume, and/or cost. Applicable propulsion technologies include nuclear and solar electric propulsion. One area of emphasis pertains to high-performance propulsion systems capable of delivering specific impulse (Isp) greater than 6000 seconds, while utilizing 50 to 100 kilowatts or more of electrical power from a nuclear energy source. Another area applies to propulsion technologies capable of delivering Isp greater than 3500 seconds, using electrical power from radioisotope or solar energy sources. Significant improvements are sought in in spacecraft capability, longevity, mass, volume and/or cost.

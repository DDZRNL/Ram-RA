<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
To make deep travel possible new high-density power sources will need to be developed.  Of the hypothesized solutions for these missions, thin-film solar cells are among those showing the most promise for attaining the required specific power rating  (> 1000 W/kg) and efficiency (> 20 percent).  Recent research has focused on the use of polymeric substrates such as polyimides due to their low density and availability in thin layers.  However, due to the thermal limitations of these materials, the desired specific power ratings and efficiencies have not been attained.  In response to this limitation Foster-Miller proposes to develop a specifically tailored high-temperature, high-mechanical strength polymeric substrate that can provide the required radiation resistance, low temperature/low intensity, and high temperature/high intensity performance. The Foster-Miller innovation will provide a thin polymeric substrate with high temperature capabilities suitable for fabricating high efficiency solar cells that can survive the rigorous demands of a space environment.  Our proposed thin film solar cell will be lightweight and flexible, and be tailored to provide the UV irradiation and atomic oxygen (AO) resistance, and emissivity to operate in a space environment.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed Foster-Miller innovation will be applicable to a variety of NASA spacecraft including solar power satellites, microsats and nanosats.  Applications such as very large satellites and deep space craft will depend highly upon the availability of high-density lightweight power sources capable of surviving in a space environment.

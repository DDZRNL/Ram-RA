<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Feasibility testing of a novel high-throughput, tilt-compensated 
<br>interferometer design is proposed. The Phase I effort will 
<br>demonstrate a prototype and two manufacturing techniques 
<br>for lowering costs.  The novel optical design offers excellent 
<br>interferometric stability, inexpensive manufacture and permanent 
<br>alignment. The design is attractive for remote sensing from both 
<br>aircraft and spacecraft, as well as commercial application. There 
<br>is at least one mission in the hardware testing phase, which 
<br>this combination of optical stability and stiffness would have
<br>greatly benefited. The design has high throughput appropriate 
<br>for remote sensing, but would also have many industrial and 
<br>medical applications, particularly non-invasive measurement 
<br>of blood glucose levels and other human metabolites. Manning 
<br>Applied Technology has the expertise to enhance the performance 
<br>of the interferometer with powerful DSP hardware and software, 
<br>making it more attractive for commercial application.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This highly-stable interferometer for use in Fourier transform 
<br>spectrometry has widespread industrial, medical and military 
<br>applications. By far the most important application is 
<br>measurement of blood glucose and other human metabolites. 
<br>The market impact for medical applications is measured in 
<br>billions of dollars. Other applications include a range of process 
<br>control, spectral imaging, environmental and occupational health 
<br>monitoring, laboratoyr research, field measurements and remote 
<br>sensing. Conservative estimates indicate a $10 million per year 
<br>market for the technology. Cost-effectiveness insures capture of 
<br>a significant market share.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This interferometer has many desirable features for use in 
<br>remote sensing from satellite platforms, where it could 
<br>replace some current designs. NASA and its contractors 
<br>are currently solving problems of cryocooler vibrations 
<br>disturbing interferometer alignment. This interferometer 
<br>provides excellent resistance to vibration as well as high 
<br>interferometric stability.  It also has applications in air 
<br>quality monitoring for spacecraft, crew health monitoring 
<br>and laboratory research.

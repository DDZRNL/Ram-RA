<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In the last few decades our understanding of life has expanded considerably with major progress in the fields of biotechnology, molecular biology, and genetics. This has culminated in deciphering the human genome. Microarray technologies have now made it possible to identify and study the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously. Currently used microarray readers are predominantly fluorescence readers for their superior sensitivity. Alternative readers that are simpler, less expensive, compact, and portable are desired for space applications and various in situ applications. Intelligent Optical Systems proposes to develop a highly sensitive, lightweight, compact, microarray reader for gene expression analysis. This proposal explores the utilization of ellipsometry in conjunction with nanoparticle-based amplification for creating an imaging microarray reader. The feasibility of the principle will be demonstrated in Phase I with commercially available oligonucleotide microarrays. The sensitivity, spatial resolution, the ease-of-use of the reader will be tested and validated to fluorescence microarray based measurements.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed device is a basic research tool and has applications in the areas of toxicology screening, pharmacogenomics, drug discovery, antibody development and other applications.  One of the primary applications will be in the area of infectious diseases detection: bacterial tests, viral detection and viral load determination, viral and bacterial genotyping, and blood screening applications. The reader could also be used in cancer diagnosis.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A simple, sensitive, portable, lightweight, microarray reader for gene expression analysis is proposed. This device will have applications for NASA in both space and earth-based laboratories. Given the compact size, portable nature, and low power requirements, it is well suited for space-based applications. The device could be very useful as a clinical diagnostics tool for various ailments and could be used in space-based applications for monitoring the health of astronauts. In addition, it could be used in the examination of samples from other planets for markers of life and in monitoring the microbes that inhabit space stations to control contamination.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The energy density of Li-ion batteries can be enhanced by utilizing cathodes that have significantly higher energy density than that of state-of-the-art LiCoO2.  The proposed program focuses on developing novel nanocomposites with a theoretical energy density of ~ 800 Wh/kg, which is more than 60% higher than that of the practical energy density of LiCoO2.  Working in collaboration with a leading developer of Li-ion batteries in Phase I, we will demonstrate that it is possible to produce stable and high energy density nanocomposite cathodes.  These cathodes will lead to economical, high energy density and long cycle life rechargeable Li-ion polymer batteries at discharge rates acceptable in commercial Li-ion batteries.  As part of Phase I work, the electrochemical properties of these nanocomposite cathodes will be evaluated in Li test cells with a liquid electrolyte.   In Phase II, prototype batteries will be fabricated and tested for performance, along with the optimization and scaling of the powder synthesis process.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Secondary Li-ion polymer batteries are the system of choice for several consumer applications, such as portable consumer electronics, wireless communication devices and implantable medical devices.   Smaller and thinner cellular telephones and notebook computers, and emerging portable products such as, personal data assistants and palmtop computers, have created an immediate need for developing advanced rechargeable Li-ion batteries with high energy densities and longer run times. Because of their high current drain requirement, several implantable devices such as, ventricular assist devices (LVAD), implantable hearing assist devices, and some neurostimulators, need secondary batteries for use in both implantable and external battery systems.
<br>The broader impact of the proposed program will be the availability of economical, high energy density secondary Li-ion batteries for several consumer applications.  The cathode in Li-ion batteries is a very important constituent and accounts for a worldwide market of more than $250 million/year.  Consequently, an economical, high energy density cathode has a major role to play as Li-ion batteries evolve in year to come.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Rechargeable Li-ion batteries are being used in government furnished equipment (e.g., camera, laptop computers and camcorders) for space applications.  Additionally, Li-ion polymer batteries can potentially replace Ni-MH batteries, which are being used for several space applications, including supplement battery pack (called Areba rechargeable battery pack) to power astronaut?s accessories (e.g., wrist computer, glove heaters) during Extravehicular Activities (EVAs), and Avionic batteries (8 modules connected in parallel, each module ~ 28V) for the Crew Return Vehicle, X-38.  Furthermore, high voltage and energy Li-ion batteries (270V, 200 Ah) can also be used to power the pump for the hydraulic system in a space shuttle.  Presently, a hydrogen turbine is used to power the pump; however, it has a major safety issue, and a Li-ion polymer is a potential replacement.

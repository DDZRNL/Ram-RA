<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovative solar array is based on combining two cutting edge technologies, the SquareRigger solar array structure and the Stretched Lens Array (SLA), to produce an extremely lightweight, high efficiency, high power, high voltage and low stowed volume solar array suitable for very high power applications.  This solar array uses SquareRigger, which is believed to be the best-demonstrated structural approach for deploying extremely large photovoltaic blankets in terms of low mass, low stowed volume and high stiffness and the SLA Fresnel concentrator, which is believed to be the best demonstrated photovoltaic system, in terms of the desirable combination of low cost, high efficiency (30%), ultra-low mass (>500 W/kg blanket) and high voltage (>1000V).  The proposed concentrator elements are highly optimized versions of the extremely successful Deep Space 1 SCARLET solar array components.   During the first phase of the SBIR preliminary design and analysis (structure, power and mass) of the solar array system will be performed and reported and a mechanically functional mock-up of the dual-deck SLA photovoltaic blanket will be fabricated.  It is envisioned that a full size (5m x 2.5m) SLA SquareRigger array will be built and tested for mass power and structural properties during phase 2.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
SLA SquareRigger is potentially applicable to all earth-orbiting commercial high power satellites providing the benefits of reduced cost and mass.  The projected near term doubling of power of high power GEO communication satellites from the current range of 15 kW to over 30kW provides a very likely application.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The innovative SLA SquareRigger solar array developed in this program will potentially enable numerous future NASA and DOD missions requiring the critical combination of high power, low cost, low mass, high efficiency (minimal deployed area), high voltage and compact stowage for launch.  Specific NASA applications for SLA SquareRigger are broad and include Space Solar Power (SSP), deep space probes, Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) tugs, earth orbiting science satellites and high radiation missions.

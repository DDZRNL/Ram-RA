<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Human control and interaction with synthetic agents and environments has tremendous potential application in intelligent tutoring, performance analysis, human factors analysis, and distributed training.  To date, this application has been limited by the cost of creating and maintaining simulations.  Vcom3D has developed Authoring Tools and a Web-enabled Simulation Engine that allow subject matter experts to efficiently and economically create training simulations that embed realistic, communicating ?virtual humans? in Advanced Distrbuted Learning (ADL) conformant, web-based training courses.  This software has been used to create courses for job interview skills, law-enforcement, and military operations training; as well as over 30,000 copies of language skills training software.  To date, however, the tools have not been applied to training human-automation interactions. 
<br> 
<br>For this Phase I SBIR, we will extend our Vcommunicator? authoring tools and Extensible 3D (X3D) simulation engine to create high-performance human-automation training simulations.  Key products of this project will include a new Controller-Based architecture that extends the Model-based design, as well as definition of the Controller architecture in terms of relevant industry standards.  The goal is to enable cost-effective, reusable, human-automation training available over the web.  For Phase II, we will develop a full prototype system and exemplar course.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed Authoring Tools and Simulation Engine will be directly applicable to a significant portion of the simulation-based e-Learning market that is projected to grow from $300M in 2002 to $37B in 2001.  We will market the technology developed as part of this SBIR in two ways: 1) as enhancements to our own Synthetic Environment authoring tools and X3D Simulation Engine, and 2) by licensing the technology to other toolmakers and training course developers.  By mapping our techniques into the ADL/SCORM Model and X3D Node Set, we will assure that other vendors are able to build on our architecture, while reserving our commercial rights to license our specific implementations.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed Authoring System and Simulation Engine for Model-based Human-Automation Interaction Training will allow NASA to develop new training modules that can be accessed anytime, anywhere by maintenance and assembly workers, as well as astronauts.  By promoting reusability and ease of authoring/editing models, simulations, and training lessons, it will dramatically cut the cost of training course development and administration.

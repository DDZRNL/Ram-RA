<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed system uses a combined hard-core processor/programmable-logic chip to implement the front-end control and processing functions of an intelligent sensor system.  Combining these functions in a single chip is an innovation, relative to a traditional processor-only based system, because it provides re-configurable control of the sensor interface, i.e. analog and digital I/O and signal conditioning electronics, while freeing up the processor for computational tasks - yet maintaining tight coupling between the two functions.  To embed intelligent functions on sensors, the proposed miniature, front-end electronics will combine at least 32 MB of RAM and a 200 MHz, 32-bit RISC processor with a flexible sensor interface that consists of two analog input and two analog output channels, with programmable gain, programmable anti-aliasing filters, and automatic calibration, and eight digital I/O channels.  An Ethernet communication port will be available.  The processor will be programmable using C/C++.  Provisions for expansion to four each of the analog input and output channels and sixteen digital I/O channels will be included in the design.  The final system will be no larger than 4" x 4" x 2".  A programming kit for a PC will be part of the final development.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This system has commercial potential in the areas of automotive and industrial testing, as well as industrial control.  The versatility of the electronics will allow this system to work with nearly any type of sensor.  This capability, along with multiple analog and digital I/O channels, gives the system broad utility.  Relatively high computational power and both analog and digital outputs make the system useful for control applications also.  Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are very common for industrial automation control.  The PLC, however, is a fairly simple system that does not have the computational capability that the proposed system will have.  The relatively high powered processor of the proposed system will allow the implementation of powerful, complex, and versatile control systems.  This capability is further enhanced by the included Ethernet capability, that allows access to the system through a common, high speed communication system

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed system has strong potential for application to ground testing of rocket engines.  Multiple sensor capability, including the versatility to interface to many different types of sensors, and full programmability of each channel allow the system to support a suite of sensors in an a test instrumentation role.  The integrated processor provides the capability of programming complex data processing algorithms into the system.  Coupled with the analog and digital I/O channels, this creates a powerful and versatile data acquisition and control system.

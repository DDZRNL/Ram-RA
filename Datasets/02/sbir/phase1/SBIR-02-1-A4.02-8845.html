<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Non-conventional technologies are needed to revolutionize space propulsion. Development of materials with improved properties is essential to increase performance and reduce cost. Advancements are needed for components in high powered electrical, beamed energy, and nuclear propulsion systems. Innovative Vacuum Plasma Spray (VPS) processes for fabricating net shape, tungsten-rhenium-hafnium carbide alloy components are proposed. Tungsten is being used for its high melting temperature and chemical stability. However, conventional tungsten materials have to be forged to get adequate properties.  Forging tungsten into complex shapes is difficult and has limited its application. Tungsten alloys yield improved properties as compared to conventional unalloyed tungsten.  It is well documented that small additions of rhenium improve the ductility of tungsten without significantly decreasing the melting point. Also, dispersion hardening by additions of HfC increases the high temperature strength by pinning grain boundaries. In Phase I, W-Re-HfC powders and process parameters will be developed to fabricate samples for characterization and hoop tensile testing. After optimization, nozzles will be fabricated and hot fire tested at ATK-Thiokol. Development of these materials will allow the production of components with unique properties and reduce the size, weight, and cost of propulsion systems.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The results of the Phase I effort will clearly demonstrate the ability to fabricate improved tungsten alloy components. Development of these advanced materials will produce robust components with unique properties and reduce the size, weight, and cost. Potential clients for these components are NASA, DOD, Thiokol, and Aerojet. Letters from Thiokol and Aerojet for Plasma Processes ongoing R&D efforts are attached to this proposal. PPI will develop and transfer the SBIR technology to other commercial applications such as:  Ballistic and tactical missiles, gun barrel liners, Arc-jet thrusters, Heat exchangers, Welding electrodes, Plasma facing components for nuclear reactors, gas turbines, automobile engines, incinerators, thermal control coatings, oxidation protective coatings, coatings for composite parts and structures, thermal barrier coatings, structural jackets on tubular combustors and nozzles, crucibles, tubes, valves, and storage vessels.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA applications that net shape tungsten alloy components can be used for are high powered electrical, beamed energy, and nuclear propulsion systems. Tungsten alloys can also be used for microgravity crucibles, heat pipes, fuel cells, and components for solar themal propulsion, liquid/solid rocket motors, and other high temperature applications.

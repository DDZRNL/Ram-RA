<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
For the proposed Phase I project, MicroCoating Technologies, Inc. (MCT) will explore the feasibility of fabricating a two-layer thin film composite on single crystal substrates that is composed of an epitaxial superconducting BKBO-class thin film of superior, sharp temperature transition edge and a ?super-?doped epitaxial thin film of the same material compound with large absorption of far-infrared wavelengths.  This enabling materials platform is made possible by MCT's proprietary non-vacuum Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition (CCVD) technology, which permits the deposition of complex epitaxial thin films and variation in material composition.  Thus absorber and detector are made in the same process sequentially for the high Tc transition edge bolometers.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Far-IR detectors can be used for spectroscopy with a Fourier transform spectrometer.  Since the existing detectors offer only moderate performance in linearity and responding speed, an improvement in detector technology will greatly increase the precision and convenience of spectroscopic measurement.   With the rapid development in the photonics industry, for which the targeted marketplace is estimated at $23 billion/year in 2005, the far-IR spectroscopic measurement devices will have large markets in the near future.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Future instruments for NASA?s sensors and detectors for astrophysics will require increasingly sophisticated electromagnetic radiation detecting and sensing technology.   The the radiation of cosmic microwave background (CMB), the remnant from the creation of the universe about 15 billion year ago, has been shifted to longer and longer wavelengths and its weak anisotropy was discovered recently.  It is believed that this temperature anisotropy (varying by > 130 mK) contains information about the very beginning of the universe as well as about the parameters that govern its evolution.  Therefore, only bolometric detectors with high sensitivity for infrared, especially far-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths, make it possible to precisely measure the CMB temperature anisotropy as to map the temperature anisotropy over the sky and develop cosmological models to study the beginning and evolution of the universe.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Based on its unique micromachining technology, LEEOAT Company will develop, design, fabricate and test the resilient space qualified NDE miniature system for space deployment.  In Phase I of the SBIR program, LEEOAT Company will design and simulate the imaging system for NDE of avionic components and structures.  We will reduce-to-practice and conduct theoretical simulations to predict the system performance.  Finally, we will estimate the cost/effort for the fabrication and testing of the NDE system in Phase II of the program.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The development of the resilient, cost-effective NDE miniature system for space application, will open a large window of commercial opportunities in nonmedical and medical applications, as well as in high-technology manufacturing quality control.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The development of the "Resilient Space Qualified NDE miniature system by micromachining," under the SBIR program, will provide NASA a real-time noninvasive analytical space-deployable tool for on-line structural evaluation of future modular space exploration systems.  The light-weight, miniaturization and cost-effectiveness of the innovated NDE system, will result enormous benefits to NASA, in maintenance, safety assurance and qualification of future space components.

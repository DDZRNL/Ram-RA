<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Phase I project will demonstrate a virtual computer environment that links geographically dispersed computer systems over the Internet to solve large computational problems.  Ultimately, the technology will deliver compute power from dedicated sources, over the Internet, on-demand, creating a business paradigm where companies can concentrate on their core competencies, and rely on other entities to provide context technologies which are critical to business success, but which can potentially detract from the primary business objective.  The ultimate goal of this paradigm (and the Phase II project) is that cpu cycles will be a commodity purchased by end users, much like electric power.  Companies and Government Agencies (such as NASA) engaged in scientific computing will not be burdened with the concerns of system architecture, system maintenance, backups, and other issues associated with high performance computing.  The only concern will be how many teraflops are required to solve a given problem.  Once that is estimated, the teraflops of compute power can be purchased over the Internet, much like kilowatts of electric energy are purchased over the power grid.  The Phase I project will implement and demonstrate an earth science computing application over the Internet on a large-scale (100 to 1000 cpu) system.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This project has implications beyond the seismic and energy applications demonstrated herein.  The concept of remote commercial scientific computing and TeraGrid utilization applies to other compute intensive fields such as: fluid flow modeling (oil and gas reservoir simulation and environmental applications), aeronautics and aerospace, biological simulation (DNA sequencing and genetic simulation), computational chemistry, astrophysics, and computational physics.  This proposed project will strengthen 3DGeo's marketing push and allow 3DGeo to more effectively deliver its core imaging technology to worldwide and local markets by harnessing Internet resources.
<br>The advanced seismic imaging technology directly impacts the discovery and recovery of hydrocarbons and could decrease the United State's dependence on imported oil and create jobs in the oil service industries.  In existing oil fields, better seismic images of complicated subsurface geology reduce development costs and increase (1) the amount of hydrocarbons recovered and (2) the amount of national oil reserves.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This product will allow effortless and efficient access to NASA computer resources that are geographically dispersed.  It will also facilitate access to external computing resources for computationally intensive tasks.  This will make computing resources universally available, and give NASA researchers access to tremendous compute power to solve large engineering and scientific problems on an as-needed, on-demand basis.  The application developed in Phase II will be relevant for any compute intensive and data intensive NASA application. Applications in this category include: astrophysics, helioseismology, aerodynamic simulation, biological simulation computational chemistry, and computational physics, and earth science applications such as environmental applications, fluid flow modeling, and simulation of planetary interiors.  The Phase II product will offer an infrastructure which will allow NASA scientists and engineers to easily and efficiently harness system-wide and third party resources in order to accomplish their computational tasks.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This project builds on experience in an SBIR phase I project which successfully determined that the particle transport code Geant4 could be applied to the simulation of biological shielding. Among the many lessons learned during phase I was that while the physics and functionality embodied in Geant4 is either already excellent, or clearly extendible as needed, the great lacuna lies in its ability to understand geometries specified by other tools, most notably CAD tools. To this end, while this proposal involves continuing to work with the physics of the program, the main focus is on developing the tools to match the representation systems intrinsic to Geant4 to those used by other tools which generate geometries. Based on discussions with NASA this is by far the most pressing issue for immediate application to space radiation shielding, and is certainly crucial for all commercial applications we envisage as a small business.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The basic idea is to provide a standard description of geometrical and material information suitable for radiation shielding and mechanical work and tools to convert between it and commercial CAD and Geant4 formats.  One beauty of this approach from a commercial point of view is that, once in place, this provides interconvertibility not only between Geant4 and CAD formats, but from one CAD format to another. Such functionality has clear commercial value both to end-users employing more than one CAD system, as well as to CAD suppliers themselves, allowing them to import foreign geometries or export their own in foreign formats.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Geant4 provides a prodigious array of physics models and generic tools which application developers may exploit in writing Monte Carlo simulations of particle interactions in materials.  Such a Monte Carlo approach is complimentary to the analytical approach adopted by NASA for its core radiation shielding simulation program.  One principle issue which requires further attention, and is the focus of this proposal, is related to the description of complex geometries and allowing Geant4 to import geometry descriptions from CAD packages.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
	Lithium (Li) / Sulfur (S) batteries are one of the most promising power sources for many civilian and military applications due to the extremely high energy density.  However, the performance of the current batteries including power/energy density and cycle life have fallen well below the theoretical marks mostly due to the poor electrochemical stability and low electrical and ionic conductivity of the current sulfur electrode materials.
<br>	TPL proposes to develop a novel S/polymer nanocomposite cathode material (NCM) that will significantly improve the performance of Li/S batteries in terms of power/energy density and cycle life. The superior properties of the proposed NCMs will be achieved via formation of the nanophases that facilitate interfacial contacts and improve electrochemical stabilities.
<br>	In Phase I, TPL will prepare the novel S/polymer nanocomposite electrodes via a solution approach. The NCMs will be structurally characterized and the nanocomposite electrodes will be electrochemically evaluated. The concept of the NCMs for S/Li batteries will be demonstrated.
<br>	TPL proposes to team with Sandia National Laboratories to demonstrate fabrication of the proposed nanocomposite cathodes. TPL and SNL have extensive experience in nanocomposite, and lithium battery chemistries. TPL's technical and management teams are well positioned to move this technology into the market.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA wants to develop new relative navigation methods and sensors for autonomous rendezvous and docking, with a minimum relative navigation sensor suite addressing spacecraft-to-spacecraft ranges of 100 kilometers through docking, including relative attitude control during the final 100 meters of the approach. This proposal represents an opportunity to leverage an on-going program. The Video Guidance Sensor (VGS) has been proven on orbit and is the system of choice for rendezvous and docking guidance for both manned and unmanned flights. Advanced Optical Systems, Inc. (AOS) has been selected to develop the first prototypes and to support Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC) in developing the flight hardware for the Advanced Video Guidance Sensor (AVGS) for the Demonstration of Autonomous Rendezvous Technology (DART) mission under the Space Launch Initiative (SLI). AOS proposes to combine a mid/short-range AVGS with a long range, time-of-flight laser radar in order to achieve a complete sensor suite that gives range and bearing at ranges of 100 kilometers through docking and 6 degrees-of-freedom information from 300 meters through docking. As an alternative, and depending upon NASA?s needs, we could develop a wide field-of-view, mid range (2 kilometer) laser radar.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In addition to the ongoing AVGS activities under SLI, Advanced Optical Systems is currently in discussions with several aerospace corporations to supply AVGS units for NASA and non-NASA missions. The addition of a long-range or mid-range laser radar to the AVGS would expand the applicability and customer base. The Rendezvous and Docking Sensor Suite would also find application to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle recovery and may find application to other military and civilian aircraft landing. Robotic arm operation is another potential application.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Use in the Space Shuttle, use in the Alternate Access to Station (AAS), and use in any other programs involving rendezvous and docking.

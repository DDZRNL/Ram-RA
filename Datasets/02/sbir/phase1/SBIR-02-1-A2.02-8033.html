<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The performance of the currently used Auto Thermal Reformer(ATR) in the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) suffers degradation from carbon depostition due to inadequate mixing of fuel/steam/air in the reformer.  An innovative concept of Double-Mixing Vortex (DMV) mixer/injector is proposed to remedy the defect of the ATR.  The improved mixing outcome from the DMV mixer is resulted from two consecutive mixing steps built in the device.  The primary mixing is achieved by direct-impinging scheme of fuel, air, and steam jets in the fuel passages.  The secondary mixing of the fluid is achieved by setting-up swirling vortex in the mixing chamber of the mixer in the later stage.  Finally, extremely fine drops in the spray are formulated due to the expansion of small air/steam bubbles which are entrapped in the fuel during the mixing process in the mixing chamber.  A two-fluid mixer of similar design has been tested by SUN VALLEY TECHNOLOGY (SVT) successfully in the industrial burners.  The DMV mixer will be expected to achieve improved mixing of fluids and extremely fine drops in the spray for the proper fuel distribution in the ATR applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed Double-Mixing Vortex (DMV) mixer/injector will achieve a much superior quality for fluid mixing.  It can be used in the Auto Thermal Reformer (ATR) of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) for the auxiliary power unit (APU) in an aircraft.  The sprays generated from this mixer/injector are extremely fine and uniform, which is great for gas-turbine-combustor or industrial-burner applications for high turn-down ratio runnings.  It can also be used in the general liquid/gas or gas/gas mixing where fast mixing within a compact space is required.

The extremely fine sprays generated from this mixer/injector along with its high turn-down ratio will be beneficial to gas-turbine-combustor runnings.  It can also be used in the desulfurizing process for the hydrocarbon fuels.

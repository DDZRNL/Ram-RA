<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are considered suitable for use in components for high-strength structural composites used in spacecrafts. However, structurally similar boron nitride (BN) nanotubes that promise both mechanical and electronic superiority over CNTs have not been studied in great detail so far due to the absence of facile preparative techniques. BN nanotubes exhibit good mechanical strength, chemical resistance and heat tolerance and have been predicted to be better reinforcing material than even CNTs for structural polymers. 
<br>
<br>MMI proposes to utilize its expertise in nanotechnology to develop a novel one-step process for synthesizing boron nitride nanotubes in morphologically pure form.  Phase I will be used to develop the synthetic technique for BN nanotubes and test epoxy samples impregnated with the BN nanotubes prepared. Phase II will involve fabrication of prototype parts using the BN-epoxy and establishment of its superiority over CNT- and other fiber-reinforced polymers that are currently used in the fabrication of high-performance parts.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
BN nanotubes can be used as structural reinforcements for specialty polymers such as those used in automobiles and aircraft interiors. BN nanotubes may also be used in heavy duty bearings for machineries and will also find use in electronics by virtue of being a semiconductor.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Although the specific end use envisaged for BN nanotubes is in composite polymers, other equally attractive applications relevant to NASA include energy storage, life support systems, thermal materials, nanoelectronics, nanosensors and electrostatic discharge materials.

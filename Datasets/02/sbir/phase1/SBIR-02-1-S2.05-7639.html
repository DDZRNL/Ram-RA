<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Ceramic Composites, Inc. will demonstrate the feasibility of constructing a lightweight, affordable and dimensionally stable SiC mirrors using an innovative process.  The structure will combine rigorous thermal control as well as structural strength and stiffness.  The proposed technology demonstration promises to produce a net shape SiC article at a lower cost that present SiC manufacturing technologies.  The present state of the art SiC manufacturing technologies requires extensive high risk machining as the final processing step.  The proposed innovative processing technology eliminates the need for any machining as a final processing.  The proprietary SiC processing technology will create a net shape SiC article and accomplishes this task by a Chemical Vapor Infiltration and Densification Process.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This approach is primarily focused at demonstrating a very lightweight DACS system for propellants but could in the future also be applied to monopropellants and solid DACS systems.

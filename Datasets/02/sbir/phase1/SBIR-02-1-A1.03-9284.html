<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The detection and isolation of air vehicle process failures is difficult because air vehicle dynamics are nonlinear and the vehicle has many important and complicated sub-systems.  The fault diagnosis performance is further complicated by the presence of sensor failures. In this proposal, Intelligent Automation, Incorporated (IAI) proposes a novel approach to perform simultaneous diagnosis of sensor and process faults for air vehicles. This algorithm can be embedded into low cost electronics. First, two independent residual vectors (RVs) for detection and isolation of the sensor and process faults are built. This is in sharp contrast to conventional methods, which can deal with either sensor failures or process failures but never both. Second, to isolate faults, the RV is transformed into a set of structured residual vectors (SRVs), where one SRV is made insensitive to a specified subset of faults, while remaining sensitive to other faults. The proposed technology is relevant to this subtopic because we will develop an electronic module that can be embedded in low cost sensor electronics to quickly identify both sensor and process faults.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed sensor and process faults diagnosis module is novel by itself and will have many practical NASA applications such as spacecraft, flight control systems, etc. The developed technology will result in an increase in inspection efficiency and inspection unit autonomy while reducing the demand on NASA maintenance personnel and the total ownership cost for NASA asset.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Health monitoring technology has many applications such as health monitoring for engines, helicopter gearbox systems, jet and automotive engine diagnostics, and commercial and military aircraft.  The jet and automobile industries are multibillion dollar industries that are commercial targets for this technology. Our goal is to develop a generic electronic module, which can be used for many systems.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to develop a formal modeling tool, Networks in Organizational Risk Management (NORM), that allows mission planners and organizational designers to create and experiment with organizational structures that minimize risk throughout the lifecycle of a system. The core of our approach is a model of the network of interrelationships among people, knowledge, tasks, technology, organizational goals, system failures, and the surrounding environment. Our proposal is uniquely innovative in three respects. First, we seek to develop a formal quantitative model of organizational risk management rather than qualitative descriptions of theoretical aspects or recommended practices. Second, our model encapsulates a holistic view of organizational risk management, where organizations are not depicted solely as a source of errors but also as a means for detecting and responding to system failures. Finally, in contrast to conventional methods that focus on analyzing technical failures in the system, our model incorporates explicit measures of organizational phenomena such as goals, decisions, authority, communication, and informal social networks. The software tool we envision will provide capabilities for simulation, to allow mission planners to experiment with ?what-if? scenarios and optimization to generate organizational designs that minimize the losses incurred by system failures.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The capabilities of NORM are most likely to appeal to customers who have the need to analyze and improve organizational safety or design organizations for safe operations. Examples of potential applications include air traffic control, supervisory control systems, command and control systems, ground and maritime transportation, hospital administration, construction, and manufacturing. In addition, management consulting firms provide a potential market for software licensing and consulting services. Business analysts that advise corporate management on safety issues require a deep understanding of the risks present in the organization, but are typically unacquainted with scientific methods for rigorously modeling and analyzing organizational risks.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Formal modeling of organizational risk management is critical to a variety of NASA applications, including launch operations, the Mission to Mars, and the International Space Station (ISS). Failures such as the Challenger launch and the Mars rover illustrate the need for tools to design organizations that minimize rather than induce errors, and to identify latent errors introduced during design and construction before they manifest themselves as operational failures providing little opportunity for recovery. The challenges of constructing, maintaining, and continually expanding the ISS demand cost-effective methods for predicting the impact of new technologies on system safety prior to installation.

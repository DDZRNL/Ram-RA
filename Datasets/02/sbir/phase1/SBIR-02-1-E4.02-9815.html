<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to develop EarthTutor, an Intelligent Tutoring System that extends NASA's Image2000 software, and an accompanying authoring tool used to create new tutorials. The system will be innovative in that it delivers a learning experience that is more visual, interactive, and adaptive than experiences offered by current remote sensing learning materials. EarthTutor aims to offer the benefits of a one-on-one human instructor. EarthTutor will demonstrate image processing and Earth science skills and concepts, ask questions, offer challenges, monitor and assess the student, and provide contextual guidance. EarthTutor will run tutorials created with the separate authoring tool. The tool will be basic enough to allow teachers to construct tutorials to fit one's curriculum, but also powerful enough to allow advanced authors to create highly-interactive tutorials that engage students in unprecendented ways. SHAI will work with SEE, CIPE, and educators to design and implement a library of tutorials that simultaneously teach image processing skills and Earth science principles to students.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
SHAI will market EarthTutor to Earth science-related curriculum providers. We will apply EarthTutor's technologies to other sciences that use image processing tools. SHAI will also approach educational game makers.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
EarthTutor will provide Image2000 with a cutting-edge educational component. The system will be an effective Earth science learning tool for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students as well as principal investigators. Image processing tutoring technology can also be applied to other sciences of interest to NASA.

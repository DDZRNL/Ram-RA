<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The communication network of the Air Traffic Management system requires highly reliable and secure transmission to protect the secrecy and authenticity of the information being transferred. Systems must meet that criteria and be capable of recognizing and withstanding tempering, spying and physical attacks. These requirements cannot be relaxed without diminishing severely the capability of the communication network, and the consequences of loss of security could be disastrous in the extreme. The only undecipherable encryption method is quantum cryptography in which the encryption key is encoded in a quantum property of the carrier, and detecting a quantum property destroys the quantum coherence, altering its value. This concept implementation requires that the transmission network consisting entirely of optical paths in which random polarization is not destroyed or revealed. 
<br>
<br>SiWave proposes to develop and test a low loss and hardened 32-port all-optical path switch designed for extreme environmental conditions (thermal, vibration, shock) and suitable for quantum encryption applications in this Phase 1 SBIR. During Phase II, SiWave will fabricate and test the optimized switch designed in Phase I.  We will demonstrate the performance of the device for quantum encrypted data transmission applications, and propose modifications to extend its capabilities for better performance.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
For a medium port count switch such as the 32x32 switch that we propose in this Phase I SBIR, the best known application is to telecommunications, where optical crossconnects and optical add/drop multiplexers have a large market.  The projected market size for optical switches in 2006 is $6B and up to $10B by 2010. Another application is to sensors where the sensor connects to the measurement device by fiber optic cable, and to distributed sensor networks where an array of sensors can be interconnected with each other and with multiple measurement systems. These switches can also be implemented in classical computers that use fiber optics. Finally, the application to secure data networks for handling financial, business and information transaction represents a potential market worth billions of dollars per year.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed optical switch from SiWave will enable NASA to create an ultra-secure and reliable quantum encryption communication network for its Air Traffic Management system. The proposed switch will be reliable and low loss and be capable of withstanding severe environmental conditions and physical attacks. In addition, such switch would be compact and low power to reduce the back-up power requirements for operation in severe conditions.  SiWave's optical switch can also function as the central crossconnect or router in a high bandwidth optical network, routing multiple high data rate optical signals to different destinations. Such application would increase greatly the data communication capability of NASA, allowing scientists to share and to analyze large volume of data.

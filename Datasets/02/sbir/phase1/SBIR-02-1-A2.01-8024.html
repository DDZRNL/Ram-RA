<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Combustion Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is a vastly improved method of modeling turbulent-combustion in gas turbine combustors, and will provide improved emissions/instability prediction capability of UEET combustors.  It is widely recognized that one of the best subgrid turbulence-combustion models is the Linear Eddy Mixing (LEM) model with multi-step reactions. However, this model is not commonly used in the design environment for one main reason: computational time.  
<br>
<br>In this SBIR, we propose to develop a subgrid LEM module with multi-step Jet-A kinetics that is 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art direct LEM.  This new, innovative method performs off-line LEM calculations over a range of turbulence levels and compositions to train an artificial neural net (ANN).  The ANN is then used to determine the chemical source terms required in the combustion LES calculation.  In Phase I of this SBIR, the feasibility of developing the LEM/ANN module will be demonstrated by training a one-step, five species Jet-A fuel oxidation mechanism.  The preliminary LEM/ANN module will be implemented into the CFD-ACE+ code, validation performed, and speed-up demonstrated.  At the end of Phase I, the module will be delivered to NASA for incorporation into the NCC code.  In Phase II, the LEM/ANN approach will be extended to include multi-step Jet-A kinetic mechanisms, and applied to UEET combustor configurations.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The LEM/ANN chemistry module will significantly improve combustor design methods. The ability to reduce emissions, avoid combustion-driven instability, and to investigate high-payoff ideas will be possible.  The software will be useful for gas turbine manufacturers, burner and boiler manufacturers, chemical processing industry, and the automotive industry.  The module will be incorporated into CFDRC's commercial code, CFD-ACE+.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The LEM/ANN chemistry module developed in this SBIR will be useful in the cost-effective design and analysis of liquid-fueled, high performance combustors.  The LES combustor design tool will be used to help meet the NASA UEET emission goals. The module will be supplied to NASA for incorporation into the National Combustion Code.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovation is an implementation of an improved, more efficient method for processing individual Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) data during the process of rendering audio in a structural acoustic simulated environment.  Binaural or 3D-simulated audio has been identified as a useful method for analyzing acoustic and vibro-acoustic data.  The highest quality audio simulation requires the processing of HRTF data to create the most accurate 3D audio rendering; however, such processing requires an extensive amount of CPU cycles and is one of the biggest limiting factors of the complexity of the audio simulation.  By significantly improving the efficiency of HRTF processing, through such techniques as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Equivalent Source Reduction (ESR), the complexity of the structure being acoustically modeled can be increased.  In fact, the capacity of the audio rendering engine can be increased to the point where not only single point audio sources can be modeled, but surface-defined audio sources can be defined, using an array of single-point sources. Such surface-defined audio sources make the audio simulation of vibro-acoustic systems feasible. Such a system will act as an effective tool for assessing the noise characteristics and ?sound quality? of structural acoustic prototypes.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercial applications of this technology would be in the automobile industry, where millions of dollars are spent every year in order to find ways to make new vehicles operate more quietly.  The acoustics analysis capabilities that would be enabled with the development of the SVD/ESR-enhanced 3D audio simulation software could be applied widely throughout the automobile business by licensing it to be integrated with existing and broadly used industrial acoustics analysis packages such as the Virtual Acoustics Sciences product line.  Such a combined package would offer significantly more capability to engineers designing to optimize acoustics than any other package available today.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
When designers are given the ability to simulate the expected noise generated from an object or structure with a force applied which induces vibration, this noise can be characterized by examining its volume and tonal qualities and determinations can be made regarding how perceptually problematic the projected noise might be in field conditions.  This capability will allow more accurate analysis of and experimentation with the acoustics of designs for aircraft and International Space Station structural components.

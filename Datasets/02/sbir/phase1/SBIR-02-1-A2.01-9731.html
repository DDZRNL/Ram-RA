<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The exhaust flow from a turbofan engine operating at typical cruise conditions generates noise as turbulent flow interacts with the basic shock cell pattern. This can be a significant source of noise within the aircraft cabin. The proposed innovation is a new method for testing the acoustics of model scale turbofan engine exhaust systems at cruise conditions in a transonic wind tunnel. This would complement the aerodynamic tests now conducted in the wind tunnel. Currently, acoustic data at cruise conditions is only obtained from costly flight tests. Wind tunnel tests are desirable to simulate the proper flight conditions, but acoustic measurements are difficult in this environment. Microphone arrays and specialized array processing techniques are required to separate model noise from tunnel induced noise and reverberation. The new method involves three specific areas of innovation: a) phased-array noise measurement methods, b) evaluating potential modifications to an existing wind tunnel, and c) evaluating means for reducing model air supply noise. Preliminary measurements demonstrate that each of these problems is solvable. The proposed research will then lead to a successful commercial ?service? to airframe manufacturers interested in increasing passenger comfort through better understanding of the noise sources that influence the passenger cabin environment.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The principal commercial application of this research will be an expanded ?test service? available at our test laboratory to conduct model scale acoustic tests on aircraft components in a 66-inch transonic wind tunnel where aerodynamic performance measurements on exhaust nozzle systems are currently conducted. This service would be available to commercial airframe and engine manufacturers interested in minimizing cabin interior noise levels created by the operation of turbofan engines. Another application relates to acoustic diagnostics of full scale turbofan engines under test conditions. During maintenance procedures an engine is extensively tested prior to remounting on the aircraft to ensure proper operation. These tests occur in hard walled test cells, not unlike the hard walls of a wind tunnel. We have begun discussions with engine manufacturers to determine how acoustic array technology can be applied to maintenance diagnostics.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA conducts acoustic measurements on aircraft systems and components in several wind tunnels. The research to be conducted on this program will complement NASA tests. The subspace methodology described in this proposal is being developed on a related Air Force SBIR and will be refined for use on this program. It is common in the field of communication but has not been applied to aeroacoustic studies. It is not restricted to the transonic problem and may provide superior performance to standard techniques now in use for the low speed aeroacoustic problem.  In particular, it may improve the noise source location techniques now used to identify source locations for tests conducted in NASA wind tunnels, such as the 40- X 80-Ft wind tunnel at NASA ARC. This research will provide significant advancement of adaptive beamforming techniques applied to conventional aeroacoustic wind tunnel tests.

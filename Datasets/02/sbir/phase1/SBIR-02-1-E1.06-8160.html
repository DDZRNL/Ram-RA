<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Making use of fabrication technology commonly used in the manufacture of liquid crystals and semiconductors, but not previously applied to vacuum devices, the diamond-based backward wave oscillator (BWO) will provide a miniature, energy efficient, electronically tunable and mass producible signal source in the sub mm wavelength regime.  Fabricated within a shell of chemically vapor deposited (CVD) diamond, the BWO will employ a novel biplanar interdigital slow wave circuit.  The dimensions of the BWO are estimated to be 0.600 inches long and 0.130 inches in diameter at 300 GHz, and a power output of 10 mW is predicted with a total power input of 198 mW for an overall efficiency of 5%.  The electron source for the BWO will be a field emission cathode.  The offerors have previously demonstrated a diamond field emitter that makes use of the negative electron affinity of diamond to obtain a threshold of emission for a gate voltage as low as 0.25 volts[1, 2].   Widely available, cost effective silicon fabrication technology will be used to integrate the BWO components into a single chip, avoiding conventional assembly techniques.  The  BWO would replace the present generation of bulky, power consuming signal sources that are unsuitable for space applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Most of the applications of a sub mm oscillator of the type proposed here would be in scientific instrumentation for use in laboratories or in spectroscopy above the earth?s atmosphere.  If the manufacturing process described in this proposal is successfully developed, relatively inexpensive sub mm oscillators would be available for the first time, which might open up additional commercial opportunities.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The diamond-based sub mm BWO will provide a new class of light weight, power efficient local oscillators for use in heterodyne detection of extraterrestrial radiation above the Earth's atmosphere that will replace the bulky inefficient devices now available.

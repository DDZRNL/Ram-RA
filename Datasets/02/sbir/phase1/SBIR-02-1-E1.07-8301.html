<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
MicroEnergy Technologies, Inc. (MicroET) and the University of Washington propose to demonstrate the feasibility and the major advantages of a unique high heat flux cooling module for localized cooling of distributed electronics.  This technology combines innovations in heat sink design, manufacturing, and operation including an innovative micropump design to achieve heat rejection rates in excess of 1000 W/cm2 from the surface of a substrate. The most critical innovation is the use of ceramic nanoparticles suspension used as the heat rejection medium in which intense nucleate boiling produces extremely high heat fluxes.  The micropump geometry is integrated into the cooling module to maintain a high enough flow rate through the parallel array of microchannels for efficient cooling.    The proposed approach allows for distributed cooling without the need for external pumping and the ability to provide localized control.  During Phase I, we will perform analytical and computational modeling for system design and analysis, experimentally demonstrate the significant advantages and improvements in cooling system performance.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The final product, ultra high heat flux thermal management system, in addition to application in the aerospace and space electronics industry will have a significant commercial value to a broader industry, including defense electronics, supercomputing, and desktop computing applications.  Efficient distributed cooling will reduce the risk of system failure, increase system throughput, and reduce the complexity, size, and weight of the system.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This technology is particularly of value for the NASA?s mission for Earth Science Enterprise to track and assess global environmental processes.  Minimization of the weight and size of the systems and instruments used for these studies are critical.

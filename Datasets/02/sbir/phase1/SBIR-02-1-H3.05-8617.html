<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The objective of our proposed program is to demonstrate a high power single crystal fiber laser of Tm, Ho:YAG at 2 microns, an eye-safe wavelength, that can be used to power satellites. This system would be very efficient, light in weight and quite small in size. The efficiency and size of the laser would in large part be due to the fact that the laser is to be diode pumped and the single crystal fibers will be double-clad. These two developments have led to the demonstration of fiber lasers that have output powers over 100 Watts. The single crystal fibers will lead to increases in efficiency and power capability and therby reduce these systems further.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A high power two micron laser will have many commercial applications as a high power compact laser at this wavelength does not exist at this time. This wavelength is very useful for medical and dental applications. It is the proper wavelength for several medical procedures. A high power 2 micron source that is single mode, as our design can be readily developed to be, will find application as an OPO pump. This can lead to a broadly tunable source for investigating molecular and atmospheric effects.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Beyond the satellite power application, this laser device could find wide application in NASA because of its eye-safe wavelength. Two microns can be used to probe the atmosphere to monitor and study aerosols and particles. This system could replace the CO2 laser for this application.It could also find use in rangefinding. As a pump for an OPO, this system could be of significant use for studying the atmosphere of earth and other planets.

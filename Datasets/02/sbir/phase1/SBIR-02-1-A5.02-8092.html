<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed effort relates to the use of Cerablak?, an amorphous-based black oxide material, as a coating for protection of metallic thermal protection systems (TPS) to be used in reusable launch vehicles (RLVs).  This material shows potential to be a coating that meets all of NASA?s requirements for TPS protection in a single material system. The basic technical requirements for a coating to protect metal TPS are a) total hemispherical emittance >0.8 to maximize re-radiation b) low catalytic efficiency (<0.3) for recombination of atomic N and O species, and c) protection against oxidation of the underlying metal substrate at temperatures up to 2000oF (1093oC) for approximately 15 minutes during each reentry.  The coating material is also lightweight, low cost, and easily repairable.  The proposed coating material is easily applicable by painting, and is amenable to quick field repair.  Phase I work will focus on optimizing emissivity of the material and developing coatings. Phase II will focus on further developing coating for metallic TPS panels and further testing for emissivity and catalytic efficiency.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There is a growing interest in commercial RLVs, which will require TPS systems that require minimal maintenance. Low cost, field repairable high emissivity protective coatings for TPS will be especially critical for commercial systems.   High emissivity coatings are also needed in the glass industry and other processing industries.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Metallic TPS are being pursued by NASA for next-generation RLVs to replace the currently-used ceramic TPS which requires extensive maintenance and water-proofing after each launch cycle.  NASA?s long term goal is to implement multiple missions to space with rapid turnaround times which demands a robust TPS that requires minimum maintenance after each cycle.  Metallic TPS systems hold great promise to meet the need, but require a robust coating that provides high emissivity, low catalytic activity, and oxidation protection of the substrate.  The proposed technology offers many benefits and can be easily implemented into production.

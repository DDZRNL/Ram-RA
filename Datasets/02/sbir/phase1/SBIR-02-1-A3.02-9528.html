<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose an innovative scenario generation application that significantly decreases the time and cost to develop complex air traffic scenarios. Our application addresses functionality including the user interface, real time displays, data processing (input/output), and compatibility with other similar applications. Unique innovations are focused on flexible user interface and simulation processing options combined with open-architecture, object-oriented software to enable rapid scenario construction and evaluation. These capabilities are lacking in current scenario generation tools and will provide significant savings to users performing analysis on new airspace operational concepts or modifications to the National Airspace System. In addition, such an application will support a number of other applications including military, firefighting, and aviation security planning, operational simulations, evaluations, and training, The proposed initial research analyzes the requirements for such an application and designs and implements an initial prototype.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercial airlines can use this application to support technology investment decision making, new procedure design, operational concept robustness analysis, operations analysis, and training. The FAA may use our product with their Target Generation Facility (TGF) to provide quick-turnaround, human factors analysis of future operations concepts. There is a growing market for aerospace operation simulation worldwide to support; a) communication, navigation, and surveillance, and weather sensing equipment loading and placement analysis, b) UAV and commercial space launch scheduling and design, c) defense force strike planning and procedure development, d) firefighting mission planning and training, and e) aviation security threat analysis.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Within NASA, our scenario generation application can be used to advance research efforts including human performance evaluation in advanced airspace concepts, advanced airspace system concept evaluation and visualization, and the study of revolutionary vehicle concept airspace integration issues. Our application is primarily aimed at providing a scenario generation and analysis tool for investigating many advanced airspace concept issues including conflict detection and resolution, airspace and airport design, en route replanning and traffic flow management decisionmaking, and environmental impact. In general, NASA simulation capabilities exist for these areas but the capability for efficient generation of new scenarios is lacking.

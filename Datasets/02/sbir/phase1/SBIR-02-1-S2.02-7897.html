<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Lift Gas Cracker (LGC) is new method for producing lift gas for balloons for both terrestrial and extra-terrestrial applications, eliminating the need for heavy, bulky gas bottles.  The LGC produces a lift gas from the cracking of methanol, an easily obtained, easily stored liquid, to make either the hydrogen/carbon monoxide cracking product or a hydrogen-enriched product by using membrane separation.  Combustion of about 10% of the methanol provides sufficient energy to crack the remainder.  The LGC product gas can be converted back into methanol, allowing a balloon to maintain altitude during the daytime without having to vent lift gas.  The methanol can then be converted back into lift gas at night to maintain altitude without dropping ballast.  Thus, long duration balloon flights could be extended a factor of 20 or more compared to conventional means.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In addition to supplying lift gas in remote locations, such as during military operations or worldwide weather balloon launch campaigns, LGC in the membrane separation mode could supply cheap, easily generated hydrogen for multiple fuel cell applications, including automobiles and remote power supply stations.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA applications would include ultra-long duration balloon flights for earth observation, greatly extending the time aloft.  Other applications would be the production of lift gas in remote areas, such as the Arctic and the Antarctic, where conventional gas bottles are difficult and costly to obtain.  LGC could also be used for long-duration balloon flights on Mars and Venus, enabling much more time for data acquisition compared to conventional technologies.

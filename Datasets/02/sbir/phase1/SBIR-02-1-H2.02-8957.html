<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal seeks to extend the existing BrahmsVE environment to support a semi-autonomous "intelligent" agent operating inside a 3D virtual world on the web. We are calling this agent the Personal Bot Assistant (PBA) and it will be paired with an agent-astronaut driven either by the user or by the Brahms model-based simulator. The PBA should allow us to provide a test bed for one of the canonical scenarios of human-centered computing research: the interaction and task sharing between a human and a mobile agent. Once completed, the PBA-astronaut simulation will be subjected to a "virtual test fixture" within a re-creation of both the FMARS/Haughton-Mars Project surface habitat and the International Space Station.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The growing popularity of ?robot games? and ?robot wars? for K-12, college, and adult audiences suggests that BrahmsVE and the PBA could be a basis for the creation of a successful multiplayer online game both as a learning tool and as a pay-per-play tournament environment. From factory automation to security systems, complex environments where humans work in tandem with mobile agents or other autonomous machine systems all need a comprehensive model-based environment with high fidelity 3D re-creation during both design and operations phases. The military will be using semi and fully autonomous agents working closely to support troops and command in surveillance and combat missions throughout the 21st Century. Therefore we expect a great deal of interest surrounding production systems in this space. The emerging era of wireless, wearable personal assistants is picking up momentum with ever more sophisticated cell phones and other handheld devices. In a real sense, each of these devices represents the pairing of humans with machines as the BrahmsVE PBA project will study.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Numerous projects within NASA ranging from the Personal Satellite Assistant at Ames to the Mobile Agents project of interest to several NASA centers could benefit from the addition of ?intelligent? agents within a virtual world simulation. In addition, many of these projects are already employing Brahms. Putting more complexity in the virtual world agent in BrahmsVE will offload some of the modeling requirements at the Brahms level and generate better data on agent performance in simulated and possibly in physical space. Rapid, iterative design of a mobile agent in a virtual world can be made possible by changing both the Brahms model, where appropriate, and the script locally controlling the agent in the 3D world, where appropriate. Local algorithms in the virtual agent could then be downloaded into the physical robot, as is done today with Brahms Mobile Agents Architecture.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Large arrays of cryogenic microbolometers and other cryogenic detectors will be used for infrared imaging in future space observatories.  If the signal from the sensors is amplified, multiplexed, and digitized using superconducting electronics, then this data can be efficiently read out to room temperature with a minimum of noise and thermal load.  HYPRES will develop an integrated system based on SQUID amplifiers, a high-resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) based on RSFQ (rapid single flux quantum) logic, and a clocked RSFQ multiplexer.  The ADC and SQUIDs have already been developed for other projects, so this work will focus on demonstrating the perfomance of the digital multiplexer, starting with a 3x3 prototype for Phase I.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The ability to multiplex, digitize, and perform further signal processing with a low-power cryogenic readout chip will be invaluable to the cryogenic detector community.  It may also have applications in wireless communications and radar.  The flexibility of the architecture to adapt to user-specified requirements of speed and resolution should make this system adaptable to a diverse range of commercial and military applications, as well as those of NASA and others in the astrophysics community.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Improved cryogenic readout electronics is needed for cryogenic detector arrays in proposed space observatories.  Low-power A/D converters and digital signal processing that can be located near these detectors will enhance the effiency and performance of these imaging systems.

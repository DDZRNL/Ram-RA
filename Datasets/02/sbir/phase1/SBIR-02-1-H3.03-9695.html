<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed antenna is a Radial-Waveguide Array (RWA) that will operate at Ka band, 25.5-27.5 GHz in transmit and receive for left-hand, right-hand. This Phase I effort will develop the phase shifter element and control distribution layer. This planar antenna has the ability to reconfigure its beam width from a narrow, directive beam to a sector-wide beam. The design is easily scaleable to support the desired gain for the specific link. The design and the Parascan? phase shifter technology that makes this antenna possible are unique to Paratek Microwave, Inc. This antenna will enable NASA to realize a space-based telemetry system for their reusable launch vehicles, with substantial savings from their terrestrial-based telemetry systems and revolutionize broadband network links for both terrestrial and SATCOM communication networks.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This antenna has the potential to revolutionize broadband network links for both terrestrial and SATCOM communication networks. Due to the scalability of the array once the frequency and parameters are defined, the size (and thus price) of the antenna can be specified to support both ends of a terrestrial broadband wireless link such as the local multipoint distribution system (LMDS), hub and customer premise equipment. 
<br>
<br>The projected price point of such an array is significantly lower than such solutions as the Boeing Connexion phased array antenna, which costs in excess of $500K.

The design is easily scaleable to support the desired gain for the specific link, which will support other SATCOM networks or point-to-point links.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovation combines advances in EUV multilayer coating technology with Luxel?s long established manufacturing techniques to produce thin foil EUV and X-ray transmission filters.  Currently, EUV filter passbands are limited to those that can be created from combinations of the natural electronic absorptions of various elements.  EUV Multilayer technology offers the design flexibility to build filters with much more optimized passbands.  Multilayer techniques have been used for some time to fabricate normal incidence EUV mirrors.  With adequate deposition control, similar materials can be used to fabricate multilayer foils and add the flexibility of interference technology to the suite of EUV filter designs.  At Luxel, this is possible because of recent completion of a new deposition system that provides adequate control of individual layer thicknesses.  These new multilayer foils will be transformed into EUV transmission filters using Luxel?s traditional filter manufacturing processes.  The goal of Phase I will be to show feasibility by fabricating and delivering an evaluation filter that is relevant to a NASA science application.  During Phase II, the new multilayer design capabilities will be integrated into Luxel?s manufacturing processes.  Filters based on this new technology will provide exciting new options for EUV sensors and science.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Outside the space science community, EUV filters find applications in fusion energy and other forms of plasma research, advanced microelectronic fabrication, photoemission microscopy, and laser research.  All of these applications can benefit from technology advances that lead to enhanced filter performance.  Of particular interest is the ability to enhance NOAA?s operational solar activity forecasts.  These predictions of the impact of solar activity on plane earth depend on solar telescopes carried on the GOES weather satellites.  These instruments currently utilize Luxel filters and it is clear that the proposed technology would improve these devices.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Within NASA, EUV filters are a key enabling technology for solar physics and high energy astrophysics missions.  They are needed to isolate diagnostic spectral features and to protect sensitive detectors from unwanted optical radiation.  Enhanced EUV filter technology will have significant beneficial impacts on the scientific returns of future missions.  Examples of these applications are found in the roadmaps of the various Space Science Themes.

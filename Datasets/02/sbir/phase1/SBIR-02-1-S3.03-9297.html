<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Driven by research and development of advanced photon detectors--which require temperatures below 100mK-- there is considerable research into new ADR designs and techniques.   These AADR have many advantages over other technique to achieve ultra-low temperature and there is considerable commercial potential.   We propose to design control instrumentation for advanced adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators (AADR).   The first step is to develop a thermal and electrical model of the basic operating parameters of various AADR.   The next step is to split the design into hardware development and software development.  Hardware development will take the results of the thermal-electrical model and design a circuit.  This involves trade studies of different methods to measure and control temperature, magnets and heat switches.  The software design focuses on optimizing the control of the multiple ADR stages and their timing sequence.   This work will result in a control program and hardware design, which will be integrated together in Phase II

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
An AADR, and the Continuous ADR especially, is a disruptive technology that is a more efficient method to reach temperatures below 100mK than existing dilution refrigerators.  With the control instrumentation that we will develop, the AADR will be able to meet a wide range of applications.  This includes physics and material science studies at temperature below 100mK. There is also an industrial application of semiconductor material analysis. Using advanced x-ray detectors, cooled to 100mK, semiconductors can be probed for material defects and impurities.   A reliable control instrument?taking the AADR from research labs to factory floor?is required to open this market.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The major application is for better ground testing of advanced photon detectors for NASA.  A complete control system for Advanced Adiabatic Demagnetization will make for more efficient testing of detectors and detector components.  Additionally, there is a broader application for any material testing at temperature below 100mK.  A controller for an AADR is an enabling technology that extends the utility of ADR beyond detector testing.

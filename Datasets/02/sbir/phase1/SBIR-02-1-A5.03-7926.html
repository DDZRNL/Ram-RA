<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Aluminum is a common fuel used in solid propellant formulations. The amount of aluminum used varies from 9%, 18% and as high as 21%. It is a known fact that the smaller the particle size, the more surface area and the higher the burn rate. Recently the manufacture of Ultra Fine Aluminum Particles (UFAP) has been easier to produce. Recent literature on UFAP testing indicates that it has burn rates up to 50% higher than standard aluminum. In addition test data indicates up to 70% higher propellant mass flux. This information forms the basis for developing higher energy density propellants. Not much attention however has been paid to the use of UFAP to replace standard aluminum in solid propellants or to use of the UFAP in hybrid or slurry propellant systems.  A key data point in the efficacy of this is that test data shows that the UFAP can be used in a water burning system. The proposed effort will evaluate the use of UFAP in solid, hybrid and liquid slurry propellants.

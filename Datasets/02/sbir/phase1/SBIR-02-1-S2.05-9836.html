<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The development of high-performance, broadband, polarizing beamsplitters is paramount to the evolution of future optical and communications systems that require the use of polarized light. Conventional polarizing beamsplitters are limited by small fields of view and narrow spectral regions. Cornerstone Research Group, Inc. (CRG) proposes to develop broadband, polarizing beamsplitters based on a proprietary combination of nematic and chiral liquid crystals materials. The unique materials and processing allow the films to be transferred from the substrate on which they are fabricated and to either remain free-standing or to be applied to another surface as a coating.  In addition, by altering the composition of the materials, the wavelength regime can be tuned. The bandwidth can be increased by introducing a pitch gradient throughout the film thickness. 
<br>The proposed technology will directly address NASA's requirement for novel optical coatings for use in the EUV, UV, visible, IR and far IR for filters, beamsplitters, polarizers and reflectors. Subtopic S2.05 calls for broadband polarizing beamsplitters, which this proposal specifically addresses.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The technology presented in this proposal has many applications in the field of optics. The reflective films could be utilized as reflectors for imaging applications, such as HMD visor coatings. The films also have applications in such areas as communications systems and liquid crystal projectors. By integrating two films integrated together, high-performance filters could be fabricated for laser eye protection as well as filters for delicate, high-cost optical devices, such as infrared detectors. In addition, the films are conformable to complex surfaces. Therefore, they could be laminated onto optical surfaces and used as polarized coatings or filters.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary application for the chiral liquid crystal polymer films discussed in this proposal is broadband beamsplitting. The ability to split an incident beam into right- and left-circularly polarized beams (or S-and P-polarized beams) could, therefore, be utilized anywhere where polarization preservation is needed or desired, such as polarizing beamsplitters for shared-aperture laser radar applications.
<br>The unique ability to make CLCP membranes opens up the possibility of utilizing such reflectors for lightweight, space-based mirrors. By integrating two membranes of opposite handedness, a high-performance reflector can be fabricated that reflects in excess of 95% of the incident light. Because the materials are polymerized, they possess an inherent structural integrity and a slight degree of shape memory characteristic of polymeric materials. Additionally, with such high reflectivities over a broad wavelength range, it is conceivable that the reflectors could utilized as a lightweight propulsion sail.

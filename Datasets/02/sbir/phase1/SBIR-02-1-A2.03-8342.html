<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Pulse detonation engines hold promise to increase performance of air-breathing propulsion systems by taking advantage of the increase in cycle efficiency due to the constant-volume heat addition characteristics of detonative combustion. SPIRITECH is developing a pulse detonation engine, the Rotating Chamber PDE, which utilizes multiple combustion chambers on a rotating spool to improve inlet and nozzle performance and to eliminate the need for valves. Efficient flow of the fuel-air mixture into the detonation chambers as they rotate is critical for achieving high levels of thrust. A flow test is proposed using a rotating plate to simulate the flow characteristics into the rotating detonation chamber. This Phase I study will provide the data necessary to quantify the flow efficiency through pulse detonation engines. Additional testing of other critical PDE engine components and key technologies will be performed in the Phase II program to develop the technology base required for a prototype in Phase III.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Rotating Chamber PDE is a lightweight, air-breathing engine offering high specific impulse. This engine offers advantages to replace more expensive turbojets and less capable rockets in high speed aircraft. Additionally, it may be incorporated in combined cycle applications, where it is combined with a scramjet for a single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicle (RLV) or as the first stage in a two-stage-to-orbit RLV using rockets or a rocket-based combined cycle for the second stage.

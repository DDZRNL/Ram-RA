<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Technical Abstract
<br>Applicote  Associates  proposes  a  6  month  $70K program to establish the
<br>feasibility  of  controlled  laser doping of silicon carbide as an enabling
<br>process  step  for the fabrication of advanced microelectronics and sensors
<br>requiring  thermal management, high temperature stability, high power, long
<br>life,  radiation  hardness and nanoscale features.  Doping, is the focus of
<br>this  project with the intent of understanding additional diffusion driving
<br>forces,  in addition to the conventional Fick?s driving force, which may arise from laser dopant substrate  interactions.  The laser doping technology proposed
<br>by  AppliCote  is derived from patented direct write technology, owned by
<br>the  PI,  that  eliminates  the  need for additive material processes.  The
<br>ultimate  success  for  microsystem  integration  based  upon  wide bandgap
<br>semiconductors,  such as silicon carbide, is dependent on materials/process
<br>development,  which  drives  1) RF/Microwave/Millimeter wave Technology, 2)
<br>High  Power Conversion and Distribution Electronics and 3) semiconductor UV
<br>Optical  Sources.  A  target  device  to  be  addressed  in Phase II is the
<br>development of a terahertz Schottky diode signal processor.

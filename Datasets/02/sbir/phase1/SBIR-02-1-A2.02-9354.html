<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Hydrogen centered technologies such as fuel cells have generated much attention as a means of reducing emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. Unfortunately there are no ideal solutions to the problems of hydrogen production and storage. An innovative integrated hybrid solid state electrochemical system is proposed as a means of overcoming many of the fundamental problems pertaining to hydrogen production and purification, fuel reformation, and fuel cell operation. The proposed process is a physical, chemical and thermal integration of three operations; (1) hot electrolysis of steam to produce high purity hydrogen, (2) electrochemical partial oxidation of hydrocarbon fuel, (3) electric power generation by a solid oxide fuel cell fueled by the reformed hydrocarbon. Required process inputs are air, steam and hydrocarbon fuel, producing electric power, high purity hydrogen and an exhaust stream suitable for CO2 sequestration, containing only carbon dioxide and steam.  The concept allows design flexibility in meeting the desired mix of electric power produced by the integrated solid oxide fuel cell, and high purity product hydrogen suitable for use in low temperature fuel cells. Current developments in intermediate temperature electrolyte materials will enable operation of this device in the temperature range centered around 600?aC, favorable to reforming thermodynamics.

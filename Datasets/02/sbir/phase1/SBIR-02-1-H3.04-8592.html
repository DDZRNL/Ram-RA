<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In response to NASA?s need for miniature sensors for detecting and measuring electrostatic potential and charge distribution generated on payloads, spacecraft, and landers, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop an innovative Differential Electrostatic Optical Sensor (DEOS).  DEOS will measure the quasi-stationary (steady state or low frequency) charge induced in its electrodes by a local electrostatic field.  Modulation, rectifying, integration, and optical attenuation will be accomplished by the optically driven structure of three cantilevered membranes.  The compact, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) device will have a very low optical power consumption, will require no galvanic link to the source of an electrostatic field, and will have no vulnerability to electromagnetic influences.  The unique DEOS design will permit it to be safely used in any environment, including toxic and explosive vapors, liquid and solid propellants, the ionosphere of earth, and in the atmospheres or on the surfaces of other planets.  In Phase I, POC will fabricate a laboratory model and demonstrate the feasibility of the DEOS technology.  In Phase II, POC will design and fabricate an engineering prototype for field-testing.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
POC?s Differential Electrostatic Optical Sensor will have several commercial applications in mapping electrostatic fields, and in the transportation and power industries for measuring ionization and triboelectric charges to prevent undesirable electrostatic discharge that could harm both personnel and equipment.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The fully developed, compact, and durable DEOS will be used in electromagnetic physics measurements of Human Exploration and Development of Space (HEDS) Enterprise of NASA.
<br>As a part of environmental research, DEOS will be very useful in experiments of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory?s (JPL?s) New Millennium Program.  In particular, it will benefit the Geospace Electrodynamic Connections (GEC) mission.

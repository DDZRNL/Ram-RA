<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Our overall goal for this project is to develop the technologies necessary for fabrication of efficient cryogen-free superconducting magnets that can operate at temperatures of 6-10K. In the Phase I program, we will demonstrate that an efficient solenoid magnet system may be built using small diameter Nb3Sn wires employing the react-then-wind approach. As a part of this work we will fabricate an efficient 3T magnet with an operating current of 8A and an operating temperature of 10K. The magnet will be tested and then used by NASA in an ongoing R&D in the area of Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigeration.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This program will establish practical and economical technologies in the areas of superconductor, and superconducting magnet technologies for operation at 6-10K. The results will impact the design, fabrication, and use of superconducting magnets for applications in space, high energy physics, medical, low temperature physics, spectroscopy, imaging, and chemistry.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Highest efficiency adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators useful for achieving very low temperatures in space missions require superconducting magnets with low operating current that work at temperatures in the range of 6-10K. This program is geared toward the development of technologies for manufacturing of such magnets.

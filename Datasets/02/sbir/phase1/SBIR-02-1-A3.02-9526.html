<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Metron Aviation, Inc. builds a tool for Traffic Flow Management (TFM) that integrates existing and emerging technologies in the areas of modeling and operations analysis to enable the evaluation of proposed TFM initiatives (Figure 1). The key innovation of this effort is the integration of the Post Operations Evaluation Tool (POET) and the Future ATC Concepts Evaluation Tool (FACET) in order to accomplish new tasks that neither of these tools can do alone. This development leverages the following key features: FACET?s trajectory prediction and modeling capabilities, and POET?s mature database management system and operations analysis tools. By integrating the tools we provide a system that allows Traffic Flow Managers to investigate future TFM initiatives in real-time. These users then exploit the tool?s analysis capabilities to observe and compare the benefits and impacts of several proposed initiatives prior to implementing them operationally.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The integrated tool researched in the Phase I and II efforts has FAA and Airline Operations Control (AOC) commercial potential. The tool is designed primarily for Traffic Flow Managers to allow them to model proposed initiatives prior to implementation. These individuals are already familiar with Metron?s operational POET tool. Leveraging POET analysis techniques and displays, we will be providing a TFM Decision Support Tool that is both familiar and well integrated. 
<br>Under the CDM program, AOCs use airline-specific versions of strategic planning tools such as FSM to collaborate on control decisions and allocate resources. As the propsed tool leverages models for equitable delay distributions in proposed initiatives, AOCs would benefit from the ability to provide input to such actions. Furthermore, airlines may be particularly interested in monitoring their relative performance using the equity metrics we have proposed. This tool could be marketed to airlines under the CDM program.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA currently uses FACET for, as the name describes, the evaluation of future ATC concepts. Integrating POET and FACET provides NASA with rich analysis and data visualization capabilities for such evaluations. Furthermore, as the number of data sources used by FACET grow, a robust database management system, such as the one proposed in the effort, will be helpful for organizing and managing it. Though not treated explicitly in the proposal, a significant side effect of the proposed effort is that the integration of FACET with the POET database provides quick access to months of historical ETMS data currently archived by Metron.

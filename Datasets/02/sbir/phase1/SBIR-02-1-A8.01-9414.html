<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Design-oriented steady and unsteady aerodynamic analysis tools for Aeroelastic / Aeroservoelastic evaluation lag significantly behind other multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) developments for aerospace vehicle design. In almost all MDO studies to date involving configuration shape optimization, dynamic Aeroelastic/Aeroservoelastic constraints were left out. Flutter, gust stresses, vibration, fatigue, ride comfort, handling qualities ? all extremely important ? still cannot be accounted for in an automated design process involving configuration shape variations. Proposed here is the creation of a comprehensive design-oriented unsteady-aerodynamic methodology to enhance current MDO/MSO capabilities with Aeroelastic/Aeroservoelastic shape sensitivities. ZONA Technology?s proven ZAERO code will serve as the aerodynamic base for this development. In phase I the new methodology will provide sensitivities with respect to planform shape design variables for aerodynamic matrices, pressures, and loads. Subsonic, sonic, supersonic, and hypersonic Mach numbers will be covered as well as order reduction techniques for repetitive generation of aerodynamic matrices during optimization. Easy interfaces with general finite element codes will be introduced and validated. In phase II non-planar surfaces and general 3D wing-body sensitivity solutions and reduced-order approximations will be obtained and validated. This new general capability will fit any aerospace vehicle MDO environment, and will provide a crucial critically needed MDO building block.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed design-oriented software (ZAERO-DO) will become the unique and the only Aeroelastic/Aeroservoelastic-Aerodynamic tool for shape sensitivity/uncertainty evaluation and shape optimization of flight vehicles.  ZAERO-DO will become a software standard, providing aerodynamics for Aeroelastic/Aeroservoelastic constraints throughout the full Mach number and frequency ranges.  ZONA plans to package it as stand-alone software for Aerodynamic/ASE analysis/sensitivity/approximations.  Shape/sizing optimization can be carried out when ZAERO-DO is interfaced with FEM software with structural shape sensitivity capabilities.  It can be adopted for MDO of a wide class of aerospace vehicles: UAV/UCAV, supersonic transports, space launch vehicles, RLVs, blended wing/body, flying wings, joined-wings, hypervelocity missiles, winged projectiles (with optimized fin/canard/wing). It will be an important Aeroelastic/ASE design tool for current NASA projects: morphing aircraft and revolutionary vehicles.  Potential customers include the R&D and design arms of Government and private industry, including ZAERO users (see 10.1). With ZONA?s customer network, the marketing of ZAERO-DO will be straightforward.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Design-oriented software for producing steady and unsteady aerodynamic loads for Aeroelastic/Aeroservoelastic shape design of complex flight vehicles is still non-existent, leading to a gap in every current MDO capability for flight vehicle design. NASA has been working for many years toward achieving a universal MDO system with capabilities that would cover both sizing and shape optimization, and would include integration with advanced structures, CFD aerodynamics, and controls. The proposed methodology is aimed at providing an expedient aerodynamic computation capability for rapid evaluation of standard static and dynamic Aeroelastic/Aeroservoelastic constraints in conceptual and preliminary design, which is beyond present CFD capabilities. Thus, the proposed methodology will enhance NASA?s flight vehicle MDO system with capability for generating Aeroelastic/Aeroservoelastic sensitivity and constraints. It will support design studies for practically every category of flight vehicles including blended wing/bodies, joined-wings, supersonic transports, morphing aircraft, space planes, RLVs, Mars planes, and any revolutionary concept pursued.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Leveraging extensive experience from major airspace re-design projects, Metron develops a software system to model the NAS-wide environmental consequences of new airspace concepts.  The NAS Environmental Impact Model (NASEIM) is innovative in the following ways:
<br>(1)	It solves the NAS-wide data-integration problem; 
<br>(2)	It solves the data-transformation problem for new airspace concepts involving new procedures, aircraft, emissions characteristics, and airspace usage; and 
<br>(3)	It solves the computational-burden and scenario-comparison problems inherent in large-scale environmental modeling of new airspace concepts.  
<br>This enables NASA to determine, early in concept development, which concepts may have either adverse or beneficial effects on the environment, particularly with regard to aircraft noise.  This also enables NASA to determine which elements of the new airspace concepts are causing significant environmental impacts, and to modify the concepts to ameliorate the associated environmental impacts.  Key features of the Metron approach include NAS-wide modeling of impacts (not just around airports), automated adherence to concept-specific flight profiles, and the ability to model proposed concept-specific changes in operational procedures, aircraft types, and levels of noise emission.  This approach also provides integrated comparison of different scenarios, quantification and localization of impacts, and analysis of the causes of differences in impact across scenarios.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Phase I and Phase II commercial potential for embedding NASEIM in VAMS is significant in two areas:
<br>?	Commercial firms of all types (airlines, aerospace companies, consultants, etc.) need access to a full-scale simulation environment for gauging the operational utility and feasibility of new airspace and ATM concepts; and
<br>?	The same firms will need to gauge the environmental impacts of proposed new concepts in order to show both operational and environmental feasibility.  Without the latter, no new concepts will be able to survive the environmental assessment process mandated by the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA).

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Phases I and II embed NASEIM into VAMS and lead to NASA capabilities critical to airspace modernization
<br>
<br>?	Enables NASA to determine, early in concept development, which concepts may have either adverse or beneficial effects on the environment, particularly with regard to aircraft noise;
<br>?	Enables NASA to compare the environmental and operational benefits within a unified simulation environment that uses the same flight and trajectory data;
<br>?	 Enables NASA to determine which elements of the new airspace concepts are causing the most significant environmental impacts, and, where appropriate, to modify the concepts to ameliorate the associated environmental impacts.

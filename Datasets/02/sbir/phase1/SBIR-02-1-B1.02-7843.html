<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Two critical aspects for microgravity materials experiments are to ensure the safety of the International Space Station (ISS) crew/hardware and to maximize the level of obtainable science.  Several of the materials processing experiments for the Quench Module Insert (QMI), one of the first Experiment Modules (EM) to be used aboard the ISS, require processing aluminum or aluminum alloys.  Recent tests by NASA have shown refractory metal cartridges have limited resistance to attack from molten aluminum.  In addition, these cartridge materials have relatively low emissivities which result in reduced rates of heat transfer from the heater core to samples being processed; thus, the level of obtainable science is not maximized.  Recently, tantalum carbide has been identified as having a high resistance to attack by molten aluminum as well as having a significantly higher emissivity than typical refractory metal cartridge materials.  Therefore, an investigation is proposed to develop methods for producing tantalum carbide on the internal and external surfaces of containment cartridges for use in microgravity furnaces.  Successful completion of this work will enhance furnace efficiency by lowering power requirements and increasing quench rates, increase sample containment reliability/safety, and reduce the cost to produce sample containment cartridges.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercial potential for the technology being developed during this effort is very high.  Potential applications included, but are not limited to, high temperature furnace and retort components, rocket motor throat inserts, radiation shields, heat pipes, power generation equipment, nuclear components, turbines, combustion chambers, incinerators, beam and sputter targets.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA?s desire to obtain the maximum amount of science from microgravity materials science experiments along with the need to provide safe and reliable containment methods to protect extremely expensive space hardware and the lives of the crews occupying those facilities more than justifies the development of the proposed technology.

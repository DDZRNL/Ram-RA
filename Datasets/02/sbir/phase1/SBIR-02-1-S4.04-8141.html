<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
	We propose to develop a lightweight, heat-resistant Diamonite(TM)-bonded C/C composite for thermal protection of re-entry vehicles.  Our previous work has shown that nanostructured carbon produced by pressure-assisted polymerization of mixed fullerenes creates a new high specific strength carbon material called Diamonite(TM), which has mechanical properties closer to diamond than to graphite. Building on this experience, in Phase I, we will pressure infiltrate a woven fiber carbon preform with mixed fullerenes, and transform the infiltrated material into Diamonite(TM), thereby forming a Diamonite(TM)-bonded C/C composite. The fiber architecture can be computer designed to match the performance requirements of the shielding material.  In Phase I, the best parameters for pressure-assisted polymerization of the new composite material and an optimal reinforcing fibrous structure will be determined.  We will machine experimental samples and determine the value of specific strength, thermal stability, and other properties needed for the design of an optimal thermal protection system.  In Phase II, we will determine the conditions for scaling the process and fabrication of a prototype thermal protection shield, which can be evaluated by Lockheed Martin. The manufacturing of new material and protection parts will be established in Phase III.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The developed composite carbon material and process will enable the design and implementation of a new class of high performance C/C composites for thermal protection of re-entry vehicles.  It will also benefit other aerospace applications, such as nozzles for thrusters.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
High temperature capacitors based on a new family of ferroelectrics are proposed.  The Curie temperatures of the (1-x)BiMeO3 - (x) PbTiO3 (Me = Sc, In, Yb, or Fe) family have been found to range from 450C to >600C.  Multilayer ceramic capacitors based on these materials offer a distinct advance in the working temperature compared to currently available devices.  The aim of this Phase I project is to fabricate prototype high temperature capacitors with capacitance values ranging from 10nF to 1microF at ~300C using standard multilayer capacitor fabrication techniques.  After initial studies determine the most desirable composition(s), prototype capacitors will be fabricated and tested.  Electrical testing will primarily be focused on reliability issues including HALT testing, impedance spectroscopy, insulation resistance, and leakage mechanisms.  Finally, the performance of the prototype capacitors will be compared to commercially available devices.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Potential NASA applications of the proposed high-temperature capacitors include robust high-temperature electronics, power distribution systems, and power conversion systems.  The proposed devices will capable of functioning at temperatures well in excess of commercially available devices.  This advance in operating temperature will reduce, or completely eliminate the need for cooling systems, thereby reducing the overall size and weight of electronic systems aboard spacecraft.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Potential commercial applications include high power electronics, signal conditioning, avionics, and consumer electronics.  Decoupling capacitors for use in high-performance computing devices offer the possibility of developing a family of high-volume products that would lower device costs to both NASA and non-NASA consumers.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A number of fatal aircraft accidents in recent years have been linked to component failures. With the predicted increase in air traffic these numbers are likely to increase. With reduction of fatal accidents as motivation, the proposal plans to investigate design of fault tolerant control system for aircrafts undergoing actuator failures. The feasible approach for such a control scheme is to predesign various controllers anticipating these failures and switching to appropriate controller when the failure occurs. It is found that use of nominal controller when actuators fail may lead to catastrophic accidents. Switching to an appropriate controller enabled by the available redundancy in actuation allows the system to perform adequately even when these failures occur. However, the predesign for actuator failures is not trivial as the position at which the actuators fail is not known a priori. For linear systems the problem has been solved in recent literature; however failures when they occur can cause excursions into nonlinear regimes. The primary thrust of this research would be to extend the results in nonlinear control theory to accommodate actuator failures in aircraft.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Actuator failures such as stuck control surfaces when they occur in commercial aircraft can cause catastrophic accidents and fatal loss of life. The primary application area of the proposed work is to improve the safety and performance of these vehicles in face of such failures. Since the proposed work addresses the problem of actuator failures using the systems approach these techniques will be applicable to a broad range of systems including other aerospace vehicles, ground and sea vehicles, hazardous chemical plants, nuclear power plant, robotic manipulators and others. The value addition in increased safety and performance achieved because of the control techniques to be developed from this research cannot be overestimated. Additionally, the design techniques will also provide a framework in order to synthesize fault tolerant systems making contributions to the development of autonomous systems.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Several design techniques to be developed in the proposed work are directly applicable to improve the safety and performance of aerospace vehicles in case of components failures involving the actuators. Since NASA has a great interest in developing autonomous systems, the work will provide a means to synthesize fault tolerant systems which can continue to perform under adverse operating circumstances even after failures. These techniques prove to be invaluable when especially when the system is deployed in a remote location or when continued safety and performance are desired features of the system.

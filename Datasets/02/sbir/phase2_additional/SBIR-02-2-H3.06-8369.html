<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
HyPerComp Engineering, Inc. (HEI) proposes to develop well characterized, reliable filament wound composite pressure vessels for cryogenic and other low temperature applications. The proposed effort also explores the potential for a significant improvement in filament wound composite pressure vessels performance (end results: lighter weights) through cryogenic process treatment.
<br>
<br>Both the aerospace and the commercial communities have shown significant interest in using filament wound composite pressure vessels for cryogenic applications.  Investigation has shown that to date this usage has been limited and that ?off the shelf? composite pressure vessels have been used.  Constituent materials and the pressure vessel designs have not been well characterized for these types of applications and as such the margins for these applications are not well defined.  This in turn means that the reliability of such usage is basically unknown.  
<br>
<br>HyPerComp Engineering has recently completed a Phase one SBIR through NASA, MSFC.  This successful effort demonstrated some significant material degradation and the potential for significant improvements in composite pressure vessel performance in cryogenic usage (NAS8?03027).  The effort proposed herein builds upon that knowledge, significantly expands the data base, and will result in reliable ?off the shelf? technology for composite pressure vessels in cryogenic applications.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Mr. Joe Lewis and his assistant Lorie Grimes-Ledesma of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) have expressed keen interest in our phase I SBIR cryogenic work and  subsequent follow on work.  While they have an overall general interest in lightweight cryogenic pressure vessels for propulsion systems they also have a very specific application of interest.  That application would be a spacecraft currently on the drawing boards and referred to as the ?icy moons of Jupiter mission?.  It is planned to use cryogenically stored xenon gas as a power source on that spacecraft and a high performance cryogenic pressure vessel will be required.  A letter of support and interest from JPL is attached in appendix A of this report.
<br>
<br>We have also been informed that there is interest within NASA for the long term storage of fuels and propellants in what we would refer to as ?orbiting gas stations?.  These would be fuel depots storing fuels (perhaps liquid hydrogen) under cryogenic storage conditions.
<br>
<br>The emergence of a potential ?cryogenic treatment? to improve the performance of lightweight composite tanks is certainly of interest within NASA where the inert weight of pressure storage tanks has always ?been the enemy?.  Any means of reducing weight while at the same time improving performance and reliability can only be seen in a positive light.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
HEI has performed preliminary work with the Waldemar S. Nelson and Company, Inc. of New Orleans, LA exploring the potential of using very cold (approaching cryogenic temperatures) compressed natural gas storage in oceanic transport systems.  The very cold temperatures significantly increase the storage density of the compressed natural gas. 
<br>
<br>While this project is currently in the evaluation stage there is little question that it and similar projects to increase efficiency in the storage and transportation of gaseous fuels (hydrogen, LNG, CNG) would derive significant benefit from an improved understanding of how composite pressure vessels perform under cryogenic and/or very cold environments.  A letter of support and interest from Waldemar S. Nelson and Company is attached in appendix B of this report.
<br>
<br>The Department of the Army through its Engineering Research and Development Corps of Engineers has expressed interest in the cryogenic pressure vessel work being done by HEI.  As expressed in their attached letter of support and interest (appendix C) they see lightweight cryogenic pressure vessels as a key element in improved fuel storage for aerospace, military, and commercial applications.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Driven by research and development of advanced photon detectors--which require temperatures below 100mK-- there is considerable research into new ADR designs and techniques. In particular the continuous ADR (CADR)has many advantages over other technique to achieve ultra-low temperature and there is considerable commercial potential. We propose to design control system (including instrumentation) for a CADR. Phase II will start with a review of the circuit model and software model developed in PhaseI. We will build a complete prototype insturment and control software.  They will be developed and tested interanlly and with an on-site evaluation at contracting site. We will also study system improvments in particular XML web server control and open loop control for the upper stages. All studies and testing results will be used to develop the final integrated control system.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Continuous ADR (CADR), is a disruptive technology that is a more efficient method to reach temperatures below 100mK than existing dilution refrigerators. With the control instrumentation that we will develop, the AADR will be able to meet a wide range of applications. This includes physics and material science studies at temperature below 100mK. There is also an industrial application of semiconductor material analysis. Using advanced x-ray detectors, cooled to 100mK, semiconductors can be probed for material defects and impurities. A reliable control system is necessary for full commercial sucesss.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The major application is for better ground testing of advanced photon detectors for NASA. A complete control system for Advanced Adiabatic Demagnetization will make for more efficient testing of detectors and detector components. Additionally, there is a broader application for any material testing at temperature below 100mK. A controller for an CADR is an enabling technology that extends the utility of ADR beyond detector testing.

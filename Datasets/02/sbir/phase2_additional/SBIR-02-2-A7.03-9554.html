<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Through numerical simulations and wind tunnel testing, Nielsen Engineering & Research (NEAR) has demonstrated that their acoustic sensing technology can be used to quantify the magnitude and direction of the local shear stress vector.  Because the instrument can 1) measure shear stress values up to 100 Pa, 2) account for atmospheric variations in local fluid properties, and 3) accommodate relatively large streamwise pressure gradients, it is well suited for use in flight test research and commercial aircraft applications.  During the previous Phase I program, NEAR identified some deficiencies in the current sensor housing design.  Thus, the proposed Phase II effort will focus on developing a robust housing which can withstand the vibration, temperature, pressure, and moisture levels found in flight.  Sensor housing designs will be developed and refined through a series of wind tunnel tests using tunnels capable of simulating the flight environment.  The final sensor design will be demonstrated through flight testing on NASA Dryden?s F-15B.  In addition to the sensor redesign effort, NEAR will develop a flight-qualified electronics package for use in the flight test program.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The present proposal defines the tasks necessary to develop NEAR's shear stress technology into a flight test research instrument.  The ability to generate real-time shear stress measurements accurately and reliably over a wide range of flight speeds and ambient conditions will help researchers at Dryden Flight Research Center to evaluate and expand the flight envelope of modern aircraft.  Researchers at NASA Langley have also expressed interest in NEAR=s technology for use as a wind tunnel instrument, and for incorporation into closed-loop flow control systems.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are many commercial applications for a robust, accurate, nonintrusive, flight-ready shear stress sensor.  The U.S. Army is interested in NEAR's sensor for use in detecting the onset of dynamic stall on helicopter rotor blades.  Commercial interest and financial support for this technology have been received from Goodrich Sensor Systems.  Their objective is to develop shear stress sensor-based products for transport aircraft including stall warning sensors and ice/contamination sensors.

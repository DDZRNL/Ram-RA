<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Small Business Innovation Research project concerns the novel application of cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy to determine isotope ratios of carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor in extreme environments. These environments, which include deep-sea hydrothermal vents, ocean boreholes, underwater volcanoes, and terrestrial aquifers, are of interest to the NASA Ames Astrobiology Group because they may harbor subsurface microbiological ecosystems, whose occurrences can be detected by measuring such isotope ratios. In Phase I, we have demonstrated the technical feasibility of making all three of these ratio measurements in a single, multiplexed instrument using both simulated and actual biogenically-generated gas samples. These ratios have been determined to better than 0.2%, which is sufficient to determine the presence of biological activity. The Phase II effort will consist primarily of packaging the instrument for extreme environments and subsequent field-testing in conjunction with NASA. The final Phase II prototype will be delivered to the NASA Ames Astrobiology Group. This instrument will be the first remotely operable sensor capable of measuring isotope ratios with sufficient precision to indicate the presence of biological activity in a variety of extreme environments.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The characterization of extreme environments is of primary importance to the NASA Ames Astrobiology Group, because they provide a mechanism to sample novel biospheres. For example, deep-sea hydrothermal vents sample a biosphere which represents one of the few anaerobic environments that is devoid of photosynthesis and may emulate the conditions beneath ice crusts on Europa, Callisto, and Mars. One of the key indicators of such a Subsurface Lithotrophic Microbiological Ecosystem (SLiME) is a change in the carbon dioxide and methane isotope ratios. Our instrument will permit in situ measurements of such ratios in a variety of extreme environments of interest to NASA.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
An accurate determination of isotope ratios in an inexpensive, portable device has significant commercial impact in medical diagnostics, the petroleum industry, and environmental monitoring. Projected sales of the ratiometer in the former two areas alone are expected to exceed $65M over the next five years. Moreover, the proposed prototype can be readily modified to monitor various industrial gases, further increasing its commercial impact. During the Phase I research effort, considerable progress has been made in developing an industrial process control monitor in collaboration with Dow Chemical Company.  Los Gatos Research is actively pursuing such commercial ventures and support through the SBIR Program would greatly bolster our efforts.

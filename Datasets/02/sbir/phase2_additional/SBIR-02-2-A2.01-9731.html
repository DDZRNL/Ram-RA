<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The exhaust flow from a turbofan engine operating at typical cruise conditions generates noise as turbulent flow interacts with the basic shock cell pattern. This can be a significant source of noise within the aircraft cabin. The proposed innovation is a new method for testing the acoustics of model scale turbofan engine exhaust systems at cruise conditions in a transonic wind tunnel. This would complement the aerodynamic tests now conducted in the wind tunnel. Currently, acoustic data at cruise conditions is only obtained from costly flight tests. Wind tunnel tests are desirable to simulate the proper flight conditions, but acoustic measurements are difficult in this environment. The new method involves three specific areas of innovation: a) phased-array noise measurement methods, b) evaluating potential modifications to an existing wind tunnel, and c) evaluating means for reducing model air supply noise. Phase I demonstrated that each of these problems has been solved. The proposed Phase II research will combine these processes into an efficient measurement procedure. It will lead to a successful commercial service to airframe manufacturers faced with meeting recently enacted legislation governing noise in the aircraft cabin.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA conducts acoustic measurements on aircraft systems and components in several wind tunnels. The research to be conducted on this program will complement NASA tests. The existing subspace array methodology will be refined for use on this program to allow a small microphone array to perform like a much larger array using standard rechniques. It is common in the field of communication but has not been applied to aeroacoustic studies. It is not restricted to the transonic problem and may provide superior performance to standard techniques now in use for the low speed aeroacoustic problem. In particular, it may improve the noise source location techniques now used to identify source locations for tests conducted in NASA wind tunnels, such as the NATR at NASA Glenn. This research will provide advancement of adaptive beamforming techniques applied to conventional aeroacoustic wind tunnel tests.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The principal commercial application of this research would be available to commercial airframe and engine manufacturers interested in minimizing cabin interior noise levels created by the operation of turbofan engines. Recently enacted noise legislation in Europe not only increases the visibility of this service but expands the need for related acoustic tests at high speed. This includes other airframe noise sources such as the turbulent boundary layer on the fuselage and flaps, slats, and landing gear that may get deployed in high speed flow. Evaluation of the acoustic treatment used in the inlet and exhaust ducts of turbofan engines is another possibility. We have begun discussions with engine manufacturers to determine how acoustic array technology can be applied to these tests possibly as part of maintenance diagnostics. Military applications include the weapons bay cavity and buffet issues which require evaluation at high speed to prevent failures.

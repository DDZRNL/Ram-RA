<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose the development of an innovative software tool that will permit payload developers with no human factors training to produce interfaces that are well suited to the tasks required by the payload, and that conform to NASA commonality standards. Developing such a tool represents a significant challenge; thus, we suggest an integrated approach drawing upon a range of AI techniques. An intelligent, visually-based knowledge elicitor will guide the developer through the task capture and analysis process. The resulting task model and a battery of intelligent design advisors, assisting in everything from widget selection and initialization to graphical element distribution, will allow the system to collaborate with the developer in constructing a task-based interface. The resulting interface will be analyzed as a whole by design critics drawn from human factors research and NASA commonality standards. The developer will then be able to run usability testing from within the same framework, and the tool will help him analyze the testing results. Finally, the developer will be able to export the interface in code form for continued application development. We proved the feasibility of our approach with a Phase I prototype and propose the implementation of a full-scale payload interface development system. 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed system can be marketed as a tool for interface development for small and medium-sized companies that cannot afford to hire a human factors expert, or for in-house development at large companies, where maintaining standards conformity is important. 
<P>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed system will be a valuable payload interface development tool. NASA can distribute it to payload developers to help insure consistent, high quality interfaces. They can also use it as an information exchange tool between NASA human factors experts and the remote payload developers.

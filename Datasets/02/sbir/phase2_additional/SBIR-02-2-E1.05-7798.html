<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The present invention provides an ultra-reliable and low loss fiberoptic manifold for lightweight, high-efficiency, photonic phased-array antennas. Our approach is sate-of-the-art in design and closely coupled with proven volume fiber optic component manufacturing techniques, holding a promise of realizing space qualified optical digital delay with performance and cost that have not been achieved before. By using all solid-state inorganic material construction, the proposed optical switching based component technology overcomes the limitation in speed and long-term reliability associated with other approaches.  The proposed novel photonic digital time delay can potentially be part of NASA?s next generation large space radar phase-array antennas in which the phase control among antenna elements is beyond electronic means.  During the short Phase I, we have successfully demonstrated the full functionality of the proposed approach.  The prototype 4 bit photonic delay performed over a temperature range from ?40oC to 75oC with switching speed faster than 100 microsecond, as well as latching and 5V low drive voltage.  Moreover, our study indicates that the electro-optic version could offer fast msecond response time and excellent optical performance covering an extremely wide temperature range of ?75?C to 85?C.   The Phase I work laid a foundation for further Phase II development.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Radar is undergoing a significant change in status as a sensing instrument.  New systems must accomplish more with fewer resources: power, equipment mass and volume, operating and maintenance personnel, and cost. For NASA applications; microwave radar based sensors have proven to be ideal instruments for many Earth science applications. Examples include global freeze/thaw monitoring and soil moisture mapping, accurate global wind retrieval and snow inundation mapping, global 3-D mapping of rainfall and cloud systems, precise topographic mapping and natural hazard monitoring, global ocean topographic mapping and glacial ice mapping for climate change studies. For global coverage and the long-term study of Earth's eco-systems, space-based radar is of particular interest to Earth scientists.  For large size space radar antenna, photonic true time delay provides the critical technology to link each segment.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Variable optical delays have potential applications in both optical data networks and optical logic circuits. The applications involve synchronizing internal components of such networks and logic circuits to external data streams and other internal components, respectively. Variable optical delay can also be used to compensate polarization mode dispersion in high-speed data transmission.
<br>
<br>The proposed high-speed optical device can be a key building block for high-performance, cost-effective solutions for managing aggregated OC-192 and above optical bandwidth networks in metro environments. It provides for data rate, protocol and data format transparency and its high-speed logic interface enables unique capabilities.  With a speed of less than 1 millisecond, the proposed switch supports unique light management functionalities such as multicasting and broadcasting. The proposed technology holds a promise of extending switching to dynamic reconfiguration, performance monitoring, and traffic management while power balancing, attenuation and equalization management that are inherent in the switch fabric.

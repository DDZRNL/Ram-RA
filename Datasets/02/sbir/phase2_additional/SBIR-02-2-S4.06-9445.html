<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
High energy pulsed fiber lasers have been considered to be an enabling technology to build high power transmitters for future high rate space communications. However, to achieve a high power at a high repetition rate > 10 MHz and with a good pulse shape and a high extinction ratio still remains an issue unsolved. PolarOnyx proposes a novel approach targeting to make over 10 MHz high repetition rate high power laser and resolve the issues of pulse distortion and nonlinear effects by employing our proprietary technologies in specialty fibers and fiber lasers. In Phase I time frame, we have experimentally demonstrated the pulse shaping effects to achieve Gaussian shape pulses at a repetition rate up to 30 MHz and with a pulse width down to 4 ns, peak power of 10 W, and an extinction ratio over 30 dB.  This proves that the proposed pulse shaping idea is feasible for implementation and provides a foundation for us to continue the research and development in Phase II to achieve 1 ns pulse with over 1 kW peak power, for which more serious pulse distortion has to be compensated. A compact prototype will be delivered at the end of Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed pulse shaping fiber laser will have a great potential to be used as a transmitter for NASA?s deep space high speed optical communications. It can provide a narrow pulse width with a high peak power and a high extinction ratio. In addition to the deep space mission, it can also be used as a laser source for NASA?s remote sensing system, and as a transmitter for optical communication systems between GEO, LEO, and earth.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are a number of non-NASA potential applications for the proposed fiber laser. The proposed pulse shaping fiber laser can be directly used in military applications, and space, aircraft, and satellite applications such as LIDAR systems, remote sensing system, illuminator system, and phase array antenna system. Commercial applications include material processing, medical equipment and biomedical instrumentation, and optical communications.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this Phase II project, Kaitech proposes to develop and demonstrate a Water Properties Sensor (WPS) sensing system to synchronously measure the spectral inherent and apparent optical properties and the physical properties of oceanic, coastal, and fresh water. This single instrument will provide oceanographers with a small, easy to deploy, affordable, and adaptable integrated sensing system to collect and measure geospatial information of the in situ water's fundamental marine processes.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The WPS's applications have capabilities to support NASA's earth science programs to gather the in situ measurements of environmental conditions impacting the marine processes. Basic programs this instrument can support include: NASA's Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry and Applied Sciences programs, its Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) program, its regional coastal research, and NASA's satellite measurement calibration and validation programs.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications include supporting marine field studies for coastal research by Federal, state, and local resource managers.

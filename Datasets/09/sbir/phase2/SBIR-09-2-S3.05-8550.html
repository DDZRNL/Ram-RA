		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Silicon carbide (SiC) and other wide band-gap semiconductors offer great promise of high power rating, high operating temperature, simple thermal management, and ultra-high power density for both space and commercial power electronic systems. However, this great potential is seriously limited by the lack of reliable high temperature device packaging technology. The objective of this proposed research is to develop a ultra-compact, hybrid power module packaging technology based on the use of double leadframes and direct leadframe-to-chip transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding that allows device operation up to 450 degrees Celsius.  The unique advantages of this innovative solution include very high current carrying capability, low package parasitic impedance, low thermo-mechanical stress at high temperatures, double-side cooling, and modularity for easy system-level integration. The new power module will have a very small form factor with 3-5X reduction in size and weight from the prior art, and capable of operating from 450C to -125C.

		The proposed concept will have a profound impact on power electronics and energy conversion technologies and help to conserve energy and environment, as well as to reduce the nation's dependence on fossil fuels. Widespread use of efficient and cost-effective power electronics technology can potentially result in a 35% reduction in energy consumption. Power electronics, along with computer and microprocessor technology, impacts nearly every sector of the U.S. economy including automobiles, electric utility, pollution control, communications, computer systems, consumer electronics, and factory automation. For commercial applications, the proposed new packaging technology can be used in its current form or scaled down to medium or conventional temperature range with a significantly reduced cost, making it a viable and economical option for large commercial markets such as hybrid electric vehicles, renewable energy conversion, and power supplies.

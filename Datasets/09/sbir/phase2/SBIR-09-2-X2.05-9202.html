		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Future manned space exploration missions will require space suits with capabilities beyond the current state of the art.  Portable Life Support Systems for these future space suits face daunting challenges, since they must maintain healthy and comfortable conditions inside the suit for long-duration missions while minimizing weight and venting no consumables.  We propose to develop an innovative system for thermal and humidity control in a space suit that is simple, rugged, lightweight, and nonventing.  In Phase I we proved the feasibility of our approach by identifying the optimal materials, developing fabrication methods, building and testing a proof-of-concept system, and demonstrating by test that its performance is suitable for use in space suit life support systems.  Results from these tests agree well with our design models, which we used to produce a conceptual design for a full-size system.  In Phase II we will optimize the overall design for integration with space suit systems, produce a full-size prototype, and demonstrate operation in a prototypical environment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed system can be used in any future space suit, with applications that include lunar and Mars exploration or constructing/servicing next-generation space telescopes while maintaining a clean environment.  The basic technology can also be used to provide rugged, nonventing thermal and humidity control for spacecraft, manned rovers, and habitats.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are numerous commercial and military applications for the proposed technology.  Commercial applications include untethered personal cooling systems for law enforcement, nuclear/chemical plant workers, and heat-sensitive multiple sclerosis patients.  Military applications include personal cooling systems for soldiers or marines wearing chem/bio protective gear, body armor, EOD suits, or level-A HAZMAT suits.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Dust mitigation is critical to the survivability of vehicle and infrastructure components and systems and to the safety of astronauts during EVAs and planetary surface operations. By coupling Eikos Invisicon<SUP>REG</SUP> nanocomposite conductors with existing dust mitigation Dust Shield technology developed at NASA-KSC, the Phase I program demonstrated an enabling approach to producing electrodynamic dust mitigation devices on a wide variety of surfaces not possible with traditional metal based electrode materials. Eikos reproduced proven NASA spiral electrodes using Invisicon<SUP>REG</SUP> patterned onto transparent plastics, Tyvek<SUP>REG</SUP> fabric, and silicone rubber sheets; employing inkjet and spray deposition methods, two CNT ink formulations, and four dielectric binders to create working devices. These Invisicon<SUP>REG</SUP>-based devices are far more flexible then traditional devices and exhibit superior durability to abrasion, elongation, and thermal cycling.   A dust mitigation system utilizing this technology has broad value to many NASA mission directorates and terrestrial commercial applications. The Phase II project will build on these successes and integrate the electrode into larger surfaces, and more complex components. Further, extensive dust mitigation, and both environmental and mechanical testing, will be conducted to position this electrode technology for insertion into windows, fabrics, and elastomeric components in space and terrestrial applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		ESC mitigation is critical to the survivability of vehicle and infrastructure components and systems and to the safety of astronauts during EVAs and planetary surface operations.  This technology will provide significant improvement in robustness, reliability, and safety. Once fully matured, this technology will be implemented to sustain affordable exploration in remote environments where surface contamination, like dust, is persistently reducing the effectiveness, safety, and sustainability of key systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Eikos is currently marketing these conductive coatings under its registered trademark, Invisicon<SUP>REG</SUP>, as a replacement for ITO in existing applications, and a core part of our second thrust is to use Invisicon<SUP>REG</SUP> coatings for rapid prototyping of new electronic devices and enabling entirely new device structures. Based on superior performance and lower costs Invisicon<SUP>REG</SUP>  can be a transparent electrode that is easily printed and patterned allowing manufacturers to produce more efficient and cost effective PV's, displays, and electronic devices. One key terrestrial application is the use of Invisicon<SUP>REG</SUP> electrodes in electrodynamic dust mitigation cleaners for solar PV arrays for utility electricity generation in arid regions.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to develop a planning model integrated development environment (PM/IDE) that will help people construct, review, understand, test, and debug high-quality planning domain models expressed in the Action Notation Modeling Language (ANML) more quickly and effectively.  PM/IDE will enable novice modelers to review and understand models more expediently, so they can learn modeling techniques more efficiently.  PM/IDE also will enable experienced modelers to review the models of others more quickly, so they can share modeling techniques and best practices.  Interactive graphical displays will enable modelers to describe planning domain models under construction and the plans they can generate to domain experts in order to facilitate more efficient knowledge elicitation and model review.  Without PM/IDE, ANML modeling will remain a tedious and difficult task that can be carried out only by the small number of people who have the necessary specialized skills and patience. This, in turn, will severely limit the use of ANML-based automated planning systems.<BR><BR>During Phase I, we characterized the planning domain modeling task to identify the types of analyses and decisions that modelers carry out and the kinds of information they review and assess.  Based on this understanding of the task, we designed and prototyped PM/IDE capabilities and user-system interactions that help people develop ANML models.  During Phase 2, we propose to develop a TRL 7 version of PM/IDE. Our design approach draws upon our experience using a top-down, decision-centered software requirements and design process to develop data visualization and decision support systems.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed research effort will result in an operational IDE that NASA personnel can use to develop high-quality, large-scale ANML models more quickly and easily.  After Phase II, Stottler Henke will market the IDE to NASA contractors and will enhance the IDE to support additional NASA and NASA contractor requirements.  The technology developed during the project will also enable Stottler Henke to develop planning domain models for other modeling languages used by NASA, its partner space agencies, and its contractors.  The technology will also enhance the domain modeling capabilities of Stottler Henke's Aurora<SUP>TM</SUP> intelligent scheduling tool suite, which  is used by NASA, NASA contractors, and major aerospace manufacturers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The resulting technology will also serve as an important new part of Stottler Henke's intelligent sensing and control solution offerings to the Department of Defense that support military operations, simulation, and training.  For example, automated planning could be used to support more intelligent computer-generated forces used within training and wargaming exercises.  It can also be used to control next-generation unmanned vehicles and intelligent software agents.  The technology will also enhance the domain modeling capabilities of Stottler Henke's Aurora<SUP>TM</SUP> intelligent scheduling tool suite, which  is used by NASA, NASA contractors, and major aerospace manufacturers

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Cryogenic fluid valves are subject to harsh exposure and actuators to drive these valves require robust performance and high reliability.  DSM's piezoelectric actuators offer advantages over traditional alternative actuator technology.  However, in order to use piezoceramic actuators in cryogenic fluid handling applications, proof of operational reliability and improvements in thermal neutral response are required.  During the Phase I, DSM experienced great successes and found multiple compelling reasons to continue into Phase II. Particular successes include: gaining access to a new piezoceramic material with superior cryogenic performance, demonstrating a flight-like vibration test survivability level for a small actuator sample set, and, development of a novel composite actuator with excellent neutral thermal response. The outcome of the Phase I yields multiple compelling reasons to continue into Phase 2.  The potential for application of this actuator technology to cryogenic fluid valves is substantial with interested NASA advisors at NASA JSC, MSFC, and GRC.

		DSM has received interest from NASA regarding piezoelectric actuators for cryogenic applications and for others that do not require low temperature capability. Many non-cryogenic uses require a wider temperature range than laboratory environment, so some of the proposed work related to CTE characterization and improved protective coating would be useful for these purposes, as well. Many inquiries are related to the regulation of fluid flow or pressure. Thruster valves used in highly miniaturized satellites have received significant attention. Flow and pressure control of cryogenic propellants such as LOX for propulsion is also an area of interest. A scientist at GRC has begun investigating whether this technology will be suitable for regulation of flow for a fuel cell application. As the technology is more fully developed, it will be practical to pursue applications requiring more force. Interest has been expressed in an actuator for a 2 inch cryo-isolation valve that will require over 150 pounds of output force. There are many cryo and non-cryo valve applications that can potentially be addressed by this technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The most direct applications outside NASA are other aerospace projects that require actuators to operate valves for cryogenic fluid handling. ESA and major US defense contractors have previously tested systems that used piezoelectric actuators from DSM. It is reasonable to assume that once the technology reaches a readiness level that is acceptable for NASA, other aerospace entities will have similar interest in using it for their programs. The US Air Force has expressed interest in very low temperature, high force piezoelectric actuators for use in their low Earth orbit simulation chambers at Arnold Engineering Development Center. More broadly, some commercial applications related to materials evaluation and inspection need positioning at very low temperature and could benefit from this research.

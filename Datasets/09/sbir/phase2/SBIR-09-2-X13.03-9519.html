		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Makel Engineering and Cornell University propose to develop a galley architecture taking into account the design constraints of the space habitat, such as reduced pressure and gravity, minimize size, mass, power and crew time, while producing food with high nutritional value and enough variety, acceptable taste and texture qualities for long term crew consumption. The current design of the space habitat will have a reduced atmospheric pressure of 8 psia which is equivalent to a 16,000 foot mountain top, with oxygen enrichment to prevent hypoxia effects on the crew.  The combination of reduced pressure and gravity will affect the heat and mass transfer during food processing and food preparation of the food.  Whether the food system is based chiefly on bulk packaged ingredients or crops grown on site, it must minimize mass, volume, power and waste, make effective use of the limited resource of crew time, produce nutritious, highly acceptable and varied food, and integrate into the closed habitat's atmospheric control system by containing and controlling airborne particulates, water vapor and odors generated during food preparation.

		The technology developed in Phase 2 will find near term applications in ground-based analog missions, where many of the subsystems will be tested.  Portions of the technology (such as individual cookware items, or environmental control system) may be incorporated in flight demonstration missions.

		Recent research indicates that the fumes generated in the kitchen, if not properly exhausted and treated, are rather detrimental to human health.  While exhaust systems are common practice in residential kitchen, they are usually ill-equipped to treat noxious fumes, but rater focus on drawing air and trapping oil mist.  Many kitchens, in particular in small urban spaces, use recirculation exhaust, which simple traps oil mist, but end up recirculating odor causing volatiles and any noxious chemicals (e.g., overheated oil, small food spills on hot surfaces, etc.).  A derivation of a hood system with built-in treatment may be the development of convection ovens and microwave ovens with built-in odor control systems.  These items are usually outside of the range of kitchen exhaust, but also are key sources of odors and indoor pollution.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this proposed Phase II program, builds on the phase I feaibility where  a multifunctional lightweight radiation shield composite was developed and fabricated. This structural radiation shielding is high strength, syntactic polymeric where the polymer is filled with high strength low Z material. The phase II program will provide radiation modeling and testing for these new structural radiation solutions as well as a physical property database for using them in space habitats.  The Phase II program will address issues including flammability, attachment, and incorporation of these new materials into existing and future space habitat designs.  The accumulation of the phase II program will be prototype components that can be tested at TRL level 5 or flown for TRL level 6.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA Commercial applications include, Radiation shielding and structural members for space craft, landers, habitat structures and satellite components.The replacement of parasitic shielding, and enabling shielding to be used in sun, electronics, and reactor exposed areas where temperatures exceed 120 C is enabled (when using high temperature matrix solutions). The primary insertion target will be the an inflatable habitat structures but ridged habitats for near term missions will be considered, where we have time to reach the required TRL level consistent with program schedules, and mars missions (electronic boxes, reactor shielding, etc.). It is imperative that any new material development be downselected in the next few years to meet even these insertion opportunities, and the lightweight structures exploratory development investment must be made today to achieve any significant return on the investment prior to mars missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-Nasa Commercial application include habitat radiation shielding for space tourism applications. There are potential structural shielding uses for this material for electronics and components for both satellite and missile structures as well.   Other non aerospace applications include use as medical shielding, nuclear shielding and for radiation hardened electronics.

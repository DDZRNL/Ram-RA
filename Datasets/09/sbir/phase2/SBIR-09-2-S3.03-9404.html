		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Deployable Space Systems (DSS), in partnership with ATK Space and EMCORE, is focusing on the design development and optimization of the most promising advanced space photovoltaic subsystem now available: EMCORE's ultra-thin 33% BOL-efficient Inverted Metamorphic Multijunction (IMM) solar cell that is interconnected into module form and integrated onto an advanced flexible blanket (gore); specifically for implementation on the lightest solar array structural system currently in use, ATK's UltraFlex.  The innovative and synergistic solutions conceptually developed during the Phase 1 effort produced a near-term, low-risk solar array system that provides breakthrough performance in terms of highest specific power (>380 W/kg BOL), light weight, scalability to large (>15 kW) wing sizes, high deployed stiffness, high deployed strength, compact stowage volume (>40 kW/m3 BOL), high voltage operation capability, reliability, affordability, and rapid commercial readiness. The Phase 2 study will  successfully further increase the design fidelity (TRL) of the most promising IMM-integrated onto UltraFlex-specific triangular gore blanket solutions configured to meet key high-voltage SEP / deep space science mission requirements.  The development, as performed on the cost-effective Phase 2 SBIR plan structured in detail, will allow for an expedient and low-risk commercial infusion of the ultra-lightweight integrated IMM PV UltraFlex solar array technology via continued hardware-based and test-validated development, and enables future missions, including near-to-medium term NASA Outer Planets and Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) science missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A mass-optimized UltraFlex solar array with integrated IMM cell flexible blanket is applicable to all future NASA Space Science, Earth Science, and Exploration Initiative missions as a direct replacement to current-state-of-the-art.  The IMM-optimized UltraFlex is the mission-enabling solar array system solution for near-to-medium term NASA Discovery, Flagship Outer Planets and New Frontiers-class science mission planners requiring high power (scalability), stowed packaging efficiency, high voltage design capability and highest specific power.  The design will benefit interplanetary, comet rendezvous and Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) science missions, and all other NASA LEO, GEO, planetary or celestial-body Lander, planetary orbiter, and/or Deep Space applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A mass-optimized UltraFlex solar array with integrated IMM cell flexible blanket is widely applicable to all future non-NASA GEO and LEO space missions (including DoD and commercial missions), and is a direct replacement to current-state-of-the-art.  IMM-on-UltraFlex technologies are mission-enabling for high voltage, high power and constrained-volume launch vehicle packaging applications.  Additionally, because of its inherent light weight and deployed stiffness/strength capability, the IMM UltraFlex is ideal for rapid-maneuvering surveillance satellite applications (can more weight-efficiently take high-G accelerations).  Additionally, the next-generation of GEO spacecraft could be optimally designed to take advantage of IMM UltraFlex's high stiffness/strength to allow the arrays to remain deployed during transfer orbit burns (generating full power) and greatly reducing spacecraft ACS requirements (>10X deployed stiffness). Applicable non-NASA space missions include: LEO surveillance, reconnaissance, GEO commercial communications and critical payload/equipment satellites, and GEO DoD communications and payload/equipment satellites.

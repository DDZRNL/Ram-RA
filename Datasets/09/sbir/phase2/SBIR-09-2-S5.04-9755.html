		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In order to support the tools needed to develop the Mars Sample Return (MSR) rendezvous and capture of the Orbiting Sample (OS), Aurora and MIT Space Systems Lab proposed the development of the Mars Orbiting Sample Return (MOSR) Rendezvous & Docking with the OS (RDOS) system. This system supports development of GN&C algorithms to address the "last few meters" operation between the chaser spacecraft and OS and extends the capabilities of the current SPHERES MOSR test bed. During Phase 1, the team demonstrated the feasibility of the visual navigation and controls infrastructure for the test bed. During Phase 2, the team proposes to integrate these capabilities into the test bed while engaging the NASA safety process throughout the development effort, resulting in ISS flight payload hardware ready for environmental testing and safety approval.

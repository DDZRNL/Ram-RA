		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The health and integrity of aircraft sensors play a critical role in aviation safety.  Unfortunately, inaccurate or false readings from these sensors can lead to improper decision-making resulting in serious and sometimes fatal consequences. The research performed in Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of using advanced data analysis techniques to identify anomalies in Pitot tubes resulting from blockage such as icing, moisture, or foreign objects.  The core technology used in this project is referred to as "noise analysis" since it relates a sensor's response time to the dynamic component (noise) found in the signal of these same sensors.   This analysis technique has used existing electrical signals of Pitot tube sensors that result from measured processes during in-flight conditions and/or induced signals in pre-flight conditions to detect anomalies in the sensor readings.<BR><BR>AMS has routinely used this technology to determine the health of pressure transmitters in nuclear power plants. The application of this technology for the detection of aircraft anomalies is innovative in that instead of determining the health of process monitoring at a steady state condition, this technology will be used to quickly inform the pilot when an air speed indication becomes faulty under any flight condition as well as during pre-flight preparation.  <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Although the general target for the end product of this research is in the commercial and private aircraft sectors, NASA and other governmental/military facilities would greatly benefit from this technology.  As all aircraft rely on the accurate and reliable performance of Pitot/static systems, improving the detection of inaccurate indications would increase the safety of aircraft passengers and crew, reduce the potential for accidents, and will lead to other advances in aviation technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The intended end product of a Phase I and Phase II project is the development of hardware and/or software that can be used for the detection of Pitot tube anomalies resulting from blockages either during in-flight or pre-flight conditions. This end product, which will be commercialized by AMS in a Phase III project with non-federal funding, will have wide applications in the commercial, private, and military aircraft industries.  Furthermore, it is envisioned that this new technology would be used not only for new aircraft, but also for existing aircraft with only minor modifications.

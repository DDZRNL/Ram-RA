		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The key innovation in this effort is the development of an industrial-grade analysis testbed to integrate simulation tools, such as ACES, with aviation environmental effects models, such as the Aviation Environmental Design Toolkit (AEDT), to provide a "360-degree" evaluation of new operational concepts. The testbed will be demonstrated by producing such  a "360-degree" evaluation of advanced NextGen concepts such as time-based merging and spacing at ATL airport, high-density metroplex concepts, and the efficiency of new route structures with environmentally responsible aircraft using RNAV routing.   The industrial-grade software will be implemented in Java and can potentially reduce the analysis time for combined performance/environmental analyses by several months over the current state of the art.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This tool enables NASA headquarters to make future research investment decisions about advanced aviation concepts using information about both their expected performance impact as well as their expected environmental impact.  In addition, analysts at NASA centers that study advanced concepts (currently, Langley, Ames, and Glenn) can use this tool to fine-tune their ideas so that they meet performance and environmental objectives.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potentially the tool could be used by any airport, FAA analyst, or aviation consultant interested in performing a comprehensive analysis of new concepts under consideration.  Thus all congested Metroplex areas (approximately fourteen in the United States), as well as large airlines and all large airports could benefit from using this tool for expansion planning.

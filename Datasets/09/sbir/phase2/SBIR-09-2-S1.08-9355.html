		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		AOS has shown that it is feasible to use the combined NASA/SBIR resources from Phases I and II to:<BR><BR>(i)	Build a turn-key analyzer system that has the dual-band/differential architecture and is small, light and sensitive enough to be deployed in the smallest zone of the Global Hawk (GH);<BR>(ii)	Demonstrate TRL 9 and flight readiness of the analyzer system for deployment on the GH and<BR>(iii)	Validate the analyzer system for observations of CO2 DMF by double-blind comparison with the flask sampling technology of NOAA/GMD and by broadband comparison with an AOS analyzer system that have been validated on hundreds of airborne missions.<BR><BR>The net result of Phase II will be a TRL 9 CO2 analyzer system that can be deployed on the GH as needed for NASA field studies and validation of CO2 satellites.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		(i) CO2 analyzer payloads appropriate for the platforms of NASA's Airborne Science Program.<BR>(ii) Validation/calibration of the atmospheric CO2 column observed by satellite.<BR>(iii) Calibration of ground-based line of sight calibrators (TCON) of the CO2 satellite.<BR>(iv) Studies of atmospheric CO2 as part of detailed process studies of oceanic and terrestrial environments.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		(i) Drop-in CO2 analyzer payload for great range of platforms to include robotics and the cabin of conventional aircraft.<BR>(ii) Studies of atmospheric CO2 as part of detailed process studies of oceanic and terrestrial environments.<BR>(iii) Improvement of all CO2 analyzer technologies invented and developed by AOS, Inc. for a substantial range of robotic and manned platforms.<BR>

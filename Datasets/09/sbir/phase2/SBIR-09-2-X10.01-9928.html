		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		History has repeatedly shown that combustion instability is the greatest technical risk faced in any chemical propulsion development program. The UCDS Process addresses this issue by using a rigorous physics-based analytical framework to decompose the complex flow field inside a chemical propulsion device, such as a liquid or solid rocket, in a way that allows rapid simulation of the dynamic behavior.  Using UCDS it is possible to generate high fidelity predictions of the time evolution, amplitude and waveform of a pressure oscillation, along with any changes to the mean properties due to non-linear effects.  Furthermore, it has been shown that the modal Alpha (linear growth rate) is a key physical parameter that defines the dynamic behavior of a rocket and provides a reliable measure of combustion stability margin.<BR>By monitoring how the array of modal Alphas change with design or operational features, the effects on engine combustion stability can be predicted.  This insight provides the means to eliminate instability without resorting to expensive cut-and-try iterative developmental testing.  GTL proposes to use this design guideline and the UCDS<SUP>TM</SUP> Process to create a clean-sheet design for a new liquid rocket that is inherently stable and compare it to an existing engine.  <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		As a physics-based tool, the UCDS Process is applicable to practically any chemical propulsion systems, including liquid rocket engines, solid rocket motors, turbojets and scramjets.  With UCDS, it is possible to either fix an existing engine that has oscillations or design new engines that are inherently stable.  This will greatly reduce development costs by eliminating the need to rely on expensive cut-and-try testing.  Additionally, UCDS provides the means to explain the dynamic behavior of engine.  This added insight and reduced development risk may lead to great advances in engine performance and capability.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The UCDS Process is equally applicable to NASA and non-NASA chemical propulsion systems, since UCDS is not restricted by propellant type or engine size.  Therefore UCDS can support DoD propulsion development efforts from small storable propellant thrusters to large cryogenic engines to complex tactical interceptor solid rocket motors and many others.  Additionally, UCDS could play a critical role in the commercialization of space by reducing the cost and risk of commercial rocket development.

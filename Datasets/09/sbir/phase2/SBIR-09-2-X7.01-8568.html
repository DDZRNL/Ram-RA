		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A new high capacity anode composite based on mesoporous silicon is proposed. By virtue of a structure that resembles a pseudo one-dimensional phase, the active anode material will be able to accommodate significant volume changes expected upon alloying and de-alloying with lithium. The mesoporosity will be created without the aid of a surfactant template using a novel high volume synthetic process. The anode composite based on this material is designed to have a reversible Li-ion capacity exceeding 600 mAh/g or nearly twice that obtainable with graphite anodes; indeed much higher capacities could be practically attainable. Phase I successfully demonstrated the synthesis of this new meso-Si material as well as its high electrochemical activity and rechargeability. An expanded investigation on the development of mesoporous Si-based Li-ion anode is the principal objective in Phase II. The optimum anode will be evaluated in Li-ion cells containing 4V oxide cathodes. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Principal NASA applications will include power for landers, rovers and extravehicular activities (EVA). Coupled with a suitable electrolyte Li-Ion cells based on this anode will be suitable for space-related applications, in moon and other planetary habitats etc, requiring high specific energy rechargeable batteries with unique attributes such as non-flammability and sub-ambient temperature operation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The new anodes will result in high performance Li-ion batteries suitable for electric vehicle propulsion and for use in portable consumer products such as cellular phones, portable power tools, cameras and laptop computers.

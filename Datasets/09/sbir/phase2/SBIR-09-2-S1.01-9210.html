		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The primary objective of the proposed Phase II effort is to develop and deliver a ruggedized, single-frequency, mJ-level, 2050-nm master oscillator  power amplifier system suitable for coherent LIDAR applications. The laser system is based on a low-average power, pulsed, single-frequency, 2-um Ho-laser source. Pulsed operation of the Ho-oscillator is achieved via passive Q-switching using robust Cr2+-doped saturable absorbers. Development of such pulsed seed sources enables the design of compact, rugged, reliable and efficient LIDAR transmitters based on all-amplifier architecture.<BR>Direct diode-pumping using the latest 1.9-um diode laser technology provides improved oscillator reliability and compactness. Efficient, Tm:fiber laser pumped, bulk Ho:YLF single-stage amplifier provides energy scaling to mJ level. The choice of a 2-um Ho-laser material (as opposed to 1.5-um Er-lasers) enables efficient power/energy scaling of the pulsed seed oscillator output in high-gain Ho-amplifiers. This approach decreases the number of amplifying stages, simplifies the overall design and packaging, and improves the electrical efficiency of the complete laser system as compared to the current technology.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed work has direct application to NASA coherent, wind-sensing LIDAR programs based on the use of eyesafe, 2-um region lasers, as well as CO2 DIAL applications. The developed seed oscillator enables compact design, enhanced ruggedness and aids the overall all-amplifier system efficiency. Other use is as a front end of an all-amplifier-system to pump mid-IR parametric oscillators for application to DIAL sensors.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial uses are for ground- and aircraft-based wind sensors in commercial aviation for wind shear and turbulence detection , as well as monitoring of CO2 levels in the atmosphere . Low-power, pulsed oscillator can be offered as a stand-alone component.<BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		As the size of composite parts exceed that of even the largest autoclaves, new out-of-autoclave processes and materials are necessary to achieve the same level of performance as autoclave cured composites.  Many of the new out-of-autoclave prepreg systems can be used to manufacture high quality composites initially but the lay-up time for producing quality parts is limited by the short shelf-life at ambient conditions.  The resin advancement, due to long lay-up times, commonly causes variations in fiber volume and higher void content in the cured structures.  Also, current out-of-autoclave prepreg systems do not provide the same level of performance, especially damage tolerance, as many current autoclave cured prepreg systems.  It is the objective of this work to develop a matrix and prepreg system for out-of-autoclave processing that possesses a year plus shelf-life while also providing an excellent balance of composite properties and damage tolerance.  As an additional functionality, the out-of-autoclave prepreg system will be developed to have inherent skin-core self adhesive characteristics so that film adhesives may not be required for designs with honeycomb structures.  It is expected that the TRL will be 6 at the end of this Phase 2 program.

		The successful completion of this research program will enable the development of high quality large composite structures that are produced out-of-autoclave and require long lay-up times.  The utilization of this out-of-autoclave prepreg material was initially targeted for NASA Ares launch vehicle structures but other NASA applications could benefit from this technology as related to the topic "Low Cost and Reliable Access to Space" LCRAS.  There are many cost advantages that will result from this specific technology for producing high performance composites including no autoclave capital equipment or consumables, no freezer storage (year plus shelf-life at ambient temperature), more damage tolerant structures (less repairs), and the possibility of no film adhesives required for honeycomb structures (lower weight and cost).  This material may also find use in out-of-autoclave cryotank development.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Opportunities for this material may be found in commercial, defense, and civilian aircraft and helicopter applications that are trying to reduce material and processing costs of composite structures.  Specific applications may be found in primary and secondary structures including fuselage, wing structures, fairings, engine core-cowl, and rotor blades.  In comparison to current out-of-autoclave prepreg materials, the new technology will provide the avenue for development of much larger composite structures, requiring longer lay-up times, and with higher damage tolerance.  The material system will also enable the development of lower cost honeycomb composite structures due to the advantage of inherent skin-core self adhesive properties.  Applications may follow for lower temperature cure systems in the manufacturing of composite marine vessels and ships due to the large structures and long lay-up times.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposed Phase II program builds on the Phase I effort addressing NASA's future mission requirements by: 1) developing higher performing TPS materials capable of meeting the demands of multiple severe mission trajectories; and 2) integrating TPS materials with the sub-structure to improve overall robustness and decrease mass.  The program's goal is to extend Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) and Fiber Materials, Inc. (FMI<SUP>REG</SUP>) Integrated Composite Structure (ICS) TPS materials to a broader range of flight heat fluxes and mission performance requirements to address future heatshield design needs.  Specific mission enabling improvements sought by NASA that will be developed and/or demonstrated under this Phase II program include: preform/component size, ablation performance, thermal insulation performance, efficient and extendable assembly process, and net-shape preform casting.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Stardust Sample Return Capsule completed its objective with earth reentry in January 2006. Mars Science Laboratory Aeroshell heat shield has been completed and delivery of the Curiosity rover to Mars is scheduled for 2015. With the successful fabrication of PICA TPS heat shields in support of NASA flight missions, FMI has quoted and is prepared to continue supporting PICA heat shields for NASA missions. FMI is actively involved in the study of PICA application for two New Frontiers sample return missions, and Mars EDL mission. The program proposed will assist FMI in support of these missions and extend PICA utility to additional mission application.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed multi-layered integrated airframe concept will be applicable to commercial space vechiles, as well as NASA vehicles. Advances in the individual PICA and integrated composite structure technologies will be advantageous for DoD applications, including Missile Defense interceptor airframes, and aeroshell/insulation systems for Air Force and AMRDEC extended-flight vehicles.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The primary goal of this project is to design and develop an autonomous instrumentation and control (I&C) health monitoring system for space nuclear power applications.  The system, once fully developed, will be able to detect system anomalies based on analytical modeling technique using data from existing sensors in the power generator.<BR>The primary application for the proposed technology will be with space nuclear reactors and the non-nuclear test systems that are being used for component and system level validation.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary application for the proposed technology will be with space nuclear reactors and the non-nuclear test systems that are being used for component and system level validation.  However, the basic autonomous instrumentation and control (I&C) and health monitoring technology developed could be applied to a wide range of applications including aircraft structural and system health monitoring, chemical propulsion systems and ground test facilities for liquid fuel rocket motor testing and development. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Another commercial application will be the development of a system health monitoring product for nuclear power utilities.  AMS will work to develop a product that can first be used for health monitoring on reactor power plant components and subsystems, with continued development focused on higher-level systems and, potentially, overall plant health monitoring.  There is a demonstrated need for such systems in the existing commercial nuclear power fleet as well as the next generation designs that are now being considered.  In addition, a potential commercial opportunity exists in the development of autonomous health monitoring systems for Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), which are now in the design phases.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		QM Power will build and empirically test Space and Cryogenic qualified preproduction Parallel Magnetic Circuit [PMC] 1-5 HP motor/actuators with electronic controllers.  These preproduction prototypes will demonstrate lower operating power requirements for cryogenic motor/actuator components used in Space applications. PMC is an enabling technology having a broader peak power and high efficiency range than incumbent solutions for prime mover and dynamic suspensions used in space rovers and actuation in robotic systems. The PMC motors/actuators and electronic controllers to be built and empirically tested are those identified through the extensive modeling and analysis performed during the execution of QM Power's NASA Phase I contract NNX10CD85P demonstrating power densities greater than 0.050KW/lb with efficiencies greater than 90%.  These PMC motor/actuator prototypes will undergo extensive testing in cryogenic and vacuum environments measuring performance, structural integrity, space radiation tolerance, and low out gassing.  The prototypes will be optimized for manufacturing production under a Phase III effort for commercialization.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		PMC motor and actuators could be an enabling solution in virtually any space application where an electro-mechanical function is required.  These could include but not be limited to propulsion and power, vehicle systems program, revolutionary aeropropulsion concepts, alternate energy foundation technologies, subsonic propulsion, lunar landers and rovers, servo positioning robotic actuators, thrust vector control actuators, fuel valve control actuators, solar array deployment, control moment gyroscopes, gimbal positioning, optic drives, open loop micropositioning, timer switching, space telescopes, cryogenic storage and transport and many others.  <BR>   
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		QM Power is evaluating the commercialization of this technology in ambient temperature conditions for commercial refrigeration, wind and hydro renewable power generation, industrial motors, aerospace and military applications, power tools, electric or hybrid electric vehicles, non-renewable power generation, HVAC, linear actuators/pumps/clamps and a variety of other stand-alone applications.

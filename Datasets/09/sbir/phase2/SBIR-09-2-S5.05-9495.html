		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Chronos Technology (Div. of FMI, Inc.) proposes to design, fabricate and deliver a conceptually proven, practical, and commercially available solution for a novel compact, radiation hardened, stable, low power, programmable crystal oscillator (RPXO), for high reliability space & extreme temperature applications. Our proposed device will be offered in a robust miniature 5x7mm industry standard surface mount package (0.24 grams only). We have engaged in the Phase I study to further refine the approach with more confidence which concludes that the proposed solution would also offer compelling features such as scalable (wide) frequency range (100KHz to 250MHz), and dual output logic compatibility (CMOS & LVDS). The compelling features of our device features include drastically improved reliability and quicker availability. <BR>The overall design of the RPXO includes a radiation hardened SiGe ASIC that operates over the extreme temperature range of -230C to +150C and holds all the necessary functions of a crystal driver circuit, synthesizer, and output buffers. The ASIC uniquely provides dual output logic compatibility (CMOS and LVDS). All aspects of radiation hardness such as TID, ELDERS and SEU have been researched and addressed in the phase 1 study. The SiGe ASIC is integrated with a high reliability and radiation hardened crystal resonator in a highly compliant yet robust miniature package.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed RPXO is intended for very demanding and high radiation missions such as Europa EJSM (JEO & JGO), Mars Sample Return, Titan, missions to comets, Juno, space station, and GPM. The compelling features and performance of the proposed RPXO makes it highly suitable for most scientific and commercial space missions that require high speed data transfer link. This device could operate during take-off, interplanetary travel, orbit entry as well as landing of the probe. RPXO can be used in processor modules, DSP, servo control, receivers, transmitters, & sensors, auxiliary memory modules, where clock signal stability (temperature, shock, vibration, etc.) and integrity (signal to noise, phase noise and phase jitter) is critical.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We have already received requirements for commercial space applications of RPXO (which we can not respond to yet) and that has further exposed the potential value of our proposition to our customers who manufacture the various instruments for NASA and other first tier space payload contractors. Sensors, controllers and communication modules are the examples of such usage. There are a number of applications for our proposed RPXO in avionics and jet engine controllers as well as other military driven system application. The jet engine market segment is a new and growing one which intends to eliminate complex, heavy and unreliable wire harnesses in the present aircrafts. Low flicker noise of SiGe HBT makes the ASIC suitable for low phase noise and low jitter applications such as instrumentation, radar, optical transceivers and high speed network applications.

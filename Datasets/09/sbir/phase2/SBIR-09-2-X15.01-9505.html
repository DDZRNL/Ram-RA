		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address NASA's need for a method to preserve human biological samples, mostly blood and urine, from astronauts collected during flight under ambient conditions, ChromoLogic (CL) has developed a novel Fluid Preservation System (FPS). FPS is based on collecting and sealing fluids in a sterile, hermetically sealed volume, with automatic separation of supernatant fluid where necessary. The unique microfluidic and medical expertise of CL scientists has resulted in an innovative and lightweight fluid storage system that utilizes compact and rugged microfluidic chips and novel valve technology that are capable of processing ~10ml of samples in a few minutes using on-board processing equipment. In Phase I CL has demonstrated the feasibility of the FPS technology by building prototype chips and demonstrating the proof of concept of pumping, separation, storage and preservation. The FPS has been demonstrated to be able to store blood plasma at room temperature for 54+ days. In Phase II CL will develop a fully functional system that will be FDA approved and space qualified.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The FPS will be used by NASA to collect and store bodily fluids such as blood, urine and saliva from astronauts with the aim of gaining a fuller understanding of the physiological effects of travel to and from and existence within a microgravity environment. Fluid samples will be able to be stored at ambient temperature over extended periods of time. Further applications of the FPS may present themselves in the field of extra terrestrial soil and bio-sample recovery and processing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential Non-NASA commercial applications exist in fields such as blood sample collection and storage by medical personnel operating in locations far from traditional preservation infrastructure. From third world counties to rural America medical practitioners that serve outlying areas are often constrained by the lack of a method of blood preservation, reducing the need to carry methods of refrigeration will increase the total amount of samples that can be collected and will increase the efficiency of man power used for such work. Other fields that will be targeted by the FPS are research and development environments. Civilian research applications include large epidemiological studies and remote field research, such as environmental research.  There also exists many opportunities for use of the FPS by the military for bio-sample collection and management under challenging field conditions.

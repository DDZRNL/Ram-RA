		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		DSS's recently completed successful NASA SBIR Phase 1 program has established a TRL 3/4 classification for an innovative IMM PV Integrated Modular Blanket Assembly (IMBA) that can be rolled or z-folded and enables NASA's emerging high voltage solar electric propulsion (SEP) missions.  Significant concept feasibility, design/analysis, trade study/evaluation, and proof-of-concept hardware build/test efforts executed during the NASA SBIR Phase 1 program have validated DSS's IMM PV IMBA technology as a potentially revolutionary flexible photovoltaic blanket assembly that provides high performance in terms of; high voltage operability, high specific power / lightweight (>1000 W/kg BOL at the blanket subsystem level, and >500 W/kg BOL at the array level), compact stowage volume (>50 kW/m3 BOL), rollable or z-foldable for stowage, reliability, modularity & rapid production, flexibility/durability and robustness, affordability, and adaptability to all existing industry flexible blanket solar array products.  DSS's IMBA technology also accommodates standard ZTJ PV device technologies to provide significantly improved performance over current state-of-the-art.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed IMM PV integrated flexible blanket assembly technology is applicable to all future NASA Space Science, Earth Science, and Exploration Initiative missions as a direct replacement to current-state-of-the-art. The proposed technology is a mission-enabling solution for near-to-medium term NASA Discovery, Flagship Outer-Planets and New Frontiers-class science missions, and/or other NASA missions requiring high specific power, exceptional stowed packaging efficiency, and high voltage operation capability, especially as applied to interplanetary, comet rendezvous and Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) science missions. The innovative technology also provides a near-term and low-risk solar array panel subsystem that can significantly benefit all other NASA LEO, GEO, planetary or celestial-body Lander, planetary orbiter, and/or Deep Space applications, through weight, compact stowed volume and cost savings. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed IMM PV integrated flexible blanket assembly technology is also applicable to all non-NASA space missions (including DoD, civilian, & commercial missions), and is a direct replacement to current-state-of-the-art.  The proposed technology is mission-enabling for high voltage, high specific power, and constrained-volume launch vehicle packaging applications. Applicable non-NASA space missions include: LEO surveillance, reconnaissance, communications and other critical payload/equipment satellites, LEO commercial mapping and critical payload/equipment satellites, GEO commercial communications and critical payload/equipment satellites, and GEO DoD communications and payload/equipment satellites. Non-space / commercial private sector applications include many potential power / energy production terrestrial applications for fixed ground, mobile, and roof-top mounted consumer applications, and high altitude airship applications were very-high specific power, high efficiency, and low-cost is required.

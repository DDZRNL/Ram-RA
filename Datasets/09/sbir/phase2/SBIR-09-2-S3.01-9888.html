		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Space Micro proposes to build a radiation hardened by design (RHBD) flash memory, using a modified version of our RH-eDRAM Memory Controller to solve all the single event effects issues (SEU, SEFI and multiple bit errors) using either a RHBD process with NAND Flash cells. The RH-eFlash will be manufactured on known radiation characterized ASIC processes: examples being 130 nm or 65 nm TSMC or other US foundry equivalents. Using the TSMC example, the resulting RH-eFlash, fabricated on a 65 nm process, provides 512 Mbit to 1 Gbit of radiation hardened (SEU, SEFI, SEL and TID) NAND Flash memory. Operating temperature and packaging reliability is addressed through a thorough memory integrated circuit design (temperature) and post IC high-reliability package selections (i.e. ceramic packages). Note that this technology is portable to future available and radiation tested ASIC processes with even finer geometries and high density.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Virtually all NASA space programs have a demand for this proposed technology and product. NASA applications range from space shuttle, space station, earth sensing missions e.g. (EOS), and deep space missions. NASA programs/missions that will benefit include new lunar landers and orbiters e.g. (LADEE), Mars missions, solar system exploration e.g. (Titan, Juno, Europa, comet nucleus return, New Discovery, and Living with a Star (LWS).  NASA programs which may continue to be funded by Congress include the Ares launcher, the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and Commercial Orbiter Transportation Service (COTS) would benefit.   Products (NVM devices) evolving from this SBIR will be enabling for future programs such as Dawn, Aquarius, Kepler, Ocean Vector Winds, and space interferometry (SIR).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology and evolving Space Micro products may benefit many commercial space platforms, both LEO and GEO telecommunication satellites, such as Intelsat, Direct TV, XM radio, Orbcomm and Iridium Next telecom constellation replenishment, plus standard industry busses including Lockheed's A2100, and Boeing's HS-702.<BR><BR>Civil earth sensing applications such as weather/metrology applications e.g. (NOAA GOES and Landsat) can also benefit. <BR><BR>The large DoD space industry, including USAF, MDA, NRO, and new Army nanosat programs at SMDC will directly benefit. Among these programs are AEHF upgrades, GPS follow-ons, MDA's STSS and PTSS, USAF TacSat family, Operationally Responsive Space (ORS), and Army SMDC nanosat family. The entire Cubesat initiative including NRO's Colony program would benefit.<BR><BR>This technology and products will also address emerging MDA radiation threats. These programs include AKV, THAAD, AEGIS, MKV, and GMD for Blocks 2014 and beyond. With the new challenge of atmospheric neutrons to High Altitude Airship (HAA) programs and NASA or Air Force UAV programs, this R&D and NVM product will be a timely solution. <BR><BR>Other military applications may include strategic missiles (Trident and Air Force upgrades), as well as many DoD tactical weapon programs with nuclear survival levels.<BR>

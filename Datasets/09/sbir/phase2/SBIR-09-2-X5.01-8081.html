		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal describes the development of a wireless multisensor system for NASA application to remote wireless sensing of temperature distributions in composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) and development flight instrumentation (DFI) for test facilities for large area composite component validation testing.  Phase 1 demonstrated ASR&D's ability to produce temperature sensors with sensitivity controlled by device design, and to selectively read any one coded wireless sensor out of a set of up to 32 uniquely identifiable sensors.  Phase 2 will further develop these passive wireless sensors for target applications, and will develop a miniaturized wireless electronic reader capable of autonomously reading up to 32 sensors operating simultaneously within its field of view.  ASR&D has teamed with Metis Design Corporation for the Phase 2 electronics integration, miniaturization, and DAQ hardware development.  After the Phase 1 program, the sensors and selected portions of the wireless reader are TRL 2-3.  At the completion of the Phase 2 effort ASR&D will deliver to NASA a complete wireless multisensor temperature measurement system suitable for field testing (TRL 4+), including one wireless reader and 32 individually identifiable temperature sensors.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary NASA application for the proposed sensor system would be the distributed wireless measurement of temperature as DFI for large area composite validation testing in facilities such as the thermal vacuum chamber (Plumbrook Facility), within cryogenic (and other) storage tanks, and around the vehicle during launch (with some sensors expendable).  Numerous small, passive, lightweight sensors could be mounted in locations throughout the area to be monitored, and wireless reader systems could quickly scan through the sensors in their field of view, providing real-time temperature distribution information. Tanks would require only one tank feed-through for the antenna, minimizing heat transfer.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Identified commercial applications for the proposed sensor system include monitoring temperature in motors, gear boxes, and other hard to access locations in heavy industrial equipment, fixed wing aircraft, and rotorcraft.  Vehicle health monitoring systems being developed utilize sensor data to predict component lifetime, detect incipient failure, and trim maintenance costs by reducing inspections and unnecessary component removal and replacement.  Measurement of temperature is one key parameter measured in VHM systems, and ASR&D is discussing further development of the proposed technology with a major aerospace firm.  Additional potential applications exist in down-hole drilling, military equipment, landfill monitoring, and civil infrastructure monitoring.

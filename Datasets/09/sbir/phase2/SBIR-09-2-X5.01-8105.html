		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to fabricate, characterize, and verify performance of a new type of frequency steered acoustic transducer (FSAT) for structural health monitoring for impacts and leaks in aerospace structures.  FSATs will be demonstrated both in the laboratory and on relevant NASA structure.  Testing would be performed on both simple and complex parts.  Multiple receivers would be tested to develop incoming signal analysis, angular distribution mapping, and source detection and localization.  In addition, Genziko will evaluate the suitability of its integration into a wireless system, using a micro power generator and RF transceiver.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will allow the integrated vehicle health management or structural health monitoring of impacts and leakage of numerous NASA structures including airframes, airlocks, vehicles, space structures, spaceport infrastructure, fairings, and pressure vessels.  
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will allow commercial structural health monitoring, nondestructive evaluation, and leakage detection applications are numerous including pipelines, dams, levees, tanks, oil wells and rigs, industrial and biomedical equipment, and even HVAC equipment.  In addition, FSAT may have benefits for other applications ranging from steered sonar to ultrasonic flow measurement to ultrasonic processing and characterization.

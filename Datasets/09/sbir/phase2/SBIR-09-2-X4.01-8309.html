		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In Sub-topic X4.01, NASA has identified a need for advanced radiation-shielding materials and structures to protect humans from the hazards of galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and Solar Energetic Particles (SEP) on long-duration missions, outside the earth's magnetosphere. The radiation species of greatest interest are light ions (particularly protons), heavy ions (such as iron-56) and neutrons. International Scientific Technologies, Inc., in conjunction with the College of William and Mary, in its Phase I program developed lightweight, multi-layered, polymeric shielding against GCR and SEP.  The Phase II objectives include analysis and design of single and multi-layered nanocomposite polymeric radiation shields using OLTARIS modeling protocols to supplement the empirical results of Phase I, fabrication of nanocomposite films and multi-layered structures, acquisition of families of test data to determine key parameters of single and multi-layered structures tailored to stopping GCR and SEP, optimization of prototype multi-layered polymeric shields using statistical design and OLTARIS modeling for a range of manned and unmanned NASA applications prior to commercialization in Phase III.  The anticipated result of the Phase I and Phase II programs is the development of multi-layered shields with an outer layer of hydrogenous polymeric material for significant dose reduction of incident GCR ions and inner layers of polymeric composites containing additives chosen to moderate and absorb neutrons resulting from fragmentation of incoming heavy ions and to absorb short wavelength electromagnetic radiation resulting from the slowing of the GCR particles and capture of neutrons.  The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at the beginning of Phase II is 4. At the end of Phase II, the TRL will be 5.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed multilayered multifunctional high performance polymers, films, coatings and additives will find application in NASA missions in protecting astronauts and sensitive optical, electronic, thermal and acoustic components from space hazards, including radiation, dust and thermal transients, while, at the same time, providing lightweight structures for planetary rovers and habitats.  It is expected that these multi-layered systems will provide a high-performance-to-weight radiation shield that can be used within human habitats, spacecraft and protective apparel.  Other missions supported by NASA could also make use of the multifunctional materials for the International Space Station or in other orbiting vehicles involving long-duration small dose exposure.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Lightweight multifunctional radiation shielding will find application in the commercial (e.g., hospitals and nuclear power plants) and defense (e.g., nuclear-powered ships and surveillance satellites) sectors.  The shields will provide protection for homeland security first responders employed by law enforcement agencies, fire departments and hospitals.  It is also expected that the shielding can be fabricated into temporary shelters used by defense personnel and considered for use in the protection of individuals in case of  nuclear or radiological events.  The radiation-shielding material will be suitable for fabrication into protective clothing for healthcare professionals involved in X-ray and nuclear medicine.

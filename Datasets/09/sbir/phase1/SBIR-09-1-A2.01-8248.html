		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR Phase I effort will develop and demonstrate an innovative shape memory alloy (SMA) periodic cellular structural technology.  Periodic cellular structures (PCS) will be designed and tailored to determine if additional shape memory performance benefits can be derived from the underlying macro-structure when fabricated from SMA's.  These structures will be manufactured using an advanced reactive metal casting technology that will allow complex-shaped, integral bulk structures to be fabricated with the requisite composition-microstructure-properties needed for shape memory performance.  Casting also offers a relatively low-cost approach for fabricating near net-shape components.  The fabricated SMA structures will be characterized for resulting microstructure-properties in order to determine how to best design such PCS to better exploit SMA's for use in aerospace applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA commercial applications include aeroengine and airframe structural components, particularly those requiring shape memory behavior, light weight, acoustic dampening, and impact resistance. SMA's are also being considered for flexible wings for aircraft.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA commercial applications include armor applications, automotive and land vehicle components and structures, shipboard structures, sporting goods, biomedical implants, and building structures. Essentially, a practically limitless list of potential applications could be made if large-sized SMA material with the requisite shape memory propertie scan be manufactured affordably.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		ZONA Technology, Inc. (ZONA) proposes to develop an on-line flutter prediction tool for wind tunnel model using the parameter varying estimation (PVE) technique to ensure the safety of the flutter model as well as the wind tunnel system. This tool will be applied to rapidly evaluate parameters, such as modal damping and frequency, which are required to assess the flutter boundary of a wind tunnel model in the pre-flutter test conditions. In this PVE Toolbox, system identification techniques such as Polymax and Subspace methods are employed to consistently estimate the damping/frequency of the physical modes, followed by the implementation of Zimmerman-Weissenburger flutter margin method, linear parameter varying modeling combined with µ analysis, and/or thin plate interpolation method for flutter boundary prediction.  In order to minimize the dependence on the experience for obtaining a reliable flutter prediction, an accurate estimation of the auto-spectrum of the output data, k-mean stochastic algorithm for automate modes selection are developed to enhance the on-line capability of the PVE Toolbox. The end product PVE Toolbox can be used by the test engineer as an on-line flutter prediction tool in the wind tunnel to effectively make a timely decision for proceeding to the next test point.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Comprehensive flutter prediction software is still non-existing; leading to cautious and expensive wind tunnel test programs. ZONA envisions that the proposed Phase I research effort will result in a commercial product, called the PVE Toolbox. This Toolbox can assist NASA in its goal to dramatically reduce the cost and time required to ensure the safety of the flutter model as well as the wind tunnel hardware system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The potential non-NASA customers for this tool include the R & D arms of USAF, Navy, Army, and the defense industry complex. It can be readily adapted by a wide class of aerospace vehicles ranging from current to next-generation designs such as: (a) USAF's F-22 and F-35 aircrafts at Edwards AFB, (b) UASF's Hilda and/or sensorcraft aircrafts, (c) USAF's next generation stealth and morphing UAV/UCAV, (d) DARPA's new Switchblade Flying Wing Program, and for (e) Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) with enhanced control/maneuver capability.

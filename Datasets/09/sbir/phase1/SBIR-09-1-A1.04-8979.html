		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		SBIR Phase I Project proposes a new passive microwave airborne sensor for in flight icing hazard detection, Microwave Radiometer for Aviation Safety. A feasibility study of a relatively inexpensive, small in size, robust, energy efficient instrument with reliable calibration, easy to use, and with minimal maintenance requirement is proposed.<BR>Extensive radiative transfer modeling will be carried out. The results of modeling will be used to optimize instrument design, parameters such as frequency of operation, individual channels polarizations, scene sampling strategy (scanning mode), antennae beamwidths, and potential use of auxiliary data will be evaluated. Phase I objective is a preliminary three dimensional model of the instrument. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA aircrafts, especially turboprops and helicopters can use the proposed sensor in everyday operations. NASA research aircrafts could potentially use the instrument for in-flight icing research or for general applications where flights in or close to icing zones are required. <BR>The technology proposed here will improve aerospace system safety, efficiency, an could lead to more effective use of national airspace. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		When available on market and deployed in regular operation, an instrument of the MRAS class will have applications in general aviation, military operation, search and rescue operations. It could become a part of such weather reporting systems such as ACARS (Aircraft Communication and Report System), or private TAMDAR (Tropospheric Airborne Meteorological Data Reporting). It is conceivable that the private weather data provider, such as WxWorkx (www.wxworx.com) currently providing mobile data service to public through the XM radio channel will be interested to include the local, more detailed information about icing condition into their data service. Corporate aircrafts and individually owned small engine aircrafts, helicopters operating for oil rigs, military and Coast Guard helicopters are potential customers for such devices too. UAV platforms might also be interested in technology that will allow them to seek routes through icing conditions.

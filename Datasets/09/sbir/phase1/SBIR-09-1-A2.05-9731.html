		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The objective of the proposed work (Phases I and II) is to develop uncertainty quantification methodologies and software suitable for use in CFD simulations of aerodynamic flows, ranging from sub-sonic to hypersonic. We will address both pressure and density-based methods, as well as the class of algorithms addressing all-Mach number flows. The software developed here will be based on an existing unstructured finite volume CFD solver, TETHYS, which has been developed by Jabiru Software and Services. A central focus of the proposal is the development and evaluation of generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) methodologies for uncertainty propagation.  In Phase I, we will develop non-intrusive sparse-grid based adaptive collocation techniques for all-speed flows to address the curse of dimensionality and to resolve discontinuities and non-linearities in random space. We will evaluate the feasibility of implementing stochastic Galerkin techniques non-intrusively through operator overloading. Phase I will address airfoil flow across the range of Mach numbers. Phase II will address more general implementations of  feasible approaches, application to more complex aerodynamics simulations, as well as implementation on parallel platforms.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The solver developed during Phases I and II of this project will find wide applicability in NASA. Efficient and accurate flow solvers based on unstructured meshes addressing compressible and incompressible  flows will find use in NASA's aerodynamics, aerothermodynamics, space entry, internal fluid mechanics, turbomachinery, microgravity, propulsion and materials processing programs. Sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification software will find use in every application in which computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used, but especially in aerodynamics, propulsion, turbomachinery, space re-entry, and materials processing.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The solver developed in Phases I and II will find non-NASA applications in virtually every application in which computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used today. This includes aerodynamics, automotive, chemicals processing, electronics cooling, food processing, materials processing, power generation, propulsion and many others.

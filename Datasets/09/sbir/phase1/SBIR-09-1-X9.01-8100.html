		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		ELORET Corporation, in collaboration with the Space Systems Design Laboratory of Georgia Institute of Technology, proposes developing and demonstrating a capability/technology to de-orbit small payloads (approximately 1 kg) from Low-Earth Orbit and returning them to Earth safely. To achieve this goal, the current proposal has five objectives and associated tasks:<BR>1.	Surveying the Bio-science communities to define requirements for the first generation mission architecture.<BR>2.	Understanding the launch interface requirements such as mass, volume, vibro-acoustic loads, electromagnetic interference (EMI), etc.<BR>3.	Designing and developing the first generation of mission architectures including the key aspects of launch, in-space operation, entry trajectory analysis (EDL sequence), and landing/recovery. <BR>4.	Understanding and quantifying small spacecraft requirements for power, thermal control, communications, propulsion, etc., and developing the preliminary design of the spacecraft system using off the shelf technologies whenever possible.<BR>5.	Designing and developing a passive (i.e., without any chemical or aerodynamic deceleration devices), single-stage ballistic entry system (including the aeroshell).<BR>6.	Designing and developing the impact energy absorption system and thermal control system required for payload thermal management and survivability upon landing. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are three potential NASA applications:<BR>1.	Launch and recovery of small payloads (science experiments performed in microgravity environments in Low Earth Orbits)<BR>2.	Instrumented flight test bed for novel Thermal Protection System materials/concepts<BR>3.	Materials research in space environments<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The potential non-NASA applications is:<BR>1.	Low-cost, customizable, launch-to-recovery flight platforms for Life-/Bio-science experiments<BR>

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

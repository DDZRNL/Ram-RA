		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is interested in the development of advanced instruments and instrument components for planetary science missions.  Specifically, an area of importance in relation to in situ sensors and sensor systems is instrument deployment on a variety of space platforms, which include orbiters, flyby spacecraft, landers, rovers, balloon, other aerial vehicles, subsurface penetrators, and impactors.  These instrumentation and space platforms are to be used in the exploration of inner and outer planets and their moons, comets, asteroids, etc.  As a direct consequence, the instrumentation systems are subjected to space and planetary environmental extremes including temperature, pressure, radiation, and impact stresses during operation.  In particular, NASA is soliciting instrument development that provides advancements in several specific areas.  One of these areas is "Radiation mitigation strategies, radiation tolerant detectors, and readout electronics components for candidate instruments for the Europa-Jupiter System Mission (EJSM)".<BR><BR>We intend to answer NASA's need for a suitable radiation resistant ROIC technology for future planetary science missions through the integration of advanced radiation hardening technologies incorporating radiation hardening by design (RHBD) technologies, as well as the use of an advanced multi-gate integrated circuit technologies.  Additional focus will be on the reduction of cost, size, weight, and power.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The ROIC architecture that will be developed under this SBIR will demonstrate the protection offered by the combination of our innovative radiation hardened by design (RHBD) methods and an advanced foundry process in terms of "greatly enhanced" TID, SEL, and SEU mitigation capabilities that are required for NASA's future exploration missions including Jupiter and its moons (EJSM Flagship mission). None of the currently available ROICs can meet the rad-hard requirements of EJSM, therefore development of this technology is essential.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Other potential markets include the DoD, DoE, and Homeland Security, as well as Prime Contractors that are involved in building spaceborne sensors that require rad-hard ROICs.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

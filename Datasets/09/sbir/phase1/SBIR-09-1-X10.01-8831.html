		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		C-CAT, which has proven carbon-carbon fabrication capabilities, will investigate use of ACC-6 High Melt oxidation protective system on carbon-carbon for use on the Cryogenic and Non-Toxic Storable Propellant Space Engine nozzle and nozzle extensions.  <BR><BR>ACC-6 High Melt is a carbon-carbon coating application that embeds HfC,ZrB2 in the outer layers.  This material system has been tested in Arc Jet environment at over 3000 degrees F, for more than 24 minutes with little to no erosion.  ACC-6 High Melt has shown to be the best performing high temperature material system, and still retains the ease of manufacturing associated with carbon-carbon.<BR><BR>ACC-6 High Melt has been manufactured in small scale leading edge experiments, but has yet to be demonstrated in large components.  Manufacturability of large scale components remains as the main question to be answered for this material system.  For Phase I, C-CAT proposes to build subsections of a nozzle extension representing the attach flange and the exit diameter of approximately 40" diameter. Success will be achieved by manufacturing the aforementioned subsection using ACC-6 High Melt with no voids or spalling of coating.  This successful demonstration will provide the path for scale-up to a full size prototype nozzle extension for Phase II. <BR>

		<BR>
		The successful completion of the Phase I manufacturing demonstrations will demonstrate the manufacturing techniques required to manufacture a full scale nozzle extension of the Cryogenic and Non-Toxic Storable Propellant Space Engine. At the completion of Phase I, C-CAT proposes to team with an engine designer and manufacturer to fully develop ACC-6 High Melt into the material system that is used in conjunction with the appropriate design to  produce the nozzle extensions for future NASA spacecraft.<BR>Additionally, ACC-6 High Melt is a material system that can be used a structural, re-usable TPS system for future spacecraft.  The continued development of this material for nozzle extensions will lead to a more in depth understanding of the manufacturability and structural properties that can be applied to the TPS designs of future spacecraft.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		ACC-6 High Melt has shown to be the best performing material system in a high temperature cycling re-entry environment.  The demonstration of scale-up will provide the catalyst for design of structural TPS applications for hypersonic flight vehicles currently being investigated by the military.  In addition, the material system is a candidate for hypersonic scram engines and can provide the means by which a re-usable scram engine can be manufactured.

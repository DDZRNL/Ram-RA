		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal outlines the development of a novel instrument for calibrating satellite based imaging sensors  the Polarization Hyperspectral Image Projector (PHIP).  The PHIP instrument is capable of producing realistic, standards-based satellite imagery, simultaneously projecting spectral, spatial and polarization scenes.   In this proposal, we offer to extend our current collaboration with NIST and add polarization capability to the HIP instrument, anticipating the need to calibrate emerging polarization-based sensors in NASA's climate monitoring satellites.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Polarization based sensors have shown great promise for climate monitoring: tracking hurricanes, detecting forest fires, quantifying atmospheric aerosols, measuring sea surface temperature and ocean color.  The addition of polarization sensing capability to sensors, however, requires a complementary capability in polarization simulation for calibration.  Pre-launch calibration of these instruments is vital, particularly in view of strict polarization requirements necessary to produce useful climate data.  Current calibration methods are similar to those used for spectral characterization, using uniform monochromatic, simple polarization states.  The proposed instrument will provided arbitrary polarization on a pixel by pixel basis, at multiple wavebands and with crucial spatial content.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Applications beyond calibration of remote sensing instruments include: "digital tissue phantoms"  projection of complex, realistic, calibrated medically relevant images, calibration of digital cameras and other consumer electronics, quality control of medical film products, and machine vision simulations.  In addition, the individual spectral, spatial and polarization engines can be offered as stand-alone products to the scientific community.

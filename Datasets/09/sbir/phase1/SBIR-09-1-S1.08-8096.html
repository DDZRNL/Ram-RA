		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I proposal seeks to develop a compact, autonomous NO2 sensor for air monitoring applications based on laser induced fluorescence (LIF).  A key component in the proposed system is new laser technology developed at NovaWave.  The Phase I research will directly demonstrate the utility of this new light source by performing LIF measurements on NO2 samples in a laboratory setting.  The Phase II system will fully integrate the laser with an autonomous spectrometer and air sampling system to comprise a complete sensor package. Phase III will result in the development of fieldable commercial systems that will be manufactured and distributed to the regional end users.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA applications for the proposed technology include the study of the Earth's atmosphere, and the atmospheres of other celestial bodies.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The potential commercial applications based on the sensor technology described in this proposal are quite large.  NO2 monitoring by a network of urban air quality monitoring stations is a critical component to understanding the chemistry of air pollution and ozone depletion, and has recently been mandated by the EPA.  This need creates a significant market opportunity.

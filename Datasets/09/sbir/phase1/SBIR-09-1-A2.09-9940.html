		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Under this SBIR program, Ridgetop will introduce the first low-cost, low-power, and lightweight data monitoring solution for rotorcraft diagnostics. The solution is an integrated MEMS-based sensors fabricated by a MEMS-first CMOS process methodology. The device measures temperature, shock, and vibration from multiple sensors integrated onto a single substrate that also contains submicron-scale CMOS electronics for the associated readout and data storage functions. High-sensitivity MEMS structures will be developed, and associated sense amplifiers that exploit low power transistors biased to operate in the subthreshold regions will be introduced. Further scaling in power is achieved by leveraging ultra-small geometries available in modern processes (e.g., 130 nm minimum feature length and below).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Improved temperature-shock-vibration sensors will support the Subsonic Rotary Wing thrust of the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Program, as well as NASA's IVHM goals for future aircraft, satellites, and similar systems. The proposed technology will significantly help monitor and diagnose harmful vibration effects inherent to flight operation. With strong existing relationships with several NASA sites and a reputation for excellent service and products among the NASA community, Ridgetop anticipates collaboration with NASA SRW testbeds at Glenn Research Center to help optimize the technology through Phase II and into actual implementation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial rotorcraft have been known to suffer significantly from structural and electronic stress as a result of the vibration levels caused by routine flight. As such, the proposed innovation which will be able to collect and process critical diagnostic data will be very advantageous for manufacturers and operators. For manufacturers, the tool will be very useful during field testing as a measurement utility for vibration and accumulated stress. For commercial operators such as Bell Helicopter and Sikorsky, the proposed innovation will be instrumental in the real-time efficient analysis of diagnostic routines critical to safe flights.

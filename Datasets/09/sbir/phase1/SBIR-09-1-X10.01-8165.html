		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The need exists for a fast drying, robust, low gloss, black, high emissivity coating that can be applied easily on aircraft rocket nozzles and nozzle extensions.  Based on their 40+ years of experience with loaded polymers, particle dispersion and surface gloss control, scientists at Materials Technologies Corporation recently developed DURACON&#61652;, a high emissivity, high thermal diffusivity, low-gloss infrared black coating. We now propose an innovative process for the deposition of a current DURACON formulation to enhance its emmittance mass index, ruggedness, uniformity, as well as adhesion to the substrate at extremely high temperatures to the levels desired by the NASA.

		<BR>
		The potential usefulness of a robust, high emissivity IR black coating which can be applied easily (brush-on or air-sprayed) to a wide range of metallic, ceramic, or plastic surfaces goes well beyond the immediate need stated by the NASA. Commercial and military applications of such a coating exist in radiation shielding inside IR optical instruments, in quantitative thermography, in IR-visible nighttime signage on military vehicles (made easily visible by a small voltage applied to the coating), etc. Such a coating would also be a natural addition to the present line of DURACON formulations.<BR><BR>Hypersonic flights, ARES V: Thermal control coatings for rocket nozzle extensions. <BR>SCLP and PATH survey missions: Sensor Coatings<BR>Lunar Missions: Thermal control loops and EVA thermal control system equipment<BR> <BR>

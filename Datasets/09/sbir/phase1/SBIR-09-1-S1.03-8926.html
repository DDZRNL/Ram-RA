		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Nuvotronics has developed and optimized the PolyStrata<SUP>TM</SUP> process for the fabrication of intricate microwave and millimeter-wave devices.  These devices have primarily been rectangular coaxial transmission lines, although rectangular waveguide and other structures have also been demonstrated.  Intricate devices have been demonstrated with insertion loss 5 to 10 times lower than traditional planar circuits; isolation better than 60dB for lines that share separating walls; multiple levels of densely-packed coaxial circuits; and low-parasitic attachment to active devices and traditional circuit boards.  In this Phase I project, Nuvotronics will deseign microfabricated MEMs-based switches on the Polystrata platform.  Nuvotronics will explore whether piezoelectric-based or magnetic-based actuation provides the best performance for millimeter-wave radiometry applications.  The devices will have size and cost advantages, higher power handling capability, and lower loss than achievable with the commonly available wafer-based switches of today.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The initial application is for the Beyond Einstein Inflation Probe as part of the Physics of the Cosmos Program, but has additional applications in other future NASA decadal survey missions including Aerosol-Cloud-Ecosystems (ACE), Snow and Cold Land Processes (SCLP), and Precipitation and All-Weather Temperature and Humidity (PATH).  NASA satellite communications systems could also benefit from this technology in microwave switch matrix modules for efficiently multiplexing high data rate uplinks and downlinks such as in the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS).  The MEMS switch integration technology will provide NASA additional capabilities at higher signal frequencies, allowing more effective use of RF hardware on board mission satellites.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We anticipate high volume product opportunities for the MEMS switch integration technology within the DOD and non-Government commercial markets.  For military communications, the benefits are higher bandwidth, multipoint links, and low payload weight for planes, missiles, tanks, and soldiers.  Microwave Switch Matrix (MSM) applications exist in automated test equipment and instrumentation.  MSMs are widely used in microwave test setups and satellite communications systems.

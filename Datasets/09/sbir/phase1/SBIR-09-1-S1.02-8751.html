		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		IAI proposes to develop a Reconfigurable Wideband Radar Transceiver, with direct digital synthesis of P-band radar frequencies, novel high bandwidth P-band antenna design with high contrast ceramic material and digital implementation of receiver stretch processing, to achieve the solicitation objectives. Our innovation focuses on implementing maximum radar transceiver functionalities on high-speed digital reconfigurable platforms (FPGAs), and minimizing the number of analog components. Our Software-Defined Radar designs are based on COTS components and are modular in nature. This makes it easier to upgrade smaller units of the design with development in state-of-the-art, instead of re-designing the entire SDR. The stringent payload constraints of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) require tight integration of all radar functionalities, including signal generation, acquisition, processing, and down-link. The proposed platform can be an enabler for low form factor radar systems to support on-going UAS based NASA missions for Biomass/ecosystems imaging in P-band. A summary of our proposed innovation are:<BR>1.	Reconfigurable digital waveform synthesizer with 600 MHz bandwidth capability. <BR>2.	Compact P-band antenna design using high-contrast ceramic materials to cover 200 MHz bandwidth. <BR>3.	Digital implementation of receiver stretch processing. <BR>4.	Low size, weight and power specifications making the radar design suitable for UAS applications.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose herein to augment current NASA spaceflight dynamics<BR>programs with algorithms and software from two domains.  First, we<BR>propose to use numerical parameter continuation methods to assist in<BR>computation of trajectories in complicated dynamical situations.<BR>Numerical parameter continuation methods have been used extensively to<BR>compute a menagerie of structures in dynamical systems including fixed<BR>points, periodic orbits, simple bifurcations (where the structure of<BR>the dynamics changes), Hopf bifurcations (where periodic orbits are<BR>created), invariant manifolds, hetero/homoclinic connections between<BR>invariant manifolds, etc.  Perhaps more importantly for the current<BR>work, such methods have already proven their worth in flight dynamics<BR>problems, especially those having to do with the complicated dynamics<BR>near libration points.  Second, we propose to use advanced filtering<BR>techniques and representations of probability density functions to<BR>appropriately compute and manage the uncertainty in the trajectories.<BR>While advanced methods for understanding and leveraging the underlying<BR>dynamics are clearly necessary for effective mission design, planning,<BR>and analysis, we contend that they do not suffice.  In particular,<BR>they do not, in and of themselves, address the issue of uncertainty.<BR>Herein we discuss methods that balance the accuracy of the uncertainty<BR>representation against computational tractability, including a<BR>discussion of the notorious ``curse of dimensionality'' for problems<BR>with large state vectors.  We propose approachs that revolve around<BR>modifications of algorithms such as ``log homotopy'' particle filters<BR>and especially Gaussian sum filters.  Finally, we propose to integrate<BR>all of the above algorithms into standard NASA software packages<BR>GEONS, GIPSY, and GMAT.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are several current state-of-the-art software packages that<BR>are clear and direct transition paths for the proposed work.<BR>In particular, there are the GPS-Enhanced Onboard Navigation Software<BR>(GEONS), the GPS-Inferred Positioning System and Orbit Analysis<BR>Software (GIPSY), and the General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT).  <BR>Of the various packages, GMAT is the most directly applicable and will<BR>be the focus of the Phase I effort.<BR><BR>Accordingly, these algorithms will find applicability in any<BR>pre-flight mission design, planning, and analysis activities that<BR>utilize these software.  One domain of particular note is space craft<BR>missions in the neighborhood of libration points, where the underlying<BR>dynamics are rather complicated and the effect of the dynamics on the<BR>trajectory uncertainty is important.  Another domain that we see of<BR>prime importance is that of spacecraft formation flying (such as the<BR>Terrestrial Planet Finder mission) where, again, the dynamics and the<BR>uncertainty play a key role.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The satellite market is large and growing.  For example, analysis firm<BR>Forecast International is projecting worldwide deliveries of about 262<BR>geostationary   or   medium-Earth   orbit  commercial   communications<BR>satellites by 2019.   This implies a strong market  for the technology<BR>described  in this  proposal.  In particular,  as  space becomes  more<BR>crowded with commercial and  government spacecraft, not to mention the<BR>large number of ``junk'' objects currently in the space catalogue, the<BR>robust calculation of trajectories along with accurate estimates<BR>of uncertainty can only become more important.<BR><BR>The space and satellite market is expected to reach $158 Billion by<BR>2010 and is a multi-billion dollar industry both in the US and around<BR>the world.  This market involves numerous government agencies and<BR>permeates many parts of the U.S. Military as well as numerous<BR>commercial entities.  In particular, large players in this market<BR>include Boeing, TerreStar, and Northrop Grumman to name but a few.<BR>The algorithms and software proposed herein will find applicability to<BR>many challenging problems for both the DoD and commercial entities<BR>where complicated dynamics and uncertainty play a role.<BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose the development of an analysis testbed to integrate simulation tools, such as ACES, with aviation environmental effects models, such as the Aviation Environmental Design Toolkit (AEDT), to provide a "360-degree" evaluation of new operational concepts.  The testbed will be demonstrated by producing a "360-degree" evaluation of advanced NextGen concepts such as four-dimensional trajectories (4DTs), dependent arrivals to parallel or converging runways, continuous descent arrivals (CDAs), time-based merging and spacing, flow corridors, and many other NextGen operational improvements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Analysts at NASA Ames, NASA Langley, as well as analysts at JPDO could all use this tool.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potentially the tool could be used by any airport, FAA analyst, or aviation consultant interested in performing a comprehensive analysis of new concepts under consideration.  As such, congested airports (approximately thirty five), all enroute traffic control centers (twenty one), and many aviation consulting and analysis firms could use the tool.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In-situ studies of the rocks, minerals, and soil on the Moon's surface provide a wealth of information during field geology and the <BR>mining phase for planetary resource identification. Sensitive optical spectroscopic instruments such as X-ray fluorescence <BR>spectrometers coupled with UV fluorescence spectroscopy is vital for lunar science. Many moon rock samples contain mineral oxides <BR>in the forms of Al2O3, TiO2, FeO, MnO, MgO, Cr2O3, Na2O and CaO. Further tests have shown that some of them exhibit <BR>fluorescence when exposed to UV light. <BR>Traditional UV fluorescence spectroscopy used in analysis of organic and inorganic materials utilizes power hungry, bulky lasers. <BR>Recently introduced UV-LED and semiconductor UV lasers with powers > 10 mW are small, reliable, and power efficient making them <BR>ideal for use in space exploration. Redondo Optics Inc, a world leader in design and development of fluorescent scientific <BR>instruments, proposes to develop a highly innovative and sensitive, light-weight, hand-held space qualified frequency domain <BR>fluorescence lifetime measurement system for NASA using heterodyne cross correlation technique. The instrument also includes an <BR>ultra miniature 340-780 nm spectrophotometer. The combined spectrometer utilizes lowest power COTS electronics components for <BR>fast and accurate estimation of fluorescence lifetimes to identify the rocks spectral signature.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Redondo Optics Inc. (ROI), proposes to develop, demonstrate, and deliver to NASA an innovative , portable, power efficient UV <BR>Fluorescence Spectrometer for in situ mineral identification by combing Spectral signatures and time resolved lifetimes of fluorescent <BR>agents in Lunar rocks. This is the process of Fluorescence spectroscopy. In order to meet NASA's stringent requirements, the unit <BR>needs to be lightweight, power efficient, and space qualified UV Fluorescence Spectrometer for lunar surface studies of rocks and <BR>minerals to uniquely identify fluorescent agents and metal oxides. Many of the minerals containing metal oxides exhibit fluorescence <BR>in the visible spectrum once illuminated with an high power UV source (both short and long UV). The analysis and classification of <BR>the various mineral species and rocks on the surface of the Moon is a key enabler during planetary field geology and subsequent <BR>mining operations for resources identification during manned and robotics explorations

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		ROI's portable, and power efficient, UV Fluorescence Spectrometer can be used as an in situ or short distance remote monitoring of <BR>Fluorescent lifetimes measurements, and extraction of spectral signatures of many organic and non-organic materials including <BR>minerals. as well as many organic ( biological ) agents that fluoresce when exposed to UV light sources in the Short to Long UV <BR>wavelength ranges. This measurement system can be easily adapted to a fluorescence life time imaging system by adding a CCD for <BR>rapid two dimensional lifetime measurement and monitoring system including applications specific software for various imaging as <BR>well as non imaging applications The technology developed can be adapted to biological (Proteins, skin tissue), chemical, and petro- <BR>chemical identification systems. Many biological agents including airborne bio-aerosals have spectral signature when excited with UV <BR>light. Petroleum based products and Hydrocarbons including Methane and SO2 etc can also be identified using this instrument. <BR>NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded <BR>R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

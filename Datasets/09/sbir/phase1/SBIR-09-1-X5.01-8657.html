		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In Phase I of the SBIR program, LEEOAT Company will develop a hand-held high-resolution ultrasonic nonlinear imager for<BR>non-destructive inspection (NDI) of delamination and intrusion faults in composite structures. We will reduce-to-practice the<BR>innovation by conducting experiments on composite structures with calibrated faults. Additionally, we will design as well as<BR>theoretically simulate the imaging NDI system. Finally, we will estimate the cost/effort for the fabrication and testing of the portable<BR>cost-effective NDI prototype to be executed in Phase II of the program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The development of the portable cost-effective ultrasonic nondestructive inspection methodology and imager for the detection of<BR>delamination and faults in composites, will open a wide window of commercial opportunities for NASA maintenance and mission<BR>ready applications, as well as for high technology manufacturing quality control of NASA components.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The development of the portable cost-effective ultrasonic nondestructive inspection methodology and imager for the detection of<BR>delamination and faults in composites, will open a wide window of commercial opportunities in civilian aviation diagnostic<BR>applications, as well as for high technology manufacturing quality control. Additionally, the imaging technology will be used for<BR>medical imaging.

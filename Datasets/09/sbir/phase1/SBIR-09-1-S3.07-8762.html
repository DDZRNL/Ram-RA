		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Current and future NASA missions are confronted with the challenge<BR>that the amount of data collected by its sensors significantly<BR>outpaces the down-link bandwidth. As a consequence, initial data<BR>reduction has to occur on-board, using algorithms sophisticated enough<BR>to sufficiently reduce the amount of data while simultaneously<BR>ensuring the preservation of valuable information. This requires<BR>enhanced processing power on-board the spacecraft/device/telescope. While future generations of rugged, radiation-hardened hardware can be expected to deliver the necessary performance by employing highly heterogeneous architectures consisting of a combination of FPGAs, DSPs and massively multicore architectures, software development for such devices poses a significant challenge. We prepose to develop tools that facilitate and accelerate algorithm development on these hardware devices. The tools will enable scientists to prototype algorithms in the High-Level language that they are most familiar with while simultaneously building code for<BR>high-performance computational hardware.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The software tools in this project can benefit a variety of current<BR>NASA missions including the Landsat Continuity Mission (LDCM), or<BR>planned missions like HyspIRI, the hyperspectral infrared<BR>imager. These missions offer a glimpse of the flood of<BR>data that is going to be expected from far-future missions. This is not<BR>only a challenge encountered with Earth Science missions, but with all<BR>future missions, including the Solar Dynamics Observatory or the James<BR>Webb Space Telescope.<BR>Mechanisms currently used or investigated to reduce the amount of data<BR>prior to transmission to Earth ranges from fairly simple trigger<BR>functions as encountered on board of RHESSI or planned for XMM, to<BR>more complex cloud detector algorithms on board the Earth Observing<BR>System (EOS) mission.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Modern computational accelerator technologies like FPGAs and GPUs can<BR>be difficult to program efficiently and effectively due to the complex<BR>nature of the underlying hardware. Many companies provide libraries<BR>with highly specialized algorithms that can be accessed from compiled<BR>languages like C/C++/Fortran. However, this presents another barrier<BR>for many scientists who generally program in high-level languages like<BR>MATLAB and IDL. The tools developed in this project, can make these<BR>computational accelerators easily accessible to a much wider range of<BR>scientists through open source high level languages.  <BR>

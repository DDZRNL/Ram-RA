		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The purpose of this project is to develop a wideband digital spectrometer<BR>to support space-born measurements of planetary atmospheric <BR>composition. The spectrometer is based on a superconducting digitizer <BR>and a digital autocorrelator. The digitizer will be able to handle the entire<BR>6 -18 GHz band by operating above the Nyquist frequency (target: 30 <BR>GSamples/s). The superconducting circuits will be based on <BR>Niobium-based Rapid Single Flux Quantum (RSFQ) technology. They will <BR>be implemented without substantially impacting the cryogenic sensor <BR>package. The data from the superconducting digitizer will be processed <BR>by a 128-lag autocorrelator. During the Phase I performance period, we <BR>will determine whether the autocorrelator is best implemented using the<BR>RSFQ autocorrelator circuits we developed for the National Science <BR>Foundation, or the polyphase implementation we recently produced using <BR>fast FPGAs. The criteria for downselecting the best design will be the <BR>projected  Signal-to-Noise ratios and the relative added terms to the <BR>system noise temperature. <BR>Our choice of Niobium superconductor technology will enable one single<BR>technology to implement the TerraHertz mixer, the digitizer, and the <BR>fast manipulation of digital data on a low-power low-temperature platform.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This project will simplify wideband spectrometers in space, on aircraft<BR>or on earth by simultaneously utilizing  low-power broad-bandwidth <BR>digitizers and ultra-fast autocorrelators, along with high-resolution <BR>digitization. The spectra of planetary atmospheric gases, <BR>intergalactic dust, or red-shifted remnants of the big bang in the far <BR>universe will not require using second intermediate frequencies, <BR>additional analog circuits, or stitching together several spectra. <BR>Targeted applications are:<BR>	Global climate change and global circulation effects<BR>	Effect of chloro-fluoro-carbons on the high atmosphere<BR>	Atmospheric ozone chemistry <BR>	Global air pollution <BR>	Wideband studies of the early universe<BR>This technology can substantially improve the present electronics used <BR>for the Global Atmospheric Composition Mission and specifically the <BR>Scanning Microwave Limb Sounder. It can also be used on earth-based<BR>platforms such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. <BR>As a cross-correlator, this instrument can improve the resolution and <BR>overall performance of optical- and radio-telescope arrays. <BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The most commercially viable non-NASA applications pertain to <BR>homeland security and atmospheric monitoring, along with digital-RF<BR>communications<BR> Detection of nitrogen-based compounds used in explosives<BR> Detection of biohazards<BR> Land-based or airborne air quality monitoring<BR> RF Spectrum monitoring for present and future wideband communications  <BR>

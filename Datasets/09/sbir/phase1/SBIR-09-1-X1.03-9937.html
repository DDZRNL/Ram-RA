		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Ridgetop Group will design a rad-hard Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) for spacecraft power management that is functional over a temperature range of -230 to +130 <SUP>o</SUP>C. This ASIC is intended to work in conjunction with a Fuel Cell power system and battery back-up to provide uninterrupted power to critical modules in Space.<BR>Ridgetop will combine Radiation Hardening (RH) techniques with Large Scale Integration (LSI) methodologies to build a power management system for spacecraft applications onto a single monolithic circuit. The significance of this innovation is a single reliable component (ASIC) that will meet platform requirements for high voltage, wide operating temperature range, and radiation tolerance (minimum 100 krads Total Ionizing Doze (TID), 100 MeVcm2/mg Single Event Latchup (SEL). During phase 1, we will select two functional blocks from within a representative NASA power management system as test cases. Designs for these blocks will be developed and validated through SPICE circuit and radiation simulations, using technology files provided by a commercial foundry.<BR>In phase 2, Ridgetop will deliver working prototype integrated circuits (ICs) that meet and exceed the above requirements.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology will provide numerous tangible benefits to the Altair and other space vehicle programs, including; (1) lower power draw, (2) higher reliability, and (3) lower mass. Commercial applications include power management systems for remotely located telecom switches having critical, uninterrupted power management.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology will be directly applicable to the energy generation and automotive markets.<BR>In the electric vehicle market, stacks of fuel cells or batteries are used to power the drive motors. These stacks would be an ideal application for this technology. Power management is essential during use, refueling, or battery recharging.<BR>

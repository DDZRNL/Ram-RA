		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We are proposing to develop high altitude CO2 analyzer technology that can be deployed on the research aircraft of NASA's Airborne Science Program (ASP). The ultimate scientific goal is the calibration/validation of CO2 observations made from spacecraft. Two forms of the analyzer are to be developed, pod for unmanned aircraft and rack for more general purpose platforms. The CO2 payloads are small and light enough to perform on all 15 platforms of NASA-ASP, some reaching altitudes of more than 65,000' ASL and capable of probing at least 95% of the atmospheric column. By prior work, we have built a prototype having the appropriate levels of sensitivity (0.10 ppmv), bias (<0.10 ppmv) and spatial/temporal resolution (1 Hz). Consequently, we can initiate our program with Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 5-6. Validation of the prototype was on a piloted aircraft by a second airborne AOS analyzer system of the same specifications and by flask samples analyzed by NOAA/GMD. Observations, some reaching altitudes of 26,000' ASL, were referred to the WMO scale of CO2 DMF by use of reference gases. As a result of prior technological and scientific work, our Phase I program can present a detailed plan for achievement of TRL 9.

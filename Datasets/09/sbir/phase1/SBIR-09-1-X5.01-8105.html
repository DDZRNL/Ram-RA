		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop, fabricate, and characterize a novel frequency steered acoustic transducer (FSAT) for the structural health monitoring of aerospace structures for impacts, damage, and leakage.  A single compact, cost effective FSAT is expected to replace high-element-count phase arrays, significantly reducing cost, weight, size, and power requirements for multiple channel data handling, wiring, electronics, and powering.  FSAT will allow for permanent continuous leakage detection and localization of simple and complex structures.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will allow the structural health monitoring of impacts and leakage of numerous NASA structures including airframes, airlocks, vehicles, space structures, spaceport infrastructure, and tankage.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will allow the structural health monitoring of impacts, defects, and leakage of aerospace structures, pipelines, dams, levees, tanks, oil wells and rigs, industrial and biomedical equipment, and HVAC equipment.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerators (ADRs) are considered for operations in many space missions. At the heart of an ADR is a magnet that produces the background field necessary for demagnetization of a paramagnetic material. To achieve very low temperatures, all sources of heat need to be eliminated or minimized, making superconducting magnets an obvious choice. The size and power requirement of current cryocoolers that cool such superconducting magnets to about 4K make them unrealistic for space missions. ADR magnets that can operate at 30K-40K require simpler cooling systems and are more suited to space applications. This requires the coils to be fabricated from HTS wires. Phase I of this work  aims to manufacture 0.2mm diameter Bi2212/Ag wires and fabricate a 1T 30mm dia. x 62mm long superconducting coil that can operate at 30-40K.<BR><BR>Since 2002 our company has been the beneficiary of SBIR awards in the area of developing light-weight low-current ADR magnets operating at 10K by using Nb3Sn superconducting wires in manufacturing of ADR magnets, and successfully fabricated demonstration magnets that were provided to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. All the developed techniques, procedures and the equipment will directly be applied to the aims of this proposal.<BR>

		Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerators (ADRs) are considered for operations in many space missions. At the heart of an ADR is a magnet that produces the background field necessary for demagnetization of a paramagnetic material, often a salt-pill. To achieve very low temperatures, all sources of heat need to be eliminated or minimized, making superconducting magnets an obvious choice. The size and power requirement of current cryocoolers that cool such superconducting magnets, that can achieve 3.5-10K, make them unrealistic for space missions. Operations at 30-40K would be greatly beneficial. This requires the coils to be fabricated from HTS wires. This may enable a space relevant ADR magnet to use a small and efficient mechanical cryocooler. In addition to ADR systems, other NASA applications that can benefit from this work include efficient motors and generators, MHD propulsion, high precision sensors and actuators, electromagnetic launch, and magnetic resonance imaging in space.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Larger efficient motors and generators fabricated from HTS wires operating at 30-40K may have applications in the power generation, and transmission industries. Advances may be implemented in the magnetic resonance imaging industry since the cooling requirement of HTS wires are orders of magnitude less than LTS such as NbTi and Nb3Sn devices currently used. Applications in vehicle and appliance industries can be envisioned as this technology advances towards more powerful wires/cables that can operate with simple/lighter single stage cryocooler operating at up to 40K. <BR><BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this proposal, AlphaSense, Inc. (AI) and the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) detail the development of RF front end based on MEMS components for miniaturized digital EVA radio. Key innovations of our approach include: a) the use of a novel parallel receiver front end architecture based on MEMS components, b) a novel design of a high Q mixer-filter for RF mixing and IF filtering, and c) the implementation of band pass filter and voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) using CMOS fabrication technique.  Consequently, the proposed EVA radio has the following merits: a)Small size, light- weight and low power consumption, b)High sensitivity and frequency selectivity, c)Good device reliability, and d)Easy device fabrication and low manufacturing cost.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The most straightforward application of the proposed miniature MEMS based EVA radio is used by NASA for space exploration. The significantly reduced form factor and power requirements along with the increased selectivity and performance of the MEMS based EVA radio allows long duration human exploration while simultaneously increasing communication reliability and crew safety.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Other than the space exploration, the proposed MEMS based EVA radio also has vast applications in the areas of wireless and mobile radio communications. For example, it can be used by first responders to enhance interoperability among police, firefighters, HazMat, homeland security and medical personnel. It can also be used by the military personnel for the soldier-centric secure communications and mode switchable on-the-fly communications. Finally, the miniature MEMS RF front end components can also find commercial applications in cell phones, pagers, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/UWB radio integration.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Cryogenic systems, heavily used in rocket ground testing, space station operations, shuttle launch systems, etc, require a large number of temperature sensors for system management and control. Currently available temperature sensors cannot offer simultaneously sufficient reliability in highly corrosive environments of LOx and LH2 flows and sufficient temperature resolution. Development of new type of cryogenic temperature sensing solutions is needed to meet reliability and sensitivity requirements simultaneously and thus to provide NASA with more efficient, reliable solution for ground testing and flight missions. MicroXact Inc. proposes to develop highly sensitive, reliable sensing solution to address NASA needs that will offer ease of calibration and installation. In Phase I the feasibility of the solution will be experimentally demonstrated. In Phase II, sensors and system will continue to be refined and will undergo extensive testing and validation. By the end of Phase II, the proposed sensing solution will reach TRL 5. In Phase III, Luna will commercialize the developed sensors.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed solution when properly developed will find applications in NASA test facilities as well as potentially in space missions utilizing cryogenic space engines. Applications include but not limited to LOx and LN2 pipeline temperature monitoring, and LOx and LN2 liquid level sensing in cryogenic tanks.  Not only it promises the improvement of reliability and useful lifetime of temperature sensors, but it also promises significant cost savings due to multiplexibility and low weight of the solution. This, in turn, will cause a significant impact on the cost, safety and reliability of future NASA missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to NASA applications the proposed solution will find applications in such applications as temperature mapping in superconducting RF cavities (used in accelerators), temperature mapping of superconducting magnets (for MRI imaging as general research), temperature mapping of superconducting power lines and many more.

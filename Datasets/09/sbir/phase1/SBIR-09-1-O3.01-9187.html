		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose a high performance approach to enhancing communications between astronauts. In the new generation of NASA audio systems for astronauts, inbound signals may interfere with outbound signals and create an annoying positive feedback during communications. Our objective is to eliminate the inbound signals in the outbound path. We propose to apply an affine projection algorithm (APA) to achieve the above objective. In our recent studies, it was found that APA achieves a balance between performance (convergence speed) and computational complexity, as compared to least mean square (LMS) and recursive least square (RLS) algorithms. Our preliminary simulation results showed that the proposed framework is promising. In Phase 1, we will perform extensive simulations to prove the feasibility of our approach. In Phase 2, the validated algorithms will be implemented in radiation hardened DSP or Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).

		<BR>
		Our proposal system will enhance speech quality by minimizing the interactions between inbound and outbound signals. In particular, we will eliminate the inbound signals from the outbound path. It will significantly enhance communications between astronauts wearing helmets.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are many other applications that involve the use of helmets, including fire fighters, military personnel dealing with chemical and biological warfare, pilots operating military jets, etc.

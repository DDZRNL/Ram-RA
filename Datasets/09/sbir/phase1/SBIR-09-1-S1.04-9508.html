		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Southwest Sciences proposes development of gas filter correlation (GFC) spectroscopy using non-periodic gratings for spaceborne and airborne deployment.  Our proposed technology will result in smaller, lighter weight, lower power, and more rugged instrumentation than is possible using established GFC spectrometers.  The approach is based on the development of non-periodic diffraction gratings that replace the reference gas cells used in GFC spectrometers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Our technology will fill a need for satellite-based atmospheric measurements of carbon dioxide concentrations with 1 part per million precision.  These measurements are needed to monitor changes that can affect global warming and for validating climate change models.  Satellite-based remote sensing allows global coverage with relatively short periods.  The technology can also be adapted to remote sensing of other atmospheric components.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We target the newly emerging market for low-cost precision carbon dioxide sensors that will need to be deployed in large numbers for monitoring cap and trade agreements and greenhouse gas reduction treaties.  Cost benefits of high volume production should make practical a worldwide network of reliable, automated sensors.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed project is to manufacture a C-SiC honeycomb structure to use as a high temperature material in advanced aircraft, spacecraft and industrial applications.  The proposers will fabricate a carbon fiber honeycomb structure.  The structure will be charred and then converted to C-SiC by means of chemical vapor infiltration.  The resultant material will then be tested mechanically at ambient, at high temperature and then at ambient after high temperature exposure.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The resultant material should be an excellent structural material for hypersonic aircraft.  In any area requiring high mechanical performance at temperatures above 2000F, the resultant material would outperform any currently-available honeycomb.  
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The resultant material would be adaptable to industrial applications, especially those currently utilizing silicon carbide.  The high density of silicon carbide could be mitigated by utilizing SiC honeycomb.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

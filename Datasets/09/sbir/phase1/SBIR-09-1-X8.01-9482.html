		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced Materials Technology, Inc (AMTI) responds to the NASA SBIR solicitation X8 "Space Cryogenic Systems" under subtopic X8.01, "Cryogenic Fluid Transfer and Handling".  The proposed Phase I SBIR program is aimed at developing new cryogenic insulations for passive thermal control, resulting in zero boil-off storage of cryogens.  The passive thermal control will serve to limit the heat leak into the cryogenic storage system.  The proposed technology is expected to increase reliability, increase cryogenic system performance, and is capable of being made flight qualified for the flight systems and to meet Exploration Systems mission requirements.   We propose to develop advanced closed cell organic/inorganic hybrid microfoams offering affordable cost, lightweight, high strength, low thermal conductivity, high thermal stability, and easy processability which will result in improved efficiency and reliability of the cryogenic systems.  The proposed approach will be environmentally friendly and will not emit any volatile organic compound (VOC).   The closed cell structure of these novel foams will prevent the occurrence of cryopumping.   Once the feasibility of fabrication of strong, lightweight cryogenic insulating materials by the proposed technology is demonstrated in Phase I, we shall scale-up this technology in a Phase II program to meet the NASA's requirements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The ability of the proposed hybrid microfoams to remain flexible and resilient at cryogenic temperatures makes them an ideal choice for lightweight insulation in space applications.  Some examples of NASA applications include cryogenic insulation of storage tanks, vessels, pumps, and transfer lines on major rocket propulsion systems.  Our materials will provide NASA with robust cryogenic solutions and, therefore, will significantly decrease space mission failures. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The innovative technology proposed in this program will provide excellent thermal and electrical insulation capabilities.  The technology is ideal for numerous applications.  For instance, it can be used in military or commercial aircraft, and in the hulls of ships.  In addition, these novel microfoams can be used as laminates for circuit boards or in other electronics.  In automobiles, the foam can be used for the firewall behind the engine or in brake pads, trim, molded plastic parts, and other care elements.  They also can be used in a variety of construction applications or in recreational equipment.  Other attributes of these materials are their excellent chemical resistance, low outgassing, superior radiation resistance, and excellent wear performance.  We anticipate that parts made from these materials will be excellent replacements for metals, ceramics, and other engineering polymers.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Small Business Innovative Research Phase I proposal seeks to develop a compact mid-infrared laser spectrometer to benefit Earth science research activities. To capitalize on emerging aerial platforms, a miniaturized and ruggedized mid-infrared laser spectrometer using novel, fiber-coupled, solid state lasers will be designed to improve performance over traditional tunable diode laser systems requiring cryogenic cooling. It will measure priority gases specifically listed in the subtopic.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications for the instrument described in this proposal include the interrogation of Earth atmosphere for trace species for pollution monitoring and greenhouse gas research. The described instrument will have applications in atmospheric chemistry and satellite validation performed on uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAV) and other emerging platforms as well as spacecraft environment monitoring and terrestrial applications such as combustion diagnostics, hazard assessment, and industrial process control
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The worldwide market for gas sensors with the capabilities of the proposed system is quite large.  Numerous potential applications can be found in trace gas monitoring, pollution monitoring, industrial process control, and medical diagnostics.

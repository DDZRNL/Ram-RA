		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this SBIR Phase I program, we propose to fabricate high-efficiency and radiation hard solar cells based on InGaN material system that can cover the whole solar spectrum by adjusting the alloy composition.  The main program objectives include the fabrication of InGaN-based solar cells on large diameter substrates, with external efficiency in excess of 35%, and capable of long life operation in high radiation environment of space at elevated temperatures.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Satellites are increasingly being deployed for various space-based observations and long term missions. The development of more sophisticated satellite systems with longer missions has created the need for higher performance power sources.  Furthermore, the current solar cell technologies do not provide adequate radiation hardness for the next generation of solar panels that are needed for NASA's future inner planetary and near Sun missions.  A successful Phase I effort will result in the demonstration of novel high-efficiency InGaN-based solar cells.  In the Phase II effort, further improvements in the efficiency, reliability and lifetime of these devices will be done to achieve the required technological readiness level for insertion in future NASA missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to NASA applications, the development of high efficiency solar cells also appeals to the civilian/terrestrial sector. The use of more efficient solar cells, with capability to operate at higher temperatures, makes its possible to increase the power of an array with no increase in size or weight or to produce a lighter/smaller array with the same power. Improved efficiency means a reduction in launch and continuous operational costs for NASA and other government agencies involved in space-based operations.<BR><BR>

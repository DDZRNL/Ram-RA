		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Research is proposed for the development and implementation of state of the art, reduced order models for problems in<BR>nonlinear aeroelasticity. Highly efficient and accurate aeroelastic simulation tools will be constructed based upon the<BR>mathematical formalism of optimal prediction theory and a novel implementation of a filtered harmonic balance solution<BR>methodology. The implications of the proposed work include orders of magnitude reduction in computational time, with minimal<BR>loss of accuracy, for time periodic problems in nonlinear aeroelasticity. The application of the proposed innovations spans the<BR>range of flight, from high-speed transport vehicles, to small-scale, flapping Micro-Air vehicles. Anticipated results include 1) the<BR>implementation of the proposed reduced order methodology into both a standard grid-based aeroelastic tool and a material<BR>point method monolithic aeroelastic solver for the production of technology ready, multi-flow regime aeroelastic simulation<BR>tools 2) application of the proposed work to large-scale simulation and comparison with experiment and "full-order" aeroelastic<BR>simulations and 3) advancement of the state of knowledge for nonlinear problems in aeroelasticity in both the subsonic, low<BR>Reynolds number regime and transonic high Reynolds number regime.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A broad range of NASA applications exists for the software infrastructure that is expected to result from this SBIR effort, and<BR>NASA centers will be the initial target. The direct application to the NASA represents a prime opportunity for further product<BR>development and enhancement, as well as a potential revenue stream from engineering support and technology acquisition.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Various DoD components likely to have interests in this technology are the US Air Force, Army and Navy. Particularly, Air<BR>Force has a lot of research going on in aeroelasticity. Non-military applications represent another potential market sector.<BR>Improvements in the computational accuracy and efficiency for aeroelastic modeling are needed for a wide range of<BR>aerospace, ocean, and general engineering applications. The accurate assessment of aero-structural properties of aircrafts<BR>has been known to be very important in designing safe aircraft. Companies such as Boeing, Bell, Sikorsky, and AeroVironment<BR>are our industrial partners, and during our briefing for the technology to be developed in this SBIR, they indicated their strong<BR>interest. They will be actively involved in this project and they are expected to be immediate users of the end product. In<BR>addition, Pratt & Whitney, General Electric, General Dynamics, and Lockheed Martin represent other potential customers that<BR>we intend to aggressively pursue. And finally, corresponding companies in Europe and Asia represent an opportunity for<BR>exporting the resulting methods and technologies, provided that the NASA permits us to do this.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The objective of the Phase I is to develop, demonstrate and test novel instrumentation based on ultrasensitive laser absorption spectroscopy for sensitive real-time measurements of several important parameters for monitoring and control of oxygen production facilities and for analyses of lunar surface resources. The instrumentation will provide measurements of multiple trace gases and impurities on the lunar surface with a speed, accuracy and sensitivity not possible with current instrumentation.

		<BR>
		Instrumentation for rapid, sensitive chemical analysis of several gaseous species will enable NASA scientists and engineers to monitor the quality and quantity of oxygen production in real time and to analyze the impurities generated during processing of lunar regoliths.

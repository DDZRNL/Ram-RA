		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		R-LAM (Rad-hard Location and Attitude Module), promises a new generation of both integrated navigation modules and stand-alone navigation subsystems including nav-grade IMU's, atomic-precision clocks and GPS units compliant with the Space Plug and Play Architecture (SPA) initiative.<BR><BR>R-LAM leverages two active DARPA MTO programs.  In the Navigation-Grade Integrated Micro-Gyroscope (NG-IMG) project, Archangel Systems, Inc. has developed a MEMS IMU called NG-MARS - a spinning mass IMU with navigation-grade performance.  <BR><BR>In DARPA's Chip-Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC) program, Symmetricom, Inc has developed a clock that is 50-100X smaller and lower power than any previous atomic clock technology, while exhibiting short-term stability of &#61555;y(&#964;) < 1x10-10/&#61556;1/2 and long-term drift of < 3 x 10-10/month.<BR><BR>NASA-Goddard has constructed a rad-hard GPS called Navigator for the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) program.  Designed for high elliptical orbits (HEO), Navigator uses NASA's Geon algorithms.  Currently Navigator weight and power exceeds R-LAM requirements.  NASA-Goddard colleagues will advise the R-LAM team as they transition Navigator hardware.  <BR><BR>Intrinsix Corp. is an ASIC design house skilled in rad-hard mixed-signal design.  They will implement rad-hard support electronics for NG-MARS, CSAC and Navigator.  Intrinsix is familiar with NASA's SPA initiatives and will design the R-LAM interface for compliance.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		R-LAM outputs will serve multiple NASA missions across LEO, HEO and GEO regimes.  One example is the Magnetospheric Multiscale program  HEO mission where GPS signals are weak and intermittent.  The stand-alone IMU and clock will become COTS components in Archangel and Symmetricom product lines and available to NASA and its contractors.  <BR><BR>The GEON navigation algorithms will be ported to a low-power rad-hard processor. At the system level, both the enhanced Navigator GPS and R-LAM integrated GPS/IMU/Clock unit will be developed.  Licensing agreement between NASA and the R-LAM team will allow these products to be marketed inside and outside of NASA.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		With four rad-hard product spin-outs (IMU, Clock, GPS, R-LAM integrated unit), R-LAM's commercialization potential is high.  Non-NASA applications include:<BR><BR>Ballistic missile and interceptor guidance with DoD and its contractors as the major consumers.<BR><BR>The Air Force Small Sat program for low-cost, fast-turnaround satellites<BR>DoD pico-satellite efforts.<BR><BR>Non-navigation space-based timing applications.<BR><BR>Commercial satellite navigation systems to satellite integrators.<BR><BR>As each of these applications have need for R-LAM subsystems and integrated units, the marketing opportunities are considerable.<BR>

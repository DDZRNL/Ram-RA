		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The objective of this NASA STTR program is to develop single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) based ultracapacitors for energy storage devices (ESD) application, using NanoSonic's patented molecular level self-assembly process performed at room temperature. Specifically, we would combine advances in metallic SWCNTs, metal and oxide nanoclusters, and polymeric materials and electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) processes, to enable large-area, low-cost and integrated device manufacturing on rigid and flexible substrates. Such a combination of solution-based thin film deposition approaches to form ultracapacitor based devices and materials offers advantages over conventional high temperature and costly processes such as vacuum processes and vapour-phase deposition, in that very different materials can be incorporated uniformly at room temperature and pressure. We will perform synthesis of SWCNT and other precursors that can be used for ESA processing and transitioned to deposition of two-dimensional patterned materials.  Layer by Layer fabrication of multilayered CNT enhanced ultracapacitors leads to the analysis of chemical, physical and optical properties during and after synthesis, and verification of material morphology and response. We will study the cyclic voltammetric (CV) behavior and derive the power density from the inner integrated area. We will also investigate the specific capacitance as a function of discharge current density. From here, NanoSonic and Virginia Tech will develop an equivalent circuit model of the CNT ultracapacitor device for NASA applications. NanoSonic and Virginia Tech will also experimentally validate CNT ultracapacitor performance through extended field test evaluation, and possible testing with industrial partners, and produce first-generation ultracapacitors and energy storage systems for sale.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Ultracapacitors, also known as electrochemical capacitors or electrical double-layer capacitors, are energy storage devices which combine the high energy storage potential of batteries with the high energy transfer rate and high recharging capabilities of capacitors.  Ultracapacitors can have hundreds of times more energy density than conventional capacitors and thousands of times higher power density than batteries and may be used to power Lunar surface system vehicles. Ultracapacitors can be used as independent power sources or in a hybrid mode with rechargeable batteries to power Lunar surface mobility systems and/or portable electronic equipment such as cameras, camcorders and power tools.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Due to their high capacitance and high power, ultracapacitors can be effective energy storage devices for a wide variety of applications. In low-voltage configurations of 5.5 volts or less, ultracapacitors have applications in consumer electronics, such as backup power supplies for memories, microcomputers and clocks. In higher voltage configurations, ultracapacitors have opportunities in electrical power load leveling, battery augmentation and pulse discharge applications, such as in wireless communication products. Other battery augmentation applications are possible in electric and fuel cell vehicles in which ultracapacitors could be used to boost acceleration and regulate braking energy. Since ultracapacitors can be recharged many times faster than rechargeable batteries and through many thousands of cycles, ultracapacitors have applications in rechargers for such products as power tools, cordless phones, flashlights, electric shavers and other rechargeable devices. Ultracapacitors are also expected to be useful in a wide range of robotic applications.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA seeks to develop high specific energy primary batteries that are safe and capable of performing under a wide temperature range, for manned space missions. To meet this goal, CFX Battery Inc. proposes to develop, characterize, and establish technological feasibility of a new Li/SF-CFx based high capacity lithium primary battery that offers higher rate capability and enhanced safety than conventional Li/CFx primary systems. In Phase I of the project, CFX Battery will develop the sub-fluorinated CFx cathode materials that offer high capacity (>700 mAh/g) and rate capability. In addition, novel non-flammable electrolytes that are highly conductive and electrochemically stable at a wide temperature range will be developed to increase the safety of the Li/SF-CFx system. The technological feasibility of the sub-fluorinated CFx cathode and non-flammable electrolyte combination will be demonstrated using small coin and pouch cells. Phase II of the project will implement the developed technology in large cell formats and perform any refinement and optimization that will be needed to bring the technology to a commercially usable stage.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is in constant need of a safe, high energy primary battery that is tolerant to the extreme conditions encountered during space missions.  The commercially existing lithium primary batteries, including Li/MnO2 and Li/SOCl2, have low energy density values or safety issues that make them incompatible for manned space missions. The successful completion of Phase I work will demonstrate the feasibility of using a high-rate sub-fluorinated CFx cathode and non-flammable ionic liquid electrolyte pair for the development of a safe, high energy lithium primary battery system that can be used for NASA's exploratory mission applications including power to support outposts, habitats, and science packages. The high specific energy will greatly reduce the mass of the batteries used onboard in long distance space missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The success of the proposed approach of developing a safe, high energy density lithium primary cell will also open other avenue of business opportunities such as the oil field, military, transportation, and commercial markets. Oil fields require primary batteries that can withstand temperature up to 150oC, to power electronics used down-hole for data logging, monitor, and control. The currently used Li/SOCl2 battery system has lower capacity and safety issues that justify the search for an alternative power source. The proposed ionic liquid based lithium primary battery has the necessary specific energy and temperature resistance for down-hole applications. It will also serve as a safe and reliable power supply for military radio man-pack, tire pressure monitoring system, implantable medical devices, utility meters, memory back-up, portable electronic such as cameras and measuring equipments, and emergency power source.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Small and micro-spacecrafts require the efficient, micro-propulsion systems.  Chemical micro-propulsion is best suited for use as primary thrust, orbital insertion and attitude control because of its high energy density.  When grouped into arrays for larger thrust applications, micro-propulsion devices provide high propulsive flexibility or can be used as igniters.<BR><BR>The proposed effort will focus on thermo-catalytic ignition and combustion of advanced mono- and bi-propellants in micro-channels; and the development of a micro-propulsion device. An innovative near net shape forming technique, in combination with carbon nanotube deposition, will facilitate manufacturing of sub-millimeter diameter micro-channels and tubes with enhanced internal surfaces area for maximum catalytic reaction. The microchannels will provide thermo-catalytic ignition of bi-propellant rockets without needing high voltage igniters and can also provide stable and reliable ignition source for advanced, environmentally friendly, mono-propellants. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Mono-propellant rocket engines, bi-propellant rockets, and igniters for large rocket engines for large, small (100 kg), very small (10 kg) and very, very small (1 kg) satellites.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to NASA applications, the technology has many commercial applications including iridium electrodes for ferroelectric capacitors and high-performance spark plug igniters; crystal growth crucibles, catalyst electrodes for chemical production processes; and radiation oncology.

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

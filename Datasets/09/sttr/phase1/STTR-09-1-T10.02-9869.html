		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed innovation is the replacement of existing test stand and parking lot  fixtures with current SSL LED technology. The replacement fixtures will reduce energy consumption, generate less heat and provide maintenance free operation for over 50,000 hours. An explosion-proof fixture is capable of containing an internal combustion event without allowing flames or hot gasses to escape to the surrounding environment. The lighting fixture defined is an explosion-proof fixture for use in hazardous hydrogen/oxygen atmospheres. Current fixtures contain a 110 Watt reflectored incandescent lamp. SSL sources are remarkably efficient compared to incandescent sources. The 110 Watt lamp in existing explosion-proof fixtures will be replaced by an SSL fixture requiring only around 29 Watts for the equivalent lighting output.  The proposed Energy Focus solution will be an efficient, solid-state, explosion-proof  fixture for use in hydrogen/oxygen atmospheres which is compatible with current systems and provides the required lighting distribution. It will do this through advanced thermal and electrical power management to ensure long fixture life

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications will include replacement of existing explosion <BR>proof fixtures for test stands and replacement of parking lot and <BR>low bay fixtures. Energy Focus has already achieved some sales of its Solid-State Lighting (LED) products to the DoD. These were the result of contacts made within the DoD sourcing community during the execution of the DARPA Temporary Ship Installation of HEDLight program. Energy Focus built and installed high efficient LED and HID lighting systems for the Fort Meade Commissary located in Ft. Meade, Maryland. The first LED application replaced 36 incandescent globe fixtures in a drive-in/walk-in freezer unit with 15 Watt LED globes. A second LED application was a dock installation which replaced 150 Watt Par spotlights with 15 Watt LED spotlights. Energy Focus is presently working with GSA (Government Services Administration) to obtain listing for several of its energy-efficient lighting products.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Energy Focus currently sells a wide range of commercial SSL lighting products:<BR><BR>	LED Dock Lights<BR>	LED Globe Lights<BR>	LED Light Rails<BR>	LED MR-16 replacements<BR><BR>Energy Focus Inc has traditionally utilized direct sales, or sales through distributors for bringing products to the market place. This practice has been successful in the past and this strategy will be used for bringing EFOI<BR>Ergonomic LED Products to the commercial market. We will use a dedicated staff to educate lighting specifiers and support them as needed to help them decide to incorporate our fixtures into their lighting plans. We will go to energy managers at large companies and enlist their help in convincing merchandisers that a change to this technology can be made without affecting the look of the store while improving the well-being and working efficiency of their employees and increasing the alertness of their customers. Sales tools will include catalogs, CDs with data for lighting simulation programs, direct mailings and demonstration kits.<BR>

		NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In providing an innovative solution to improving information technologies and health management systems, AGNC is proposing a significant technological achievement with the Advanced Structural Health Monitoring System for Comprehensive Real-Time Vehicle Characterization. During in-flight conditions, this system is able to not only provide the status of information such as regarding the flight envelope, but also make accurate diagnostic and prognostic statements of aircraft subsystems. Real-time capabilities are enabled using intelligent algorithms and advanced techniques to provide both time and frequency localization of data. As such, the health management system is able to provide information quickly enough as to monitor an aircraft subsystem in a highly dynamic environment and to make statements regarding anomalies as well as future problems. A key enabling technology is newly developed low-power sensors that offer significant advantages over traditional sensor methods. In addition, automated reasoning technologies to improve sustainability, increase identification of system degradation, and enhance scientific understanding include data fusion, and advanced decision-making, among others. With this system, a comprehensive image of the system/subsystems, and in particular, the structural components, is provided in real-time.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Advanced Structural Health Monitoring System (ASHMS) will directly support a host of NASA's information technology and health monitoring requirements. The proposed system is specifically designed with aircraft in mind as it provides an increased understanding of the complex interactions of the vehicle intrinsic modes and its structures by constantly providing relevant information that aids in characterizing the in-flight vehicle. Examples of specific application areas include unmanned aircraft such as NASA Helios, Pathfinder, and other newer critical high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) technologies. In addition, the ASHMS system would find use for unmanned hypersonic aircraft (X-43) as well as non-aircraft applications such as the International Space Station, and the Space Shuttle.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		One of the main objectives of this STTR is the commercialization of the project's research results and introduction of a commercialized product to the marketplace (both civilian and military). The ASHMS system will provide an integral solution for information technologies with respect to health monitoring for both military and civilian aircraft. Different types of aircraft may use the proposed product such as fixed-wing types or rotor-wing types. Further non-aviation uses include monitoring of other vehicle types such as maritime applications with barges, navy ships, submarines, as well as autonomous ground vehicles.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The overall objective of the proposal is to design, develop and demonstrate a potentially portable Compton x-ray scatter 3D-imaging system by using specially designed rotationally movable x-ray source and x-ray detector, and the development of a suitable 3D-processing computer model. <BR><BR>The proposed rotational configuration will allow the acquisition of multiple projections or images 360a around the region of interest, probing a conical volume of the object to be interrogated. The subsequent application of a computer model on these multiple projections, developed during Phase I, will allow a three-dimensional reconstruction of the object under study.<BR><BR>In the proposed x-ray imaging system, the primary technical advance will be to extend methods that normally supplied a 2D projected image through a sheet of material, to a 3D image with more complicated features at different depths, such as cracks, corrosion, voids, delaminations, land mines, or improvised explosive devices.  Also, the proposed system will be potentially portable, allowing it to be brought to the object to be imaged.<BR><BR>The Beta and Production Phases of the proposed system would incorporate a battery self-contained package and wireless data transfer capabilities. These systems would revolutionize the current imaging applications that rely on 2D x-ray imaging systems only.  <BR>

		The proposed three-dimensional backscatter x-ray imaging system addresses he interest for NASA is one-side 3D imaging of non-uniformities in non metallic space flight materials. The proposed x-ray backscatter 3D system will help determine defects, voids or imperfections in the workmanship of the Space Shuttle components at the launch site. <BR><BR>In general, a portable, wireless 3D or in-depth imaging capability will address the NASA¡¦s need for a system that can generate 3D images of non-metallic materials when the access is limited to one side of them. The system portability will allow it to be brought to the spacecraft and to be handled in the field for multiple applications. Furthermore, this 3D capability can be used at the launch site to meet the inspection requirements for new NASA programs, such as the Constellation program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Aerospace - In addition to NASA's needs, there is a routine need in the aerospace industry to inspect for metal fatigue on the wings and fuselage of airplanes.<BR><BR>Cargo Inspection - There is a demonstrated need for one-sided imaging for inspecting cargo and other transportation containers that are already loaded onto a ship or other transportation carrier. A portable, battery-powered unit would enable random inspections at a much lower cost than truck-based imaging systems.<BR><BR>Explosives Detection - Current explosives ordinance detection systems require an imaging plate to be positioned behind a suspicious package such as a suitcase or backpack.  The x-ray source is positioned in front of the package, and an x-ray transmission image is obtained. <BR> <BR>Construction and Related Industries - There is a need for contractors to be able to image inside walls, floors, ceilings, etc., to determine the location of pipes, electrical wires, and other internal obstructions before demolition or remodel work.<BR>

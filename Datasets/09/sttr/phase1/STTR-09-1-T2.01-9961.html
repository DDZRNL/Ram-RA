		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		ASSURE - Aeroelastic / Aeroservoelastic (AE/ASE) Uncertainty and Reliability Engineering capability - is a set of probabilistic computer programs for isolating uncertainties in simulation, manufacturing, test, measurement, and test to analysis correlation affecting the AE/ASE characteristics of advanced flight vehicles in flight and on the ground, and for studying the effects of such uncertainties.  ASSURE will provide a quantitative assessment of the statistics of AE/ASE stability and dynamic response of aircraft at given flight conditions, throughout the flight envelope, on the runway, and throughout the aircraft fleet and its missions.  It is designed to have significant flexibility in the types of problems analyzed, the solution methods used, and how problems are defined.  ASSURE will be unique in the scope of problems tackled, systems complexity involved, and the inclusion of all elements affecting the ASE behavior of flight vehicles; including detailed models of structures, aerodynamics, sensors, actuators, control systems, landing gear, and flight operations and maintenance procedures.  Uncertainties of the undamaged and damaged / repaired systems (structural, actuator, sensor, control computer, and landing gear, including possible aerodynamic consequences of damage) will be covered, with applications to test planning and analysis, design, certification, and fleet operation and maintenance.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Proposed ASSURE development will equip NASA with a comprehensive Aeroelastic / Aeroservoelastic uncertainty, reliability, and safety assessment and optimization tool that will be applicable to practically all of NASA's aerospace flight vehicle system development, optimization, test, and operation, including fleet management for NASA vehicles and for flight transportation system researched by NASA.  ASSURE will contribute to the evolution of small and large UAVs, efficient and environmentally friendly new transport flight vehicles flying at all flight regimes, launch and re-entry vehicles, high performance vehicles, and any vehicles displaying tight integration and interaction of light weight structures, unsteady aerodynamics, active controls (including engine controls), and advanced landing gear systems.  ASSURE will help guide test planning and the utilization of test results for such vehicles covering flight, runway operations and ground tests.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Proposed ASSURE development will equip the aerospace industry with a comprehensive Aeroelastic / Aeroservoelastic uncertainty, reliability, and safety assessment and optimization tool that will be applicable to practically all aerospace flight vehicle system development, optimization, test, and operation, including fleet management and maintenance procedures for airlines and the US DoD.  ASSURE will have the potential to contribute to the certification of flight vehicles and increase safety.  It will contribute to the evolution of small and large UAVs, efficient and environmentally friendly new transport flight vehicles flying at all flight regimes, launch and re-entry vehicles, high performance vehicles, and any vehicles displaying tight integration and interaction of light weight structures, unsteady aerodynamics, active controls (including engine controls), and advanced landing gear systems. ASSURE will help guide test planning and the utilization of test results for such vehicles by the aerospace industry, covering flight, runway operations and ground tests.  It will also help support universities in ASE and airplane design education.

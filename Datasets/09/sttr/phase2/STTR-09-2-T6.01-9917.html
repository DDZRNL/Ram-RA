		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase 2 effort focuses on development of a supercapacitor energy storage device based on novel metal oxide-carbon nanocomposites. In the Phase 1 project, NanoScale discovered a group of cathode nanocomposites with an exceptionally high capacitance of 270 F/g and a large potential window of 3.8 V versus metallic lithium in inorganic electrolytes. The combination of a large capacitance and a high achievable device voltage, allows for construction of hybrid supercapacitors with high energy and power densities and a very long lifetime. Importantly, the materials developed by NanoScale are easy to produce on a large industrial scale since no costly raw materials or manufacturing methods are required.<BR>In Phase 2, a complete supercapacitor system, including nanocomposite cathode and anode electrodes and nonaqueous low temperature electrolytes, will be tested and optimized. The proposed project will be a joint effort between NanoScale Corporation, Battelle Memorial Institute, the STTR partner, and Rayovac, a well known battery manufacturer. This team is uniquely qualified to carry out the proposed research due to its rich experience in manufacturing of nanoscale materials, supercapacitor development and large scale battery manufacturing. NanoScale and Battelle will jointly develop the proposed supercapacitor system. Rayovac will fabricate and evaluate prototype supercapacitors.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The top level requirements of NASA space applications demand highly efficient and highly reliable energy storage systems. Long cycle lifetime (100,000 cycles), long calendar lifetime (years or decades), and temperature performance, specifically -40 <SUP>o</SUP>C and below requirements favor supercapacitors over batteries in space systems. Existing supercapacitors based on carbons or ruthenium oxide offer low capacities or are prohibitively expensive. The proposed project will develop new materials that have high potential to provide superior capacities and be economical. This development will enable a new generation of supercapacitors for various NASA missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Technologies that allow for storage of electrical energy are critically important for today's energy-intensive applications. Hybrid and electric cars, power conditioning or backup systems, and various portable electronic devices (cameras, camcorders, and power tools) all require high density storage of energy and high power delivery rates. Supercapacitors are expected to be widely used in these applications and provide the high power density and long lifetime capabilities that are out of reach for batteries. Unfortunately, existing carbon based supercapacitors are inefficient for these applications while the state of the art ruthenium oxide devices are prohibitively expensive. Nanocomposite materials that will be developed in this project will combine high capacities with low cost and will satisfy the demands of industrial and Customer applications. NanoScale and Battelle anticipate great commercial opportunities originating from the proposed project.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The innovation proposed here is a high performance, high fidelity simulation capability to enable accurate, fast and robust simulation of unsteady turbulent, reacting flows involving propellants of relevance to NASA (GOX/GH2, LOX/LH2 and LOX/LCH4).  The key features of this proposed capability are: (a) Hybrid RANS-LES (HRLES) methodology, and (b) flamelet modeling for turbulent combustion, incorporated in a proven existing solver called Loci-STREAM which has been developed by the proposing personnel under funding from NASA over the last several years.  Basic flamelet methodology has been incorporated in Loci-STREAM during Phase 1 work and tested on gas-gas injectors of relevance to NASA.  The enhancements in Loci-STREAM resulting from Phase 1 work have demonstrated an order of magnitude improvement in simulation turnaround times relative to existing capability for turbulent reacting flow applications at NASA. The work proposed during Phase 2 will extend the flamelet methodology to real-fluid flows, wall heat transfer and variable pressures.  This will ultimately result in a state-of-the-art design and analysis tool to enable the accurate modeling of for multiphase combustion in solid and liquid rocket engines, combustion stability analysis, etc. which constitute critical components of versatile space propulsion engines part of NASA's deep space missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The outcome of Phase 2 activities will be a powerful CFD-based design and analysis tool for propulsion engines of relevance to NASA.  This tool is envisioned to be useful for full rocket engine simulations, injector design, etc.  Specific applications at NASA of this capability include: (a) design improvements of injectors of SSME, J-2X and RS-68 engines as well as potential novel designs to be developed for NASA's proposed heavy lift vehicle, (b) modeling of multi-element injectors coupled with fuel and oxidizer feedlines and manifolds, (c) prediction of stability and stability margins, (d) design of acoustic cavities for combustion stability, etc.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The computational tool resulting from this project will have wide-ranging commercial applications.  The Hybrid RANS-LES methodology can be used for a wide variety of engineering applications involving unsteady turbulent flows.  The reacting flow capability can be used for simulating combusting flows in various industrial applications, such as gas turbine engines, diesel engines, etc.  The real-fluids methodology can be used in a large number of industrial flow situations involving both chemically inert and reacting flows.  With additions of multi-phase combustion modeling capability, the applicability of this tool can be further broadened.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed effort will develop a solid-state LED replacement lamp for rocket engine test stand lighting and more general hazardous-location lighting.  The LED lighting will produce a smoother lighting spectrum compared to the existing arc lamp sources which will improve the visual accuracy and quality of high-speed engine photography.  The LED lighting will also last significantly longer than arc lamps which require frequent replacement in hazardous-gas environment.  A specialized array of optical collectors will redirect the light more effectively to the needed test areas using principles on non-imaging optics.  The result will be improved lighting for engine diagnostics, lower operating costs for the test stand, much longer lamp life and a safer environment by reducing or eliminating lighting maintenance operations in an explosive environment.  <BR><BR>The housing will also be shock, vibration and heat resistant to be able to withstand the proximate effects of live-fire rocket engine testing.  The electronic controls for the lighting will be sited remotely from the lamp head to be consistent with the existing facility and for thermal and reliability considerations. Additionally, a hazardous-location LED lighting device for general illumination which is not for high-speed engine diagnostics will also be developed and tested.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential applications include increasing the energy efficiency, lighting quality and maintenance effectiveness in all gantry and test-type facilities where there are hazardous or explosive gasses or materials.  This includes but is not limited to Stennis, KSC, Goddard, Dryden, White Sands, Langley, Wallops, Glenn.  
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The number of non-NASA applications is vast.  A high-intensity solid-state hazardous-location lighting fixture will have direct application in the following areas: petroleum refineries, oil drilling rigs, sugar refineries, grain silos, coal mines, sawmills, industrial painting facilities, chemical processing plants, steel mills, subways tunnels, tunnel roadways, sewers, rail yards, natural gas storage and distribution centers, liquefied gas depots, gasoline pumping and refueling stations, navy vessels, army ammunition and fuel depots, airports, and hazmat field response deployment units.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Computational tools that accurately predict the performance of electric propulsion<BR>devices are highly desirable and beneficial to NASA and the broader electric propulsion<BR>community. The current state-of-the-art in electric propulsion modeling relies heavily on<BR>empirical data and on numerous computational "knobs". In Phase I of this project, we<BR>developed the most detailed ion engine discharge chamber model that currently exists.<BR>This is a kinetic model that simulates all particles in the discharge chamber along with a<BR>physically correct simulation of the electric fields. In addition, kinetic erosion models are<BR>included for modeling the ion-impingement effects on thruster component erosion. For<BR>Phase II of this project, the goal is to make this sophisticated computer program a user<BR>friendly program that NASA and other governmental and industrial customers are able to<BR>utilize. In Phase II we will implement a number of advanced numerical routines to bring<BR>the computational time down to a commercially acceptable level. At the end of Phase II,<BR>NASA will have a highly sophisticated, user friendly ion engine discharge chamber<BR>modeling tool that will save time and expense in designing new and different size ion<BR>engines, as well as analyzing existing ion engine performance.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This ion thruster discharge chamber computational tool will reduce the time and expense<BR>that NASA incurs in the development of future ion engines. There are a number of space<BR>missions which ion engines could fulfill if different size engines could be designed<BR>quickly and cheaply. The computational tool being developed for this project will help to<BR>make this happen. This tool is also valuable in extending NASA's understanding of the<BR>current 40-cm diameter NEXT thruster that NASA GRC is currently testing for use in<BR>space. This tool can be used to extend the operating range of the NEXT ion engine to<BR>higher power levels, as is being considered in the NEXT STEP program. With some<BR>adjustments, this computational tool can simulate Hall thrusters, such as the HiVHAC<BR>thruster, which is currently being developed at NASA GRC.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Electric propulsion is important to other government agencies including the Air Force<BR>and the Navy. Air Force electric propulsion will benefit from additional/advanced<BR>plasma-surface interaction models available in our computer code. The multi-billion<BR>dollar military and commercial satellite industries design and develop electric thrusters<BR>similar to the ones used at NASA for the purposes of satellite station keeping and orbit<BR>changing maneuvers in space. These industries could benefit from sophisticated, userfriendly<BR>computational tools, one of which we are developing. The innovations proposed<BR>in this work will also benefit the ion source and plasma processing industries which are<BR>utilized in materials processing applications and the electronics industries.

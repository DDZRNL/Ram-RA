		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed innovation provides a way to design low flow coefficient inducers that have higher cavitation breakdown margin, larger blade angles, thicker more structurally robust blades, and better off-design flow stability than the current state-of-the-art designs.  The technology will increase the structural, stability, and suction margin of inducers designed in the currently acceptable flow coefficient range of about 0.06 to 0.1.  In addition, it will allow for stable and structurally robust designs at much lower flow coefficients than previously thought possible (down to at least 0.02) for the capability to operate in near zero net positive suction pressure inlet environments.  The innovation is based upon a synergistic coupling of Concepts NREC's patented cavitation control device with a new blade design approach that takes full advantage of the CCD's characteristics for optimal suction performance.  The technology significantly enhances the capability of rocket engine systems through increased thrust-to-weight, specific impulse, simplicity, operational safety, and turbopump life.  It will also reduce turbopump and propellant tank weight and system costs by eliminating boost pump systems and allowing for lighter lower pressure tanks.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology could be used as a retrofit onto current, in development, or future rocket engines for launch vehicle or in space propulsion that require high suction performance, high turbopump efficiency, and wide operating range.  It is ideally suited for clean sheet engine designs where the full advantage of moving a key system constraint, pump suction performance, can be used to optimize the entire launch system.  The technology could also be used for propellant ground handling systems and aircraft fuel pumps were fuel vaporization is an issue.  Ultimately, the technology opens up the rocket engine/vehicle design space and allows for a large increase in vehicle performance by significantly moving the pump suction performance constraint from its current position.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology could be used for any situation where it is necessary to pump a low vapor pressure fluid.  Nuclear reactor boiler feed pumps, vehicle fuel pumps, cryogenic fluid transfer pumps, high speed industrial pumps, and super critical C02 power cycles pumps are all potential commercial applications.  In addition, the inducer suction performance predictive capability that will be validated and enhanced during this project will be incorporated into Concepts NREC's suite of commercially available turbomachinery design software tools.

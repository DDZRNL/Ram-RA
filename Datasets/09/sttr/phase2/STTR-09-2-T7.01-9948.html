		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA application requires a system that can generate 3D images of non-metallic material when access is limited to one side of the material. The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing and build a new, practical, potentially portable, battery operated, self-contained Compton x-ray backscatter 3D imaging system by using a specially designed automated rotationally movable x-ray source, a 2D x-ray detector with a highly collimator system and the development of a suitable 3D processing computer model. In the proposed x-ray imaging system, the primary technical advance will be to extend methods that normally supply a 2D projected image through a sheet of material, to a 3D image with more complicated features at different depths, such as voids, cracks, corrosion or delaminations. The portability of the proposed imaging system will allow bringing it to the object to be imaged. Phase 2 will be conducted with a focus on technology transition and an understanding of what it will take to demonstrate and qualify the proposed method in a prototype for use in an actual imaging system and a realistic environment. Also in Phase II, time reduction in setup, data image acquisition, and 3D-image reconstruction analysis will be realized by remote automated control of the operation and movement of a brighter x-ray source and a state-of-the-art digital flat panel detector in conjunction with a highly  collimator system.

		<BR>
		The proposed three-dimensional backscatter x-ray imaging system addresses the interest for NASA in one-sided 3D imaging of non-uniformities in non metallic space flight materials. The proposed x-ray backscatter 3D system will help determine defects, voids or imperfections in the workmanship of the Space Shuttle components at the launch site. The system portability will allow it to be brought to the spacecraft and to be handled in the field for multiple applications. Furthermore, this 3D capability can be used at the launch site to meet the inspection requirements for new NASA programs, such as the Constellation program.  Additional potential applications include inspection for micro-meteorite damage to shielding layers in inflatable habitats, and inspection for damage to re-entry vehicle heat shields.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Aerospace - In addition to NASA's needs, there is a routine need in the aerospace industry to inspect for metal fatigue on the wings and fuselage of airplanes. Cargo Inspection - There is a demonstrated need for one-sided imaging for inspecting cargo and other transportation containers that are already loaded onto a ship or other transportation carrier. A portable, battery-powered unit would enable random inspections at a much lower cost than truck-based imaging systems. Explosives Detection - Current explosives ordinance detection systems require an imaging plate to be positioned behind a suspicious package such as a suitcase or backpack. The proposed system will allow imaging from one-side only. Construction and Related Industries - There is a need for contractors to be able to image inside walls, floors, ceilings, etc., to determine the location of pipes, electrical wires, and other internal obstructions before demolition or remodel work. <BR>

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This project?s goal is to produce a flight qualifiable tunable laser system specifically for use in optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) based distributed fiber Bragg grating sensing applications. This work represent an enabling technology for NASA's requirement for distributed optical fiber sensing  for health monitoring, aviation safety, and aircraft morphing programs. The work is based on the Phase I feasibility studies which generated two approaches for producing OFDR targeted laser systems. These systems have the unique combination of rapid tuning and immunity to mode hops. The proposed designs have reduced alignment tolerances and built in wavelength tracking. These features provide a level of hardening to environmental influences that will make flight qualification of the systems possible as well as cost effective. An integral part to both approaches is the incorporation of a high speed, high resolution, tracking wavemeter. This feature allows for the use of tunable lasers both with and without mode hops.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Distributed optical fiber sensing which is the motivation for this work has applications in many commercial areas. This technology competes directly with conventional strain gage and thermocouple sensors in the industrial sensors market. Applications in air and ground based health monitoring will be dominated by the distributed optical fiber sensing in the coming years due to the need for high sensor density in these applications. The extremely high sensor density is also opening up new markets for routine sensing in industrial processes and products. One of the approaches pursued in this proposal will drastically increase system performance while reducing costs. This will of course remove barriers to entry in all market areas.

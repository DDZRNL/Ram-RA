<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The goal of VCTOSS is to enable the creation and deployment of highly effective training and operations support materials by using new lightweight 3D simulation technology.  This lightweight approach to 3D simulation makes it possible to: (1) electronically transmit materials to physically distributed mission participants, (2) run 3D simulations on COTS portable computers used on-orbit, and (3) economically apply the technology to broad application areas in procedures training.   This approach is made possible by a rapid applications development system built specifically for the creation of network friendly 3D simulation.  The Phase 1 project was intended to validate the concept of using lightweight 3D simulation for spaceflight applications.  The Phase 2 project will greatly expand the applications of this approach by enabling collaborative use of the training materials. This will allow 3D simulation based training and operations support to be conducted collaboratively by geographically distributed participants using existing low bandwidth Internet connections.  Thus, VCTOSS can have significant implications to (1) increase efficiency and effectiveness of preflight and flight-based training, (2) provide additional opportunity for real-time interactive support employing 3D models with expert collaboration, and (3) increase the ability to recovery from off-nominal situations, which may have significant performance and safety implications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
One of the most promising aspects of high definition training and operations support media the wide range of applications and benefits that represent markets of 10?s to 100?s of millions of dollars. The primary general applications that can be applied to many market segments include an advance field service support system, training systems for industry and university, virtual education systems, and advanced collaborative customer service systems. The field operations and support market has wide potential in many applications including aircraft, computers, medical equipment, power systems, etc. The virtual laboratory can bring computer simulation techniques that are familiar to researchers into any classroom. Corporate and organizational training systems that bring in collaborative experts for key areas and allow the virtual, remote training to more efficiently use employee and trainer time. Web-based customer service that empower consumers to conduct self-service and allows collaborative service with a remote expert.

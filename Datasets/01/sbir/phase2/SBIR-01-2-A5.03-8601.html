<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
No timely and cost-effective methods now exist for fabrication of thick-section (>=2"), continuous fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMCs). Application of such CMCs can enhance the efficiency and performance, reduce the weight, improve the durability, and lower the cost of aerospace propulsion systems, particularly those used in high temperature, high-stress environments. Achieving these benefits requires development of matrix infiltration techniques capable of efficiently producing thick parts. The quality of such parts will also depend on implementation of improved fiber/matrix interfaces and interface deposition techniques. Carbon fibers are of particular interest as CMC reinforcements because they are relatively inexpensive, have higher strength and stiffness and lower density than oxide or non-oxide ceramic fibers, and retain their mechanical properties at very high temperatures. The main drawback of carbon fibers is their low oxidation resistance, which has prevented their extensive use in high temperature oxidizing environments. Oxide interfaces can potentially impart sufficient protection, as well as provide other essential interface functions related to load transfer between fibers. In Phase I, Ultramet demonstrated a unique and innovative process for depositing oxide interfaces, specifically ultraviolet-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (UVCVD), throughout thick fiber preforms. Ultramet also successfully achieved rapid infiltration of carbide matrices into thick-section (1") fiber preforms, up to 98% dense, using an innovative melt infiltration process and obtained initial mechanical properties and oxidation performance of the resultant composites. In Phase II, Ultramet will optimize material selection and processing parameters to produce low-porosity carbon/silicon carbide (C/SiC) thick-section CMCs having optimal strength, stiffness, and oxidation performance, and scale up the processing to fabricate components up to 14" diameter x 2.5" thick.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Cost-effective, rapid fabrication of thick-section ceramic matrix composites will potentially benefit a number of component applications.  Within this project, aerospace applications are of particular interest.  A broad range of aerospace components would benefit from an economical thick-section C/SiC composite offering a long lifetime in a high temperature oxidizing environment while under load.  Specific applications include high temperature engine panels (e.g. those needed for hypersonic propulsion hot gas flow paths), combustors, inlet nozzles (stators), turbine disks, process industry parts requiring high temperature capability and corrosive environment resistance for extended periods (e.g. hot gas and liquid handling equipment), furnace structures, and high temperature filter elements. Successful generic demonstration and database development of the proposed technology could support any of these applications.

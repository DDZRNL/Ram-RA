<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
An airborne fire is one of the most dreaded emergencies, as all pilots will acknowledge.  Isolated at high altitudes, a fire-induced loss of systems can disable the aircraft beyond control.  The space shuttles and the International Space Station face an even worse predicament. While an aircraft can land on a short notice, spacecraft are totally vulnerable.  Existing fire sensors detect smoke or flame, indicating that the fire is in a relatively advanced stage, but these systems produce false alarms 199 times out of 200.  Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) proposes to develop a fire onset detection system (FODS) that will: (a) detect fire at a very early stage, without false alarm, by performing trend analysis on key chemical markers and temperature, and (b) provide a continuous status update for intelligent decision making by the crew.  In Phase I, IOS established the feasibility of FODS by detecting 50 ppm of carbon monoxide. In Phase II, the project team will develop and test a compact FODS prototype. This prototype system will have the capability to react to several fire markers simultaneously with a high level of reliability.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
IOS's early-warning fire detection system will improve the aircraft industry's ability to detect in-flight fires. In 1997, the Federal Aviation Administration estimated that the incorporation of fire detectors in Class D cargo holds would result in a savings to the airlines of $458 million in incident and accident reductions over the lifetime of the aircraft that existed at that time. The dramatic reduction in false alarm, and increase in the sensitivity that IOS?s system offers will nearly double these savings. The system will also have applications in manufacturing facilities, buildings, and on ships.<br>Other possible applications include: a) environmental gas sensing; b) flammable gas detection in the fire hazard areas; and c) evaluation of gas mixtures in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry.<br>Another potential application includes chemical and biological warfare agent detection by remotely tracing vapors of the explosives and chemicals. The market for chemical and biological warfare agent detectors could reach nearly $400 million in 2002, rising to $490 million by 2007.<br>

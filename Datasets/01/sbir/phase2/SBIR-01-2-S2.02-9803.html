<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Global Aerospace Corporation is developing an innovative, new trajectory and performance tool for Earth and planetary balloons and lighter-than-air (LTA) systems, called Navajo. No software tool like Navajo currently exists. The key innovations of this concept are integrated vertical and horizontal trajectory modeling, application to Earth and planetary balloons and LTA systems, a graphical user interface, and a computer-platform-independent software package. Additional innovations are (a) the decoupling of environment and balloon trajectory models to allow a given balloon design to be flown in any number of environments with different levels of fidelity (b) the integration of safety analysis of Earth balloon flights for in-flight and pre-flight safety calculations, (c) improved fidelity of thermal models, and (d) an extensible application architecture to allow different balloon designs and new environments. <br><br>Navajo is a new, advanced, and modern simulation and analysis tool to enable the development of new balloon and LTA technologies for Earth and planetary applications.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The potential commercial market for Navajo includes those organizations and individuals that study, design, fabricate, fly, or analyze Earth tropospheric, Earth stratospheric, or planetary balloons and lighter-than-air systems (LTAs). These organizations would use Navajo to develop new balloon or LTA vehicle types; fine-tune models to better predict balloon or LTA vehicle performance; develop balloon platform component designs, such as valve, ballast or propulsion systems; develop new campaign and mission concepts; perform detailed, pre-flight analyses of launch trajectories; develop and analyze planetary balloon mission concepts; and evaluate in-flight safety and mission sequencing options.<br><br>

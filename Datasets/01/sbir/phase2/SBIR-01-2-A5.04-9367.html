<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The key innovation of this proposal is the design of a low-cost high data rate wireless sensor network for rocket engine test facilities.  Time Modulated Ultra-wideband (TM-UWB) technology is the key to implementing this wireless sensor network. To the best of our knowledge, no other wireless technology can achieve the high data rate and high channel capacity required for rocket engine testing. During Phase I, we have demonstrated the feasibility of our concept. In Phase II, we will further develop the complete architecture and develop a prototype wireless sensor network to evaluate the system performance and fields demonstrate its capability. The proposed wireless sensor network consists of a network controller and many smart sensor nodes. Each smart sensor node is equipped with a TM-UWB transmitter, a narrow band receiver, and a multiplexed data acquisition system. The UWB transmitter is used to transmit the digitized sensor data to the network controller at a data rate of at least 1.25Mbps. The narrow band receiver is used to receive control and configuration commands from the network controller, which will be very infrequent and can be very low data rate. We believe this is the most cost effective architecture for Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
For current rocket engine testing, a long wire needs to be connected from each sensor on the test stand to the signal-conditioning center. Furthermore, the sensor configurations always need to be changed for testing different rocket engines. These wiring and configuration changes represent significant cost and time for the test. With the proposed TM-UWB wireless sensor networks, this cost and the preparation time can be greatly reduced. This cost and time saving will attract government agencies, including NASA and US Air Force, to use this wireless sensor network for their engine testing facilities. None of the existing wireless technologies can provide high data rate and high channel capacity required in rocket test facilities, which often involves hundreds of sensors. TM-UWB also offers other advantages over other wireless technologies, such as spectral efficiency, coexistence with other RF devices without causing interference, and multipath Immunity. Beyond engine testing, this wireless sensor network can be for any equipment health monitoring and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, especially for large manufacturing facilities.  The fact that TDC raised $100 million of private funds for this development proves that there are many investors who believe this concept will yield valuable products.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This research will develop the multiuser collaboration infrastructure which<br>enables multiple users to interact and collaborate on host applications<br>using their mobile devices.  Multiuser collaboration is an important<br>element of ground operations in planetary rover and lander missions.<br>During mission operations, scientists need to meet often to plan science<br>activities with planning and visualization tools projected on large<br>displays.  This infrastructure will allow the scientists to interact<br>directly with the software tools to collaborate on science planning<br>activities.<br><br>The infrastructure includes (1) human-computer interaction techniques that<br>enable natural, fast, and accurate inputs, (2) application-independent<br>middleware that maintains information about the connection, state, and<br>session of individual users and enables interaction and collaboration with<br>the software applications, (3) communication protocol that ensures reliable<br>and secure connectivity between the mobile devices and host computers, (4)<br>toolkit that generates GUI components that can be displayed on mobile<br>devices, and (5) delivery and synchronization services that transport<br>application components and data for offline interactions.<br><br>The infrastructure supports a broad range of mobile devices encompassing<br>laptops, PDAs, and cellphones, and supports all desktop applications<br>running under the Windows or Unix platforms.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Business meetings, design reviews, and brainstorming sessions, are often<br>conducted with a software application projected to a large screen to<br>facilitate discussions. The software could be a presentation application,<br>CAD design tool, etc.  The Multiuser Collaboration Suite (MCS) will enable<br>the attendees to interact with the software application simultaneously from<br>anywhere in the room, using the mobile devices they often bring to the<br>meetings.  Since MCS supports all Java-enabled devices, millions of future<br>genrations of cellphone users can use MCS to interact with host<br>applications.  MCS also enables doctors in hospitals to access patient<br>records at point of care, passengers at airports to check city information,<br>customers at grocery stores to locate merchandises, etc.  MCS will also<br>provide a toolkit for developing mobile applications that are based on the<br>host applications.  The MCS toolkit enables rapid development of mobile<br>applications with minimal effort.<br>

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The control technology under development enables human operators to teach anthropomorphic robots, in the field, how to perform new complex tasks.  Building upon existing inverse kinematics, rule-based control, and neural network learning technology, the training method enhances robot capabilities through operator supervision.  The current innovation enables the online construction of rule-based plans of action through verbal dialogue between operator and robot, and uses verbal, visual, and manual cues such as spoken words, hand gestures, and the pushing of buttons and joysticks to teach neural networks how to improve nominal rule-based performance.  Phase I results indicate that given an underlying library of intelligent behaviors, non-trivial robot task plans can be created and modified verbally by an operator in a straightforward manner.  Phase II will optimize the behavior control system, training process, and operator interface.  Validation will focus on two scenarios: assisting EVA astronauts with tool preparation and handling using the Johnson Space Center?s Robonaut system, and assisting a physiologically degraded astronaut in partial gravity environments.  The show-and-tell approach to adaptive control is expected to give future NASA robots an unending ability to learn, and NASA astronauts the ability to customize robot behavior for both routine tasks and unexpected situations.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Successful completion of the proposed effort will result in a trainable robot control system with great commercial potential. The incremental nature of the training algorithm permits an operator with limited mobility to build complex tasks. At no time is the operator expected to provide a complete, precise example of task performance. Robot competency builds over time, course to fine, given symbolic task plans and error-driven corrective cues. Not only can suited NASA astronauts with restricted movement benefit from this approach, but also persons with disabilities. With this technology, the disabled will be able to tailor to their personal needs the behavior of robotic assistive devices, providing a level of access and a sense of freedom otherwise difficult to attain.  More generally, as anthropomorphic service robots begin to appear in consumer markets, intuitive man-machine interfaces will promote acceptance of these devices.  Smart robots capable of learning from their owners will also find their way into entertainment and educational products.  The current development effort addresses these opportunities.

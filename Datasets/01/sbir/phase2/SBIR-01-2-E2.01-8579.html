<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Triton proposes to meet NASA?s need for space- based ultra-lightweight structures and optics with a new, advanced, colorless, space durable polymer, TOR-NC.  This new polyimide is specifically engineered for resistance to atomic oxygen (AO), ultraviolet (UV) and particle radiation. This new polyimide has low solar absorbance and high thermal emittance.  The TOR-NC polyimide is well suited for synthesis of multi-kilogram quantities and cost reduction through co-polymer design. Films made by solution casting display good mechanical and optical properties for the space applications.<br>The proposed Phase II program is a comprehensive two-year program that will improve the quality and effective production of TOR-NC.  The proposed program involves the technologists, the converters, the evaluators, and the end-users all on the same team.  Feed back from the end-users will be used to develop a superior product that is geared especially to the needs of the space community.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Triton is positioning itself as manufacturer of high quality specialty monomers and polymers.  Triton is pursuing chemical companies to establish partnership for larger scale commercial production of these newly developed monomers and polymers for terrestrial and extraterrestrial applications.  We are also forming partnerships with film manufacturers to produce large thin sheets or continuous rolls of films using Triton?s polymers.  With these team arrangements, Triton will be in position to commercialize its synthesis capabilities and also produce high quality space durable films.  These films can be used in multi-layer insulation blankets for commercial and government satellites.  They also can be used for large inflatable or deployable membranes.

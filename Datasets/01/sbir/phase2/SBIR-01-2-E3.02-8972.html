<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The sheer quantity of data available to scientists via the Internet is staggering, and more is being collected, aggregated and processed daily. Unfortunately, this data is scattered in collections throughout the network, stored in a variety of formats, and accessible via many different types of programs.  NASA is a primary producer of scientific data, as well as an important consumer of such data, and thus developing systems to help scientists access, integrate and process large volumes of heterogeneous data is clearly in NASA's interest.  Theseus is a commercial high-performance plan execution system that we have developed for integrating web-based data.  We propose to extend the Theseus architecture to create a practical system that will make it easy for earth scientists to access, stage, integrate and process large volumes of scientific data distributed over the Internet.  Theseus employs a dataflow architecture for plan execution, which we can leverage to create an innovative, scalable approach for processing distributed scientific data.  The resulting system will be used as part of a collaborative ongoing effort with scientists from NASA Ames and University of Montana who are applying AI planning technology to ?Biospheric NowCasting? -- real-time ecosystem modeling from Earth Science data.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed work will significantly extend the parallel processing and data handling capabilities of the Fetch Agent Platform, our existing commercial system, which is built on top of the Theseus architecture.  Though the market for scientific data integration is relatively small, there exists much larger potential markets for Internet Application Integration (IAI) and Intelligence, and the proposed project will significantly enhance Fetch Technologies abilities to sell into these markets. The ability to easily access, move and transform data is critical for IAI in that large enterprise organizations have numerous disparate sources of information that they need to integrate.  Similarly, intelligence organizations that we have been working with (e.g., US SOCOM) are very interested in improving their technology for gathering and integrating geospatial and intelligence data.  The new capabilities that we develop in this project will be marketed as ?add on? components to our existing product.  Potential customers, in addition to U.S. military and intelligence services, include Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), and B2B integration companies.

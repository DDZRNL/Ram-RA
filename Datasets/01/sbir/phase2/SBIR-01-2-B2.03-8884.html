<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Cell culturing in space and/or microgravity offers numerous advantages and opens new applications for faster drug discovery and understanding gene expression. A growing body of data suggests cell growth in microgravity results in up-regulation of apoptotic pathways. Understanding apoptosis in microgravity will be crucial for long-term NASA missions, and it could provide valuable data on effects of radiation on cell growth. Both sensors will be incorporated into a microfluidic design and will be integrated into a single instrument easily adapted to current bioreactors (in space or rotating wall bioreactors on Earth) for on-line detection. Both sensors will use a relatively simple signal transduction system based on AC impedance. The instrument will also incorporate a sampling and separation module. The operation of the proposed instrument will be mostly automated. A compatibility of the proposed system with microgravity conditions will be tested by monitoring cell growth/induced apoptosis in rotating wall bioreactors. Compatibility of the design instrument may be also tested with existing spaceflight hardware. At the end of the Phase II, a working prototype will be delivered to NASA.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
This new technology will be of particular interest to the federal government (e.g., NASA, EPA, DOD, DOE, and NIH), e.g., to the Cellular Biotechnology Program at NASA. Also, it will be of interest to private industries for biomedical diagnostics (e.g., point-of-care or bedside testing), in-field environmental and forensic analysis, monitoring quality in food, and analysis of numerous biochemical molecules in chemical, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. <br><br><br>

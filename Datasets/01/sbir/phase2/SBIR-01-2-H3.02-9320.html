<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Phase I has shown that it is of great importance in most cryogenic pumping systems to minimize heat addition to the cryogen by the pump.  Heat addition from pump inefficiency is the most significant heat addition source and conduction from the motor and ambient surroundings into the cryogen is secondary.  The lower thermal conductivity of composite materials essentially eliminates the heat conducted to the cryogen, and allows a significant reduction in the length of what is typically an extended pump drive shaft.  The previously long shaft may have limited the speed at which the pump may operate. The speed limitation usually increases pump inefficiency thus adding more heat to the cryogen.  By incorporation of the composite material, and the subsequent drive shaft shortening that allows, a window for operation at increased speed is achieved.  This will lower heat from inefficiency and allow the pump to operate at a higher, more efficient speed.<br><br>Phase II will design, build, and test a prototype cryogenic pump using composite components. Further research and design studies will be performed based on Phase I results. A pump intended for a Liquid Hydrogen transfer application will be delivered to NASA at the end of Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The technology developed in this SBIR will be extremely useful in Helium and Hydrogen pumping applications. In these very cold applications, it can be worth thousands of dollars in operating costs to limit heat addition anywhere in the cryogenic system. BNI has sold many Helium and Hydrogen pumps for applications from magnet cooling in superconductors to circulation of Hydrogen in a propellant densification system. Nearly all of these systems could have benefited from this technology. <br><br>There is also commercial potential for this innovative pump design anywhere that cryogenic fluids (liquids and vapors) need to be transferred. All of the numerous cryogenic pumps, blowers, and compressors that Barber-Nichols supplies each year could use this technology. This would result in lower capital costs when developing the system due to the ability to use smaller cryostats. It would also lower energy consumption during operation. <br><br>With the successful demonstration of a cryogenic composite to metallic adhesive bond in Phase I, the potential commercial applications have broadened significantly to include any cryogenic system application where the use of composite materials technology is desired. Examples include liquid cryogen transfer pumps for propellant densification.

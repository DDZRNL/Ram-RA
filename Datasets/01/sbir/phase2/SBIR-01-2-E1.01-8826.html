<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Several significant potential infrared applications of tunable Fabry-Perot interferometers are not presently possible because of the unavailability of a Fabry-Perot that can be tuned at cryogenic temperatures.  For operation in the far infrared (8-12 micron) region of the electromagnetic spectrum, optics must be kept at cryogenic temperature.  At present, such devices are not commercially available for laboratory or spaceflight use.  The primary objective of this SBIR proposal is to develop and test a tunable etalon that could be used at cryogenic temperatures based on an existing spaceflight qualified piezoelectric motor design.  This actuator would also find application in infrared astronomy, both on the ground and on instruments such as the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST).  The secondary objective of this effort is to apply this motor to the Multi-Order Etalon Sounder instrument for remote sensing of trace gases in the troposphere.  A description of the motor concept as well as the MOES instrument is included in this proposal.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The advanced cryogenic Fabry-Perot interferometer to be developed under the proposed SBIR phase II program will have extensive commercial applications ranging from airborne natural gas pipeline leak monitoring and trace gas detection, to optical fiber communication.  There have been strong interests in the detection and monitoring of natural gas pipeline leaks to address public security concerns. The advanced cryogenic Fabry-Perot interferometer developed under this SBIR phase II proposal can be used to detect methane and ethane, two primary gases used to monitor gas pipeline leak. The commercial potential and benefits to the public here are significant. The advanced Fabry-Perot etalon and technologies developed under this SBIR phase II proposal will also find applications as dispersion compensation module and wavelength locker in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems, which have revolutionized the telecommunication industry. The advanced Fabry-Perot etalon and technologies developed under this SBIR phase II proposal can be used in the remote sensing of O3, CO, CO2, and other trace gases for Earth system science and defense applications.<br>

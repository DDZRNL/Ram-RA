<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This purpose of this SBIR Phase II project is to build a prototype dual-energy CT scanner to inspect and analyze the small rocks and minerals for evidnece of fossilized life.  The goal is to achieve three-dimensional volume images with 10-micron spatial resolution in the reconstructed image and to provide identification at that resolution, of both the density and the effective atomic number of the material being examined.  The scanner will use a precision turntable to manipulate the part and an array of CZT detectors to detect full-energy photons from the decay of a 109Cd radioactive source.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Microfocus CT is needed for better inspection of printed circuit boards and microelectronic components. Other applications are in military and civilian non-destructive testing, mineralogy, paleontology, composites, forensics, small-animal scanning, etc. In several of these, dual energy can improve visibility of constituents that are not readily distinguishable by density. These include fossils in rock matrix, fibers in two-component composites, and small concentrations of metal-tagged drugs in mice in pharmaceutical research. However, at the present time, the immediate commercialization of this technology is to support NASA in its exploration of Mars.

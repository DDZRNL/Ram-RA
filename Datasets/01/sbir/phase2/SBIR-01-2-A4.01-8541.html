<P><B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>DSI will develop an integrated 
backplane/server solution for the SATS cockpit. The GAAINS (General Aviation 
Aircraft Information Network Server) solution will provide the foundation for 
tomorrows SATS cockpit. DSI believes in the spirit of SATS, and through the 
integration of COTS technologies combined with current open architecture 
standards, a new enabling platform will be developed which increases cockpit 
functionality, while decreasing pilot workload at a fraction of the cost of 
today?s systems. DSI?s GAAINS architecture is based on current communication 
industry standards for redundancy and fail over scenarios. Ruggedized COTS 
hardware coupled with proven smart software suites will provide new heights of 
modularity, cost savings, and ease of access, operation and growth. This 
backplane/server platform will ultimately increase the chance of success for 
NASA?s SATS vision. 
<P><B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>Commercial applications include 
the GAAINS installations in the existing 100,000 travel active airplanes, as 
well as new GA aircraft. This product will also be designed for integration with 
the ground and satellite based GA extranet (SATS-Net). Outside of this, there is 
almost no limit to expansion and opportunities in terms of providing information 
to the GA aircraft. The implications of this are vast. As the Internet has 
matured and brought forth a host of viable information services, the potential 
for radically improving the availability of information services to the GA 
aircraft is enormous. This also has strong potential for the commercial airline 
industry. As concepts were borrowed from the automotive industry, the likelihood 
that advances in the GA market could be applied back to the automotive industry 
are very high. <BR>

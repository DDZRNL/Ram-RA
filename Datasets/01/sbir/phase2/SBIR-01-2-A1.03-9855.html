<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The safety and efficiency of transportation will be enhanced by revolutionary systems that provide on-line health management of vehicle systems.  Creare's Online Health Management (OHM) Toolkit facilitates the assembly of a such a system, through the creation of a distributed network-based data processing structure, which is completely described by semantic metadata.  This approach enables the system to intelligently interpret diagnostic and prognostic information and to dynamically generate online reports for a wide range of users.<br>The object-oriented paradigm employed by Creare's software, provides numerous advantages over current custom written systems, including reduced development time and cost, reduced learning curves, reduced bandwidth requirements through distributed processing, and increased data availability through data buffering and web-based report delivery.<br>In Phase I we demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by developing and testing prototype software.  We accomplished this by building on Creare's previously developed, patented, and award-winning RBNB? middleware software.  We augmented this enabling technology with an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) for configuring online health-monitoring systems.<br>During Phase II of this project, we will complete development of the software to produce a commercial-grade package.  We will then test the OHM tools by creating health-management systems for a number of demonstration applications.<br><br><br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Health management systems can enhance the safety and cost effectiveness of a broad range of vehicle, machinery, and processing systems.  As a result, our software tools, which enable the creation of online-health management systems, have a broad range of potential applications, in the military, transport, medical, and industrial fields.  However, the revolutionary potential of our application is as a next-generation web tool that moves beyond the simple formatting capability of HTML tools, to interpreting and processing capabilities enabled by semantic data descriptions.  We envisage explosive growth of this new technology once the the required data management infrastructure is widely implemented and the use of semantic metadata becomes standard.  Our software toolkit addresses both of these requirements, through our buffered data management middleware, and our integrated metadata schema.

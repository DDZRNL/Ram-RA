<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Leak detection and location within manned spacecraft has been an elusive goal as was demonstrated on MIR.  Manual leak detection, using ultrasonic technology, was successfully demonstrated at Johnson Space Center by a project team within ES using techniques for leak detection in pressurized aircraft.  Manual surveys are intrusive to space craft activities and crews.  An automated process of leak detection and location is needed.  IVC proposes to do this with  (a) existing space qualified hardware, (b) an addition of wideband ultrasonic transducers, and (c) new "smart" software algorithms that process emitted leak energy in a manner that results in detection and location of the leak.  The uniqueness of the proposed approach is the use of large numbers of self-powered, miniaturized, "stick on" ultrasonic sensory nodes that are all synchronized within a radio frequency network and are self calibrating.  The network provides the data paths and synchronization. Ultrasonic transducers can act as transmitters as well as receivers. Thus the sensor network calibrates itself thus increasing detection and location accuracy.   Numbers of MicroWIS units (organized into such networks) have already been flown on Shuttle and station and have operated in a completely non-intrusive manner in regard to radio frequency, physical encumbrance, and astronaut time.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Cyclotron facilities require manual processes of leak detection.  The proposed technology would allow automated detection and location of leaks.  Food storage depends upon reliable temperature maintenance and air circulation equipment.  This technology would monitor the  sonic and ultrasonic energy that represents normal cooling conditions and alert maintenance personnel to abnormal conditions.  Operating machines, whether for transportation, manufacturing, or maintenance give off residual wide band energy.  Flaws in the machine will produce uncharacteristic spectral patterns of energy that can also be first recognized as anomalous and later evaluated to determine the nature and severity of the malfunction.  Application of this NASA technology to complex machines would establish an automated process for machine inspection routines currently provided by expensive and error prone manual methods.  Automotive, submarine, aircraft, and ship structures display a characteristic sonic and ultrasonic vibration pattern when excited.   These patterns are functions of the structure type, weight, and bulk modulus of the materials.  Accurate detection and mapping of these patterns and their dynamic characteristics are critical to noise suppression design.  This technology would allow miniature wireless sensor units to be place quickly and easily on the surfaces to be tested so as to not damp the signals producing the noise.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Spacecraft Formation Flying is a key technology for NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) and other Origins missions. Specific formation flying technologies required for TPF are distributed real-time fault-tolerant collision-free path planning and U-V mapping optimization tools.  During Phase I, we investigated and further developed two approaches for solving the collision avoidance problem; namely, the LMI Approach and the Crossing Pattern Approach. Both methods proved to be very effective for small formations such as TPF. The objective of Phase II is to design and develop a Formation Flying Path Planner (FFPP) Toolbox with a comprehensive set of algorithms for path planning, u-v mapping, reactive control, actuator failure detection and dynamic control allocation.  Specific Phase II tasks are:  (i) Optimal path planning algorithms for TPF, (ii) Path Planning algorithms for moderate and large formations, (iii) Reactive collision-free control, (iv) Actuator failure detection and dynamic control allocation, (v) U-V mapping optimization, (vi) Testing and tuning of the algorithms for TPF, (vii) Development of FFPP Toolbox, (viii) Commercialization Planning, and (ix) Reports.  Phase II work will be closely coordinated with JPL project teams for technology transition to TPF and other missions.  The commercialization of the Toolbox will be pursued collaboratively with Ball Aerospace, Lockheed-Martin, and Boeing.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Commercial applications of collision-free path planning strategies exist in flight formation for UAVs, fighter aircraft, and spacecraft, as well as in control of automated air traffic management systems, and automated vehicle highway systems.  NASA Space Science (Starlight, TPF) and Earth Science Enterprises (EOS, NMP, ESTP) will directly benefit from this technology. Commercial applications exist in the areas of satellite communications and remote sensing.

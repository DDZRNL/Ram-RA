<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Trace Contaminant Control System (TCCS) used onboard the International Space Station provides for control of trace cabin air contamination originating from materials off-gassing, human metabolism, hygiene activities, experimental facilities, etc. The TCCS removes contaminants via a combination of techniques. The U.S. segment uses an expendable, activated charcoal bed (22.7 kg charcoal), a high temperature catalytic oxidizer assembly and a postsorbent LiOh bed. The Russian system uses an expendable activated carbon canister (1.3 kg) followed by two regenerative activated charcoal beds (16 kg apiece, 7.4 kg charcoal in each) and a room temperature CO oxidizer. <br><br>PCI is proposing to develop a novel, regenerable adsorber using zeolites/adsorbents coated on Microlith? substrates to replace the activated charcoal beds. Phase I results indicate the potential to reduce 15 kg charcoal weight to less than 2 kg of adsorbent with a proportionate reduction in size and a reduction in housing weight. The Phase II proposes to develop and optimize a resistively heated, thermo-vacuum Microlith? adsorber to be used as a simple, lightweight and cost effective system that aims to demonstrate safe and reliable operation with minimal maintenance, electrical power and crew-time requirements. A prototype will be delivered to NASA upon Phase II conclusion.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Precision Combustion, Inc. is proposing to further develop a high gas contact rate Microlith? regenerable mini adsorber with rapid trapping and release capability and low pressure-drop.  The technology applications include air clean-up for closed room environments and closed personal environments.  The target application is to replace the existing carbon bed installed in the Trace Contaminant Control Subassembly on-board the International Space Station. Future space applications such as space factories, lunar/Martian habitats, and lunar/Martian landing spacecraft would also find value in the small, light-weight and regenerable features. Terrestrial applications would be for military cargo planes, commercial airliners, and naval applications such as ships and submarines. Finally, applications in confined, sterile rooms such as special manufacturing processes (e.g. semiconductor manufacturing) as well as military applications in battlefield command posts that may need airborne chemical protection.<br><br>Smaller-scale versions of the technology may find use in regenerative breathing devices for personnel protection against airborne toxins.  Potential applications include, breathing masks for firemen and rescue workers as well as for emergency use by people in buildings and airliners.  There are also potential DoD applications for soldier chemical warfare breathing protection in the field.<br>

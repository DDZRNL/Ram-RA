<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Phase II objective is to deliver two commercial products: 1) variational analysis software that can produce optimized DEM maps for any region along the US coast; and 2) hurricane flood atlases for any coastal area.<br><br>These atlases will not only include higher-resolution storm surge simulations but rainfall effects as well.  For flash flood mapping, the well-established HEC software program will be obtained from the Hydrologic Engineering Center of the US Army Corps of Engineers. These maps will have overlaid roads and detailed coastline information. Product evaluation partners will provide guidance on how to make the graphical output easy to interpret for their use.<br><br>It is important to note the power and versatility of variational analysis - non-conventional variables (in this case, optical pixel brightness and backscatter) can be incorporated into a cost function to find the optimized solution for an unrelated variable (in this case, elevation).<br><br>The current implementation of variational analysis yields desirable improvements to bare-earth estimation in several key areas, while other aspects require more work. There are also validation uncertainties due to a lack of ground truth that hampers both the development of the algorithm and in validation efforts.  These shortcomings will be addressed in Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The market is wide open for the application of state-of-the-art remote sensing information to improve public safety.  Federal and state agencies, such as Federal Emergency Management Agency, are evaluating IFSAR data as a potential solution for its Floodplain Map Reinvention Program, at significantly less cost [and higher resolution] than traditional means could achieve (Imaging Notes, July 2000).<br><br>Baron Services, of Huntsville, AL, currently distributes WorldWinds? commercial weather product line.  They are interested in adding the storm surge and flood prediction forecasts into their current product offering to their established customer base that includes: local Emergency Management Officials, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and  their TV broadcast station clientele.<br><br>A second major client base is the utilization of DEMs for orthorectification of satellite and airborne imagery.  Intermap Technologies of Englewood, CO, is very interested in partnering on this SBIR in an effort to utilize WorldWinds' automated DEM algorithms for their commercial applications.  This will be a ?ready-made? established market for the WorldWinds? developed DEM algorithm.  Intermap is the commercial world leader in elevation mapping and plans to capitalize on its market and technology leadership, by capturing complete national coverage of the United States, Japan, and countries in Western Europe.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Phase II SBIR builds on the exciting results demonstrated during the Phase I research.  Using a new approach for enhancing the near-infrared (IR) sensitivity of high gain avalanche photodiodes (APDs), Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. (RMD) will develop a reliable procedure to produce APD arrays with high sensitivity at 1064 nm.  This work utilizes an innovative technique to microtexture the front surface of the APD using high power, ultra-short laser pulses (100 femto-seconds). The laser processed silicon surface exhibits remarkably high absorption characteristics over a large range of wavelengths (0.4 - 3 microns).  Phase I work established that this processing technique provides an enhancement in the photo-induced charge collection at near-IR wavelengths.  We have further demonstrated APD responsivity > 350 A/W at 1064 nm.  Evidence of silicon bandgap transformations makes this remarkable innovation extremely promising for present detector technology needs.<br>The ultimate goal of this project is to use laser microtexturing technology to develop a high speed, high gain, low noise APD array sensor module with significantly improved near-IR response.  The APD array sensor will be an extremely valuable tool for long distance optical communication and for LIDAR/LADAR applications.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed technology will have numerous important commercial applications, such as imaging altimeters, LIDAR systems, near-IR spectroscopy, free-space optical communication, optical mammography and tomography, tissue oxygenation studies and many other applications.  A successful program could potentially revolutionize any field that is presently limited by the lack of sensitive detection at 1064 nm, where robust and compact transmission technology is readily available.

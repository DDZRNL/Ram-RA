<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Rotating wall vessels (RWV) are widely used for cell culture in simulated microgravity conditions.  Sensor technologies capable of monitoring the expression of proteins on a large scale (proteomics) are needed to fully exploit the unique capabilities of RWVs.  This Phase II effort is part of a program to develop an advanced analytical monitoring system for quantitative detection of bioreactor bioproducts in microgravity.  The underlying technology is grating-coupled surface plasmon resonance, which permits sensitive, label-free, parallel detection of bioproducts in a complex fluid without purification steps in real time.  The objective of this effort is to develop generic capture microarrays that will allow for the site-directed self-assembly of tailor-made, user-defined high-density multi-component assay chips.  This is accomplished by immobilizing a library of short oligonucleotide PNA (peptide nucleic acid) probe molecules on a chip in a site-specific manner using covalent attachment chemistry and a spotting method.  Capture molecules that will compose the array are tagged (off-line) with a library of complementary PNA sequences.  Then, the microarray is assembled by flowing the complex mixture of different PNA-tagged compounds over the chip, which through hybridization reactions, form site-directed self-assembled arrays.  A set of microarrays will be produced and a complementary set of protein-PNA conjugates relevant to microgravity research.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The commercial application that will be the focus of the proposed SPR technology is high throughput screening for drug discovery. The proposed site-directed, self-assembled microarrays will enable the production of disposable chips, which in combination with the SPR detection hardware will create a highly flexible platform, providing for the first time, massively parallel detection of hundreds to thousands of binding events along with kinetics without the limitations of a reporter molecule. A recent survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers reflected that the timely development of new products is the most important issue facing the pharmaceutical industry. There is a multi-billion dollar worldwide market for systems and consumables related to functional genomics, proteomics and drug discovery research. Pharmaceutical companies alone-spent billions of dollars on tools related to drug discovery in 1999 and this number is rapidly increasing. Now that mapping of the human genome has been essentially completed, there is increasing emphasis in discovering new druggable targets.

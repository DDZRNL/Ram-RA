<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Human tissue and electronic component protection from harmful effects of space radiation is essential for extended deep space exploration voyages. The prime objective of this Phase II proposal is to develop a multi-functional composite material design to fulfill the current need for non-parasitic, lightweight, high-strength, and effective radiation shielding materials for space exploration applications. Using their patented rapid prototyping approach, ACR and its partners will fabricate test panels of polymer materials reinforced with aligned functionalized single-walled nanotubes (SWNT). The physical, material, and comprehensive radiation properties of the composites materials will be evaluated to identify optimal radiation shielding design criteria. ACR believes the goals of this Phase II effort are directly in line with the NASA Mission.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Potential applications are for NASA and for commercial space travel, which seems to be increasingly becoming popular. All space radiation environment which humans will travel will benefit from these materials.

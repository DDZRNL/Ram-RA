<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Rotational molding is a low-cost processing scheme used to fabricate large tanks, ducts, and tubes with complicated shapes. Rotational molding of liquid crystal polymer (LCP) resins was successfully demonstrated in the Phase I program, and the proposed Phase II effort will continue development of this process.  LCP materials are of interest in application to cryogenic propellant storage because of their low permeability, low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), excellent strength, and chemical inertness.  Development of rotationally molded LCP articles addresses the aerospace industry's need for lightweight, low-cost liners for use in propellant storage tanks and transport lines in space vehicles.  LCP tanks will potentially be suitable for use with several liquid rocket propellant systems including liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Rotationally molded LCP tanks will have a broad domestic application base in containment of cryogenic liquids, compressed gas, hazardous chemicals, and food processing.   In effect, we hope to use LCPs as a low cost and lightweight alternative to metal containment materials such as stainless steel.  We estimate the potential market size for rotationally molded LCPs in the tens of millions of dollars per year range.

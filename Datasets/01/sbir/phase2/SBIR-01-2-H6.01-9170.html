<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
EDAptive Computing, Inc. (EDAptive) and the University of Kansas (KU) propose a unique and commercially viable solution to the problem of testing upgraded hardware and software components in place, within the system that contains them. Such upgrades occur frequently in NASA satellite and Space Station embedded systems. Our proposed solution implements specification-based testing techniques to automatically generate test sequences and expected results from component requirements models, and translates the generated tests, initially generated for application to the component interface, for application to the interface of the overall system. Our solution will considerably reduce the time and effort required for in place testing of components in real-time and embedded computing systems, thereby ensuring their safe and reliable operation. Our proposed Automated Test Generation in Intelligent Systems (GENISYS) project leverages the following:<br>i.	An emerging System Level Design Language (SLDL), Rosetta, <br>ii.	EDAptive?s VectorGen? tool, to automatically generate test sequences and expected results starting from specifications, and Syscape? tool to intuitively capture system specifications,<br>iii.	EDAptive and KU?s expertise in formal methods, specification languages and test generation techniques, and<br>iv.	KnowledgeKinetics (K2), an enterprise collaboration tool suite.<br>Furthermore, our commercialization and business plan has been refined and validated through a peer review.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed GENISYS tool suite is applicable to a variety of application areas; however, the Phase I analysis has indicated that GENISYS enabled automated test generation mechanism from specifications, and unit testing performed through the system interface upon replacement/upgrade of components, especially in embedded systems, holds high probability of commercialization success. EDAptive Computing has created a commercialization and business plan that includes the GENISYS translator, and subjected this business plan to a peer review of business leaders active in the field of innovative, high-tech products.  This Government and commercial thrust enables effective utilization of limited Phase II resources. This initial target market provides a foundation for extending the GENISYS tool suite to other application areas such as Automotive, Control systems, Environmental controls (HVAC), and Security markets during Phase III.  This provides NASA the benefit of a commercially supported toolset with which to address problems such as upgrading a software or hardware component on a satellite in orbit, or in a complex real time environment such as the Space Station.  The GENISYS tool will make in place testing viable in virtually any system or environment.<br>Commercialization of the related VectorGen technology is underway, and the GENISYS effort will further its commercialization.<br>

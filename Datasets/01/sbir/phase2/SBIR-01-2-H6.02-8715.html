<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Integrated Video for Synthetic Vision project aims to create a unique software technology to seamlessly add real-time video capture to VisualFlight's proven combination of real time flight simulation performance and Geographic Information System (GIS) power.  While solutions exist to do this in hardware, they are ill suited to the flight deck environment for reasons of size and weight.  These hardware video mixer solutions are limited to analog video technology, and therefore do not provide the level of resolution offered by new generations of digital video cameras.  This project proposes to develop the first software only synthetic vision video overlay solution that will be scalable to any video resolution, and which will have no weight or size impacts on cockpit design.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The first application of the SmartCam technologies will be as a flight review system or debriefing system. This system records a pilot?s performance during instructional flight for later review.  In this application the SmartCam technology is mounted in an aircraft and used to assess and improve the performance of pilots and aircrews.  The SmartCam system will be used to record the flight including overlaid two and three dimensional data to video tape.  The video tape then will be used by the instructor to review the performance of the crew and identify areas of necessary improvement.  Typical commercial customers include flight schools and airline Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA).<br><br>The other major application of SmartCam technology that we foresee is to enhance UAV aircrew situation awareness. The SmartCam system will permit these vehicles to be operated more safely by providing the flight crew with enhanced situation awareness through SmartCam?s use of enriched video. UAVs have video cameras providing video imagery to ground stations from which they are controlled.  By combining this video with 3D geographic information, we create an information-rich display, which substantially enhances situation awareness.  This enrichment was demonstrated during recent NASA and RIS flight tests.  <br><br><br>

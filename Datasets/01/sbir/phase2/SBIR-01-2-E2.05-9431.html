<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Phase I work completed under Contract NAS3-02025 demonstrated that a family of ceramic oxides can successfully be used either as high temperature catalyst carriers or catalysts for decomposition of HAN/MeOH fuels.  A ceramic processing technique to produce high surface area spherical catalyst granules was also demonstrated.  However, no performance and process optimizations were performed.  The work initiated in Phase I will be continued under Phase II to develop and test ceramic based catalyst carriers and catalysts that are capable of initiating the decomposition of HAN-based monopropellants, and sustaining steady-state runs for several hours.  One or two candidates in each of catalyst carrier and unpromoted catalyst categories will be defined.  Their performances in a small rocket engine will be demonstrated using the propellant(s) specified by NASA.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Catalysts proposed here as an ignition technique promise to achieve the same reliability as that already demonstrated with Shell 405 catalyst in hydrazine thrusters.  The catalyst developed by STI has near-term applicability to NASA programs and ties in directly with nontoxic propellant thruster development in progress at other government centers and NASA or USAF contractors. The potential market for the catalyst to be developed under this Phase II SBIR contract and its Phase III follow-on commercialization contracts is the same as that for the well-established Shell 405 catalyst.  Our material may eventually replace Shell 405 in most monopropellant thruster and gas generator applications.

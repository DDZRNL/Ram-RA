<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
An advanced Environment Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) for long duration manned space missions -such as planetary flight missions or planetary bases- requires an almost complete closure of all relevant material loops.  The recovery of oxygen from a concentrated stream of carbon dioxide (CO2) offers significant advantage to long duration manned space missions by reducing the requirement for consumables.  TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes a sorbent-based system that carries out CO2 removal and CO2 reduction in a single unit.  The system eliminates the interfacing problems associated with the currently operational CO2 Removal Assembly (CDRA) and planned CO2 Reduction Assembly (CRA).<br><br>In the Phase I work, we will develop a high capacity, long-life MgO sorbent that can effectively remove CO2 from the cabin air.  We will also demonstrate the technical feasibility of carrying out CO2 removal and reduction in a single unit.  <br>

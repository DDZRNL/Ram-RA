<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA has a pressing need for cost-effective and rugged mass spectrometers to detect hazardous gases on and around space vehicles during launch and flight.  Recent advances in sensor technology have led to the development of very small detectors for mass spectrometers.  However, the vacuum systems required to support these sensors remain large, heavy, and power hungry.  An even greater problem is that commercially available high vacuum pumps cannot supply the required performance while withstanding the loads that would be experienced if the pumps were located on the launch vehicle or adjacent structures.  Creare proposes to build and test a rugged, space-qualifiable vacuum system for use in a mass spectrometer.  The vacuum system utilizes two innovative pump designs: a turbomolecular pump and a molecular drag pump.  Both pumps employ a unique motor developed during Phase I specifically to provide high vibration tolerance.  These pumps, which also rely on pump design technology developed in earlier NASA-sponsored projects, will be combined with a modified commercial diaphragm pump.  Together, these pumps will comprise an integrated vacuum system that is optimized for use in a mass spectrometer operating in a harsh environment.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The vacuum system has commercial applications to support portable analytical instruments such as mass spectrometers and leak detectors that are intended for harsh environments.  This includes mass spectrometers used for military chemical and biological weapons detection, and general-purpose field use such as environmental monitoring.  Current-generation portable mass spectrometers are limited either by the size, mass, and ruggedness of their turbomolecular pumps or because they use less capable absorption pumps.  Building a small, lightweight, low-power, and rugged vacuum system based on a turbomolecular pump and a molecular drag pump whose performance is optimized to meet the needs of miniature detectors, will expand the market for portable mass spectrometers.

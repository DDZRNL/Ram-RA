<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
SATS is NASA's efficient personal air transportation vision. SATS airplanes must strive for higher levels of safety, speed, and comfort than small airplanes currently offer. BRS proposes to explore the dynamics of parachute inflation for aircraft in this new category and develop a system that will automatically and efficiently manage the parachute deployment sequence throughout their operating envelope. A prototype system for a 5,000 lb aircraft with a speed range from 60 to 300 knots will be developed using an unmanned drop test vehicle and cargo aircraft. BRS will also work concurrently with several light jet manufacturers to define the parachute/aircraft interface requirements. These relationships are critical because it is clear that a practical emergency parachute system for this application must be an integral component of the aircraft and will require contributions from a variety of engineering disciplines. These proposed tasks ideally fit BRS's experience and capabilities.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
BRS is strategically positioned to take advantage a new generation of jet aircraft that will break the price and operational barriers of the past. An important key to this new concept is a focus on safety. These new aircraft must be both easier to fly and safer to operate. To date, BRS has signed letters of commitment from three light jet manufacturers to provide cooperative support during and after the Phase II contract period. This support will include engineering support in the areas of airframe structure, parachute installation, and crashworthiness enhancements necessary for the successful parachute deployment and subsequent landing. All of these companies have agreed to work with BRS with the ultimate goal of making their airframes ?BRS ready?. This will allow for the installation of a parachute system once it is available. Continued promotion of Light Jet BRS product will be attained through strategic partnering with other companies that emerge as this market expands and attracts more competitors. These markets can be a significant revenue source for BRS with the average recovery system price ranging from as low as $15,000 and up to $30,000.

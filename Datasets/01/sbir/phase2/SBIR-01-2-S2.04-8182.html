<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In Phase I, MER has demonstrated low cost diamond/Al and diamond/Mg composites, which have the highest thermal conductivity of any known isotropic composite available today (>640 W/m/K), with low CTE (<7.5 p.p.m/K) for compatibility with GaAs and Si devices in electronics applications.  The Phase II effort is focused on confirming low cost fabrication and processing of diamond/Al composites into useful forms including rolling of thin sheet (0.05" thick) and sheet joining for space radiators and building power electronic devices, using vapor deposition techniques for adherent dielectric layers with laser micro-machining and metallization techniques for 3-D devices.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Diamond/Al can be used for light-weight space platforms and high density power electronics.  Low cost processing by rolling can provide thin sheet product for radiators, a generic thermal spreader for substrates and for lids which is a multi-billion dollar market. Higher added value is provided by patterning of the diamond/Al with dielectric and metallization to make devices with projected initial multi-million dollar yearly market increasing to multi-billion dollars once the products gets established.

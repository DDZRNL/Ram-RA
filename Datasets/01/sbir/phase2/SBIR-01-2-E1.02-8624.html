<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Diode pumped solid state lasers have proven to be well suited for use in space based and airborne Lidar systems for remote sensing.  These types of lasers are capable of operating at high efficiency while remaining both compact and extremely rugged.  However, one of the primary limitations of such systems has been that the laser gain media operates only at specific wavelengths determined by the active dopant ion.  These wavelengths do not necessarily match absorption features or transmission windows specific to a given application.  Scientific Materials Corp. has recently developed innovative laser gain media that provides operation at the desired wavelength without the need for frequency conversion or tuning elements.  It is the purpose of this Phase II SBIR to improve the optical homogeneity and optimize the performance of these materials for diode pumping, as well as scale the growth of these materials to allow implementation in a variety of cavity designs.  Based on previous results, the primary material of interest will be Nd3+ doped crystals of YAG(1-x)YSAGx for operation at 944.1 nm for use in lasers for lidar systems designed for remote sensing of atmospheric water vapor.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The commercial availability of materials which lase at specified wavelengths that exactly match the requirement for a particular application would greatly simplify laser design as well as open possibilities for a variety of new applications in medical and other remote sensing systems.  Laser manufacturing companies have already begun development of systems based on these materials.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Accurate Automation Corporation has developed a distributed adaptive guidance and control architecture for minimum Delta-V formation flying of satellite constellations. The innovation in this approach is that it is an extremely streamlined solution to a very difficult guidance and control problem.  The guidance module of the proposed architecture is built around a simulation of a system of particles whose motion is a result of attractive and repulsive forces generated through simulated potential fields.  Desirable characteristics of the guidance system are: 1) that a large number of satellites, starting at some initial conditions, can move amongst themselves to some desired final conditions with a guarantee that undesirable interactions between individual satellites will not occur, 2) that the path taken by each individual satellite can be achieved using minimum Delta-V, and 3) that the guidance system is distributed. In order to guarantee stability for the satellite constellation as a whole, we designed a distributed satellite control module with a specifiable convergence rate.  This in combination with our ability to specify the convergence rate of the guidance module, allows us to ensure that each satellite will stay within a certain distance of its commanded path (tracking error has a known bound).

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
This project will result in two products.  The first product will be a distributed, nonlinear, adaptive guidance module for minimum Delta-V formation flying of satellite constellations.  The second product will be a nonlinear satellite tracking control module with the capability for user specified convergence rate.  These products are important to NASA because they can be applied to control of semi-autonomous agents of any sort, including spacecraft, rovers, and submersibles.  The potential size of the Government market is very large.  The Air Force and NASA are investigating a wide range of satellite constellation applications, including TechSat-21 (Air Force) and NASA?s LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) for observing gravitational waves in space, NASA?s MAXIM (Micro-Arcsecond X-Ray Imaging Mission) for capturing the black hole phenomenon, NASA?s Stellar Imager for understanding the magnetic field of stars, NASA?s SPECS (Submillimeter Probe of the Evolution of Cosmic Structure), another interferometer, and NASA?s GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) for helping predict climates.

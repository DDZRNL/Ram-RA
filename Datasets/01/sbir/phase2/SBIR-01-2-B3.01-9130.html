<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The cost of delivering payloads to remote destinations in space is extremely high, and even the smallest weight reductions can result in substantial cost savings.  Consequently, systems that have been designed for low Earth orbit may not be suitable for a mission to Mars.  One example of this is the system to recycle waste water.  A system that utilizes vacuum distillation and catalytic oxidation (VPCAR) is being developed for Mars missions.  A key step in the VPCAR process is the gas phase oxidation of ammonia to nitrogen and water without forming NOX.  In Phase I TDA Research Inc. developed catalysts for this reaction.  Our approach to the problem was centered on the development of a bifunctional catalyst, which could separate adsorbed oxygen and nitrogen atoms, thereby reducing NOX formation.  In Phase I we identified a catalyst formulation, which converted 100% of the ammonia feed at temperatures where very low concentrations of NOX were produced.  In Phase II, we will refine the catalyst composition, test both ammonia and hydrocarbon oxidation reactions in a pilot scale reactor, and then, in work carried out at Hamilton Sundstrand, we will test the reactor on a full-scale unit.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
In addition to use on the VPCAR, a selective ammonia oxidation catalyst would have several major commercial applications.  One such application is in environmental catalysis, a field that generates approximately $2 billion in revenue per year.  Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is an effective method for controlling NOX emissions from stationary sources including coal-fired power plants power plants.  In this method ammonia is injected into the effluent, and, in the presence of a catalyst, and it reduces NOX to nitrogen.  However to be effective, excess ammonia must be present.  Unfortunately, this results in ammonia emissions.  Thus, if an ammonia oxidation catalyst were located downstream of the SCR unit, the excess ammonia could be oxidized to nitrogen and thus the ammonia slip problem could be eliminated.  Another application is to oxidize ammonia in stripped sour gas streams.  If ammonia is present in these streams, undesirable reactions occur, causing a number of problems in the refinery.  Thus, a catalyst that would completely oxidize ammonia to nitrogen would eliminate these problems.  In both of these cases, the catalyst must have high selectivity for nitrogen and water and produce very low concentrations of NO or NO2.

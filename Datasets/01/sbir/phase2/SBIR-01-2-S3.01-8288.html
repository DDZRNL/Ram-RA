<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The goal of the efforts described in this proposal is to establish the feasibility of boundary control and alignment actuators for improving the optical figure of thin film membrane optics.  A representative example of this type of system, and the primary focus of the proposed Phase 2, is the DART telescope concept currently being advanced at JPL.   Of immediate interest are multi-degree-of-freedom parallel actuator hexapod systems that can be used to adjust the orientation of the two primary reflectors relative to one another in the presence of manufacturing, deployment, and on-orbit disturbances.  The desirability and feasibility of such systems was established in the course of Phase 1 activities.  In Phase 2 we propose the continued development and hardware demonstration of hexapods with asymmetric attachment planes and suchsystems capable of functioning at the cryogenic temperatures required for infrared science as well as laying the groundwork for scaling up to on-orbit implementation.  The developed systems will support the DART, and other space science, technology development efforts and lead to eventual in space applications as well as anticipated commercial/terrestrial spin-offs.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed actuators and hexapod based alignment systems could be used across a wide range of potential NASA and DOD missions covering a variety of Space Science, Earth Science, and Aerospace Transportation Enterprise major efforts such as Origins (optics and sunshields for NGST, TPF, Life Finder, Planet Imager), Structure and Evolution of the Universe, Sun-Earth-Connection and the Living with a Star Initiative (Solar Sails for Geostorm and North and South Pole Sitters), Exploration of the Universe (Solar Sails, SEP Concentrators and large communication antennas), the Interstellar Probes and Precursor Missions, and ASTP (Concentrators for SOTV and Solar Sails) and other programs like technology development for Space Solar Power.  Potential terrestrial applications of the technology are also foreseen in a variety of applications such as life sciences, advanced manufacturing, fiber-optic alignment, and precision motion control applications industries.<br>

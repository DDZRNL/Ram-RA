<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The main goal of this project is contructing a lightweight, low-cost, real-time ultrasound system for bone assessment that could readily be used in long term space flights as well as in a variety of environments in general medical practice.  The major goal of Phase I of this project was to construct a functional prototype of the BUSS and to demonstrate in model experiments that the device is capable of evaluating the stiffness of compact bone, coritcla thickness and the stiffness of underlying spongy structure using flexural and longitudinal acoustic wave propagation parameters.  In every area, Artann Laboratories fulfilled the proposed accomplishments of Phase I.  A proof-of-concept prototype of the BUSS was designed, constructed and extensively tested in laboratory experiments with bone composite models.  In Phase II, the BUSS team will enhance system hardware and software quality and design to the level of a final product and will validate BUSS functionality through comprehensive laboratory and clinical studies.  The end products of the project would be twofold:  (1) a lightweight, hand-held and easy-to-use device, with which an astronaut will monitor bone health; (2) a small size inexpensive, diagnostic bone ultrasonometer that would be marketed for general use in the commercial marketplace.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
A clear demand for better diagnostic tools, growing population and progressing bone disease rates create a significant market niche for new, more effective and more affordable screening and diagnostic technologies for bone health assessment.  Due to the portability, ease of operation and affordable price, the clinical BUSS is intended for use in the health care establishments of the various size:  from the large hospitals to small private clinics.  It is conservatively projected that the smaller size private heatlh care establishments and offices are not likely to need more than one unit of the device, while large hospitals with the average of more than 1,000 health professionals employed will require at least five units.  Based on these projections, the overall 365,000 units of market potential is available today.  Population growth, aging and proliferation of the small home-case health care facilities are expected to dramatically increase demand for the technology.  The Company will initially target specialty clinics and then migrate to the much larger market of family practice/internal medicine.  Given the stringent requirements for clinical applications, the opportunity in commercialization of the BUSS will be explored into the sports medicine and veterinary medicine, as well as expansion on the foreign markets.

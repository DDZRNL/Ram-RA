<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The existing plasma codes are ill suited for modeling of mixed resolution problems, such as the plasma sail, where the system under study comprises subsystems with diverse modeling paradigms (e.g., fluid, kinetic) at differing levels of temporal and spatial resolution. Such complex systems are not unique to propulsion studies, but are commonly encountered in wide variety of fields.  In Phase I, we were able to develop and successfully test the core technology for multi-resolution modeling within two distinct computational paradigms. By introducing a temporal mesh, we successfully overcame a major obstacle in the use of time-stepped simulations for multi-resolution problems. However, even more significant is our finding that discrete event simulation methodology works quite well for many-body systems such as plasmas with several orders of magnitude performance advantage over equivalent time-stepped simulations. The importance of this result cannot be overstated as it will have immediate repercussions in all fields where time-stepped modeling are currently used. Using these early versions of our code, we were able to address a number of outstanding issues in regards to the feasibility of plasma sails. Our objectives for Phase II are (i) to fully develop the codes, (ii) address the issues regarding the feasibility of plasma sails such as expansion of the magnetic bubble by the plasma source and the resulting drop-off of the magnetic field strength with radial distance, and (iii) prepare plans for marketing our technology in Phase III.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The successful completion of the proposed R&D will bring into existence a new generation of simulation codes that would position SciberNet as the premier provider of plasma simulation services to customers in the Federal Government and the private sector such as the aerospace and electronics industries. The discrete event simulation code (DES) presents a break through technology and will be applicable to most fields that are currently using time-stepped simulations. To this end, we plan to design our 3D DES code based on a general architecture so that it can be readily adapted to other applications such as gravitational or fluid simulations, among others.  One of our objectives in Phase II is to conduct market analysis to identify the most suitable market nitche beyond propulsion and plasma simulations that we can pursue in Phase III. The development of the DES code has also led us to a new concept in interactive simulation and visualization with high commercial potential. Although a significant fraction of our revenue is projected to be from a service model, we have already had discussions with several vendors (e.g., Analytical Graphics) about the possibility of developing modules, based on simplified versions of our codes that can be integrated into existing commercial software.<br>In that regard, our business model will be similar to a number of companies that offer specialized commercial modeling tools such as OPNET, SES, and WorkBench.<br>

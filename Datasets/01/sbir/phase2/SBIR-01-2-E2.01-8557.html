<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
	The primary objective of the Phase I work was to determine the feasibility of manufacturing inflatable preshaped polyimide film structures that have the inherent thermal stability and structural strength to meet requirements of large space systems without internal pressurization or other rigidization.  The feasibility of the scalable, low-cost manufacturing technology was validated by structural component design, fabrication and testing.  A sound technology basis was established for continued manufacturing process refinement and application.  The Phase II effort will develop and demonstrate large ultra-lightweight, compactly stowable, self-rigidizing inflatable structures.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
	This structures technology is applicable to large antennas, high resolution earth observation satellites, solar thermal and electric propulsion, space solar power, and high temperature materials processing systems.  Ground commercial applications include emergency shelters in extreme environments and lightweight articles exposed to long-term weathering conditions.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This SBIR project investigated feasibility of nanostructured polymers for improving micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) packaging for deep space harsh environments.  MEMS technology enables development of spacecraft devices and subsystems that are small, low-cost, low mass, low volume, and low power consumption.  A Stirling powered microcooler device was studied and investigated in Phase II.  MEMS devices offer improvements in spacecraft efficiencies and new mission functionalities, MEMS introduces new challenges directly related to their micro-size and solid-state structure.  Space missions require devices to operate in harsh environments with extreme temperatures, debris, planetary atmospheres and electromagnetic radiation.  A pervasive issue facing users of MEMS devices in all environments is the availability and design of packaging technologies for ensuring long-term reliability and performance of the devices.  This project will develop packaging technologies for MEMS based on innovative polymeric materials that are processable into diamond like carbon and silicon carbide materials.  Packaging benefits include:<br><br>?	High wear surfaces<br>?	Thermally conductive<br>?	Electrically insulating<br>?	Anti-stiction<br>?	Hard surface<br>?	Low porosity<br>?	Low coefficient of friction<br>?	CTE matched to silicon<br><br>These materials are also expected to be low in cost compared to chemical vapor deposition materials and they achieve higher purity and quality.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The technology that is proposed for this project is a pervasive, critical path capability that is needed for MEMS devices as well as for microelectronics packaging.  AMT is presently in the process of launching services for packaging and utilizing high reliability microelectronics in space and military environments and this project will provide added capabilities and new market niches that are complementary and synergistic.  The initial focus is on space applications, however there are many other terrestrial needs for MEMS devices that are required to operate in harsh environments; examples include oceanographic exploration, automotive, oil and gas exploration, medical applications, fuel cells, etc.  The market for MEMS devices is presently $3.8B and is expected to reach $11B by 2005.  Packaging will become at least 10 % of the sales (based on microelectronics industry experience) and therefore MEMS packaging should achieve a market size of at least $1B.  Because of the performance and cost benefits that MEMS devices offer for harsh environment applications, it is expected that the products and the packaging technology should be a high profit margin business.  AMT has received a contingent letter of commitment from Intel Capital for $300K to support Phase II.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In Phase I IAC, teamed with Pratt & Whitney and Luppold & Associates, developed and demonstrated a hybrid modeling approach to enhance diagnostics and prognostics performance on F-117 engines.  The hybrid model fuses a physics-based model developed by Pratt & Whitney called STORM with an empirical model that uses neural networks to monitor and quantify unmodeled and/or mismodeled engine phenomena that corrupt STORM?s diagnostic outputs. The resulting hybrid model is called the enhanced STORM or eSTORM.  In Phase I eSTORM was demonstrated to work extremely well for limited conditions when processing simulated engine data.  <br>In Phase II IAC proposes to develop a standalone system for real time implementation of a full F-117 engine eSTORM.  The system will cover the full C-17 flight envelope. The system will include interfaces to accept data from the C-17 aircraft bus and will be capable of on-wing operation.  The system will be demonstrated using real F-117 inputs running in a test bench environment.  Though developed explicitly for an F-117 application, the hybrid modeling concept developed on this Phase II is generic and can be used for eSTORM development on all Pratt & Whitney military and commercial engines.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
IAC worked closely with Pratt & Whitney in development of the initial eSTORM system in Phase I.  Pratt & Whitney will support IAC in Phase II to provide engine expertise and proprietary engine models.  Though developed explicitly for an F-117 application, the system to be developed on Phase II is generic and can be used for eSTORM development on all Pratt & Whitney military and commercial engines.  If Phase II is successful Pratt & Whitney would transition the technologies developed to all their product lines

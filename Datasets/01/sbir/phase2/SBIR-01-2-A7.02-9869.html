<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In this proposal, a solution-based three-dimensional mesh adaptation procedure is described. The algorithm utilized in our code can very effectively refine the mesh in regions of interest by moving nodes in regions of unchanging flow field for accurate prediction of steady and unsteady pressure and thermal load distributions. Our flow solver interacts with most popular commercial CAD packages through the CGNS interface and currently interfaces with OPTIMESH/MOM3D through a user friendly GUI provided with ICEM CFD mesh generator package. <br>Benchmarks have been performed; among them is the moving-lid (lid-driven) cavity problem. This problem is a well-known standard to test CFD codes. The results of these benchmarks have been excellent.<br>Further correlation and more stringent benchmarking will continue as part of the Phase II efforts. Enhancement of the code is required to accept additional mesh element types, for unsteady flows, inclusion of species, reaction and other scalar functions.<br>Our objective for Phase II is to develop a product involving both the CFD solver and the grid adaptation module within a single package.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The commercial applications of this package are varied and many since the adaptation procedure may practically be applied to almost any field or industry such as structures, acoustics, earthquake simulation, magnetic fields and so on. This is because the code accepts any parameter as a vector or scalar quantity and performs adaptation based on the error estimates obtained from the initial solution and variation of these variables.

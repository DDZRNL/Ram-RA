<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
As an excellent candidate soft magnetic material for transformer, generator, inductor and other applications at low frequency, Fe-Co alloys have attracted much attention.  However, at high frequency, the power loss increases due to its low electrical resistivity.  During the Phase I research, Nanomat, Inc. has successfully synthesized Fe-Co alloy nanoparticles coated with some electrically insulating materials in order to increase its electrical resistivity.  Interesting results pertaining to the electrical and magnetic properties of such nanocomposites achieved in the Phase I research suggest that there is considerable merit for further research and development of the approach.  In the Phase II program, Nanomat will focus on the optimization of powder synthesis, consolidation and scale-up.  We will consolidate the powder in order to achieve high density compacts and evaluate their microstructure, electrical and magnetic properties as a function of compaction parameter.  The additional developments and improvements will be the critical steps needed to incorporate the technology developed during Phase I into the market.  Additionally, similar studies on synthesis, compaction and characterization of structural, magnetic and electrical properties of Fe-Ni alloy nanoparticles, will also be taken up.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Fe-Co nanocomposites can be used for many applications, especially in power converters, motor drivers and other power electronics in commercial as well as military satellites, aircrafts, and spacecrafts requiring soft magnetic materials for use at high frequency. This material may also be used to make antennas and high frequency coils, tunable filters for cellular handset, suppression beads, choke coils, loading coils etc.  Fe-Ni nanomaterials have potential applications in audio coils, transformers magnetic amplifier coils, etc.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The technical, scientific, and commercial feasibility of developing a novel aquatic in-situ biogeochemical sensor, termed the XMF, is evaluated.  Using excitation-emission matrix fluorometry, the sensor will enable in-situ simultaneous detection and effective analytical separation of individual biogeochemical components present in seawater, including humic substances, hydrocarbons, proteins, wastewater/sewage, and other natural and anthropogenic substances.  Excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) will be measured at sampling rates on the order of a second.  No scanning of the monochromators, in fact no moving parts whatsoever, will be required.  The technological innovation making this possible is termed Double Dispersion Imaging (DDI).  The sensor software will incorporate real-time, automated quantum corrections and 2-D mixing analysis techniques.  Design goals emphasize portability, compactness, ruggedness, and enabling flexible deployment through features such as variable sampling rates and memory storage capabilities.  No current sensor for oceanographic deployment has these characteristics.  If feasibility is demonstrated, the XMF is expected to be a powerful analytical tool for investigating biogeochemical processes that we feel will realistically mark a turning point in the analytical oceanic measurement capabilities.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
WET Labs plans to commercialize and manufacture three products as a direct result of this SBIR effort.  These products will include an in water sensor for detection and classification of dissolved hydrocarbons and natural dissolved organics, a general purpose bench-top spectral fluorometer for process control and underway applications, and a in-water spectral fluorometer for biogenic identification.  In addition two collaborations are presently underway which will allow the company to develop products using the core technologies and methods developed in this project, for developing chemical sensors for process control applications in the sewage treatment community and for making smart auto analyzers for autonomous and remote vehicles.  The company sees potential revenues from manufacture and licensing to produce total revenues exceeding $50M. WET labs is currently hiring a marketing manager to assure successful implementation and completion of its commercialization efforts.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In the framework of a NASA SBIR-Phase I sponsored program, Face Electronics, LC has developed the first successful demonstration of a piezoelectric-based high-voltage, high-power transformer, TAP-SONER, for use in Electronic Power Conditioners (EPCs) for space Travelling Wave Tube Amplifiers (TWTAs). The new transformer operates under resonant conditions with a very high mechanical factor. Consequently, the transformer can achieve a higher step-up ratios and higher power density compared to similar conventional magnetic transformers. The novel transformer is compact in size, light in weight, and does not generate magnetic interferences, since neither magnetic materials nor coils are involved in its manufacturing. Additionally, the specific design proposed for Phase I, based on a new paralleling-tapped concept developed by Face, allows for the supply of a different number of high voltages and high powers required to drive the TWT.<br><br>The Phase II proposal is focused on the technical improvement of the proposed device in order to achieve the performance levels required for low and medium power TWTs. In order to achieve this goal the following objectives will be pursued: (a) increase power output of current design up to 100W, (b) electronic integration for space application, and (c) reliability testing for the final equipment.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The 1990s were characterized by continual growth of communication satellites caused by the expanding need for fixed and mobile communications, broadcast television, and multimedia systems. The market share of satellite communication will rise from about 2.5% of total global communication revenues today (i.e. $20 billion of $800 billion) to 6.5% of all communications services (i.e. $68 to $80 billion of $1.2 trillion in 2005). The key element of a commercial communication satellite is the TWTA. Specifically, the current worldwide market segment for TWTs (including commercial and military ground and space applications) is estimated to be in the order of $500 million. Including military applications, the total space TWT market might amount to as much as $250 million. Typically a satellite can have more than 50 TWTs on board, the price of each being about $65k, so the total cost of the flight complement on board is about $3M. The maximum number of TWTs with power supplies is related to efficiency issues, space available, and component weight of onboard equipment. Improving the performance of the HV transformers, which represent about 10% to 20% of the total size, by using Transoner based power supplies, is a situation with significant commercial potential.

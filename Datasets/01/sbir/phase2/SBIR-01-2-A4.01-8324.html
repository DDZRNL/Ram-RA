TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)
<br>The Phase I research has positive value for NASA?s SATS mission as well as for the creation of near-term GA commercial product opportunities (2005).  While researching the Phase I CCT transfer process a modular cabin and interior design partnership was created with RCO engineering.  This automotive style cabin technology had cost and comfort that was very attractive and Eclipse Aviation engaged RCO for a prototype development and is negotiating a production selection.  Therefore the successful commercial deployment of a part of the technology developed in this SBIR is possible during Phase II when Eclipse reaches production in 2004.    Phase III success will be achieved with the production certification of a complete cabin module that has integrated CCTs.  Munro & Assoc. will partner with appropriate GA OEMs and retrofitters to self fund a certification effort in parallel with the Phase II R&D.  New GA products will be spawned from the commercial success of the CCT product.

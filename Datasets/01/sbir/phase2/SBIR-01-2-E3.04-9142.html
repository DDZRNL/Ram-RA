<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The purpose of the proposed Phase II project is to develop AGNC?-2000CIMIU coremicro? IMU/GPS-based hyperspectral remote sensing processing system for spaceborne and airborne in situ data collection systems. This effort will result a high payoff and unique commercial product which features real time and high precision. Location and attitude information provided by the sensor suite of AGNC?-2000CIMIU coremicro? IMU and a GPS receiver are used for hyperspectral image processing. The Phase I efforts and achievements have laid a solid foundation for success of the Phase II project. Specifically, the Phase II project would: 1) Refine and integrate the Phase I algorithms; 2) Implement the miniature and custom design for hardware system; 3) Develop embedded software system, and 4) Perform the marketing and commercialization of the end product. Commercial applications include the use of the pointing and positioning system for monitoring water quality, geodesy surveying, precision farming, and potentially for other applications such as aircraft landing.

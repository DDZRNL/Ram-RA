<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Acellent Technologies is developing a Hybrid piezoelectric/fiber optic (HyPFO) structural diagnostic system that can be used to perform quick non-destructive evaluation and long-term health monitoring of aerospace vehicles and structures. The development is based on Acellent's state-of-the-art SMART Layer technology that utilizes a built-in network of piezoelectric sensors and actuators embedded on a thin dielectric carrier film, that can be easily mounted on the surface of existing structures or embedded inside composite structures during manufacturing itself. Due to the popularity of fiber-optic sensors, it is proposed to incorporate fiber-optic sensors into the current SMART Layer product to create a Hybrid piezoelectric/fiber-optic monitoring layer. The specific objectives of the phase I effort were to (1) Develop and fabricate a hybrid piezoelectric/fiber optic layer, (2) Integrate the fabricated prototype onto a demonstration structure and (3) Demonstrate functionality of the structurally integrated HyPFO monitoring layer. Anticipated phase II challenges include completing the design and development of the Hybrid piezoelectric/fiber-optic sensor layer, development of instrumentation for the hybrid layer in collaboration with fiber-optic companies, integration of the fiber-optic instrument and Acellent's current diagnostic instrument, development of diagnostic and application software for the HyPFO and testing and validation of the developed system with industrial partners.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
This innovative technology has widespread applications in major industries including aerospace, aeronautical, automotive, and civil infrastructure. The company anticipates that the development and subsequent commercialization of the structural health monitoring system will lead to economic benefits these industries in the form of improved safety, reduced life cycle costs through real-time structural monitoring, improvement in structural reliability, reduction of maintenance cost and improved readiness for service. The proposed development is fully supported by its industrial counterpart - Thiokol Propulsion. These companies have extensive applications of the structural health monitoring system for their products including solid rocket motors, aircrafts structures, and missiles and will test the developed system on their products during the project.

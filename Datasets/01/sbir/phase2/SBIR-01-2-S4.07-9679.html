<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Silver/zinc batteries have been a critical component in NASA missions for decades, yet the technology has not overcome the basic flaws that limit service life.  Working with Eagle-Picher Technologies, RBC succeeded in its Phase I program in solving the two major causes of early failure in silver/zinc batteries, by incorporating innovative electrode and separator components. Capacity fade on cycling was appreciably reduced translating to higher average working energy density and specific energy.  Polyolefin based microporous separators were stable in KOH electrolyte giving wet-life superior to a cellophane containing laminate. Cells could be assembled in the charged state, not requiring a formation step, which is an advantage in terms of mission preparation. The proposed Phase II program will build upon the successful results of the Phase I demonstration to complete development to the point where RBC would design, assemble and deliver to NASA a higher performance silver/zinc battery for a specific NASA application.  In Phase II RBC will work with Eagle-Picher Technologies and Advanced Membrane Systems, Inc. in order to complete optimization of separator and electrolyte for maximum service life.  The technology will then be scaled into 40Ah, 17V batteries for the Extravehicular Mobility Unit-Primary Life Support System.<br><br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Silver/zinc batteries have been widely used in space where volume and weight limitations are critical. Space applications include: launch-vehicle guidance and control, telemetry, NASA vehicles, space shuttle payload launch and power for the life-support equipment used by the astronauts during EVA's. Silver/zinc batteries (primary as well as secondary) also find critical applications in military markets, powering over 90% of all military missile systems, including the Patriot and Tomahawk Cruise missiles. The Navy makes use of silver/zinc batteries in applications that include: mines, buoys, special test vehicles, swimmer aids, deep submergence and rescue vehicles, exploratory underwater vehicles, torpedo propulsion, drones, submarines, and other military equipment. There are also commercial sector applications for silver/zinc in premium electronic equipment that requires a lightweight, high-capacity battery, such as portable medical equipment, portable communications, and professional video recorder. With sufficient improvements in wet-life/cycle-life, technology developed under this SBIR program could find new markets in high performance telecommunications and satellites, which are currently undergoing high rates of growth. Higher performance silver/zinc batteries could be reasonably expected to take market share from older versions of this system, and would be a driver for implementing technology successfully developed under this program.<br>

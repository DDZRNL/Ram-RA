<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed SBIR Phase II research project is divided into four parts.  The principal objective of the first part is to conduct hot-wire measurements to assess the accuracy of Dean?s Two Microphone Impedance Measurement Method.  They will also be used to calibrate CAA numerical codes. <br>The principal objective of the second part is to develop a computationally simple 2-DOF resonator impedance model.  The model will include non-linearity of the cavity sound particle velocities pumped into/out-of the inner/outer orifices.  The model will be calibrated by Impedance measurements as a function of SPL and grazing flow speed.<br>The principal objective of the third part is to use hot-wires to measure cavity inflow/outflow sound particle velocities near the orifices of multiple orifice resonators, backed by a common cavity.  These measurements should provide fundamental understanding of orifice-to-orifice interaction.  They will be used to assess potential resonator bandwidth improvement as a function of orifice spacing in grazing flow applications.<br>The principal objective of the fourth part is to design and construct a prototype low self-noise probe microphone to measure broadband sound in high-speed flow duct applications.  The performance of the prototype probe will be validated in the NASA LaRC 2-in by 2-in wind tunnel.<br><br>

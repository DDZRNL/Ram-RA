<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Filters don't exist that are capable of removing virus and bacteria at high enough flow rates to be practical either for space systems or for domestic consumption. In Phase 1 we demonstrated feasibility that our nano ceramic fiber filter could produce sterile water at high flow rates.  In Phase 2 we propose to develop performance data on such filters that would provide NASA with the capability for sizing such filters for AWRS for diverse missions. The tasks also include improving the strength of the filters, providing them with biocidal capability to deter the growth of bacterial slime on the filter face, and demonstrating their capability to remove all forms of pathogens. A major task will be to develop a regenerable filter that uses minimal or no expendables. We will investigate their use as pre-filters for extending the life of reverse osmosis membranes that might be used in AWRS systems. An additional task would determine the feasibility of a microbial trap to maintain sterility of stored water without using iodine disinfectant. We will prove the viability of the filter by designing and testing a full-scale cartridge filter, suitable for NASA and for commercial sale.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
There is a large and growing market for "Point of Use" cartridge filters for sterilizing water in residences, hospitals, medical and dental suites. The cartridge could also be used as a pre-filter to extend the life of RO desalination membranes and to purify water of biological weapons. If the BW can be rapidly desorbed and the filter cycled repeatedly it would be a major advance as a front end for concentrating BW agents so they could be detected and assayed.  The filter could be used as a low cost environmental sampler for virus, providing EPA with the capability to implement routine virus testing of water sources. There is also an extensive market for small, disc shaped filters for laboratory use, particularly in the life sciences. We intend to commercialize these starting in the 4th quarter of 2002.  The proposed filter would find wide application in sterilizing pharmaceutical and biotech products. It would be capable of separating cells, proteins, enzymes, and genes by charge differences.

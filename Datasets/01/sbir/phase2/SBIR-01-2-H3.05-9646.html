<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
	The primary objective of Phase I was to determine the feasibility of demonstrating critical subsystems and components of thermophotovoltaic (TPV) and thermionic (TI) power systems that use thin-film solar concentrators.  Based on design, performance, and technology readiness evaluations, key hardware elements were identified for both electrical, power generation approaches and a thin-film concentrator assembly that are viable for validation testing.  The Phase II work will validate the performance of critical elements of solar TPV and TI power systems.  These elements are: a preshaped thin-film primary concentrator with inflatable support structure; the TPV receiver-emitter with a band gap solar cell array; and the TI thermal receiver with integral cylindrical inverted converter and secondary concentrator.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
	In addition to large-scale, long-lived space solar power systems, these technologies have applications in near-sun and Mars-class missions, large antennas, high resolution earth observation satellites, light collectors for precision secondary optics, solar thermal and electric propulsion and high temperature materials processing in space.  Ground commercial applications include large- and small-scale electrical power generation and use of the inflatable structures for emergency shelters in extreme environments and in lightweight articles exposed to long-term weathering conditions.

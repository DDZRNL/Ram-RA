<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
High temperature, corrosion resistant cartridge materials are needed for microgravity processing experiments.  Tungsten and molybdenum have high melting temperatures and in general possess the required chemical inertness.  To improve the mechanical properties of these materials, alloy additions such as rhenium are necessary.  Recently, thin-walled, closed-end cartridges have been fabricated from elemental blends of molybdenum-rhenium powders.  However high temperature heat treatments are necessary to alloy elemental blended powders.  Problems with distortion, intermetallic formation and incomplete alloying have occurred.  To overcome these problems, an innovative Plasma Alloying and Spheroidization (PAS) process is being developed to produce pre-alloyed molybdenum-rhenium and tungsten-rhenium powders.  Benefits of the PAS process such as a two-order magnitude reduction in oxygen contamination, enhanced flow characteristics, ability to produce pre-alloyed refractory metal powders and the ability to reduce heat treatment processing time were demonstrated during Phase I.  During Phase II, the PAS process will be optimized.  The optimized PAS Mo-Re and W-Re powders will be used for the production of robust, high temperature QMI and GEDS cartridges for microgravity processing experiments.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Commercial potential of the technology being developed during this effort is very high. The improved powder characteristics obtained by PAS processing will directly affect the coatings and powder industries, which represent multi-billion dollar markets.<br><br>Other potential applications for the SBIR technology include, chemical processing, high temperature furnace and retort components, rocket motor throat inserts, radiation shields, heat pipes, power generation equipment, nuclear components, beam and sputter targets, solid waste incineration, automotive, printing industry.  <br>

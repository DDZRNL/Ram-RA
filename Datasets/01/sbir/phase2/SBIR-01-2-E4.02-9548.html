<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Spectral Sciences, Inc. project addresses the development of data analysis software tools for ground-based radiometers to facilitate improved atmospheric correction of remotely sensed hyperspectral and multispectral imagery (HSI and MSI) of the coastal zone. The atmospheric variables needed for the correction (water vapor and ozone column amounts, and aerosol optical properties) may be retrieved from a radiometer located in the vicinity of the remotely sensed scene of interest. The radiometer-retrieved information will significantly improve atmospheric correction accuracy, most notably by taking the guesswork out of selecting a suitable aerosol model<br><br>Phase I featured novel MODTRAN-based algorithms and tools for analyzing shadow band radiometer measurements and porting the results to the FLAASH atmospheric correction algorithm.  Key accomplishments include demonstration of radiometer data conditioning for continuous daytime retrievals, an aerosol parameterization that extrapolates well into the IR, analysis of radiometer data, and demonstration of complete, end-to-end atmospheric retrieval and correction using simulated radiometer and HSI data.  In Phase II, an integrated software toolkit will be prototyped and validated against new HSI/MSI field and archival data.  In Phase III, the toolkit will be commercialized and integrated with MODTRAN5 and ENVI/FLAASH products under development with our commercial partner, Research Systems, Inc.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
While the initially targeted application would be NASA?s current and future coastal zone remote sensing needs, an extensive market for such software exists within the broad-based remote sensing community, which includes numerous government agencies (NASA, USDA, USAF, DOE, etc.) and private companies.  A key commercial application is precision agriculture, which is being pursued by one of our development partners, Resource 21 LLC. Other commercial remote sensing applications include mineral exploration, forestry management, rangeland management, and environmental monitoring. Related military remote sensing applications include surveillance, reconnaissance, and technical intelligence.  Both commercial and military applications utilize aircraft and satellite sensor platforms.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The objective of this project is to develop a novel proprietary tool for crystallization of protein molecules and in addition to develop a multiple gene expression vector for producing protein complexes recombinantly.  The novel phage display crystallization system is a high risk project that has a tremendous potential because the conditions for crystallization remain constant regardless of the protein molecule studied.  The development of a multiple gene expression system, ?MaGEX,? for producing protein complexes also has a market that has drawn the interest and support of a premiere genetics company Athersys, Inc. for world wide commercialization.  The development of the prototype MaGEX is required to implement the Trojan Phage technology.  These products could  result in a large number of proteins for structure determination which is synergistic with NASA?s Biological and Physical Research Enterprise that utilizes micro-gravitational effects to improve crystallization conditions.  As part of the commercialization the systems would be offered as kits for expressing protein complexes recombinantly or for crystallization.  In Phase I, we made significant progress in the construction of the MaGEX system which will be used to express the Trojan Phage.  In Phase II, demonstration of the feasibility of this system to crystallize foreign proteins will begin.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
A system that could guarantee the crystallization of a protein molecule or domain does not exist.  We anticipate that there will be a world wide market for this pre-packaged proprietary tool.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Disturbance-Optics-Controls-Structures (DOCS) suite is an Integrated Development Environment for assembly of multidisciplinary analyses into an accurate dynamic integrated model for analysis of performance and margins and identification of resource-optimal redesign. The suite is innovative because it combines validated design tools, or modules, for detailed system analysis with an automation layer that drives the analysis tools, permitting rapid evaluation of the trade space between many highly coupled design variables.  The analysis modules are general enough to be applicable for the complete program life cycle, from conceptual design to operational analysis.  The automation layer handles the translation of high-level systems requirements into module-level design space constraints, and buffers the detailed analysis results.   The suite encompasses an archiving function, which enables the time evolution of the design to be explicitly tracked, facilitating the systems designer?s understanding of the design space, and providing a formal means to manage risk.  The combination of detailed modeling accuracy with the automation necessary for trading a large design space provides analysis depth and breadth, leading to an optimal systems design.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The "out of the box" capability included in the Phase II DOCS product is focused on the core market of high performance optomechanical systems.  However, the modeling language, methodology, and analysis tools are common to a much wider field of customers.  Any technical area that contains aspects of Controls/Structures Interaction (CSI), optimization of dynamic performance of structural systems, and/or coupled-system analysis are potential customers.  For NASA missions, an example of a potential analysis extension supported by the framework is power dissipation by active control system elements on the cryogenic side of a system, which is naturally described in the DOCS language using coupled electro-mechanical  impedance models of the actuators.  Some potential commercial applications, culled from current Mide customers, including: disk drives and other storage media; running shoe stiffness optimization; smart material system design; acoustic and vibration control; and human factors such as ride quality and vibration.  The basic capabilities for extension to these fields have been built into the package from the start of the Phase I effort, based in part in Mide's collaboration with representatives in these industries.  Therefore, while the Phase II effort will remain focused on the core optomechanical systems customers, a significant effort will be made to identify and cultivate the grounds for an expansion to a wider market.

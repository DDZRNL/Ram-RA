<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
<br>ResearchSouth has developed a powerful design optimization algorithm using an adjoint-based methodology for advanced aerospace vehicles including the airframe aerodynamic shape and the integrated propulsion system.  The significance is that this algorithm separates the geometric entities from the optimization process allowing an independent linkage with many CAD packages and at much lower cost.  All objectives have been met for the Phase I  project.  A computer software package, termed SAMdesign, now has the capability to solve the three-dimensional Euler equations, solve the adjoint of the Euler equations, and change the vehicle shape subject to constraints.  All of these solutions are performed on unstructured tetrahedral meshes using a Finite Element based numerical algorithm. Four test cases have been successfully computed including a generic aerospace vehicle.  Phase II will include multi-disciplinary effects, coupled physics for aerodynamics / propulsion / structures, fast finite element meshing methods, and will develop the software into a production package. Extensive  verification and validation will be done on NASA configurations. The product will be documented, delivered and installed at NASA with a user-training course given.  This will provide NASA with a powerful software tool to perform very efficient and rapid design assessment of evolving next generation space vehicles.

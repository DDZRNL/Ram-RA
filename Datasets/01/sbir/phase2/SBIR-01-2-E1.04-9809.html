<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
WaveBand Corporation proposes a novel focal plane array sensor for millimeter wave (MMW) imaging.  The major innovation is the monolithic integration of printed fractal-like antennas, pyroelectric capacitors, and MEMS switches in a single wafer.  Pyroelectric sensors have low sensitivity in the MMW range of the spectrum.  The proposed integration of pyroelectric capacitors with printed broad-band antennas will dramatically improve sensitivity.  The preliminary design and calculations performed in the course of the Phase I Project have shown that the minimum detectable temperature contrast is less than 1 K. A MEMS switch incorporated in the antenna/capacitor circuit will act as a chopper, eliminating the need for that cumbersome device. <br>The goal of Phase II of the Project is to build a working prototype of the proposed imager (with support of Raytheon?s foundry for the manufacturing process). The final result of Phase II will be the creation of a very efficient low-cost MMW imager whose sensitivity is comparable to that of the best IR sensors. The combination of WaveBand?s MMW circuitry and a pyroelectric thermal sensor makes it possible to overcome the main problem of MMW thermal sensors, their low sensitivity caused by the small power of thermal radiation in the MMW frequency range.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
A conceptual illustration of the contemplated commercial product is presented in Figure 10-1. This is a preliminary concept of the product design for the proposed millimeter wave sensor based on the Phase I work results. It consists of a monolithic array chip, which includes antenna elements, pyroelectric capacitors, MEMS switches fabricated monolithically on a semiconductor substrate and mounted in the center of a cylindrical housing with a conventional lens and interface circuitry for reading electronics. The monolithic array chip is the enabling technology that permits the realization of a very simple and low cost quasi-optical approach for the millimeter-wave high-sensitivity imaging sensor.  This compact module, which serves as the heart of sensor systems, is an ideal product for aircraft landing as well as environmental mapping applications.

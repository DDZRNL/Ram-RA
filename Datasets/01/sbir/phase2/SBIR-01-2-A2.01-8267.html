<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) embodies a new philosophy for managing air traffic. The initial implementation of CDM has been aimed at airport Ground Delay Programs (GDPs). However, it has become increasingly evident that very significant delays and throughput degradations have arisen from en-route airspace problems and limitations, particularly from convective weather activity. This effort focused on the application of CDM technology and concepts to the management of en-route traffic (Collaborative Routing). In this phase II effort, we will implement, demonstrate and evaluate a number of different collaborative routing rationing algorithms (CRRAs) to assign use of en route resources to individual flights. We have found that such algorithms are both feasible and can be made consistent with traffic management goals and with the CDM paradigm. The CRRA algorithms will be implemented in NASA?s System-Wide Evaluation Planning Tool (SWEPT) and a major Human-In-The-Loop simulation experiment will be conducted with participants from the FAA Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC), Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs) and Airlines Operation Center (AOC) facilities. This simulation will allow the air transportation community to discuss and refine the CRRA concept toward eventual deployment in the National Airspace System (NAS).<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The product that is contemplated to result from this phase II effort is an initial implementation of the CRRA algorithms into the SWEPT system. Our intent is to obtain further government contracts from NASA and the FAA to further test, enhance and implement the CRRA concepts, procedures and tools into the operational ATC environment.<br>The new procedures enabled by these algorithms and concepts allow significant flexibility to the Users of the NAS and other international ATM systems. This flexibility afforded to airlines and other Users creates decisions that need to be made and managed. Thus, as a direct result of the implementation of CDM concepts, a new market has been created to help Users manage the new options that are created by CDM.<br>Metron Aviation has the necessary experience, organization and track record in such a market to be able to successfully provide services based on the CRRA concepts to airlines. Metron Aviation has developed and now provides as a service the Enhanced Substitution Module (ESM), which is a commercial tool to assist airlines in managing their substitutions during Ground Delay Programs.<br>

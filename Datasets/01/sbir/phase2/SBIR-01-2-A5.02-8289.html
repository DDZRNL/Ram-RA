<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Accurate Automation Corporation proposes a three-pronged effort to build on the Phase I program to develop technologies in support of the NASA Hyper-X program and the X-43 series of research vehicles (X-43A, X-43B, and X-43C).  The data and technologies developed under the proposed Phase II program will also support the development and testing of future hypersonic vehicles and reusable launch vehicles.  
<br>The three major technical objectives of the Phase II program are: 1) Development of a robust, fully nonlinear parameter identification method and associated tools for extraction of dynamic models from flight test data, while rigorously accounting for both process (state) and measurement noise.   2) Development of an adaptive guidance and navigation control system for the development of optimal flight trajectories for hypersonic vehicles including reusable launch vehicles.  3) Development of a low-speed flight test database for the X-43 configuration by conducting envelope expansion flight tests to quantify the performance and handling qualities of AAC?s X-43A-LS UAV.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Accurate Automation will use the technologies and data developed during the proposed program to develop an advanced flight control system that can be used for the X-43 program.  This package will have numerous alternate applications including use for a new decoy system being developed for the military under the ALVIN Program. 
<br>The telemetry system being developed using technologies being developed in this program will be a part of our Aircraft Video Program and will transmit cockpit, cabin and cargo bay imagery to the ground. This product will significantly improve the current ACARS link used by the commercial carriers. Accurate Automation is in negotiation with Federal Express to commercialize this technology. Mr. Jim Phillips of Federal Express has visited AAC twice in the past 3 weeks on this program to talk about a sizeable investment for adding this technology to their fleet.  
<br>The Phase I of the X-43ALS development program has successfully resulted in a vehicle configuration which includes a fully integrated turbojet engine, remote control system, in-flight video, flight data acquisition system, and ground control station.  The X-43ALS vehicle provides a unique capability as a testbed to support NASA?s development of hypersonic vehicle technologies and designs.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A solid state air-gap Fabry-Perot is configured in tandem with a switchable holographic optic element established by holographic polymer liquid crystal dispersion. This switchable element is the innovative centerpiece developed during Phase I research. By stacking these tuning elements, one per wavelength channel, any discrete channel within the operating range (which can include multiple orders) of a Fabry-Perot etalon can be selected for transmission to any receiver in a LIDAR or spectroscopy system.  A sealed, solid state etalon combined with a switchable holographic element can replace a tunable etalon system.  This has advantages with respect to LIDAR system cost, complexity and weight.  Multiplexing allows additional spectral elements to be selected simultaneously or a channel may be switched in milliseconds. The device can thus isolate hundreds of individual wavelengths across the tunable range of a tunable laser or LIDAR transmitter. These capabilities are accomplished with no moving parts, and with a significant cost advantage over competing technologies.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The largest commercial market is telecommunications where this beam steering technology can be used to randomly switch signals among different fiber channels. A solid-state, dense, random optical cross-switch is commercialized to fill needs in the commercial metro-core telecom market, and to supply rapid, multi-channel, covert, and frequency agile optical communications to the national missile defense initiative.  The optical switch is based upon Fabry-Perot and Holographic Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal (H-PDLC) technology.  The deliverable is entirely solid state, is switched electronically requiring minimal power, and is fabricated using planar fabrication techniques - providing significant cost and durability advantages over competing technologies. Additionally this device when configured, as a solid state LIDAR receiver will result in many sales to the space based remote sensing community.

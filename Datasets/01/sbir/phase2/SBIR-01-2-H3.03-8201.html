<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Monitoring mission critical gases is vital for space ventures, including space shuttles, the international space station, spacecraft for planetary missions, spaceports, future projects on Mars, and satellites ? they all need to monitor gases that are mission critical.  Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS), based on the successful results of Phase I, proposes to develop a compact and multi-analyte sensing platform for use across all NASA enterprises.  Specifically, IOS will develop a prototype MOFS (multiplexed optical fiber sensor) unit for measuring, in real time, the leakage of highly combustible cryogenic fluids (hydrogen and oxygen) in spaceport and spacecraft in low ppms over multiple locations.  The use of optical fiber in the MOFS unit will eliminate the danger of any arc or spark.  During Phase I, IOS successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed device by constructing an eight-channel experimental setup that was able to detect 0.02% oxygen and 0.1% hydrogen with no interference from 100% nitrogen, argon, helium, and carbon dioxide.  IOS has committed $150,000 co-funding for Phase II, and has attracted $250,000 in additional follow-on funding.  IOS will deliver the MOFS prototype to NASA, complete with software, manuals, and schematics.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
It is estimated that the present $1.2 billion worldwide gas sensing market needs safe and reliable sensors to measure leaks in valves, and personal units for hydrogen gas safety monitoring.  The transition into a hydrogen economy could push the $120,000,000 annual hydrogen sensor market today into annual sales of $1,800,000,000 by 2010 for hydrogen safety sensing according to available estimates.  Hydrogen feed stock sensors needed to manage gas flow and purity will further increase the demand for hydrogen sensors.  The upgrading of fuel tanks aboard commercial, freight, military, and corporate jets to avoid potential explosion from fuel vapor will open new markets for oxygen sensing.  If the FAA mandates that all fuel tanks switch from open aerated fuel tanks into closed oxygen purged systems, then $900,000,000 in oxygen sensor will be required to meet the current need.  Over $100,000,000 per year would be spent on sensor tip replacement during scheduled tri-annual fuel tank maintenance.  The current combined world market totals roughly 40,000 aircraft in service today growing to 60,000 aircraft by 2020.  Of these, new aircraft will replace about 40,000 aircraft, as older airplanes are retired and military aircraft upgraded.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Deep Space Missions need a prime power solar array that can operate in both inner and outer planet conditions. The Deep Space Concentrator uses optical and thermal control techniques available to high concentration ratio design, to enable a solar array that provides power efficiently at very high flux, high thermal environments, and very low-flux, cold, high radiation environments. The unique innovation of the DSC is to take advantage of the changes in apparent solar width, and use a concentrator with limited acceptance angle to reduce the light transmitted to the solar cell at near-sun conditions, when the apparent solar disk angle and collimation angle is large, and transmit more solar energy to the solar cell when at far-sun conditions, when the apparent solar disk size and collimation angle is small.  In the Phase I SBIR, we demonstrated the basic operation of the Deep Space Concentrator through optical and thermal analysis and the fabrication and test of a Demo Model. The Phase II proposed program finalizes the mirror and photovoltaic receiver manufacturing technology, designs and analyzes a full-scale kilowatt-sized solar panel, and builds qualification and prototype panels for testing in thermal balance, thermal cycling and acoustic environments.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Solar panels represent a large fraction of high-power commercial spacecraft cost. High concentration ratio concentrator panels can reduce the cost per watt of a solar panel by reducing the cost of the solar cell, the primary driver of solar panel cost. The DSC program will demonstrate the cost reduction achievable by miniaturizing a solar cell and using automated semiconductor die-attach and assembly processes. The Phase III effort to complete commercialization will focus on minimizing risk of implementing the DSC in a commercial spacecraft operating environment.

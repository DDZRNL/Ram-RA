<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Solid Expellant Plasma Source/Contactor (SOLEX) is a new technological development that considerably simplifies the plasma generation and electron emission process.  Under the Phase-1 effort, the preliminary work to demonstrate the feasibility of the SOLEX concept was accomplished.  The intent of the proposed Phase-II effort is to develop a flight-level design for a SOLEX plasma generator, for electrodynamic tether systems, and fabricate an Engineering Unit test device that is appropriate for flight validation.  The SOLEX will operate directly off of the tether-generated high-voltage (requiring no conditioned power or control electronics) and will eliminate the need for high-pressure gas containers, pressure regulators, plumbing and valves?required by present state-of-the-art Hollow Cathode devices.  These are significant improvements over current state-of-the-art contactors that impinge heavily on spacecraft resources.  Based on available flight data and Phase-I tests, current capacity can range from a few milli-amps to several amps.  By nature of its design, the SOLEX should not be sensitive to contamination and should have essentially unlimited restart capability?both are issues with state-of-the-art contactors.  Moreover, the simplicity of the design concept suggests that flight devices will be relatively inexpensive.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The SOLEX should be an attractive alternative to present plasma generation devices because of its simplicity, robustness, efficiency, and predicted low-cost.  Potential space technology applications include (1) plasma contactors for electrodynamic space tethers, (2) plasma sources for plasma sails, and (3) electrical neutralization of high-altitude (e.g., synchronous orbit) spacecraft.  A low-mass device, such as the SOLEX, is required to enable the practical application of electrodynamic tether propulsion devices to the end-of-life deorbit of satellites where system mass, simplicity and robustness are critical concerns.  As space debris becomes a growing concern to NASA and the DOD, this application will become increasingly important.  Potential ground-based applications include plasma sources for sputter deposition systems used in the semiconductor industry.

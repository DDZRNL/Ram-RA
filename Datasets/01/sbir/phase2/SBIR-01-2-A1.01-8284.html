<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In this Phase II SBIR effort, Metron designs and develops an intent inference algorithm, an algorithm that infers the intent of the pilot of an aircraft that is being tracked by a surveillance system.  Data describing the environment around the aircraft, for instance, the location of nearby aircraft, weather, Navaids, alternate airports, turbulence, and operational data are used to determine plausible routes for travel.  Operational data and domain knowledge from pilot and air traffic controller interviews are used to identify how pilots react to these elements in the National Airspace System (NAS).  The algorithm imbeds operational data and domain knowledge into human decision-making computer models; these models are then used to predict the future motion of the vehicle and to identify intent.  The outputs of the algorithm are an inferred intent, a level of confidence in the intent, and a continuous predicted path.<br>
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
We are designing our algorithm to be used in real-time applications of systems that track aircraft <br>en route in the NAS and for future cockpit displays that require the intent of a nearby aircraft to<br>be inferred.  Such a functionality for the cockpit is a required part of a Cockpit Display of Traffic Information,<br>or CDTI.

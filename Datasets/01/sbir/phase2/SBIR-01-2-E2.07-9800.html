<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Phase I established the viability of a 3.0-volt,  Li-ion-based LixV2O5 cell  system.  Rechargeability, rate capability, and operability at -30oC, -200C, R/T, and +550C were demonstrated.  It was also found that depending on the structural modifications of V2O5, delivery of specific capacity at 200 mAh/g or higher can be achieved.  Further development and optimization of this cathode material, including processing of the electrode, should merit this system for NASA missions (GEO, LEO and Terrestrial).  This Phase II effort proposes to further the development of  two types of crystalline V2O5 (bulk crystalline and nanocrystalline) and two types of amorphous V2O5.  Continued effort on this cathode technology will focus on the synthesis and optimization of the materials, characterizations of the materials at the 15-350 mAh cell level, determinations of the optimum windows for each specific materials with respect to achieving long cycle life, and the development of a 5 Ah cell prototype as the cell deliverables.  Three basic tasks are therefore proposed:  Task 1.  Cathode Development, Task 2. Anode/Electrolyte Development, and Task 3. Cell Development for a duration of 24 months.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Successful introduction of high rate and high energy density rechargeable lithium-ion batteries is expected to have significance in commercial markets as well for military and aerospace markets. The key features in MaxPower's presently proposed SBIR battery R&D program are high energy density, high rate, and an operational range over an extremely wide temperature range. Uses in commercial markets include power tools, mobile computing (e.g. notebook PCs with energy and power demanding disk drives) which operate via satellite communications, implantable medical devices such as cardiac pacemakers and ICD batteries, and the high power battery required for hybrid electric vehicles, e.g. in combination with a low power very high energy density fuel cell.

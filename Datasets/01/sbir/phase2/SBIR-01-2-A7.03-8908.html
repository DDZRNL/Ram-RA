<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to develop an Optical Air Data System (OADS) to measure air vehicle airspeed, Mach number, atmospheric pressure, atmospheric temperature, angles of attack and sideslip, and air density using a non-intrusive technique termed Rayleigh/Mie lidar.  Currently, these parameters are measured using numerous sensors that cannot perform adequately for high-performance/high-speed aircraft.  Recent research into OADS has focused on coherent Mie (aerosol) lidar, which fail in many flight regimes due to insufficient aerosol scattering.  Moreover, Mie lidar cannot measure temperature or pressure.  Rayleigh (molecular) lidar overcomes these shortcomings by scattering from the air itself to provide velocity, temperature and pressure.  Rayleigh/Mie lidar has the additional benefit of providing improved velocity measurements when sufficient aerosols exist.  Thus, OPHIR's Rayleigh/Mie OADS offers performance, weight and cost savings advantages not provided by any other commercially available or developing technology.<br><br>The Phase I research effort has been very successful.  All objectives were met and all tasks successfully completed.  This research has proven the feasibility of a Rayleigh/Mie lidar OADS.  <br><br>Phase II will include the development of a flyable prototype.  The Boeing Company will provide flight-testing, and Goodrich Aerospace will perform wind tunnel testing, at no cost to the Phase II effort.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
This technology offers significant commercial potential for flight test operations, military aircraft and commercial aircraft.  As an indication of this commercial potential, we have been very successful in gaining support from major airframe and air data system manufacturers.  OPHIR's Rayleigh/Mie approach has gained the support of The Boeing Company Flight Test Group (providing flight testing at no cost to the Phase II effort), Goodrich Aerospace (providing testing and evaluation support at no cost to the Phase II effort) and the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company- EADS(Airbus).<br><br>Thus, the world's two largest airframe manufacturers, Boeing and EADS(Airbus) and one of the largest manufacturers of air data systems, have all expressed interest and support for this research.  The Phase II research will include cooperative demonstrations of this critical technology to these Industry leaders.  This is a significant step toward Phase III commercialization.<br>

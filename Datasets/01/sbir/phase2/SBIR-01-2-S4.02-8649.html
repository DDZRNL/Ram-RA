<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In Phase I, we explored and developed a concept for a versatile and robust locomotion methodology based on snake and worm morphologies. These creatures have evolved versatile techniques for mobility that can be mimicked by robots operating in complex unknown workspaces such as in rough debris fields or in diverse media such as water, sand, slush, or ice, as may be found on Mars or Europa. While we found a significant amount of prior research in related areas, it was confined to laboratory experiments in relatively benign environments, and none exhibited the ability of a mechanism to transition from one environment to another. For commonality of parts, our concept uses a single module design based on a three degree-of-freedom parallel kinematic linkage that is connected in series. The modules monitor their own specific orientations, which are then summed by a central processor. The vehicle's protective skin is one of the critical areas of innovation because it must resist abrasion and corrosion, yet be flexible and elastic. In Phase II, we will construct a working prototype, and conduct a series of experiments, both on the test bench and in the field, toward developing algorithms for locomotion.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Our snake-like vehicle's small frontal area and ability to conform to complex shapes would be advantageous in scientific applications, including glaciology and other polar research. Industrial applications include internal pipe inspections for obstructions, corrosion, and zebra mussel infestation. The device could be used to counter bioterrorism by inspecting and cleaning building air ducts. Its ability to maneuver in complex unpredictable environments makes it suitable for certain planetary exploration objectives, and to survey hazardous waste sites such as Chernobyl. Like silkworms, this vehicle could spool out an optical fiber, delivering a communication lifeline to survivors trapped in collapsed structures. Military applications include mine countermeasures and stealth operations, for example, deployed from a submarine, transiting through open water, moving inland via rivers or sewer pipes, onto shore and then overland, even climbing stairs or other structures. Sensors or ordinance packages could be stealthily deployed en route. The vehicle could swim to a predetermined site, bury itself, and remain on station for extended periods collecting data or awaiting further instructions. The snake mechanism also has important commercial potential as a serpentine robotic manipulator in industrial and underwater applications. Deep Ocean Engineering has a proven ability to commercialize technology developed in its SBIR projects.

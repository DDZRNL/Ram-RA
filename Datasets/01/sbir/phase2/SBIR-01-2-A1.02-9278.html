<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA is concerned with the prevention of hazardous and accident conditions in transport aircraft and is interested in the mitigation of passenger injuries in accident conditions. Aircraft seats can significantly contribute to the safety of the passengers by restraining them and providing protection in the event of crashes. <br><br>An innovative transport aircraft passenger seat concept for superior occupant protection, meeting all structural requirements used in typical seat designs was developed in the Phase I program. This was accomplished with the use of new energy-absorbing structural members and precise control of seat deformation characteristics. Foster-Miller developed an innovative design using the integrated advanced dynamic finite element modeling technique for the seat, occupants, restraints and energy absorbing elements.  Results from certification tests on an existing seat design were used to validate the analytical model. <br><br>The Phase II program will focus on the optimization and detailed design of this new aircraft seat, including the injury-reduction features. Testing and verification of designs based on the new approach will be conducted. Manufacturing issues and costs will be also addressed.  The design will conform to the SAE certification standards for aircraft passenger seats. (P-020417)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
This project is directly relevant in the design and manufacturing of high performance aircraft seats. This technology can be adapted in other fields such as automobiles and locomotives to protect passengers and train crew.<br>

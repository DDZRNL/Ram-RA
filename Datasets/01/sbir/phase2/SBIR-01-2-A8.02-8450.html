<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal describes an innovative, high-efficiency, compact<br>combustor for lean-premixed, low-emissions gas turbine systems and<br>responds directly to NASA's request for "Innovative technologies<br>relating to combustion processes, including fuel injectors, piloting,<br>flameholding techniques for increased and performance and decreased<br>emissions" under SBIR topic A8.02. The concept is based on previously<br>demonstrated means for creating high mixing rate regions using multiple<br>discrete axial vortices in the flow. This injector-mixer-flameholder<br>shows promise for emissions reduction by ensuring rapid and complete,<br>well controlled mixing. Another goal is an axial-vorticity fuel<br>injection, mixing, and flame stabilization design that passively<br>controls combustion instability and flashback by making the combustion<br>region insensitive to axial flow oscillations. During previous work APRI<br>has demonstrated the ability to stabilize flames in a geometry designed<br>to provide open three-dimensional separations. In the Phase I effort the<br>ability to control mixing rates in geometry directly suitable to gas<br>turbine combustors was demonstrated. Conceptual designs for combustors<br>based on this technology are presented. The Phase II effort will take<br>advantage of the axial vorticity mixers and flame stabilizers to<br>complete the design and test of a lean-premixed<br>fuel-injector/flame-holder for gas turbine systems.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The axial-vorticity fuel-injector/flame-holder system described in this<br>proposal is applicable to a wide variety of combustion systems. Aircraft<br>gas turbines, industrial gas turbines, gaseous waste incinerators, and<br>other industrial burners can benefit from the high mixing rate and flame<br>stability characteristics of this design.

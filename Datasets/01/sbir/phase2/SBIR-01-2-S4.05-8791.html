<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Highly-sensitive linear spin-valve sensors combined with NVE's patented GMR isolator technology will be used to develop miniature, low power, high speed,  radiation-hard, digital isolator devices for space and other commercial applications.  The proposed linear mode spin-valve digital isolators will overcome the shortcomings of the present latching mode spin-valve digital isolators. The devices can be designed to work either in the unipolar mode or bipolar mode. If operating in the unipolar mode,   the devices will not only be fully pin-for-pin compatible with optocouplers but also have superior performance with regard to   cost,  size, power consumption (<35 mW), bandwidth (DC to 1 GHz)  and radiation tolerance.  If operating in the bipolar mode, the devices will significantly improve NVE's present latching mode digital isolators with  much faster speed (>400Mbd) and  at least 80% less power consumption.  This Phase II proposal is directed towards designing, fabricating and optimizing single/multi-channel  digital signal isolator devices.   The linear spin-valve sensors used in these devices will be based on the Phase I result. Prototype, radiation hard, low power, high speed, miniature digital isolator devices, that meet space and other commercial requirements will be demonstrated, and these prototypes will be ready for Phase III commercialization.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed technique will significantly improve and expand NVE's magnetic signal isolator products. The success of this project will   enable NVE to not only fabricate low power, high speed, miniature (single/multi-channel) digital signal isolators for a variety of applications but also gain competitive advantage over other isolator technologies in the commercial market.  <br><br>Keywords: spin-valve, radiation hard,   digital isolator, magnetics, sensor<br>

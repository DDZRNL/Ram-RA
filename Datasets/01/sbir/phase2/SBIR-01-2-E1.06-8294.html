<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
XCom Wireless proposes to develop a micromachined interconnect technology for the broad-band low-loss transfer of RF energy between substrates.  This interconnect design will improve the performance of hybrid RF MEMS sub-systems that use separate substrates for RF circuitry and actuator fabrication.  MEMS relays will be assembled and packaged using the interconnect in order to determine the effectiveness of the technology for improving mm-wave performance.  XCom Wireless expects RF MEMS relays to be fundamental components of future multi-band, high-performance, low-cost antenna systems, proposing the design, prototype, and testing of this interconnect technology.  XCom Wireless is presently developing a new type of RF MEMS relay under Department of Defense contracts, which promises superior reliability to that of competing RF MEMS development efforts.  The XCom Wireless vision is to enable the design of modular, multi-functional, high-performance antennas, for a dramatic reduction in system cost, weight, volume and power consumption.  Within such a vision, the specific needs of NASA remote sensing programs can be furthered; upon the completion of this Phase II program, the results of interconnect technology development will form an important foundation for low cost mm-wave systems capable of high performance and functionality.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
<br>The benefit of RF MEMS based subsystems to the commercial marketplace is significant, in that the markets for high performance RF components and subsystems are large and growing at 35% yearly.  The test and instrumentation community, the aerospace communications and radar community, and the defense wireless system developers have been identified as the first adopters of RF MEMS technology, with relevant MEMS-enabled sales expected to grow to over $75 million in 2005.  Consumer markets for RF MEMS include fixed broadband data link equipment, wireless LAN hardware, and civilian handsets and PDA?s, and are anticipated to reach, $1.4 billion in 2005 with combined sales of MEMS components, subsystems, and RFICs incorporating MEMS<br>

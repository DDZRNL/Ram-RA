<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Electrostatic charging can damage spacecraft, cause instrument biases that limit the accuracy of scientific measurements, and poses a direct hazard to personnel during extravehicular activity. There are now few options available for monitoring spacecraft charge. An inexpensive, compact, reliable, easily deployed spacecraft charge monitor is needed. Goembel Instruments has developed just such an instrument - the Spacecraft Charge Monitor (SCM). In Phase I we built and tested a prototype SCM. Results from Phase I show that the SCM will revolutionize the field of spacecraft charge detection. The 500 gram, 1 Watt, instrument will be able to determine spacecraft floating potential to within 0.1 volt for each second in flight. The SCM's performance represents an order of magnitude improvement over what is available now. In Phase II we will advance the SCM from laboratory prototype to flight prototype. We will develop flight electronics, a flight sensor head, calibrate the instrument, put it through a series of tests for flight worthiness, and deliver the fully tested flight instrument and documentation to NASA. The Phase II work will produce an SCM for flight tests, and will prepare us for the Phase III production of instruments.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
There are three markets in aerospace for use of the SCM: 1) scientific use in low earth orbit, 2) use for the detection of hazardous charge, and, 3) use for the detection of charge in the solar wind. We have already made a significant advance into the first market. The SCM has been included in one of two proposals now pending for the NPOESS satellite system. If funded, $3-5 million would be available for the production of the Goembel Instruments SCM starting as early as late 2002. We expect continued success in marketing the instrument to both the private sector and the Government (for all three uses given above). For instance, the SCM would excel at monitoring the floating potential of the International Space Station, which charges to dangerously high levels. The SCM could be used on its own to warn of high levels of charge or it could be used in conjunction with a discharge device to reduce charge. The relatively modest expenditure by NASA in Phase II would do a great deal to advance the state of the art in spacecraft charge sensing and make an inexpensive, compact, reliable spacecraft charge monitor available to all.

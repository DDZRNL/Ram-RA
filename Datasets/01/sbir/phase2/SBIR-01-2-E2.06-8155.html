<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Distributed spacecraft systems with enhanced formation flying (EFF) technology for onboard constellation and formation control will enable large numbers of spacecraft to be managed with a minimum of ground support.  EFF facilitates a ?virtual platform? concept which lowers total mission risk, increases science data collection and adds considerable mission flexibility.  The requirement to act as a unified information system places requirements on the system architecture that go above an beyond what is required for traditional systems. <br>We propose a software based infrastructure that facilitates dependable formation and operation of distributed real-time control systems with several innovations that advance the state of the art in distributed systems technology and sensor webs. These innovations include: 1) cold start algorithms that allow for autonomous, dependable system organization and formation, 2) distributed on-line configuration control, monitoring and health assessment processes that operate in concert across the entire system allowing for coordinated system operation, 3) a multi-level scheduling approach that allows for distributed control elements to be responsive to local events and to participate in system wide coordinated operations and 4) a robust fault/error model that accounts for arbitrary fault/error cases and anomalies, thereby providing superior fault tolerance, particularly for Single event Upsets (SEUs). <br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
As distributed real-time systems move toward network centric architectures, the demand for dependable clustering capabilities multiply appreciably. Distributed clustering   technology is at the threshold of market definition in  commercial  wireless, avionics, automotive, industrial, medical and ecommerce, and in distributed system/testbed/simulation applications. It has recognized applications for a wide spectrum of distributed information processing systems that are the basis for the information age.   <br>Distributed clustering architectures of significant scale are fairly recent and have not yet matured to the point where they offer appropriate dependability and real-time performance. In  avionics (both military and commercial) alone, the market value is projected to be sufficient to establish a viable business case. In addition to this market, WWTG also foresees significant opportunities in automotive and truck fleet markets where there is interest in architecture concepts for expediting traffic flow, and now safety for highways and  critical access areas. WWTG's strategy for entering this market is based on using its extensive experience and strong background in successful fault tolerant systems developments translated into dependable distributed cluster technology applied to targeted, viable commercial markets. <br>

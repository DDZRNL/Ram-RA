<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In the first phase of this SBIR, Long Lived Solar Concentrator for Space Power, NAS3-02031, L?Garde has focused on development of inflatably deployed rigidizable parabolic reflectors for space based solar power.  L?Garde has proposed the novel approach of utilizing an inflated solar concentrator for the high precision requirements of solar propulsion, then rigidizing the reflector and jettisoning the canopy to provide long term solar concentration for space power generation at lower concentration levels. The concept of rigidizing a reflector for space solar concentration was demonstrated by rigidizing a 1m-diameter aluminum laminate reflector and achieving an excellent surface precision of 0.80 mm RMS.  Through fabrication and test of high quality test articles, the relative merits of two reflector rigidization concepts, Sub Tg and Aluminum Laminate, were demonstrated and compared.  L?Garde strongly recommends proceeding to a Phase II effort, and has developed a comprehensive analysis and test plan to build on the successes of Phase I.  L?Garde?s unique mix of skills, experience, design tools, and test hardware will ensure the greatest chance of bringing this very important technology to fruition.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The commercial applications for rigidizable reflector/concentrator concept are many.  The lightweight and simplicity of the concept, coupled with the reliability of inflatable deployment, will be used in the fields of solar propulsion and deep space power generation.  Further, the rigidized reflector can be utilized in the RF spectrum for space based radar, communications, radiometry, earth mapping, and with some further development possibly even optics.  Relevant testing in a simulated space environment will significantly raise the technology readiness levels of these technologies, and give the confidence needed for incorporation of inflatably deployed rigidizable reflectors into America?s space programs.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In our Phase I effort we demonstrated the feasibility of developing agent-based software for the simulation of NAS that (i) uses of extensions of UML to represent and agents and its interactions/protocols (ii) leverages research in verification of finite state machines to verify the agent protocols and  (iii) automatically generates code for execution on IAI?s agent infrastructure, OpenCybele.   The approach is based on a software engineering perspective that draws on ideas and recent developments in multi-agent systems, and ongoing work at IAI on multi-agent systems, which includes the development of DIVA, an agent-software verification tool, and Cybele. Having demonstrated feasibility, our Phase II effort will focus on developing a software prototype of the DIVA CASE tool for UML-based design, verification and automatic code generation of multiagent software for agent-based simulations of NAS. Our Phase II tasks include (i) development of a library of NAS agent interaction protocols that are AUML and FIPA ACL compliant (ii) extensions of the Phase I verification approach to protocol verification (iii) integration of the software with Rational Rose and (v) test and validate the case tool with NASA?s agent-based modeling and simulation Software being developed under the ATMSDI effort.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
A UML-based CASE tool for software verification and validation of scalable complex multi-agent systems will be developed in this SBIR Phase II effort. To ensure industry wide acceptance, the tool will be developed as an add-on to Rational Rose and will be compliant with OMG and AUML industry standards. To ensure successful technology transfer in our Phase II effort, Rational Software Corporation, the developers of Rational Rose, will team with us as our commercialization partner. Partnering with Rational in our gives us access to a Rational customer base of 52,000 users. In addition, in this growing market of distributed multi-agent micro-simulation applications such as Air Traffic Control Simulation, Ground Transportation, Robotics and supply-chain integration, immediate customers for this tool exist in both the Government and Commercial Sectors. In the government sector our primary customer will be NASA, USDOT and DOD. In the commercial sector customers include spacecraft, air-traffic control, process control and manufacturing companies.

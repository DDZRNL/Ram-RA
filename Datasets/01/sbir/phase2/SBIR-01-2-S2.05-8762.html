<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
SSGPO proposes the development of a fracture tough reaction bonded silicon carbide (RB SiC) composite for lightweight space-based optical instruments.  The combination of visible quality SiC optics and a fracture tough SiC structure will result in athermal operation for demanding environments.  The new structural composite has material properties approaching those of reaction bonded SiC (high specific stiffness and thermal stability), ability to be formed into near-net shapes and the durability of a composite.  Phase I showed the viability of a composite that combines a novel, low-cost fiber coating process developed in conjunction with the University of Illinois-Chicago and Drexel University with our reaction bonded SiC.  This combination provides three critical discriminators for SiC structural materials: (1) low-cost fabrication (fraction of the cost of CVI process) and scaleability, (2) the ability to achieve complex shapes using the inherent near net shape forming of RB SiC and (3) material properties that are well matched to RB SiC while providing increased durability.   In Phase II SSGPO will optimize the SiC/SiC composite process and demonstrate this process by building an optical bench for delivery to NASA.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Low-cost, high specific stiff, high thermal stability SiC/SiC composites have applications in both military and commercial markets.  The material properties enable high performance monolithic space-based optical instruments.  Low-cost/scalable processing provides a solution for high-end E-O tactical applications where multiple units need to be produced cost effectively.  Moving SiC into commercial markets where cost is a driving factor will benefit from the successful completion of this Phase II effort including high speed stages and support structures for the semiconductor industry and high-temperature applications where SiC composites provide the only solution.

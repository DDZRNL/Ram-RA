<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This project addresses the development of high performance evaporators for loop heat pipes (LHP) or capillary pumped loops.  Thermal management of future high-power laser instrumentation will require power dissipation of 2-5 kW at heat fluxes beyond 100 W/cm2.  Although localized heat fluxes as high as 100 W/cm2 have been demonstrated using bi-disperse wicks, the maximum average heat flux capability of present LHP evaporators is an order of magnitude lower.  Cooling high heat flux loads with present technology would necessitate the use heat spreaders, which would substantially increase the thermal resistance and weight of the system. <br><br>We propose an evaporator configuration that can operate at average heat fluxes an order of magnitude larger, and thermal resistances an order of magnitude lower than present LHP evaporators. A novel fabrication approach enables vapor/liquid distribution networks to maximize capillary pumping and substantially reduce liquid and vapor flow pressure drops. Phase I proof-of-concept tests and scoping analyses demonstrated the feasibility and performance potential of the proposed evaporator.  In Phase II we will develop the evaporator technology through a combination of modeling, fabrication trials, and separate effects tests.  We will then demonstrate the technology by designing, fabricating, and testing a prototype LHP incorporating the proposed evaporator. <br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The principal commercial application for this technology is cooling of high heat flux electronics.  The three areas with the highest thermal dissipation challenges are: diode-pumped lasers, solid-state power conversion devices, and high-end microprocessors.  All three are areas of high market growth.  They are also areas where thermal management is a high value-added component.  Better heat dissipation would enable higher power lasers, higher power and more compact electric drives, and higher device density and speed microprocessors.

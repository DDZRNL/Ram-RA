<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Success in recent high-speed multi-level spatial light modulator (SLM) developments has led to a desire for increased resolution at these high frame rates.  Applications such as optical correlation, holographic storage, and multi-spot beam-steering would all benefit from the development of a very high-resolution high-speed multi-level SLM.  Today Boulder Nonlinear Systems (BNS) offers several high-speed liquid crystal SLMs custom designed for use in high-end optical systems.  The most advanced SLM is our 512x512 pixel multi-level SLM that can operate at frame rates exceeding 1000-Hz.  However, many applications require even higher resolution to maximize the processing gain achieved from the highly parallel nature of the SLM.  BNS proposes to develop a multi-level 1024x1024 SLM with 5-micron pixels and 1000-Hz frame rate.  In Phase I, BNS developed a conceptual design for the system.  The Phase II effort completes the development by fabricating and testing the 1024x1024 SLM system.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
BNS has built substantial business around our SLMs because we designed them exclusively for phase and amplitude encoding instead of manipulating intensity as would a display device.  This focus results in devices with superior performance for non-display applications.  With the successful completion of the proposed Phase II effort, we will be in a position to offer this 1024x1024 multi-level SLM as a product, the likes of which cannot currently be found anywhere.  Potential customers that have shown interest in this development include those in laser-tweezer microscopy, optical correlation, holographic storage, beam steering, high-speed printing and atmospheric correction.

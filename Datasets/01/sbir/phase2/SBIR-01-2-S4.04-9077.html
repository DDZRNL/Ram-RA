<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Space rigidizable and deployable structures with ultra-lightweight, high rigidity, and space durability are desirable to improve the reliability and affordability of space structures. Some of the components currently in use like shelters or space stations use double-walled thick films with high internal pressure.  All these hollow components are often vulnerable in space because debris and meteorites can strike them.  They will lose their functions if hit and damaged by foreign objects. We propose to fill the cavities of these hollow components with an ultra-lightweight cold hibernated elastic memory (CHEM) or a shape memory polymer (SMP) foam that can rigidize the space structure in space so that it can maintain its functions even when struck by debris. In our phase I research, we have successfully processed ultra-lightweight microcellular CHEM foams using an environmentally friendly technique. These microcellular CHEM foams have much higher mechanical properties than those processed by the conventional techniques.  We have also performed tests and proved that the microcellular CHEM foams did recover their original shapes after compaction and stowage.  This capability allowed them to be packed into a very small volume, recover their shapes and be rigidized in space, thereby considerably reducing the launching cost yet providing high rigidity for space structures.   The objectives proposed in the Phase I work plan have been accomplished.  In this Phase II research we will scale-up the processing of the microcellular CHEM foams, further reduce their density, and optimize their mechanical properties as well as processing conditions.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Potential Phase III NASA applications include space structures like boom and support structures for Gossamer structures, rover subsystems like wheels, chasis, insulation boxes, masts, solar array deployment devices, shelters and hangars for space habitats, airlocks, electronics boxes, tanks/shells/shields, solar arrays, radar boards, and support structures for telecommunication subsystems like struts and beams, etc. Commercial applications include satellite structures, and medical components like artificial muscles and organs, drug-delivery devices, chemical valves, and actuators. A team of medical devices investigator and manufacturer has made a statement that our microcellular SMP foams have a large potential to be used in endovascular devices especially in the treatment of aneurysms. The proposed microcellular SMP foams may solve or alleviate the cerebral vascular accident (AVC) or stroke problem that is the third cause of death and the principal cause of long-term disability in the United States.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed project will create a novel system for using medical instruments in a wireless network.  A unique, highly innovative system architecture is proposed.  This work is made possible by the new low-cost wireless networking technology called Bluetooth.  Bluetooth makes it commercially feasible for low-cost portable devices to be connected in a true wireless network.  This enabling technology will have a long-term impact on future medical systems.  By adding Bluetooth wireless connectivity to standard medical instruments such as a pulse oximeter, electrocardiograph, or blood pressure monitor, a highly flexible medical data acquisition system can be constructed for managing medical data in the clinic, small doctors office, emergency medical, or homecare environments.  Such a system will lower costs, improve safety, and make possible new monitoring modalities.  The proposed innovation is highly relevant to space medicine and health care systems since many of the improvements address the specific needs of remote diagnosis and treatment.   In phase II the software architecture and Bluetooth enabled medical instruments will be developed and integrated into an existing commercially successful medical system.  FDA approval will be obtained and a new commercial system will resultcommercial production.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The commercial potential of Bluetooth enabled medical devices is significant.  The inherent modularity of the approach and the specific features of Bluetooth make it an attractive option for medical instrumentation system designers.  Advanced Medical Electronics (AME) will team with QRS Diagnotic, LLC (QRS) to introduce the proposed technology into the commercial marketplace.  AME has worked with QRS in the past to develop PC Card (formerly PCMCIA Card) modular medical instrumentation.  Modular forms of medical instrumentation take functions such as pulse oximetry, ECG, blood pressure, spirometry, etc. and allow them to plug into a wide variety of handheld and portable computers.  This modularity is very attractive to customers because it allows the user interface components of the system, typically a PC or PDA, to be upgraded without having to replace the measurement specific components of the system.  In phase II, QRS will put the designs completed by AME into production.  The QRS position in the marketplace will allow them to quickly commercialize the products developed under this proposed SBIR.  This will assure NASA a low cost source of Bluetooth wearable modular medical instrumentation after the phase II project is complete.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The innovation is a small, highly efficient, long life, low mass free-piston Stirling engine for low power applications. This machine is innovative because in addition to its small mass and physical dimensions it is anticipated to have 35 percent higher efficiency than engines now being considered by NASA. The proposed machine is expected to have 32 percent efficiency at a temperature ratio of 2.35 . Analysis work under the Phase I effort is intended to verify the projected efficiency, size, and the ability to manufacture such a unit. Fabrication, testing and development would be carried out under the Phase II effort.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Commercial applications for a small Stirling engine/alternator are numerous.  Anywhere a battery can be found, the Stirling engine is a candidate to replace it. The interest in this area stems from the extremely low energy density of batteries compared to liquid fuels.  For example gasoline has approximately 300 times the energy density of a Ni-Cd battery and about 140 times the energy density of a Lithium-Ion battery.  An efficient small engine combined with a liquid fuel source would thus act as a highly energy dense replacement for batteries. A second replacement category is that of current fuel fired devices such as thermoelectric power generators and small internal combustion engine portable generators in cases where such power sources are used because of their non-dependency on power grids rather than the higher powers they are capable of producing.  Some of the major applications for our proposed unit include:<br>> Uninterruptible power supply.<br>> LED based portable traffic lights and safety signs.<br>> Soldier!|s power source.<br>> Power source for controls of a non-electrically connected furnace.<br>> Recreational remote power source.<br>> Laptop computer power source.<br>> Cordless (large) battery charger.<br>

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Radatec has demonstrated that a radar/microwave sensor can be used to measure the dynamics of turbine fan blades.  The sensor was designed for function in harsh environments (+2500  F) of the combustor section.  An alpha prototype was built and data were collected on a turbine simulator.  The proposed Phase II project seeks to take this technology to the next step- a commercial product running on actual turbine engines providing new and useful information to turbine operators.  <br><br>In Phase II, technical goals are to optimize the sensor antenna, construct a 35.0 GHz radar subsystem, and built an antenna fitting that will mount the sensor to a turbine engine through existing holes in gas turbines.  Finally, a hardened beta prototype sensor will be built and tested on a General Electric F404 turbofan engine.  The end result of Phase II will be a tested beta prototype that Radatec will market to industrial and government users.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
There is a strong unsatisfied need in the marketplace for robust, high bandwidth sensors that can gather data directly from the combustor section of a turbine engine.  Existing engine health monitoring systems do not provide useful measurements of engine health, because they cannot pinpoint causes of damage- and often provide warnings of damage late.  This technology offers a compelling value proposition to operators by allowing them to safely increase there scheduled maintenance interval, thereby reducing cost and downtime. <br><br>Land-based power producing gas turbine engines and aircraft engines are both being targeted as the first markets for the sensor.  The market for land-based turbines is estimated at $56-100 million per year with the aircraft market estimated at an addition $75-$150 million per year.  Land-based turbines will be the point of entry into the market due to their lower reliability, and more immediate impact on an electric utility?s bottom line.  As active blade tip clearance aircraft engines become more prevalent, the Radatec sensor has the potential to improve cruising fuel efficiency by 1-2%.

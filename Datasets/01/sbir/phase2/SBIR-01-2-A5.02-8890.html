<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The project concerns the development of magnesium composites with advanced anodized coatings for improved corrosion and wear resistance.  Coating production and the properties obtained are significant improvements over previous surface treatments for magnesium.  In Phase I, over eighty experiments were conducted in the anodization of magnesium alloys and composites. Variables examined through these experiments include: voltage, electrolyte, temperature, magnesium alloy, cathode geometry, and time.  Comparison of the coatings was conducted using microscopy, chemical analysis, and corrosion and wear tests.  Four magnesium composites were obtained containing two different base alloys and four reinforcement phases (B4C, SiC, Al2O3, and carbon fiber).  Anodization of two composites produced excellent coatings.  The other two composites were shown to be incompatible with coating methods to resist corrosive environments.  These results justify the goals of the project to identify appropriate magnesium composites and make them corrosion and wear resistant and eliminate from contention inappropriate materials.  On completion of Phase II, the goals and objectives met will include a database will exist of known and tested anodized magnesium composites.  The deliverables include anodized magnesium composite components produced and tested to NASA specifications for use in the reusable launch vehicle program. <br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Magnesium composites sell to industries who have special weight / wear or weight / strength requirements.  Applications for magnesium composites include the automotive, military, aerospace, recreational, and electronic industries.  Automotive uses include brake assemblies and pistons.  Recreational uses of magnesium composites include tools, boat motors, and bicycle components.  Potential government use of magnesium components include aerospace and military applications.  Military uses include tank treads, hardware structural components and electronics.  Aerospace applications are to be chosen part by part based on weight savings, and desired component physical properties.  The P.I. of this project patented a process for anodizing magnesium alloys.  The patent was assigned to a joint venture company which has gone on to license the technology in thirteen countries.  The P.I. was part of the marketing and sales team that developed the patented process into a commercially viable process.  The U.S. licensee of the previous patent is anticipated to be the conduit for further U.S. development and negotiations towards that end are underway.<br>

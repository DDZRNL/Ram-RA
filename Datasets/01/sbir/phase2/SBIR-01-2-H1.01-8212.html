<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to design, build, and deploy a Toolkit for Enabling Adaptive Modeling and Simulation (TEAMS).  The proposed solution uses a process-centered approach to automatically reconfigure and optimize space transportation system operations analysis models.  Because it operates over the Internet, the TEAMS solution will be platform independent and enable collaborative space transportation system operations modeling and analysis over geographically dispersed locations.  The technical viability of the approach was established in Phase I by designing and prototyping an adaptive analysis tool that facilitates collaborative design of future NASA spaceport operations processes.  The Phase II effort will implement the innovation on two focused NASA operations analysis applications and rapidly commercialize the research results.  Central Phase II products include (i) TEAMS software applications, (ii) re-configurable spaceport operations modeling framework, and (iii) scalable operations analysis knowledge repository.  Key innovations include (i) a process-centered approach that maximizes re-use of domain knowledge for rapid operations analysis model development, (ii) open-architecture, distributed, plug and play architecture that allows for mass customization and rapid deployment of TEAMS tools in multiple application problems, and (iii) novel, simulation-based optimization mechanisms that facilitate risk minimization through exploration of a large number of spaceport design configurations at reduced cost.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The first application of TEAMS will be to provide a model-based infrastructure for quickly and cost-effectively developing, maintaining and reconfiguring operations analysis models with NASA space transportation system designers.  Other NASA TEAMS applications include space transportation systems analysis and design, spaceport process and infrastructure design, spaceport decision support systems, spaceport performance optimization, and virtual spaceport prototyping and validation. TEAMS commercial applications include air transportation system design, airport systems analysis and design, supply chain analysis and design, simulation-based acquisition, and virtual systems prototyping.

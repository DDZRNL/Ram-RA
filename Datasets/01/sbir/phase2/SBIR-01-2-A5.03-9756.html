<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
HyPerComp Engineering, Inc. proposes to develop filament wound composite pressure vessels with superior low and high velocity impact resistance as well as improved high temperature (fire) survivability. <br><br>The current generation of high performance filament wound composite pressure vessels as utilized in solid propellant propulsion, space craft energy storage systems, launch tubes, self contained breathing apparatus, and other demanding applications utilize carbon fibers in order to obtain a high performance to weight ratio.  While the impressively high tensile strength of these fibers provides for light weight pressure vessels, the resulting thin wall thickness combined with carbon fiber?s sensitivity to ?bruising? can result in significant risk of impact damage.  Even relatively light and difficult to detect impacts can potentially degrade the capability of these pressure vessels.<br><br>HyPerComp Engineering has recently completed a Phase I SBIR through NASA, MSFC  demonstrating significant improvement in impact resistance in high performance pressure vessels (NAS8?01146).  The effort proposed herein builds upon that knowledge, expands it into higher energy levels, and incorporates heat resistant materials currently under evaluation at NASA, MSFC to develop a ?next generation? filament wound pressure vessel with significant improvements in both high and low velocity impact capability as well as improved fire resistance<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Both military and aerospace pressure vessel applications where high performance and mission reliability are required are natural targets for the technology proposed for development herein.  Similarly the commercial pressure vessel industry, while not requiring quite as high of performance, is always keenly aware of any technology that might make the product safer.  These seemingly separate but demanding industries are always searching for improvements in performance and safety with regard to pressure vessels.  The demonstrated technology has the potential of taking both attributes to a new level.<br><br>In the aerospace market composite pressure vessels are relied upon for both performance (low weight) and reliability.  The thin walled nature of these high performance pressure vessels make them susceptible to impact damage, often undetectable impact damage.  An improvement in damage tolerance with little to no performance sacrifice is of significant worth and should be readily marketable either through the sale of specific hardware or the licensing of specific technology. <br><br>Likewise there are many commercial applications where pressure vessels are used in demanding applications.  An improved, significantly lighter yet extremely rugged SCBA cylinder would be viewed as a significant improvement in safety and would find a significant market niche for demanding applications.<br>

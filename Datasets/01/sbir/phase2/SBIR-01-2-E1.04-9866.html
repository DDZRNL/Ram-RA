<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary goal is to develop and market a new class of heterodyne receivers that take advantage of our proprietary GaAs-on-dielectric integrated circuit fabrication process and our innovative mixer and multiplier circuit designs. These receivers will cover full waveguide bands without tuning, require no DC bias and will be ultra compact. In Phase I we successfully demonstrated i) the basic circuit designs, ii) the elimination of isolators in the multiplier chains, iii) full waveguide bandwidth and iv) the critical dimensions necessary for the fabrication of a terahertz mixer. The focus of Phase II will be the demonstration of a highly compact receiver for the frequency band from 750 GHz through 1,050 GHz. A single waveguide block will house the integrated subharmonically pumped mixer circuit and an integrated doubler/tripler multiplier chain. This block will have an input connection for a 75 GHz local oscillator, a horn antenna for the RF signal and a coaxial connector for the IF output. The prototype receiver will be delivered to NASA GSFC for use on the Conical Scanning Submillimeter-wave Imaging Radiometer for the study of ice crystals in cirrus clouds.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
When we think about the long-term future of terahertz technology we envision the breadth and scope of the microwave and infrared industries. Although the terahertz band has its unique and often formidable challenges, it is inherently just as useful as the frequency bands above and below. It is only a matter of time and effort before the terahertz technology base becomes mature enough to allow this band to be fully exploited. VDI was formed to make this evolution occur sooner rather than later. This proposal will foster the development of terahertz components that cover complete waveguide bands without mechanical tuners or dc bias. They also use integrated circuits, so that assembly is much easier and more precise. This greatly increases reliability and repeatability and thereby reduces costs. Our customers include atmospheric researchers, radio astronomers, chemical spectroscopists, and nuclear and solid-state physicists. We also gain support from researchers developing next generation electron paramagnetic resonance imaging systems, high data rate point-to-point communications, millimeter-wave radars above 100 GHz, submillimeter-wave test equipment including vector network analyzers, and the detection and monitoring of chemical and biological toxins for military and commercial food processing applications. Each of these applications will benefit from the proposed SBIR research.

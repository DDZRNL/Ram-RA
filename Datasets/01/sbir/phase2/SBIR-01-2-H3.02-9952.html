<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Energy efficient, cost effective, cryogenic distribution system (up to several miles) is strongly commanded for spaceport and in-space cryogenic systems.  The use of magnetic levitation by permanent magnets and high temperature superconductors (HTS) results in without mechanical contact and thus, the conduction part of the heat leak can be reduced to zero.  In Phase I, various magnetic suspensions, magnetic materials, insulations and mechanical stops for the cryo-maglev transfer line has been comprehensively investigated.  Two demo modules of the cryo-transfer line has been designed and constructed.  The cryogenic tests of the modules successfully demonstrate the vertical magnetic suspension, horizontal stability, and other important performances that have paved the solid ground for a Phase II project.  In phase II, further optimizations of the designs and performances of cryo-maglev transfer lines will be conducted analytically and experimentally to meet the KSC technical requirements.  The various warm supports (shape-memory-materials, bimetals, special magnetic structures, and special metal wires) will be studied.  Two full sized prototype transfer lines will be designed, constructed and cryogenic tested at KSC.  The proposed novel transfer line will provide potential of extending many missions, save cryogens, or reducing the overall launch mass to accomplish a given mission.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed energy efficient, cost effective cryogen transfer lines with magnetic levitation technologies are strongly demanded in a variety of applications including the transport of liquefied gases (N2, O2, H2, He and LNG) and in superconducting applications such as high temperature superconducting (HTS) power transmission lines.  These technologies can also be used in various cryogenic tanks and cryostats in storage of cryogens for many government facilities (NASA, DOE, DOD, TOD, etc.) and private sectors (LNG facilities, chemistry plants, Liquefied gases plant, etc.)<br><br>*Very high thermal performance transfer lines for NASA spaceport (up to several miles) and in space application<br>*The technologies developed in this project will also directly be used in cryotank and cryostat (many NASA missions)<br>*For liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen and liquid natural gas transportation industry of the future, LH2 powered cars, buses, planes and rockets<br>*Smaller rockets such as envisioned for on-orbit payload transfer operations or interplanetary propulsion<br>*Cryogen transfer line for super conducting accelerators and power cables industrials<br>*  These technologies can also be extended to other applications, which need magnetic levitations.<br>

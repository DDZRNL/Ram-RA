<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Light alloy composites are required for components for reusable launch vehicle airframes due to their improved strength to weight ratios.  This document proposes development of magnesium composites with advanced anodized coatings for improved corrosion and wear resistance.  These coatings will be produced by electrochemical treatment of magnesium composite components for use in aerospace, military, automotive and recreational applications.  Both the method of coating production and the properties obtained by the composites will be significant improvements over previous surface treatments for magnesium in terms of performance, economics, and environmental safety.  Magnesium components exposed to the environment are prone to corrosion.  This proposal concerns adaptation of a recently developed magnesium anodization process for composites which are exposed to corrosive environments.  This process builds a thick, dense coating on magnesium that has both excellent corrosion resistance and wear resistance.  Composites with the proposed coating system would be less expensive and demonstrate improved performance with a process has been proven environmentally sound.  Testing of the coatings will include wear resistance and salt spray testing.  Application of the anodization process will be tested on several  magnesium alloys as well as representative magnesium composites of AZ91 and Mg12Li with carbon fiber and alumina non-metallic second phases.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Benefits of the new coating system will be improved wear and corrosion resistance for magnesium alloys and composites.  Commercial applications include use of anodization on magnesium automotive components, recreational equipment, power tools, and industrial equipment exposed to harsh environments.

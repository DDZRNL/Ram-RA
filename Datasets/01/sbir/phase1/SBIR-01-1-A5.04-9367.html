<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The key innovation of this proposal is the design of a small intelligent sensor interface system for remote sensing based on Time Modulated Ultra-wideband (TM-UWB) Radio. With TM-UWB, radio communication is no longer by radio waves, but instead by impulses. Because only pulses are transmitted, and because there is no carrier frequency, there is no up conversion and no down conversion required, and the output stage is a single transistor which creates a binary pulse, all resulting in decreased radio size and complexity. Impulses in the time domain generate very wide bandwidth signals in the frequency domain. In order to make this wireless sensor interface architecture independent of any particular sensors, we will adopt IEEE 1451 standard for smart networked sensors. The first objective of Phase I is to design a TM-UWB module for transmitting sensor data to a control network. The size and configuration of the proposed transceiver will be appropriate for propulsion system testing. The second objective is to evaluate overall system issues. TM-UWB will support multiple non-interfering channels, which may be quite useful for collecting data from multiple sensors simultaneously. The third object is to make this wireless sensor transceiver an IEEE 1451 compatible Network Capable Application Processor (NCAP) device.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The primary application of TM-UWB is for use in a wireless local area net. TM-UWB will not be affected by multipath signals, will require minimal power, will allow high data rates, and the low frequency content of TM-UWB signals allows propagation through walls. TM-UWB also has very important applications in radar and position tracking. TM-UWB radar is low-cost, compact-size, low power-consumption compared to conventional radar. The position and tracking capability of TM-UWB devices make them perfect complement to the global positioning system. The US Army is already trying to use TM-UWB radio for live fire training, and NASA Johnson Space Center is also trying to use TM-UWB to track the location and posture of astronauts.

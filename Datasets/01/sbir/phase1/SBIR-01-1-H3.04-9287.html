<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The problem to be addressed in this work is the development of low cost, low-power, high-speed, and compact CMOS Active Pixel Sensor (APS) array for measuring electric potential and charge distribution close to its focal plane. In CMOS APS technology, an array of capacitors are used to store and separate photo-generated electrons in the pixel areas, and the charges are buffered off to the readout circuitry sequentially for further processing. Inherently these pixels could be modified to detect electric potentials close to the focal plane providing two dimensional (2D) electrical charges and potential distributions. In this Phase I project, we are proposing to investigate and develop such pixel sensor architectures, and circuits. The innovative charge and electric potential distribution detector technology is expected to be suitable for not only NASA applications but also many industrial and military applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
High-speed, low-power, and compact CMOS APS sensors sensitive to the charge and potential distribution close to the faceplate are expected to be of use in many scientific, commercial and space applications. Some of the current applications are fingerprint detection, machine vision, printed circuit board (PCB) inspection, neurobiological activity measurement and monitoring, and spacecraft monitoring. The proposed high-performance focal-plane-array with built-in analog and digital signal processing offers NASA unprecedented sensor functionality while lowering system cost and increasing system robustness. Developed sensor technology will strengthen the leading edge of Photobit in machine vision, and scientific sensor market and boost US competitiveness in the sensor market.

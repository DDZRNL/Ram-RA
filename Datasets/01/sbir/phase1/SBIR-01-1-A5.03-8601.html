<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
No timely and cost-effective methods now exist for the fabrication of thick-section (>=2"), continuous fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMCs).  Application of such CMCs can potentially enhance the efficiency and performance, reduce the weight, improve the durability, and lower the cost of aerospace propulsion systems, particularly those used in high temperature, high-stress environments.  Achieving these benefits requires development of matrix infiltration techniques capable of efficiently producing thick parts.  The quality of such parts will also depend on implementation of improved fiber/matrix interfaces and interface deposition techniques.  For many projected applications, carbon fibers are of particular interest as CMC reinforcements because they are relatively inexpensive, have higher strength and stiffness and lower density than oxide or non-oxide ceramic fibers, and retain their mechanical properties at very high temperatures.  The main drawback of carbon fibers, however, is their low oxidation resistance, which has prevented their extensive use in high temperature oxidizing environments.  Oxide interfaces can potentially impart sufficient protection, as well as provide other essential interface functions.  In previous work, Ultramet demonstrated a unique and innovative process for depositing oxide interfaces, specifically ultraviolet-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (UVCVD).  Ultramet has also successfully achieved rapid infiltration of carbide matrices within thin-section (<0.125") fiber preforms using an innovative melt infiltration process. In this project, Ultramet will combine UVCVD of oxide interface coatings with a modified, innovative variation of the melt infiltration process to demonstrate the feasibility of rapidly and cost-effectively producing thick-section (>=2"), highly refractory carbon fiber-reinforced silicon carbide matrix composites suited for selected aerospace applications such as rocket engine turbomachinery components.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The composite materials to be developed in this project combine innovative interface materials, novel interface deposition, and rapid infiltration of refractory matrices into thick-section components.  These components will have broad commercial applicability to a range of products, including rocket and aircraft engine turbomachinery components, recuperators, ducts, and other hot gas path components, process industry parts requiring high temperature capability and corrosive environment resistance (e.g. hot gas and liquid handling equipment) for extended periods, furnace structures, and high temperature filter elements.

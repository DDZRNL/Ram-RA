<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The objective of this program is to demonstrate novel solar cells with very high specific power densities (1000-5000 kW/kg) for generating power in a new generation of ultralight space payloads like the ARISE inflatable antenna. The cells will be based on high charge mobility, processible conjugated organic polymers with a unique dendritic "star" structure developed at EIC Laboratories. Solar cells will be fabricated based on emerging concepts of interpenetrating network donor-acceptor composites and on dye-sensitized nanoporous TiO2, both types on thin, light polymer substrates using low temperature processing conditions. Research to date indicates that >10% AM0 efficiency is a realistic goal for these cells, which promise exceptionally low manufacturing cost and good prospects for stability in the space environment over a broad temperature range. Polymer solar cells will enable inflatable solar arrays and sails that also incorporate electronic components and also electrochromic layers for thermal or photon momentum control.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed solar cells promise a revolutionary reduction in weight and manufacturing cost compared to current silicon technology, addressing the >$1 billion photovoltaic market. Commercial applications include large scale solar power generation, power supplies for electronics/instrumentation/consumer appliances, and for lightweight satellites and spacecraft.

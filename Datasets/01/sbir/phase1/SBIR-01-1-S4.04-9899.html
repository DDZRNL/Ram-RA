<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Significant modulation of solar reflectance, solar absorption, and IR emissivity can be achieved with electrochromic devices operating at very low voltages. They use very little energy and can maintain their state of solar reflectance, solar absorption, and IR emissivity for some time after the potential has been removed. Devices fabricated as a monolithic stack of solid state inorganic materials can withstand the harsh space environment. These kinds of Variable Electrochromic Membranes(VEMs), with no moving parts, are well suited for active thermal control of spacecraft and deployable aerospace membrane structures.
<br>The Phase I effort will produce 100cm2 VEMs on ultra-thin polymer substrates with an areal density of 7g/M2 or less, modulations of emittance from 0.1 to 0.5, and solar absorptance from 0.2 to 0.8. The optical, thermal, and electrical performance of these devices will be thoroughly characterized. Detailed calculations will be performed to predict the thermal performance of these electrochromic coatings. 
<br>In Phase II of this effort, samples of the electrochromic devices will be tested to determine their tolerance to high vacuum, UV light, and bombardment with energetic oxygen ions. The design will be optimized to improve performance, reliability, and durability in the space environment.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
There are three major areas for the potential commercialization of variable emissivity devices.  In the aerospace industry, they show promise for thermal management of satellites.  They can also be used for the dimensional stabilization of rigid space structure as well as for Gossamer structures.  A second application for electrochromics is for architectural glazings for solar control, especially when the films can be deposited on thin polymer sheets for the retrofit market.  There has also been interest in using electrochromics with fiberglass panes to improve energy efficiency in industrial buildings.  The third application for electrochromics is to provide for security and energy efficient applications on automobile windows and sunroofs.

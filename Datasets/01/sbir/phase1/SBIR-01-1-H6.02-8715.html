<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Integrated Video for Synthetic Vision project aims to create a unique software technology to seamlessly add real-time video capture to VisualFlight's proven combination of real time flight simulation performance and Geographic Information System (GIS) power.  While solutions exist to do this in hardware, they are ill suited to the flight deck environment for reasons of size and weight.  These hardware video mixer solutions are limited to analog video technology, and therefore do not provide the level of resolution offered by new generations of digital video cameras.  This project proposes to develop the first software only synthetic vision video overlay solution in that will be scalable to any video resolution, and which will have no weight or size impacts on cockpit design.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The Integrated Video for Synthetic Vision product will consist of a developer's license, a run-time license, documentation in both electronic and paper format, the software in the form of COM libraries and a sample application.  The licenses, electronic documentation, software and sample applications will be distributed on a CD-ROM.
<br>
<br>Integrated Video for Synthetic Vision commercial market consists of applications in aerospace, military and civilian aviation, military reconnaissance, robotic exploration, remote operations, immersive training and security monitoring.  RIS believes that COM/ActiveX architecture best serves the needs of this market because most segments of this market already have substantial investments in developing proprietary or classified software applications. Integrated Video for Synthetic Vision offers these customers easily integrated, encapsulated components to add to their existing software.

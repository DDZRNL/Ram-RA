<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose the Bone UltraSonic Scanner (BUSS) for bone conditions assessment that will offer unique capabilities in assessment of bone conditions during space flights. The device will detect changes in the composition and micro-architectural properties of bone.  BUSS will build on developments made by Artann Laboratories in the multi-parametric ultrasonic scanners for osteoporosis detection and acoustic pediatric osteometer for monitoring growth of long bones in children. Main features of BUSS technology are:
<br>?	Multi-parametric assessment of bone conditions based on measurements of multiple propagation parameters of longitudinal and flexural of acoustic waves;
<br>?	Multi-site examination of the skeleton, involving weight-bearing and non weight-bearing bones; and sites with variable proportion of trabecular and compact bone tissues
<br>?	Manual scanning mode allowing for simple and efficient self-examination guided by easy instructions.
<br>?	Hand-held design and ultracompact lightweight construction
<br>The device will allow robust, and sensitive data collection on structural and mechanical state of skeletal system by laypersons.  
<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The BUSS technology and device can also have a number of commercially important applications other than in-flight spacecraft use. Monitoring of the bone health conditions and changes caused by physical exercise can be an important issue in sports medicine and athlete?s training process. BUSS can be a novel tool to scientifically design, create and observe bone health characteristics and influence of physical exercise on changes in bone parameters. Assessment of bone conditions for military personnel on remote locations, naval expeditions and other extended-time remote missions may offer a non-invasive and effective way of health maintenance and early prevention of unwanted consequences of bone condition changes.

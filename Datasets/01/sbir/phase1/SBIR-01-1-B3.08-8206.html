<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Omnisite BioDiagnostics (OmniSite) proposes to develop a handheld fluorescence polarization (FP) reader for genetic microarrays to assess transcriptional changes in the genes of radiation-exposed astronauts.  The reader will be capable of extracting messenger RNA (mRNA) from the blood or other tissues of an astronaut and looking for changes in the transcription of radiation-associated genes such as p53 on commercially available microscope slide-based gene arrays.  Amplification of the RNA will be performed either by a variation of Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) or Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).  The advantage of using the FP mode of detection on the microarray is obviating the need for wash steps, thus making assays simpler and faster.  FP enables homogenous one-step assays without sacrificing sensitivity.
<br>
<br>In Phase I, OmniSite will provide proof-of-concept for the detection of mRNAs on a gene array using an FP breadboard setup.  OmniSite will also provide design parameters for a miniaturized handheld FP reader.  In phase II, OmniSite will construct the handheld FP reader and demonstrate its use on real animal blood samples.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The entire genomics area is exploding technologically and in terms of commercialization of readers and assays for a variety of genetic diseases.  In addition, pharmaceutical companies are very interested in pharmacogenomics (i.e., assessing the effects of drugs on gene transcription).  OmniSite?s handheld FP microarray reader will provide both the clinical and pharmaceutical industries a much needed handheld reader for assessment of transcriptional activity.

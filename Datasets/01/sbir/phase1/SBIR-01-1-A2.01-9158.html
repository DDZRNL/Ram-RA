<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposals describes a new approach to implementing computer simulations of NAS using software autonomous agents.  Each software agent is implemented as an independent entity with its own thread of control. This approach provides the ability to host the simulation on many computers, allows greater code reuse, is physically and logically scalable, and provides efficient and effective simulation of complex collaborative decision making. Another important benefit is that the agent paradigm for simulation allows the simulation to be gracefully enhanced, adding greater resolution to particular aspects of the simulation without affecting the remainder of the simulation.  Future NAS simulations will need to be able to model a wide range of requests and decision processes which will be made by pilots, AOCs, and Air Traffic Controllers as NAS evolves toward the greater flexibility of Free Flight.  Many important characteristics of the flow of aircraft will be emergent properties of the interaction of many flights, many companies, and many ATSPs.  Attempting to simulate complex situations without this realistic diversity will lose much of the  structure which is essential to understand.  The work herein proposed will lead to NAS simulations which can meet this objective.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
IAI has already achieved success in commercializing its work with software autonomous agents, and is nearing the release of its Diva product which will greatly simplify the use of this technology by others.  Software agents are also key to enterprise integration, which is becoming a cornerstone of e-commerce.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Schafer proposes to extend the performance of Silicon Lightweight Mirrors (SLMs) technology, an all silicon foam-core composite substrate, for use in the ultraviolet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavebands.  In Phase I, Schafer will design and manufacture a UV Demonstrator Mirror.  We will use a 127 mm diameter Offner Relay compatible concave-optic with a radius of curvature of 600 mm over a 102 mm clear aperture as our baseline design.  Our goal will be to produce an imaging mirror with a figure accuracy of 0.02 waves rms (1 wave = 633 nm) and a surface roughness of 1-2 nm rms.  Following figuring and finishing, the mirror will receive an aluminum coating.  Preliminary calculations indicate that a weight of 0.1 kg (areal density of 7-9 kg/m2) and first natural frequency of 12,000 Hz are obtainable for this size substrate.  The UV Demonstrator Mirror will serve as the prototype for a 70-75 cm diameter primary mirror to be produced in Phase II.  This full scale mirror would be suitable for the Jupiter Magnetosphere Explorer (JMEX) or KRONOS missions.  Such performance is also suitable for infrared applications such as NGST and FAIR (filled aperture infrared).

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Silicon Lightweight Mirrors (SLMs) technology represents both a cost and performance breakthrough for lightweight imaging mirrors operating in the ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet wavebands. The cost of SLMs is approximately 30% the cost of comparable lightweighted glass optics.  The technology has already been successfully demonstrated for infrared instrument applications, and is potentially suitable for the Next Generation Space Telescope program.  The technology currently has high visibility by NASA GSFC, NASA MSFC, and the United States Air Force and several of the major contractors, including Ball Aerospace, Boeing, TRW and Lockheed Martin.  It is envisioned that the next several technology demonstrations and scale-up of the technology will lead to numerous requests for quotation.  Consequently, the commercialization potential of SLMs technology is seen as very high.

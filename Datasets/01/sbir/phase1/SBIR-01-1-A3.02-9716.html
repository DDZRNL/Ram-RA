<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
        New and innovative ways to apply many of the newly developed, advanced materials are needed.  The proposed technology addresses this need by enabling an innovative thermal spray process for use with newly emerging ultraviolet (UV) and/or visible light-curable polyimides.  The technology combines a moderate amount UV/visible light radiation with other processing modes into a novel technology to spray polyimide powders without the use of solvents as neat polyimide films and coatings and as near-net-shape products.
<br>	The solventless spray, lay-up aspects of the proposed powder spray technology addresses the mandate that NASA has for producing Advanced Materials with Reduced Emissions.  The advanced materials that can be processed with this technology, UV/visible light-curable polyimides, have application in gas turbines, rocket and turbine based combined cycle engines. The technology enables a process for economical and reliable application of these advanced materials to fabricate light-weight jet engine components.
<br>	The Phase II project will result in a prototype system for application of UV/visible light curable polyimides and other polymers.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
        The technology is suitable for use in applying a broad range of commercially available thermoplastic and thermoset polymer powder materials as neat materials and as ?designer?, composites, nanocomposites, including  functionally graded coatings and composites.  Commercial applications that include adhesives, scratch resistant coatings, protective coatings, high elongation coatings, self-extinguishing coatings, circuit board coatings, electrically conductive coatings and electrical component potting applications.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Makel Engineering, Inc. (MEI) and Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) propose to develop self contained, autonomous, hydrocarbon gas detection sensor modules for use on flight research vehicles.  Flight testing of research vehicles such as the Hyper-X, and Future-X require the use of hazardous gas detection system to ensure flight safety.  There is a need for compact, easily deployed gas detection for hydrocarbon fuels that can be used for both ground and flight testing.  The proposed system is based on the use of advanced, micro-machined gas detection sensors capable of quantitative measurement of hydrocarbon based fuels.  Solid-state sensors for hydrocarbon and oxygen detection have recently been demonstrated by MEI and CWRU. We propose to develop a miniature, autonomous sensor modules using these sensor elements and integrated low power microelectronics.  The sensor modules will be capable of entirely self-contained operation with the option for battery power, on-board data storage, and wireless communications.  These sensor modules will require minimal installation and will be suitable for flight safety applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
A large commercial market exists for improved hydrocarbon gas sensors.  Sensors are needed for emission measurements for reciprocating engines (spark ignited and compression ignition) as well as for monitoring industrial processes.  Development of reformers to convert hydrocarbon fuels to hydrogen for use on fuel cells requires chemical sensors for process monitoring.  The future wide spread use of electric vehicles using fuel cells and gasoline or diesel feed stock will require low cost onboard hydrocarbon gas sensors.

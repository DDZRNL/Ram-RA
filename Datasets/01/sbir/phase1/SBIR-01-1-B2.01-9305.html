<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Gas sensors based on metal oxide sensing layers, are known to be widely used for the measurement of CO, CO2, aromatic hydrocarbon, NO2 etc., but such sensors lack selectivity in general, and operation at high temperatures is required. Arrays of sensors distinguished by their cross sensitivity have to be used where a certain degree of selectivity is obtained. The proposed program will focus on the use of highly organized ultrathin films of conducting polymers and their nanocomposites with high conductivity, which will selectively recognize the above gases with high sensitivity (#ppb). In Phase I, we will synthesize several high conductivity polymers which we will process using the supramolecular approach via the layer-by-layer self-assembly technique to fabricate the necessary films for gas sensing applications for the first time with emphasis on sensitivity and selectivity that are otherwise unattainable with other fabrication methods or materials. Regioregular polythiophene derivatives and their metal oxide nanocomposites will be used in this effort. Characterization of materials and films as well as detection characteristics will be achieved using several techniques, particularly electrochemistry. Phase II will focus on material and technique optimization towards prototype sensors that will be used for evaluation by NASA and for marketing purposes.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
With the expected high selectivity and low detection limit and versatility of the measurement procedure, our proposed program will result in simple low cost devices that will work independently of gravity and that can be easily miniaturized for the different applications. In addition to NASA?s gas sensing needs, such sensors can be of benefit to the automotive sector for detection of pollutant gases emanating from automobile exhaust.

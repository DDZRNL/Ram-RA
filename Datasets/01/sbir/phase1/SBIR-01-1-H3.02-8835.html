<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
ducts, and tubes with complicated shapes. Rotational molding of thermotropic liquid crystal (TLCP) resins has not yet been successfully demonstrated, and would significantly contribute to modern technology.  TLCP polymers are of interest in application to cryogenic propellant storage because of their low permeability, low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), excellent strength, and chemical inertness.  Development of rotationally molded TLCP resins addresses the aerospace industry's need for lightweight, low-cost components for propellant storage and transport lines in space vehicles.  TLCP tanks will potentially be suitable for use with several liquid rocket propellant systems, including liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide. Additionally, TLCP tanks are of interest for storage of lasing fluids such as fluorine, deuterium, and nitrogen trifluoride.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The technology of rotational molding of TLCPs will benefit a number of other aerospace applications such as lightweight engine components.  Furthermore, the technology will be readily transferable to a variety of domestic applications, including cryogenic storage of nitrogen and oxygen, automotive, chemical, and maritime industries.

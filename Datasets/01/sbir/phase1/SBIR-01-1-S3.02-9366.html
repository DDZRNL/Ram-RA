<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In this project, we will develop and test strategies for optimal path planning for formation flying applications under collision avoidance constraints. The overall approach will be primarily applied to the U-V mapping problem, but can be extended to a number of distributed spacecraft interferometry control problems. Phase I will focus on evaluating the feasibility of solving the optimal path planning problem using techniques based on Differential Flatness, Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI), and optimization tools for nonconvex constraints. Specific tasks include: (i) Development of simplified test cases; (ii) Development of trajectory generation algorithms; (iii) Test and tuning of the algorithms on candidate test cases; (iv) Development of plans for Phase II; and (v) Reports and Meetings. Phase II will involve (a) the extension of the proposed approach to other formation flying interferometry problems, (b) the development of a commercially viable toolbox for trajectory generation with collision avoidance constraints, and (c) the application to future multi-spacecraft missions. The development of the above core technologies will serve as a foundation for Phase III commercialization.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The commercial applications of this technology are enormous and exist in areas such as control of automated air traffic management systems, automated vehicle highway systems, chemical process control, power generation and distribution, C3I, manufacturing systems and computer-communication networks including Internet. NASA Space Science (ST3, ST5, TPF) and Earth Science Enterprises (EOS, NMP, ESTP) will directly benefit from this technology.

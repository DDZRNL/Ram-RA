<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Giner, Inc. will develop an ambient temperature, low-power proton-exchange membrane (PEM) sensor to detect 5-5000 parts per billion by volume of ethylene in air for plant environments. The platform technology will be the  Giner, Inc. PEM sensor with solid-state thick-film electrode fabrication techniques.  This gives a small, cost-effective, flow-independent probe with high sensitivity, low detection limit and rapid response. The innovation proposed is the development of novel techniques for depositing a thin layer of the PEM on the thick-film sensing electrode in a geometry that extends the active sensing region to further increase signal-to-noise ratio. Selection of the catalytic electrode and operating potential for high sensitivity and minimal interference from other volatile organic compounds will also be a goal.  In Phase I the basic sensor described will be developed and characterized including preliminary screening for interferants and evaluation in a plant cell culture environment.  In Phase II, any necessary sensor refinements will be developed and the sensor will be packaged into a lightweight instrument for NASA. Phase II testing will include extensive cross-reactivity screening including in complex plant environments. During Phase II, the addition of sensing elements for other biogenic compounds such as alcohols and aldehydes will be explored.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Ethylene (ethene) is a plant hormone that is active at very low concentrations in the development of plants, particularly in the flowering and fruit ripening stages.  We are not aware of any commercial sensor with the ability to selectively detect ethylene in this concentration range (5-5000 ppb); the only commercially available technology is gas chromatography which is not economical or convenient for many applications.  Commercial applications include research on plant physiology, produce and floral shipping and storage, fruit ripening, nursery greenhouses, production greenhouses, horticulture and micropropagation facilities.  A real-time, accurate, low cost, low detection limit sensor is the first step to ethylene manipulation and control for these agricultural applications. NASA is interested in these very low concentrations for fundamental studies of the effects of microgravity on plants.  Additional NASA applications include future biomass (food) production in space and current applications at polar research stations.

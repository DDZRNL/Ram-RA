<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Silicon carbide fiber-reinforced silicon carbide composites are being considered for reusable launch vehicle airframe components.  There is a need for these composites to be joined to make complex and large shapes. TDA proposes to address this problem by using welding equipment to join SiC/SiC composites.  In Phase I, we will determine the thermal processing parameters required to use welding equipment to prepare the joins. Microscopy and mechanical testing will be used to evaluate the quality of the joins.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Completion of the project will result in a method for joining and repairing SiC/SiC composites and monolithic silicon carbide in the manner of advanced metal alloys.  This project will allow large and/or complex shapes to be joined for reusable launch vehicle airframe components as well as for advanced turbine engines, radiant tube heaters, heat exchangers, and erosion and corrosion components.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
	Large diameter solar concentrators that have low mass and stowage volume provide enabling capability for space solar power systems.  When constructed from thin-film material that can withstand the space environment for many years, Fresnel lenses and reflectors and curved mirrors, combined with ultralightweight inflatable support structures that are self-rigidizing after deployment, are applicable to multiple space solar power concepts.  This work will develop, evaluate and integrate synergistic technologies that can provide large-scale electrical power generation for various exploration missions and commercial activities in space.  The efficacy of thin polyimide film concentrator assemblies for thermophotovoltaic and thermionic power systems will be determined based on system requirements and concentrator performance.  Integrated system configurations will be derived and compared relative to conversion efficiencies, cost and technology readiness.  The feasibility of near-term demonstrations of critical subsystems and components will be determined.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
	In addition to large-scale, long-lived space solar power systems, these technologies have applications in near-sun and Mars-class missions, large antennas, high resolution earth observation satellites, light collectors for precision secondary optics, solar thermal and electric propulsion and high temperature materials processing in space.  Ground commercial applications include large- and small-scale electrical power generation and use of the inflatable structures for emergency shelters in extreme environments and in lightweight articles exposed to long-term weathering conditions.

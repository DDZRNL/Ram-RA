<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) embodies a new philosophy for managing air traffic. The initial implementation of CDM has been aimed at Ground Delay Program (GDPs). It has become increasingly evident that very significant delays and throughput degradations have arisen from en-route airspace problems and limitations, particularly from convective weather activity and demand surges. Work is currently underway within the aviation community to apply CDM technology and concepts to the management of en-route traffic (Collaborative Routing).   An essential component in the successful application of CDM to GDPs was the development of consensus around a fair allocation scheme for landing time slot assignment (ration by schedule, using the Official Airline Guide (OAG) schedule as a baseline).  No such fixed baseline exists for the enroute airspace. Although there are several concepts for resource allocation before the CDM community, the feasible implementation of these concepts has yet to be demonstrated. We propose to construct a collaborative routing rationing algorithm (CRRA) to assign use of en route resources to individual flights. It will be shown that such an algorithm is both feasible and that it can be made consistent with traffic management goals and with the CDM paradigm.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
A collaborative routing rationing algorithm (CRRA) has commercial application in several areas. Air Traffic Management (ATM) is confronted with demand-capacity imbalances in the en route environment on a daily basis. They require a systematic means for distributing scarce en route resources that is equitable across the air carriers. Conversely, the Airline Operations Centers (AOCs) require a means of inputting preferences to ATM when rationing is performed and a means of manipulating the resources they are allotted to maximize efficiency in their operations. CRRA would provide the receptacle for their preferences and refinements.  Lastly, there are several en route management tools developed commercially or by R&D funds: the Post Operations Evaluation Tool (POET) and Collaborative En-Route Flow Management (C-Flow) developed by Metron, Inc. the Collaborative Routing Coordination Tool (CRCT) developed by MITRE, and the Future Automation Concepts Evaluation Tool (FACET) developed by NASA. Each of these would benefit from a core algorithm to perform rationing of scarce en route resources.

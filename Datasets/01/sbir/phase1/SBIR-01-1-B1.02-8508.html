<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The high cost and short supply of tantalum and niobium along with the desire for cartridges usable to 1500?C demonstrate the need for alternative cartridge materials.  Two candidate materials are molybdenum and tungsten alloys.  Both have high melting temperatures and cost an order of magnitude less than tantalum and niobium.  Recently, thin-walled, closed-end tubes have been fabricated from elemental blends of molybdenum and tungsten powders.  However high temperature heat treatments are necessary to alloy elemental blended powder.  Problems with distortion and intermetallic formation can result.  To overcome these problems, an innovative plasma alloying process will be developed to produce pre-alloyed molybdenum and tungsten powders.  The use of pre-alloyed powders will allow fabrication of robust, high temperature containment cartridges that will have optimum properties for microgravity processing.

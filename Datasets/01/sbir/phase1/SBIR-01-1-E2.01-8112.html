<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The objective of this Phase I proposal is to develop a reliable, ultra-lightweight deployable boom that can be used as a critical component in future space applications that include deployable sunshades, solar sails, solar arrays, and 3-D deployable structures.  Minimization of the mass associated with deployable booms combined with optimization of the stiffness properties of the booms is an important step in making the ultra-lightweight future missions achievable.  For the proposed Phase I program, ABLE will implement a program approach that leverages its 25+ years deployable boom heritage to develop a coilable deployable boom system that provides low risk and mission-enabling performance.  This study will be based upon incorporating high-stiffness carbon graphite or titanium rods in place of standard fiberglass rods.  The approximate 3x stiffness increase and reduction in mass density will offer substantial potential overall improvements in the performance of the boom system.  ABLE?s program is structured to perform system definition and evaluation of several material and structural element concepts using to be incorporated within its heritage, flight-proven coilable boom. After an initial evaluation of various options, ABLE will evaluate relative stiffness and mass versus our standard deployable boom technology.  Performance improvements will be determined and documented.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The specific commercial product resulting from the proposed program will be a highly reliable, low cost, high performance deployable boom system that has applications for solar sails, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) structures, solar arrays, antennas, and other deployable structures.  The development of this technology will meet linear density requirements approaching 50 grams/m for many future lightweight boom applications.  Once this technology is validated through the proposed Phase II activity, the boom design will ready for flight-verification.  The intrinsic performance and operational benefits of the proposed deployable boom system make it suitable for a variety of current and future missions.  ABLE coilable booms have been used on numerous flight systems in the past, including Galileo, Cassini, Luner Prospector, and the IMAGE spacecraft, to name a few.  By reducing the mass, this technology can be mission-enabling for the new class of lightweight deployables being developed.
<br>
<br>The importance of the proposed coilable boom development program allows ABLE to create a strategic position as a leading supplier of ultra-lightweight deployables to complement its already industry-leading position in standard deployable booms. ABLE views this program as an opportunity to develop a truly innovative deployable boom system that will not only provide excellent performance, but will be based upon its highly reliable heritage technology, thus providing a near-term solution to achieving ever reduced system mass without sacrificing reliability or adding system risk.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
It is proposed to investigate the technical feasibility of using aligned nanotubes arrays coated with conformal coating of nanocrystalline diamond as efficient thermionic emitter.   Carbon nanotubes and nanocrystalline diamond has recently attracted attention due to their promising electronic and structure properties.  Due to the aligned structure and electrical properties of nanotubes and the negative electron affinity of the wide band gap of diamond it is expected that diamond coated aligned nanotubes could be ideal materials for highly efficient electron emitting sources.  It is proposed to produce aligned nanotubes with varied growth density, develop and coat with conformal coating of nanocrystalline diamond, and to characterize these novel materials for electron emission behavior.  These results will be compared to existing and developmental emitters. The proposed approach if successful can be applied to produce next generation thermionic energy converter.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Efficient electron emitting materials are becoming increasingly important in today's society for both energy conversion and for display applications. With the demand for portability in such applications as laptop computers, automobiles navigation system, cellular telephones, pagers, etc., the market for flat panel displays is growing rapidly.  A low cost scaleable technology of efficient emitter urgently needed.  Aligned nanotubes coated with diamond can the breakthrough needed to satisfy this large market.

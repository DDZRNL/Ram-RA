<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A high performance fullerene-based adsorbent is proposed for recovery and storage hydrogen and separating helium via pressure-swing-adsorption (PSA) process. Research work performed at MER showed that the proposed adsorbent has an exceptionally high hydrogen adsorption capacity at low pressure and excellent separation factor relative to helium.  During the Phase I program, the feasibility of using fullerene-based adsorbents for low-pressure recovery and storage will be determined.  The H2/He separation factor, the purity of He, and the economics of the system will also be determined.  The performance and cost of conceptual system, producing about 1000 to 100,000 gallon per day, will be estimated and compared to alternative system to demonstrate feasibility.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
A high performance adsorbent will make recovery and storage of vented hydrogen feasible. Using the proposed high performance fullerene-based adsorbents will be a good candidate for recovery of high purity hydrogen and separation of helium for aerospace and military uses.  This technology may also find applications in industrial and medical sectors.

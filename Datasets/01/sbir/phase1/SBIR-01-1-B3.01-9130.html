<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The cost of delivering payloads to remote destinations in space is extremely high.  Thus, even the smallest weight reductions can result in substantial cost savings on these missions.  Consequently, systems that have been designed for low Earth orbit may not be suitable for a mission to Mars.  One example of such technology is the system to recycle waste water.  An integrated system that utilizes vacuum distillation and catalytic oxidation (VPCAR) is currently being considered for missions to Mars.  A key step in the VPCAR process is the gas phase oxidation of ammonia to nitrogen and water, which is conducted over a platinum catalyst.  Unfortunately, it is likely that this catalyst also produces NO and NO2, which could contaminate cabin air.  These compounds are toxic and have lower SMAC values than ammonia.  Thus, the goal of this Phase I project is to design a catalyst that does not produce NOX and is also active and stable under conditions expected in the VPCAR system.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
There are several commercial applications for the selective oxidation of ammonia to nitrogen.  First, ammonia can be found in stripped sour gas streams, which contain water and H2S.  If ammonia is present in these streams, undesirable reactions occur, causing a number of problems in the refinery.  Thus, a catalyst that would completely oxidize ammonia to nitrogen would eliminate these problems.  In addition, because of the strict regulatory requirements, the catalysts must not produce NO or NO2.  Selective ammonia oxidation could also be used to reduce ammonia emissions from selective catalytic reduction (SCR) units, which are currently used to reduce NOX emissions from stationary sources.

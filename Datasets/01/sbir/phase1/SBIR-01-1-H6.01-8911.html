<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In this SBIR Phase I project, we are proposing a capability for the human operators to control the level of decision-making autonomy assigned to the robotic agents performing space or planet exploration, while encouraging team behavior among them. The level of autonomy is governed by a set of reasoning components or objects that interpret the incoming messages (e.g., task directive, request for information etc.) of a robotic agent. By replacing these components called role objects, the agent's planning autonomy can be altered to a level that requires human intervention to certain degree. This approach is efficient than the human operators adding and replacing the generated tasks after the planning in order to change the agent's plan. Reasoning components are formalized based on peer-to-peer relationships (e.g., trust, dependability and authority). These relationship parameters can be updated with time encouraging team behavior as orthogonal to controlling agents' autonomy behavior. Having plug-n-play reasoning components in the agent's planning layer or task sequencer/executor are also appropriate within the context of NASA's 3T architecture for autonomous control of robotic agents.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Autonomous robots and unmanned aerial, ground and underwater vehicles are in great demand by the government agencies. For example, fire fighters and rescue teams require unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for disaster management and rescue operations. Similarly, coast guards and military require UAVs and underwater vehicles for security and surveillance. One of the significant applications of this technology is to use autonomous robots to repair underground or underwater pipe leakages of toxic chemicals or oil. Therefore, the primary clients of this technology will be DOD and other government agencies involved with surveillance and disaster management operations.

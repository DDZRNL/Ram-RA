<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Studies of minerals and meteorites using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have demonstrated the sensitivity of XPS and its ability to deliver both qualitative and quantitative information on the chemical state of detected elements. In recent experiments using an imaging spectromicroscopy system at the Aladdin storage ring, sub-micron images of embedded organic structures in mineral specimens have been resolved. This combination of chemical specificity with spatial resolution offers a major advance in the search for residual biomarkers. Until recently there were no feasible ways to develop a plausible planetary version of either an XPS or photoelectron microscopy system. Surface/Interface Inc. proposes the key technology development needed to realize a miniaturized photoelectron spectrometer with potentially sub-micron spatial resolution. This spectrometer would be based on a unique development in charged particle energy analyzers that exhibit a very high multiplex advantage proposed by Dr. M. Kelly at Stanford. This proposal would enable an, in-situ, XPS systems with a 2500 fold reduction in volume, power and mass as compared to laboratory systems. This 1.5 to 5 kg instrument will revolutionize in-situ chemical analysis of solid surface and subsurface samples with unique sensitivity for organic compounds and a wide range of applicability to OSS programs.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The increased detector efficiency of the proposed electron energy spectrometer (MRS) will have a major impact in electron spectroscopy applications.  The major commercial techniques are X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES).  In order of market size, the biggest effect of the new technology will be in the use of AES for Defect Review for particles less then 100nm dimensions in the semiconductor industry.  This market is rapidly approaching $1B per year.  The ability to replace the x-ray detectors (EDX) in use to day will lower the size of particles that can be analyzed.  Applied Materials, Sunnyvale, CA, was able to a different improvement and gained 60% of the market in 2 years (International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors).  Another market will be the extension of XPS to spatial resolutions in the 1 micron range.  Now this is done at synchrotrons, which limit the use of the tools, especially where turn around time is important.  The size of this market is not clear.  The next direction will be to concentrate on much smaller XPS and AES instruments that can be used in production environments.  Here the efficiency will lower the cost and size to open up new applications.

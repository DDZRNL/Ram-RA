<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A Light Emitting Diode Array as countermeasure for Pituitary/Neuroendocrine effects of microgravity in long term space missions.  We feel what we learn in space, by developing countermeasures for long-term exposure to microgravity and radiation exposure, can lead to tremendous improvements in medical care for patients here on earth. Spaceflight has been shown to impair bone, muscle and cutaneous repair as well as pituitary/neuroendocrine function. The limited information available suggests that delayed healing in microgravity is related to impaired angiogenesis, immune dysfunction and alterations in cell migration. These are also primary factors contributing to non-healing, chronic wounds on earth.  This study will test the hypothesis that Light-Emitting Diode (LED) technology used for biostimulation can be enhanced to deliver doses of near-infrared (IR) light deep into the brain, at the level of the pituitary gland, to stimulate neuronal processes, including cytochrome c oxidase activity and neuronal regeneration.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The initial thrust of this research is to develop a device that can be used as a countermeasure for pituitary/neuroendocrine effects of microgravity in long-term space flight. There is no doubt that this type biostimulatory enhancement, once demonstrated for space, can be immediately applied to military applications and will have profound economic implications for the health care industry here on earth. With the development of a low cost LED source, this technology will no doubt find its way into rural area medical facilities thereby making the technology readily available to everyone. The world wide commercial implications for this device technology are enormous.

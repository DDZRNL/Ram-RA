<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovation is an efficient deicing system for aircraft leading
<br>edges using polycrystalline piezo-electric-based active-fiber composites.
<br>NASA and the entire aircraft industry need this technology to improve the
<br>safety of aircraft operations under icing conditions while minimizing the
<br>impact of ice removal on aircraft weight and fuel consumption.  We propose
<br>to use a composite structure consisting of a polymer matrix embedded with
<br>piezoelectric fibers, driven by a highly efficient electronic controller.
<br>Polycrystalline actuators can achieve substantial strain levels (that are
<br>high enough) to break the ice, which are then carried away in the slip
<br>stream.  The controller actuates the composite to break ice films, then
<br>recovers the unused actuation energy for very low net power consumption.
<br>In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of using the actuator to
<br>prevent ice buildup on aircraft leading edge surfaces by fabricating a
<br>model deicing system, evaluating performance in a sophisticated icing
<br>tunnel which simulates in-flight icing conditions, and designing a
<br>prototype system for demonstration in Phase II.
<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
This deicing system can be applied to a broad range of commercial and
<br>military aircraft.  It has the potential to drastically reduce power
<br>requirements and can improve small aircraft deicing systems in particular,
<br>since hot gases from turbines are not available.  The system can easily be
<br>retrofit to existing aircraft and can be applied to non-aircraft
<br>applications, such as shipboard surfaces where ice buildup must also be
<br>minimized.

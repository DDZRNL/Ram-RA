<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A novel data-driven approach to distributed operations is proposed to
<br>enable remote visualization of multimedia data and control of
<br>telescience experiments from geographically dispersed locations.  The
<br>web-based framework leverages on Java and XML technologies to create
<br>portable code and portable data that can be accessed and run on any
<br>common computing platforms.  To accommodate the diverse needs of
<br>different telescience experiments and users, the framework emphasizes
<br>openness and extensibility.  Users can utilize the available viewers
<br>to create their own clients according to their particular
<br>preferences, and also upload their developed components for custom
<br>data processing, view generation, and experiment planning.  The same
<br>system, possibly with a subset of data and tools, can be used for
<br>public outreach.  With 3D models and simulation of the payloads, the
<br>public users can replay telescience experiments and conduct their
<br>experiments with the virtual payloads.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The extensible, scalable, and secure framework for web-based
<br>multimedia visualization and payload control can be used to develop
<br>systems for web-based learning, medicine, manufacturing, etc.  The
<br>web-centric approach facilitates remote consultation with multiple
<br>experts (e.g., physicians, scientists, engineers) to attain best
<br>results, through efficient data sharing and collaboration.

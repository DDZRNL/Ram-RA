<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Health care and medical intervention during missions, of extended duration can be improved using medical instruments, which allow in flight specimen analysis. Thus, non-invasive biosensors for real-time monitoring of blood chemistry and cellular components, in particular proteins are highly desired. Current technologies based upon ELISAs can only quantitate a single protein at a time. However, due to complicated procedure for antibody immobilization, limited stability, and poor compatibility for biological materials, has strongly diminished the apparent attraction of immuno-sensors. These limitations could be overcome by using artificial receptors, which mimic the active sites of antibodies. Lynntech proposes to develop a novel sensitive recognition element to detect physiologically relevant target proteins. This is an enabling technology that combines a novel nonoimprinted polymer composite for the specific recognition of large biomolecules with the established technology of conducting plastics. During the Phase I, elements prepared to recognize different proteins would be arranged in an array to enable the simultaneous identification and quantitation of many proteins from a single sample. The proposed research will result in to a hand held device capable of specific recognition of small concentrations of target proteins from biological fluids at the end of Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The rapid and simultaneous quantitation of large number of proteins in biological fluids will become a valuable tool in clinical diagnostics.  Development of sensor to detect proteins in real time will be welcomed by every health professional.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed effort consists of applying Aerodyne's polarimetric spectral intensity modulation technique to design a passive sensor to improve NASA's capability for airborne retrieval of aerosol properties. The technique is innovative because it is capable of simultaneously measuring perfectly registered spectra and full Stokes polarimetry in a single snapshot. The technique has been demonstrated in the laboratory in both the visible and long wave infrared spectral regimes. The Phase I effort will consist of a sensor design, a correlative in situ experiment using an existing polarimetric spectral intensity modulation sensor along with Aerodyne's Aerosol Mass Spectrometer, and a modest algorithm development effort.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
There are several potential commercial applications for this technology. The most promising application is in the field of optical metrology. In particular, our technique is well suited to performing hyperspectral ellipsometry for the measurement of thickness and complex index of refraction of thin films. Other potential applications include industrial process control of sugar solution concentrations and remote surface orientation retrieval for efficient generation of 3D CAD models.

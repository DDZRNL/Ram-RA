<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
SATS is NASA's efficient personal air transportation vision. SATS airplanes must strive for higher levels of safety, speed, and comfort than small airplanes currently offer. BRS therefore proposes to develop an advanced parachute recovery system for high performance GA aircraft capable of 300-knot cruise speeds. BRS has already received FAA certification for its Cirrus Design SR-20 parachute recovery system which evolved from the BRS sport aviation products. However, heavier and faster GA aircraft will require the development of new and innovative technologies to enhance the performance, safety, reliability, and successful commercialization of an advanced parachute recovery system. First, these systems must be capable of reliable deployment in catastrophic emergencies from stall speeds to "loss of control" speeds approaching 350 knots. Secondly, the weight and volume of the systems and components is more critical to the performance and utility of GA aircraft than for recreational type aircraft and must be minimized. Finally, a steering capability for obstacle avoidance in hazardous landing areas will be investigated. These enhancements to aircraft recovery systems will be a significant step toward improving the safety of GA travel, and so have definite commercial potential.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
BRS is continuing to work with Cirrus Design in Duluth, Minnesota to develop recovery systems for their aircraft. The BRS CAPS is already standard equipment on the Cirrus SR20 aircraft. and is being adapted to the SR22 aircraft, a upgraded version of the SR20. Future Cirrus aircraft include retractable landing gear versions of the SR22 and eventually larger, faster composite aircraft that will incorporate a variety of new technologies, including more efficient propulsion systems such as cost effective jet engines for GA aircraft.  The Cirrus Design aircraft designs are a prime example of next generation of GA aircraft and are therefore, the ideal platform for the development of the advanced recovery system. A key component of BRS's strategic plan is to aggressively pursue relationships with as many of the currently existing and future aircraft manufacturers as possible to expand the recovery system product line for the general aviation and larger experimental aircraft markets. These markets can be a significant revenue source for BRS with the average recovery system price ranging from as low as $5,000 and up to $30,000.

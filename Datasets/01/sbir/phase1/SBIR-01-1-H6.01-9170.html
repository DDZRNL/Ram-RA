<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
EDAptive Computing, Inc. and Dr. Perry Alexander of the University of Kansas present a unique and commercially viable solution to the problem of automated generation of test sequences from declarative specifications of hardware or software component models. Our proposed solution implements specification-based testing techniques to automatically generate test sequences and expected responses from component models, and translates the generated tests, initially generated for application to the component interface, for application to the interface of the overall system. This will considerably reduce the time and effort required to validate implementation of components in a real-time computing system against their requirements, thereby ensuring their safe and reliable operation. Our proposed Automated Test Generation in Intelligent Systems (GENISYS) project leverages the following:
<br>(i)	Rosetta, an emerging System-Level Design Language 
<br>(ii)	EDAptive?s VectorGen? tool, and
<br>(iii)	Dr. Perry Alexander's expertise in formal methods, specification languages and test generation techniques.
<br>This effort will primarily focus on research & development of techniques and tools to translate tests generated for a component interface to tests for application to the overall system. In this proposal we present a focused approach to establish feasibility in Phase I, and prove the concept and prepare for technology transition in Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Testing a real-time computing system can require as much as 50-70% of the total design cycle time. Maturation and integration of tools and languages proposed under this effort will reduce the cost of validating an implementation against its requirements at least by an order of magnitude. Both NASA and commercial developers of real-time computing systems can use the proposed tools to identify potential problems very early in the design cycle, thereby ensuring safe and reliable systems.

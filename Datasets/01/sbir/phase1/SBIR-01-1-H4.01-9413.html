<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Personal cooling system technology was first utilized by NASA for the Apollo Astronauts to prevent heat buildup under their space suits. Extensive plastic tubing is used to circulate water for body heat removal.  The undergarment is quite binding and restrictive and inefficient in the removal of body heat to the external heat exchanger.  The proposed innovation is the creation of a new thermally conductive textile fiber using nanocomposite engineering.  The immediate opportunity is reduced contact surface required for the plastic tubing.  The loops can be spaced further apart greatly enhancing comfort and mobility.  Improved speed of heat transfer will provide the benefit of reduced water circulation needs, leading to an opportunity for a reduction in the weight and bulk of the space suit and improved astronaut mobility.  Reduced support systems, lower launch weight, greater personal comfort and extended activity time are expected.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Numerous commercial applications have been developed for cool suit technology and would benefit from improvements made through this proposal. Representative current uses include: 
<br>Personal cooling systems used by US and foreign troops under bulky protective gear
<br>Personal cooling systems for firefighters, hazardous materials handlers, nuclear power personnel, crop dusters, and workers in primary metals reduction, glass manufacturing, chemical processing, steel mills and foundries, and paper production
<br>Self contained cooling systems for mine rescue workers 
<br>Recreational sports/Sports medicine
<br>Used to lower body temperatures for patients with multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, and other neurological disorders

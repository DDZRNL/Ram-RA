<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
An innovative software tool is proposed to provide shared access to all pertinent information involved in the dynamic testing process.  The dynamic testing process is collaborative and requires the sharing of many forms of data.  By leveraging standard Internet technologies and customizing them for the dynamic testing application, all requirements, schedules, procedures, photographs, measurement data, and analysis data can be accessed in a hierarchical fashion using a standard web browser.  The Project Site would serve as a ?virtual meeting room? where all test team members could share data and collaborate for the duration of the test program.  The proposed research focuses primarily on determining the best architecture for implementing such an application.  Application prototypes will be developed based on the candidate architectures.  The best architecture will be determined from a comparison and evaluation of the application prototypes in the areas of robustness, performance, scalability, reliability, and security.  In addition, open communication standards and open source frameworks will be investigated to ensure that the target application is state-of-the-art.  By customizing and extending Internet technologies, a practical software tool can be developed which will shorten test cycles and improve the overall quality of the dynamic testing process.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
ComFrame believes that there is a strong need within the environmental testing community for a software tool which will allow distributed data access and collaboration between project team members.  Basing the tool upon leading industry standards will facilitate industry adoption of such a platform by allowing easy integration with existing test tools and processes.  Once the application is proven, relationships and partnerships can be established with system vendors in the dynamic/vibration testing industry in order to broaden marketing opportunities.  Finally, the basic software framework can be extended into other areas of environmental testing such as thermal, wind tunnel testing, and machinery monitoring.  Given the cutting edge nature of the product and the broad market scope, ComFrame believes that the collaborative platform proposed herein has significant potential as a commercial offering.

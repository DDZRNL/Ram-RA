<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Alameda Applied Sciences Corporation proposes to develop a new Clustered Vacuum Arc Thruster (CVAT) as an electric propulsion micro-thruster for microspacecraft with mass <=40kg with available thruster power ~40W. For deep space missions, high Isp thrusters are needed to minimize on board propellant mass. For electric thrusters such as the Pulsed Plasma Thruster and the Vacuum Arc Thruster, a challenge is feed of the propellant during long missions requiring >kg of total propellant. If the feed mechanism involves moving parts, its reliability is an issue, especially with active control. An innovative solution to this problem is proposed: deploy an array of individual, static thrusters, each of which delivers ~10g of total eroded propellant. An array of 100 such devices would then deliver a kg of propellant, with no moving parts. The innovation is the use of miniature solid-state switches in our inductive PPU driver that enable programmable switching of the drive power pulses from one thruster to another. By so doing, one effectively switches power out of a given cathode once it has completed its useful mission life. Such a Clustered Vacuum Arc Thruster array (CVAT) has no moving parts and yet delivers ~1kg propellant loads for various nanosatellite missions.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The primary application of the specific electric propulsion thruster to be developed in the proposed work will be for small spacecraft ~10 kg. However, beyond this immediate application, the thruster could find use for larger or smaller spacecraft, with further development.

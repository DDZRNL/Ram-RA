<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovation is divided into three parts.  The first conducts basic measurements to assess the accuracy of the two-microphone scheme, developed by P. Dean, to measure the impedance of Helmholtz resonators in grazing flow.  Dean?s method is the benchmark standard used to measure the effects of grazing flow and SPL on the impedance of cavity-backed liners.  Implicit in its derivation is the assumption (1) that the incident sound pressure can be accurately measured with a single microphone located on the resonator face-plate and (2) that a single microphone located in the center of the cavity back wall can accurately describe the response of the cavity to the incident sound field.  Unpublished in-house impedance measurements suggest that the use of a single microphone to measure cavity pressure may be subject to errors as large as 20%.  The research program will determine the minimum number of microphones required to accurately measure Helmholtz resonator impedance.  The second systematically investigates the effects of orifice spacing and orientation on resonator impedance as a function of SPL and grazing flow.  The third develops accurate 1-DOF and 2-DOF models of the impedance of resonators as a function of SPL, grazing flow and boundary-layer thickness.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
1.	One of the primary commercial applications of the technology would be to license it to a commercial providers of duct propagation codes and/or to airframe and engine manufacturers.  The control of engine noise in the community surrounding commercial airports is known to be a difficult problem to solve given the cost and weight constraints of the aircraft industry.  It is envisioned that the duct propagation software could be licensed/sold capable of selecting resonator geometry that can be both economically constructed and achieve efficient sound absorption for a specified input noise signature.
<br>2.	A secondary application of the technology would to incorporate the impedance code into a as low frequency sound propagation and attenuation code to license/sell it to manufactures of electrical generating turbines and HVAC fans.

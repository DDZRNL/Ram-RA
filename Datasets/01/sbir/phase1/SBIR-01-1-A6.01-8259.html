<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The grid stack used on ion engines is a critical component largely influencing engine performance and weight The grids currently used on ion thrusters (and laboratory ion sources) use heavy ceramic mounting posts and assembly of several parts is required. 
<br>
<br>This project investigates a novel grid materials and architecture in which the grids are joined in a sandwich structural configuration, using low-density oriented glass fiber core to maintain the spacing and precise alignment of the grids. The benefits of this architecture are (1) reduced weight, (2) simplified assembly of fewer parts, and (3) the opportunity to scale the grids to large area for high-thrust engines. Glassy carbon grids will be investigated because it offers low sputter-yield, low-CTE, and potentially low machining costs. 
<br>
<br>Phase 1 shall investigate materials and processing of sandwich grid stacks made with carbon facings. Methods for mounting sandwich grids into composite ion engine bodies and for tiling large area grids shall be assessed. A small prototype grid stack shall be fabricated for testing in an existing ion engine. Phase 2 would further develop the materials and processing leading to fabrication of larger sandwich grid stacks for use in lightweight composite ion engines.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Lightweight sandwich grid stacks will have application in ion thrusters used in space propulsion for deep space missions and for spacecraft attitude control, including communication satellites. There is a larger consumption of grids in the commercial ion sources used for materials processing, and low cost grid stacks could benefit these applications. The methods developed may be useful for other electron sources in microwave tubes, lasers, accelerators, and electronics display technology.

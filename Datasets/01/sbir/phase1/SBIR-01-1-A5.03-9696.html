<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Hyper-Therm recently demonstrated producing the world?s first actively-cooled, ceramic-matrix composite thrust chambers for liquid rocket propulsion systems. Using a near-net shape manufacturing technique, these monocoque components were fabricated with an annular array of internal cooling channel passages and are perhaps the most geometrically complex and enabling propulsion devices ever produced from continuous fiber-reinforced ceramic composites. To evaluate their performance, a non-flight-weight liquid hydrogen coolant manifold assembly was designed and fabricated to interface the composite thrust chambers to a test stand NASA GRC for ground-test firing. These devices are currently on the stand undergoing hot-fire testing using an energetic mixture ratio of liquid oxygen/ hydrogen (LOX/LH) propellants. In order to exploit the significant potential of these actively-cooled propulsion devices, it is recognized that flight-weight manifolding is key to the success and future utilization of this technology. The objective of this Phase I program is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a flight-weight regenerative coolant manifold system for the actively-cooled ceramic composite thrust chamber. Following the experimental development of a reactive ceramic-to-metal braze-joining method, a prototype axisymmetric composite heat exchanger with integrated metallic toroidal manifolds will be fabricated and delivered to NASA MSFC for evaluation.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
There are a number of DoD, NASA and DoE programs in progress or being planned that are targeting fiber-reinforced ceramic-matrix composites as viable high-temperature material candidates. The development of practical methods for joining ceramic composites to metallics could directly support and possibly impact future programs. Recent developments in actively-cooled ceramic composite thrust chambers offer promise to significantly increase performance while decreasing cost over currently available superalloy and refractory metal propulsion components. Next generation reusable launch vehicle propulsion systems, both rocket and airbreathing, could greatly benefit from the actively-cooled ceramic composites technology. The successful implementation of braze-bonding light-weight metallic coolant manifolds to actively-cooled ceramic composite thrust chambers would be recognized as a world class achievement in the area of structures and materials. Near-term applications for ceramic composites include expendable rocket thrusters for orbital insertion, attitude control system and/or divert thrust chamber components for commercial and military communication spacecraft and/or various ballistic missile defense KE intercept weapons. Opportunities for retrofit application in turbine engine augmentors (e.g., converging/diverging exhaust nozzle flaps and seals) for military aero-propulsion systems also exist, however the issues of long-term durability and damage tolerance are key barriers against insertion. Applications for ceramic composites in advanced airbreathing and rocket propulsion systems and control surfaces for reusable hypervelocity and exo/transatmospheric aerospace vehicles are currently being addressed.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate highly sensitive linear spin-valve sensors with optimized bias points, and will also demonstrate the feasibility of their application in digital isolator devices.   The linear spin-valve sensors with  high sensitivity will be designed and fabricated by manipulating the anisotropies involved in the free layer, e.g.  the uniaxial anisotropy and  the shape anisotropy.   In order to reduce the hysteresis due to both the multi-domain formation in the free layer and the detrimental effect of the fringe fields from the pinned layer, the free layer will be biased by direct coupling with an antiferromagnetic (AF) layer, and the pinned layer will be replaced by a pinned synthetic antiferromagnetic sandwich (CoFe/Ru/CoFe).   In addition to the design, materials selection and process control will be used to optimize the sensor performance.  The ultimate goal in this program is to fabricate and demonstrate low power high speed digital isolator devices using linear spin-valve sensors developed in Phase I. The current NVE digital isolator process will be modified for the proposed low power high speed digital isolator.  The success of this Phase I project will provide a solid framework for the Phase II to build high speed, radiation-hard digital isolator devices. One of our strategies in Phase II is to combine the NVE magnetic isolator technology  with the current existing radiation-hard IC processes (as announced by Honeywell, Peregrine Semiconductor and Lockheed Martin) to develop and fabricate miniature radiation-hard digital signal isolators.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The high sensitive linear spin-valve sensors developed in this research have immediate application in NVE's isolator technology, which will   lead to low power high speed signal isolator products suitable  for both military and commercial applications.   In addition, the linear spin-valve materials can also be used in field sensors and read head devices.

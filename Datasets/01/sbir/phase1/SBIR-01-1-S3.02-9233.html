<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Research is proposed on the evaluation and development of a novel Electrospray "Wick-Injector" for supplying liquid to colloidal satellite thrusters using electrostatic fields to produce and accelerate micro charged droplets of non-volatile fluids. Depending solely on capillarity driven flow, as in the wick of a candle, the injector requires no mechanical pumps or pressurizing gas, is very light, energy efficient, and structurally simple. Liquid is delivered only as rapidly as the field can disperse it, so that the flow rate depends entirely on the dimensions of the wick, the properties of the liquid, and the applied voltage. The flow is inherently self-sustaining at a rate immune to plugging or disturbance by dirt particles, and is easily varied by adjustment of the applied voltage. The thruster readily lends itself to multiplexing and can thus provide thrust levels over a wide range and direction. Effects of radiation on colloidal fluids used with the proposed thruster will also be studied.

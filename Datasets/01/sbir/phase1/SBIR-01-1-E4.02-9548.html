<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal addresses NASA?s requirement for innovative data analysis tools to support remote sensing of the coastal zone with hyperspectral and multispectral imagery.  We propose to develop novel, fully automated software for the retrieval of accurate atmospheric variables from a network of new and existing ground based spectral radiometers, and for the atmospheric correction of hyperspectral and multispectral data using these retrieved variables.  The retrieval algorithm will take advantage of both direct solar radiance and diffuse downwelling flux to retrieve detailed aerosol properties, molecular concentrations, and information on cloud cover on a real-time basis.  Phase I will focus on developing a MODTRAN based algorithm for continuous measurement of water vapor, ozone, and aerosol spectral extinction and scattering albedo using data from a commercial shadowband radiometer.   In addition, the use of such data for atmospherically correcting a multispectral image will be demonstrated.  In Phase II the algorithm will be extended to different instruments and integrated into vendor software, and a MODTRAN-based atmospheric correction code (ACC) that accepts the radiometer retrievals as inputs will be developed for NASA sensors.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The software will address a wide range of government and commercial market needs for data products from hyperspectral and multispectral imagery.  Applications include maritime environment characterization, precision agriculture, oceanography, forestry, geology, pollutant and fugitive emission monitoring, surveillance, target detection and identification, intrusion detection, and technical intelligence.

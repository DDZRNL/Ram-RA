<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Sorceron proposes a novel server-client system that delivers a virtual collaborative environment to outreach and telescience participants of NASA?s Earth Science Enterprise.   Rich media including live and archived natural and synthetic video, audio, 3-D models, telemetry, and data are (1) collected from sources including ESE data centers and the participants themselves, (2) objectized and integrated into MPEG-4, MPEG-7, and MPEG-21 compliant streams, (3) securely conveyed to participants and audiences with diverse computing platforms (from workstations to wireless PDAs), and (4) rendered at the client in a participant-driven interactive fashion that supports user-directed real-time scientific visualization, manipulation of viewpoints and articulation of models, scientific exploration, enhanced learning, real-time analysis of experiment data, and real-time experiment control (if authorized) without the need of special hardware.  The Sorceron client admits future media types and includes interfaces through which a user can connect additional software to the content stream, including Matlab/Simulink workspaces and experiment-specific control GUIs.  A graphical authoring tool facilitates the set-up of collaborative environments, telescience and outreach sessions.  Individual content streams are applied advanced compression/decompression and transport protocol optimized to the instantaneous available processing, multimedia, and communications capabilities of the client platform so as to enhance session quality and scalability.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed functionality will be incorporated into the Media Engine commercial product targeted to remote learning (market doubling yearly to $11.5 billion by 2003), financial services ($415 billion in online assets today, $3 trillion by 2003), media/entertainment (paid online content to grow to $5.7B by 2005), and customer/relationship management ($5.3 billion currently Internet-based).  Content interactivity and consumer platform diversity differentiate the Media Engine in the remote learning market, enabling technique-intensive curriculum requiring individually directed views of real-time instructor activity.  Brigham Young University and Sorceron are jointly evaluating content for technique-intensive curriculum.  Financial service institutions seeking to differentiate their research to brokers, analysts, and institutional clients also seek interactivity and rich content integration; Lehman Brothers and KPMG have committed funds to commercialize the Media Engine.  Sorceron Studios, the in-house creative services team composed of Emmy award winners from Pixar, R/GA and NBC will provide clients with world-class creative work optimized for the Media Engine.  Commercialization is reinforced by conforming to international standards for multimedia data representation and management, and partnerships with telecommunications service providers who will host Media Engine servers and provide global access to customers (producers and end-users) and content providers; ongoing negotiations involve Sprint, IBM, EMC, Cisco, and Fantastic.

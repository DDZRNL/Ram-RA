<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This small business innovative research proposal seeks to develop an energy transfer technology based on the enhancement associated with a microsphere resonator. The technique discussed in this proposal would enhance the probability of detecting target molecules and amplifying signals by lifting the constraints associated with traditional fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The Microparticle Enhanced Energy Transfer system proposed offers the ability for long-range (over 200,000 Angstroms) transfer without any orientation restraints on the donor and acceptor molecules; i.e., the donor and acceptor molecules can still transfer efficiently regardless of their relative orientation. The resulting system could easily be presented in a low-cost package while providing a unique means for signal amplification and molecule detection.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The Microparticle Enhanced Energy Transfer technology presented in this proposal offers a wide variety of applications for both the government and commercial markets. Aside from the direct application to biomolecular signal analyss, the proposed technology may find suitable applicability in other venues. Examples of possible applications of this technology are exposure detection clothing that would soldiers or medical personnel to know if they have been exposed to harmful pathogens, or contamination detection schemes for air and water filtration systems.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We will investigate the feasibility of thermographic inspection system that employs a small, handheld inspection head, which is swept over an area to be inspected, using IR transmitting fibers and a fiber coupled laser-heating system.  The system, if successful, will allow more precise control of heating and data acquisition than current NDE systems allow, and as a result, provide NDE capabilities (in particular, for cracks oriented perpendicular to the sample surface) that significantly surpass the performance of current pulsed or scanned systems.   The system will be suitable for either handheld, or robot-mounted operation.   The system will utilize a novel signal processing scheme to allow signal to noise comparable to full scale system.  The small size and absence of active heating or electronic components in the scanning head will allow inspection of limited access areas, such as radii or tanks, where access is available through a small port, or in environments where hazardous vapors pose an explosion risk.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
This proposal was formulated based on input from current and prospective customers in Government and private aerospace manufacturing, service, and R&D, including NASA, commercial airline, and military NDE personnel.  These customers indicated a high degree of interest in a small scanning system that would incorporate the advanced features of the pulsed systems that they were using on other applications, and also allow access to confined spaces and operation in hazardous vapor environments. Although the proposal has focused primarily on aerospace applications, significant market opportunities exist in the automotive and energy industries.  The growing use of composites in automotive manufacturing  is presenting new QA and NDE challenges to the industry.  TWI has been a pioneer in applying Pulsed Thermographic solutions to automotive applications, and has worked with Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, Nissan and numerous Tier 1 suppliers.   The automotive market is distinctly different than the aerospace market, primarily because of the high volume requirements and the importance of autonomous, on-line systems.  TWI has recognized and responded to these needs, will build on our experience in the automotive industry in marketing the handheld scanning system.

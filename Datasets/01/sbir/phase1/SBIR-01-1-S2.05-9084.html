<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovation is a system design suite that enables optimization of large, flexible opto-mechanical structures such as space-based observatories.  The suite is innovative because it combines validated design tools, or modules, for detailed system analysis with an automation layer that drives the analysis tools, permitting rapid evaluation of the trade space between many highly coupled design variables.  The analysis modules are general enough to be applicable for the complete program life cycle, from conceptual design to operational analysis, providing analysis traceability.  The automation layer handles the translation of high-level systems requirements into module-level design space constraints, and buffers the detailed analysis results.   The suite encompasses an archiving function, which enables the time evolution of the design to be explicitly tracked, facilitating the systems designer's understanding of the design space, and providing a formal means to manage risk.  The combination of detailed modeling accuracy with the automation necessary for trading a large design space provides analysis depth and breadth, leading to an optimal systems design.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The first-tier customer for the DOCS suite is the deep space observatory community.  Potential commercial customers include Lockheed-Martin, TRW, and Ball Aerospace.  Second-tier customers are the earth-imaging community.  Potential customers include the NRO and AFRL.  Finally, Mide will attempt to identify a third-tier aerospace or industrial market, with the intent of finding a wider market to leverage the development effort of the design tools to a general purpose systems design and optimization suite.

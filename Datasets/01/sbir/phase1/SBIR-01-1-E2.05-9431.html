<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Hydrazine monopropellants have been successfully used for NASA scientific satellites and space probes for over 40 years.  Surveillance, early warning, communication, navigation, and weather satellites for NASA and the U. S. armed services are using hydrazine propulsion subsystems similar to those in commercial satellites.  In addition, many upper stages of launch vehicles placing NASA and USAF payloads into orbit use hydrazine monopropellants for roll control and propellant settling maneuvers prior to orbit insertion burns.  There has been increasing concern about toxicity of hydrazine(s).  Safety regulations have been tightened to the point where fueling at the launch site has become a significant part of the overall cost of a spacecraft launch.  Nontoxic monopropellants based on hydroxylammonium nitrate as replacement for hydrazine promise faster and more economical fueling operations, resulting in lower life-cycle cost.  Catalysts and thermal bed materials proposed here as an ignition technique promise to achieve the same reliability as that already demonstrated with hydrazine thrusters using Shell 405 catalyst.  The product of this SBIR has near-term applicability to NASA programs and ties in directly with nontoxic propellant thruster development in progress at other government centers and NASA contractors.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
More than half of all U. S. satellites launched between 1989 and 1999 were for commercial applications.  U. S. launch vehicle upper stages such as Delta II, ATLAS-II, ATHENA or PEGASUS are built by commercial launch service providers for both commercial and government payload customers and have to be fueled with hydrazine.  In most cases, hydrazine monopropellant can be replaced by a nontoxic monopropellant with resulting cost-saving benefits that would be passed on to customers like NASA and other branches of the U. S. Government.  In a few cases, it may be possible to substitute existing systems with a drop-in replacement using a nontoxic propellant.  The potential market for the catalyst to be developed under this SBIR and its Phase II and Phase III follow-on contracts is the same as that for Shell 405 catalyst.  Our material may eventually replace Shell 405 in most monopropellant thruster and gas generator applications.

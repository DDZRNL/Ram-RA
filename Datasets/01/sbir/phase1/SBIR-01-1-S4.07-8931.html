<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal addresses the need for the efficient conversion of thermal energy from a radioisotope heat source to electrical energy for deep-space probes.  We propose to develop a miniature Turbo-Brayton Power Unit (TBPU) in a closed-loop Brayton cycle to provide approximately 100 We of electrical power at a thermal efficiency of 38%.  The technical approach that enables high efficiency relies on unique micro-fabrication techniques that have been developed at Creare.  These techniques have been used in long-life, vibration-free turbo-Brayton cryocoolers that have been successfully space flight qualified and tested.  Here we plan to apply the basic technology to high temperature power generation.  The innovation that will be demonstrated in Phase I is the operation of the turbomachine rotor at high speeds in gas bearings and at prototypical temperatures.  We will also develop a preliminary design for a TBPU optimized for spacecraft power conversion.  In Phase II, a prototype TBPU will be developed and tested at prototypical power levels and temperatures.  Creare is uniquely qualified to succeed in this research and development program.  The project team that will collaborate on this effort has extensive experience in the development of space-flight hardware incorporating high-speed turbomachines, high-performance recuperators and precision gas film bearings.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
An open-cycle turbo-Brayton power unit promises to be lighter, quieter and more compact than current commercial generators.  Commercial applications include portable power units and cogeneration units for construction and camp sites; emergency power units for homes and offices; and auxiliary power units for homes, boats and aircraft.

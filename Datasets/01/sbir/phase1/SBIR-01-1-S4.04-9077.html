<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Space rigidizable and deployable structures with ultra-lightweight, high rigidity, space durability, and high impact resistance are desirable to improve the reliability and affordability of space structures. Some of the components currently in use like shelter or space station use double-wall thick films with high internal pressure.  All these hollow components are vulnerable in space because of many debris and meteorites that can strike them.  They will lose their functions if hit and damaged by foreign objects. We propose to fill the cavities of these hollow components by an ultra-lightweight CHEM foam that can rigidize the space structure in space so that they can maintain their functions even they are struck by debris.  Foams processed by the conventional chemical-blowing agent have toxicity problems.  In this phase I research, we propose to process ultra-lightweight microcellular foams from CHEM and/or other shape memory polymers using an environmental friendly technique.  Our microcellular CHEM foams will have higher mechanical properties than those processed by the conventional techniques.  The shape memory foam can be packed into a very small volume and recovers its shape and rigidizes in space, thereby considerably reduce the launching cost yet provide high rigidity for space structures.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed ultra-lightweight microcellular foams from CHEM and other shape memory polymers have a number of potential applications for space structures including rigidified boom and support structures for Gossamer space structures, rover subsystems like wheels, chasis, insulation box, masts,  solar array deployment device, shelters and hangars for space habitats, airlocks, electronics box, tanks/shells/shields, solar array, radar boards, support structures for telecommunication subsystems like struts and beams, etc.. Shape memory gels have been explored to perform various functions including artificial muscles and organs, drug-delivery devices, chemical valves, and actuators.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Non-mechanical beamsteering eliminates the need for massive optomechanical components to steer the field of view of optical systems.  This benefit is to come in the form of compact, low-power, light-weight optical phased arrays that provide better control with greater flexibility in their steering capability.  Currently, high-speed, high-resolution, fully-programmable non-mechanical beamsteerers with good optical efficiency do not exist forcing system developers to use mechanical systems for controlling the field of view of an optical system.  This proposal offers a means to correct this deficiency.   Recent advances in VLSI foundry processes have made possible high-resolution, light-efficient backplanes capable of driving electro-optic modulators with high-voltage signals.  The high-voltage signals provide the excitation to achieve sub-millisecond response times with a wave of phase modulation.  By combining high-speed phase modulators with high-voltage VLSI backplanes, compact spatial light modulators become available for the various applications that need this type of performance such as optical signal routing or beamsteering, active diffractive optics and adaptive wavefront correction.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The control of light propagation is useful in a number of applications.  Spot generation for directing light to disparate destinations is needed for dynamic optical interconnects.  Fresnel-lens generation for controlling focal plane distance is useful for non-mechanically addressing multi-layer optical disks.  Wavefront correction, where adaptive optics compensate atmospheric induced aberrations, is primarily used in the large earth-based observatories, but there also is a need for this type of technology in medical and industrial environments.  These are some of the applications that will benefit from the proposed development.

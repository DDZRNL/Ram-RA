<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In this project, American AGNC Corporation proposes to develop and demonstrate an innovative !?Low Cost, Small Size High Performance Navigation System!? for small aircraft. The innovative navigation system contains an AHRS system, a pressure altitude sensor, an air data sensor and a relative altitude sensor. The AHRS package contains a non-orthogonal configuration MEMS IMU, a miniature GPS receiver and a magnetometer. The innovative optimal non-orthogonal configuration MEMS IMU enhances the reliability of the whole system. The integration of low cost MEMS IMU into a navigation system for a small aircraft demands the development of non-traditional approaches and algorithms. This includes sensor redundancy, fault detection, isolation and reconfiguration. In the Phase I project, the feasibility, as well as functions, specifications, hardware architecture, and software of the proposed system will be defined.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed low cost, small size and high performance navigation system based on non-orthogonal configuration MEMS IMU can be widely used on vehicles such as small rotorcraft, military ground vehicle, ship and missile, etc.

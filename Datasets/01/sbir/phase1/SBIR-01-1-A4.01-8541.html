<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
DSI will develop an integrated backplane/server solution for the SATS cockpit. The GAAINS (General Aviation Aircraft Information Network Server) solution will provide the foundation for tomorrows SATS cockpit. DSI believes in the spirit of SATS, and through the integration of COTS technologies combined with current open architecture standards, a new enabling platform will be developed which increases cockpit functionality, while decreasing pilot workload at a fraction of the cost of today?s systems. DSI?s GAAINS architecture is based on current communication industry standards for redundancy and fail over scenarios. Ruggedized COTS hardware coupled with proven smart software suites will provide new heights of modularity, cost savings, and ease of access, operation and growth. This backplane/server platform will ultimately increase the chance of success for NASA?s SATS vision.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Commercial applications include the GAAINS installations in the existing 100,000 travel active airplanes, as well as new GA aircraft. This product will also be designed for integration with the ground and satellite based GA extranet (SATS-Net). Outside of this, there is almost no limit to expansion and opportunities in terms of providing information to the GA aircraft. The implications of this are vast. As the Internet has matured and brought forth a host of viable information services, the potential for radically improving the availability of information services to the GA aircraft is enormous. This also has strong potential for the commercial airline industry. As concepts were borrowed from the automotive industry, the likelihood that advances in the GA market could be applied back to the automotive industry are very high.

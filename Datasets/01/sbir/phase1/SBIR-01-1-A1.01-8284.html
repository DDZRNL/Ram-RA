<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In the proposed SBIR effort, Metron, Inc. designs and develops the INTENT algorithm, an algorithm that infers the intent of the pilot of an aircraft that is being tracked by a surveillance system.  Based on the Ph.D. thesis work of Krozel (Purdue University, 1992), the theoretical approach for "intelligent path prediction" is used in the INTENT algorithm to identify the most likely intent of the vehicle being tracked.  In intelligent path prediction, data describing the environment around the vehicle, for instance, the location of weather, navaids, alternate airports, turbulence, Special Use Airspace (SUA), and operational data are used to determine plausible routes for travel.  The outputs of the INTENT algorithm are an inferred intent, a level of confidence in the intent, and a continuous predicted path.  Because environmental and operational considerations are taken into consideration, the INTENT algorithm is expected to perform better than a Kalman filter for long prediction times.  The INTENT algorithm increases the safety of flight by adding predictability to displays and other avionics systems and helps reduce congestion by providing meaningful long-term predictions.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
An intent inference algorithm and long term trajectory predictor has commercial application in several areas:  the flight deck (FD), Air Traffic Management (ATM), and Airline Operations Centers (AOCs).  For the FD, we provide the ability to verify intent data from and ADS-B message and the ability to predict long term trajectories, which is useful for other avionics systems on the FD.  Embedding our algorithm into systems provided by FD avionics systems manufacturers represents potential commercial applications.  Applications also include ATM, where our algorithms assist terminal area and en route automation systems in identifying intent for display to the controller or for input to conflict detection algorithms.  Our algorithm is useful to the AOCs to provide long term predictions for traffic congestion, weather congestion, and estimated delays and times of arrival.

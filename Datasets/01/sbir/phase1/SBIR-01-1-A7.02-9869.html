<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In this proposal an anisotropic solution based three-dimensional mesh adaptation procedure is described. The algorithm described in the code can very effectively refine the mesh in regions of interest by stretching pulling, splitting and node refinement and coarsen them in regions of unchanging flow field, in effect reducing the total mesh number and thereby computational effort required for accurate prediction of steady and unsteady pressure and thermal load distributions on aerospace surfaces. The code is integrated with an incompressible and a compressible flow solver through a user friendly GUI which requires little user interaction other than setting certain flow field quantities and parameters. Other solvers may be integrated and connected to the GUI. Benchmarks on the Onera Wing and the Ahmed body using the 2 codes show excellent results and correlation with experimental data. Further correlation continues on the Boeing 747 wing, re-entry vehicles and internal flows such as fuel systems and propulsion applications NASA is involved in. Enhancement of the code is required to accept prismatic and pyramidal element types,  for unsteady flows, inclusion of species, reaction and other scalar functions and for including inhouse or NASA proprietary  solvers for which funds are sought.  These enhancements can be incorporated within 5-6 months.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The commercial applications of this code are varied and many since the anisotropic adaptation procedure may practically be applied to almost any field or industry such as structures, acoustics, earthquake simulation, magnetic fields and so on. This is because the code accepts any parameter as a vector or scalar quantity and performs adaptation based on the error estimates obtained from the initial solution and variation of these variables. In fact customers from industries such as Boeing(Aerospace applications), SAIC(Magnetic fields), GE(Combustion) and other renowned industries in the USA, Japan(Automotive applications) and France(high speed jets and nozzles) have shown interest in this code and have called for stringent benchmark of problems of interest which we are presently actively involved in.

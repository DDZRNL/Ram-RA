<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Laser based flow diagnostic methods have been used for many years in aerodynamics, aero-optics, aeroballistics, and combustion research. Some of the whole field diagnostics methods have gradually evolved into using electronic array recording methods, while others still use photographic recording materials to provide the required resolution, speed, and format. The latter methods, (e.g. holographic interferometry) suffer the inconvenience and logistics of required development, processing, and data extraction, but until recently, electronic media have not proven adequate for many applications. With new developments in video technology and image processing, this state of affairs is changing. This proposal includes two unique, complementary methods to digitize, automate, and digitally record flow diagnostics information. Because of the recent emphasis on hypersonic flow, these methods should be extremely beneficial to NASA Langley test facilities. This proposal is an expanded version of a similar proposal submitted last year that received an outstanding technical rating from all reviewers. Anticipating that the increase in interest in hypersonic flow testing will raise the priority of the proposed technology improvement, we are submitting the proposal again with improvements in the concept.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed real-time, digital, differential interferometer will enable the recording of large numbers of quantitative interferograms that capture changes over a broad range of time periods. The system will be compatible with existing flow imaging and laser hardware, making it attractive for any flow facility and applicable ultimately in flight systems.

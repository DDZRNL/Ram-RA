<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Visidyne proposes to investigate a unique concept for a burst-modulated, flood-illumination LADAR to accomplish the 3-D imaging necessary to implement an effective short-range relative attitude sensor for the final phase of spacecraft rendezvous and docking. Recent advances in the areas of high-power laser diode technology and gateable CCD or CMOS array detectors promise to provide a cost-effective imaging LADAR sensor that can detect passive targets at relatively long range and over a wide field-of-regard.  Bearing and range to the target will be calculated for input to the spacecraft guidance computer for fully automated rendezvous and docking.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Rapid and precise 3-Dimensional imaging to measure -- at substantial stand-off distance -- range, range rate, bearing and even attitude has substantial commercial potential for assembly and inspection and for obstacle avoidance systems.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Microbial contamination, which is unavoidable inside any manned closed habitat, is a hazard of all human space flights. While microorganisms can be beneficial in the recycling of solids and waste water, they also can have detrimental effects if allowed to flourish unchecked (e.g., infection of the crew, degradation of materials, enhancement of corrosion, food contamination and spoilage, food crop damage, and contamination of water recovery systems). We propose to develop a novel, environmentally benign, antimicrobial surface modification. The modified surfaces will kill bacteria on contact, will be effective wet or dry, will be effective long-term, and will not need any additional care to maintain thin biocidal properties. The proposed surface modification can be applied to complex shapes; to either, or both, the inner and outer surfaces of those shapes; and to a variety of common plastics and fabrics.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The many applications of this technology are what make it so attractive. Since the proposed antimicrobial surface modification can be applied to a variety of plastics preformed into complex shapes, its use is virtually unlimited. Using this technique, the surfaces of common objects (e.g. doorknobs, keyboards and pads, telephones, countertops, etc.) could be modified to render them antiseptic and thus help prevent the transmission of bacterial infections. The proposed surface modifications also could be used to form antimicrobial fabrics, to treat medical devices, to produce heavy metal free anti-fouling coatings, in water filtration and other membranes, in dental and other water lines, and for glove and respirator materials.

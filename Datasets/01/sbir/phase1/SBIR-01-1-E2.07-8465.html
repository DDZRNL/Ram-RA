<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Thin-film photovoltaic cells offer the promise of high specific power arrays for space applications.  Two thin-film photovoltaics technologies are presently vying for use in space applications; copper-indium-gallium-diselenide (CIGS), and amorphous silicon.  This proposal focuses on efficiency improvements to the CIS-alloy technologies by the development of a third possibility, copper-indium-aluminum-diselenide (CIAS). This wide-bandgap thin-film technology will be deposited by co-evaporation at low substrate temperatures to lightweight and flexible polyimide substrates. To achieve the optimum bandgap of about 1.45 eV for the space solar spectrum, less than half the amount of aluminum (Al) is needed in CIAS, then gallium (Ga) in CIGS. Thus, using Al may avoid a concentration limit (bandgap limit) similar to the amount of Ga in CIGS for the degradation of material electrical quality due to Ga-Ga defect complexes. Also, the electronic quality of CIAS alloy may be less sensitive to lower temperature depositions needed for lightweight and flexible polyimide substrates. Other advantages from the wide-bandgap CIAS absorber include: higher-efficiency modules due to lower resistive and distributed diode losses; higher-efficiency modules at higher operating temperatures due to more favorable temperature coefficients of cell parameters; and high end-of-life-efficiency modules due to inherent charged particle radiation resistance of CIS based alloys.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Higher specific power space arrays allow more mission capability by reducing the weight of the space array and thereby allowing more satellite functionality or higher power arrays for additional satellite capability.  Due to the large increase of specific power available with thin-film technologies on flexible substrates versus the present single crystal array technology, ITN Energy Systems expects significant commercial and government satellite array business to become available.  The application of wide-bandgap CIAS absorber layers to the present thin-film technology will enhance performance and provide additional leverage of this technology to satellite manufacturers.

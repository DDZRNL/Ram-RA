<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Several significant potential infrared applications of tunable Fabry-Perot interferometers are not presently possible because of the unavailability of a Fabry-Perot that can be tuned at cryogenic temperatures.  For operation in the far infrared (8-12 micron) region of the electromagnetic spectrum, optics must be kept at cryogenic temperature.  At present, such devices are not commercially available for laboratory or spaceflight use.  The primary objective of this SBIR proposal is to develop and test an actuator that could be used at cryogenic temperatures based on an existing spaceflight qualified piezoelectric motor design.  This actuator would also find application in infrared astronomy, both on the ground and on instruments such as the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST).  The secondary objective of this effort is to apply this motor to the Multi-Order Etalon Sounder instrument for remote sensing of trace gases in the troposphere.  A description of the motor concept as well as the MOES instrument is included in this proposal.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Michigan Aerospace Corporation has received numerous inquiries from the astronomical community for a capacitive stabilized tunable Fabry-Perot etalon that can operate at cryogenic temperatures.  At present even though there is a market demand for the purchase of these devices, research and development funds are not available from these customers or Michigan Aerospace Corporation.  This proposed work would greatly advance the technology to the point where it is believed that a product could be offered immediately upon completion of a Phase II effort, and possibly after a Phase I effort if enough commitments could be secured from industry and the astronomical community.  Other potential commercial opportunities lie with missions such as the Next Generation Space Telescope, which Michigan Aerospace Corporation would bid on if an investment in this technology were made in time to significantly advance the development for such a bid.

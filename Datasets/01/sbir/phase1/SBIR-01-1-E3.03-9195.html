<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Success in recent high-speed multi-level Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) developments has led to a desire for increased resolution at these high frame rates.  Applications such as optical correlation, holographic storage, and multi-spot beam-steering would all benefit from the development of a very high-resolution high-speed multi-level SLM.  Today Boulder Nonlinear Systems (BNS) offers several high-speed liquid crystal SLMs custom designed for use in high-end optical systems.  The most advanced SLM is our 512x512 pixel multi-level SLM that can operate at frame rates exceeding 1000Hz.  However, many applications require even higher resolution to maximize the processing gain achieved from the highly parallel nature of the SLM .  BNS proposes to draw on its expertise in the development of high-speed binary and multi-level SLMs to develop a 1024x1024 pixel, 1000Hz, multi-level SLM.  BNS proposes during Phase I to perform conceptual design efforts for the 1024x1024 multi-level SLM.  During Phase II, the new 1024x1024 SLM and drivers would be fully designed and developed.  As the only supplier of high-speed multi-level liquid crystal SLMs and a long-time developer of optical systems, BNS is the most qualified company to complete such a program.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
BNS has built substantial business around our SLMs because we designed them exclusively for optical processing applications.  This focus of design objectives has so far resulted in four successful SLM products, the 128x128 binary SLM, the 256x256 binary SLM, the 128x128 multi-level SLM, and the 512x512 multi-level SLM.  Most of our customers select our product because our primary competitors are only interested in the high volume display market, and hence their products do not meet all of the specifications that are important to the optical processing community.  Since the introduction of our 128x128 multi-level SLM, we have received numerous requests for a higher resolution, high-speed, high-contrast, multi-level SLM such as the 1024x1024 multi-level SLM that we are proposing.  Potential customers that have shown interest in this development include those in optical correlation, holographic storage, beam steering, 3-D display, high-speed printing, atmospheric correction, and optical computing.  These inquiries have come from the space, military, commercial, and academic communities in our country as well as abroad.  With the successful completion of the proposed Phase I and II efforts, we will be in a position to offer this 1024x1024 multi-level SLM as a product, the likes of which cannot currently be found anywhere.

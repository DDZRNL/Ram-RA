<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Solar arrays are the preferred technology for spacecraft power generation, but the high solar flux and high temperature environment of near-sun inner planetary missions, and the low solar flux, low temperature environment of far-sun outer planetary missions pose severe problems for their operation. Some gravity assist missions need their solar array to operate at earth distance, near-sun and far-sun conditions, as well as planetary orbits which pose their own thermal problems due to planetary radiation and albedo. This SBIR investigates a concentrator design that has high concentration ratio to allow reasonable fluxes onto the solar cell when far from the sun, limits flux onto the solar cell when the solar array is near the sun. In addition, the design limits the thermal absorption of planetary albedo, and limits thermal rejection when far from the sun to prevent excessively cold operating temperatures. The Deep Space Concentrator design is based on a one-axis, parabolic trough reflector with a separate radiator, and uses a unique solar cell receiver aperture limitation, and a thermostat radiator to allowing operation in a wide variety of solar illumination and thermal flux environments.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Solar concentrators have commercial space and terrestrial applications because of the ability to replace expensive solar cells with inexpensive reflectors. High concentration ratios (CR) provide the best economic performance, since the solar cell material per watt is significantly reduced, but optical and thermal management techniques and their associated components are critical design features. This work advances the state-of-the-art of these critical design features, and could allow very high CR designs to be implemented, enabling the use of the most expensive, most efficient solar cells, and thereby decreasing balance-of-system costs associated with energy collection and conversion.

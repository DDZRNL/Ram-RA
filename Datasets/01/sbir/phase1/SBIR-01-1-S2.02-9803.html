<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Global Aerospace Corporation proposes to develop a new trajectory and performance model for Earth and Planetary Balloons, called Navajo. The specific innovations proposed are:
<br>
<br>*integrated Earth and planetary balloon modeling,
<br>
<br>*	integrated vertical and horizontal trajectory modeling,
<br>
<br>*	integrated safety analysis for Earth balloon trajectories,
<br>
<br>*	decoupled environment and balloon performance model architecture,
<br>
<br>*	improved fidelity of thermal models, and
<br>
<br>*	an extensible application architecture.
<br>
<br>The proposed concept integrates environment, balloon, gondola (for ballast and communications), and trajectory control system submodels to provide rapid and exhaustive evaluation of vertical and horizontal balloon and lighter-than-air trajectories. The concept utilizes an extensible architecture to permit user definition of additional balloons and environments. The Navajo architecture decouples the balloon performance and environment models so that users can swap balloon and environment models easily and assess the capabilities of new balloon technologies in a variety of environments.
<br>
<br>Instead of adapting existing models to new technology, Navajo provides the opportunity to have modeling capabilities lead the development of new technologies for Earth and planetary balloons.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Several organizations would benefit from the proposed platform concept and are potential customers for a commercial product.
<br>
<br>* NASA Planetary Aerobot Program
<br>
<br>The NASA Planetary Aerobot Program would benefit from flexible simulation tools for rapid evaluation of balloon mission scenarios on several planets, including Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn?s moon Titan, Neptune, and Uranus.
<br>
<br>* NASA Scientific Balloon Program
<br>
<br>The NASA scientific balloon program would benefit from an advanced simulation tool in several areas. First, integrated safety analyses would provide real-time analysis of mission trajectory Casualty Expectation (CE) values. Second, the capability to do rapid analyses of balloon design options will assist the development of new Earth balloon technologies and the development of new balloon envelope materials. Finally, Navajo will provide capabilities for analysis during Mars balloon envelope development activities.
<br>
<br>* Balloon Manufacturers
<br>
<br>Increasingly, balloon manufacturers are asked to provide engineering capabilities for customers. Navajo would benefit these manufacturers by providing advanced engineering capabilities. These new analysis capabilities would translate to better customer service and potentially additional sales.
<br>
<br>* Foreign Balloon Programs
<br>
<br>There are several scientific balloon programs in foreign countries. Their interests would be similar to the NASA Scientific Balloon Program in terms of safety analysis and mission design capabilities.

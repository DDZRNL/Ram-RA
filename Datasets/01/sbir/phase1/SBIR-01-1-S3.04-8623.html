<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Thorleaf Research, Inc. proposes to develop a miniature, aseptic, high pressure micro-sampling system for in situ measurements in deep subsurface environments. This addresses a key technology gap for astrobiology related studies, mainly how to acquire and process samples for in situ analysis while meeting challenging mass, volume and power constraints.  In high pressure deep subsurface environments this becomes especially important, since the integrity of the sample may be compromised by degassing of volatile components if brought to the surface. Our proposed high pressure micro-sampling inlet system addresses this by collecting a micro-sample in the high pressure environment, then transferring it into a protected low pressure environment for processing and in situ analysis.  This enabling technology will allow in situ analysis by spectroscopic measurements, GC/MS, or other techniques that inherently require low pressures for operation. The goal of our proposed SBIR Phase I effort is to demonstrate feasibility for a high pressure micro-sampling system for deep subsurface in situ measurement applications of interest to NASA, and to develop a detailed design for fabricating prototype instrumentation in Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Commercial application of the proposed high pressure micro-sampling system for in situ measurements in deep subsurface environments will address needs for scientific research instrumentation, energy exploration and environmental monitoring.  Analysis of commercial instrumentation markets shows that two of the three major growth areas for analytical instrumentation are real-time analysis and environmental monitoring, with projected annual growth rates of more than 15%.  There is a significant technology gap for low power instrumentation that can be miniaturized for field use.  The proposed SBIR effort to develop a miniaturized, high pressure micro-sampling system for in situ measurements in deep subsurface environments addresses this need in an innovative way, and thus technical developments in the proposed program could have a significant market impact.

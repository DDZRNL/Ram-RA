<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA has a need for innovative hyperspectral optical imager component technology for monitoring and measuring atmospheric, oceanic, and land processes to enable researchers and engineers to explore, analyze, and understand these complex phenomena.  Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new electrically variable filter module for optical remote hyperspectral sensing based on (1) a high efficiency very broadband holographic/diffractive dispersive element that performs high resolution spectral decomposition; and (2) a unique electrically tunable liquid crystal microprism array for continuous beam scanning, to perform spectral sampling without moving parts.  Integrating this filter module with a high resolution CCD detector array and simple data processing software will yield a highly versatile, broadband tunable, high spectral resolution miniature hyperspectral imaging sensor system.  This compact variable filter device will operate in real time (at video rate) with high optical throughput at low operating power.  These characteristics as well as light weight, small size, nonmechanical operation, and low cost will make the proposed sensor extremely useful for remote analysis and monitoring of the atmosphere, terrestrial surfaces, vegetation, clouds, and aerosols.  In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept through design, analysis, and experimental demonstration.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed CORIS imaging spectroscopic filter will have military and non-military applications.  Several NASA applications are anticipated, including measuring constituents of the atmosphere and on the Earth's surface.  There is a need for monitoring pollution in the environment from vehicular emission of gases into the atmosphere, and from various manufacturing plants.  Pollutants in hospital environments could also be detected by CORIS.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to develop a programming environment that will greatly simplify the development of natural, cooperative natural language interfaces to complex systems.  As flight operations and flight crews interact with larger numbers of complex and semi-autonomous systems, it is imperative that less demanding, more cooperative interfaces be developed.  We believe that natural language, when employed effectively, is a very effective way to interact with machines. However, effective natural language systems are notoriously difficult to build and maintain.  We believe these difficulties can be overcome by cleanly separating the most complex language issues like noun phrase resolution and dialog management, from the simpler issues of describing the components of the system being controlled.  Such a separation is made possible by defining broad Conversational Interface Domains (CIDs) that incorporate expert algorithms and heuristics for processing language within the domain.  Within a domain, the interface programmer need only describe the specific objects, actions, and relationships that make up the application behind the interface.  We believe that CIDs will significantly lower the cost and development time of natural language interfaces that really work.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
There a number of potential commercial applications of this technology.  I/NET is currently focused on the vehicle telematics domain and creating a comprehensive telematics CID will enable rapid deployment of I/NET telematics software in different vehicles and operating environments.  A number of similar applications exist in the areas of toy development, home and factory automation, and surveillance system management.

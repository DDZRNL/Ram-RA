<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Energy efficient, cost effective cryogenic distribution system technology (up to several miles) has been strongly commanded for spaceport and in-space cryogenic system. The conduction heat loss from the supports that connect the lines cold mass to the warm support structure is ultimately the most serious heat leak.  The use of magnetic levitation by permanent magnets and high temperature superconductivity (HTS) results in without mechanical contact and thus, the conduction part of the heat leak can be reduced to zero. A stop structure is carefully designed to hold the center tube when the system is warm. An innovative insulation system is also proposed to improve the performance for both rigid and flexible lines. The proposed novel design will reduce heat leak, more flexible and much less transfer loss of cryogens, thus offering the potential of extending many missions, save cryogens, or reducing the overall launch mass to accomplish a given mission.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed energy efficient, cost effective cryogen transfer lines technologies are needed in a variety of applications including the transport of liquefied gases (N2, 02, H2, He, LNG) and in superconducting applications such as high temperature superconducting (HTS) power transmission lines.

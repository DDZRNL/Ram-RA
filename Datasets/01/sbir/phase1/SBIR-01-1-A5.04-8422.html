<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The QoS IP network is widely discussed currently but discussions mainly focus on the level of IP or IPv6. In this proposal, the QoS network is implemented in a different way. An OPC based network is constructed independent of the network hardware layer. The QoS is implemented above the Transport Layer (Referring to the ISO OSI model) in the OPC scheme, rather than the Network Layer in a general way. The proposed scheme can be applied to LAN as well as WAN and it can be based on various kinds of network media, such as Ethernet, RS485, Token Ring, cellular net, etc., as long as it supports the OPC standard. Based on COM (Component Object Model) techniques, OPC was designed to meet some key requirements needed in this area for a long time. The key requirements include interface compatibility, hardware independency, Object Orientation and data exchange efficiency between different subsystems or equipment. Real-time and reliability are the two basic requirements for industry automation control. OPC also supplies some additional features that can support QoS, traffic congestion control and bandwidth adaptation.

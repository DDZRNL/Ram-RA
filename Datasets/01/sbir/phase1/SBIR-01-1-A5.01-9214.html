<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Advanced high performance cryogenic propulsion systems will be developed for second and third generation reusable launch vehicles. These systems will require higher thrust to weight ratios, demanding lighter pumps, higher operating speeds, and increased pressures. For reusable engines, cryogenic turbopump load support bearings have historically been life limiting components. New software is required to improve the design of rolling element and fluid film bearings to expand the operating envelope while improving life and reliability relative to today's hardware. An innovative bearing design tool is proposed that will facilitate improved design early in the initial pump development program. The tool will enable detailed thermomechanical design in the initial design phase. Traditionally this level of analysis has only been used to address problems that are discovered during hardware testing. The reason for this is that developing the required high fidelity models is currently complicated and expensive. A new software tool is proposed that will use a modern Graphical User Interface and model development tools to simplify the process. Thus more robust design will be accomplished in the initial design phase.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
There are currently no modern Windows-based software analysis models available that support a multi-bearing system, rotating shaft load support bearing design, that has the level of sophistication required for cryogenic pump bearings. In fact, the most frequently used bearing design codes are DOS based and lack many of the routines required to address rocket engine component design. A modern Windows based bearing code will appeal to the users of the current generation codes, which includes the aerospace, automotive, and precision instrument industries.

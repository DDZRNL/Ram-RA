<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will involve the experimental investigation of a compact high-efficiency Ka-band rf amplifier (CRFA) for rf communications applications in exploration of the solar system.  The CRFA is a compact vacuum tube that uses a simple, lightweight two-cavity system to efficiently produce high-frequency rf radiation with very high-efficiency, making the CRFA ideal for space applications.  The device is based on novel synchronous interactions between a small-diameter electron beam and high-frequency rotating wave fields.  Phase I is aimed at initial theoretical and numerical study of the CRFA, as well as particle-in-cell computer studies to establish credible estimates of output power, efficiency, gain and other key parameters.  Once fully developed, the CRFA should be capable of replacing conventional traveling-wave tubes in telecommunication systems for future space missions by offering substantial improvements in size, weight, and especially efficiency over its counterparts.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
This compact source should be able to efficiently produce hundreds of watts of electromagnetic radiation in the 32 GHz regime with electronic efficiency as high as 50%.  If successful, this rf source will efficiently provide coherent high average-power millimeter-wave radiation for many civilian and military applications that require high-frequency electromagnetic radiation.

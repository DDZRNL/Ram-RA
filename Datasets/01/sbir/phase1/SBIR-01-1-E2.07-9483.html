<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
An inflatable solar concentrator for use on a solar propulsion stage attains its needed high accuracy by smoothing the surface with a relatively-high pressure.  We are proposing to use the concentrating ability of the reflector after its propulsion mission is over to illuminate a solar array or other conversion device, like the Power Antenna program, earlier done for NASA by L'Garde.  We will draw on the data from that study concerning, for instance, where cells should be placed to obtain an even, proper illumination by the reflector.  Such a dual use can create super weight and cost efficient power systems.  However, using the reflector for power puts a burden on the inflation system, requiring substantial makeup gas for long life.  Our inovation is to apply new techniques, currently being developed by L'Garde, to rigidize a reflector once the upper orbit is reached.  These new techniques theoretically should allow the proper surface accuracy to be obtained both before and after rigidization.  We plan to build small test reflectors and test them to show that this is so.  This addresses the need of Item E2.07 for  "Adv. solar thermal power conversion technologies for .. spacecraft and .. orbit transfer vehicles...  Concentrators may be .. inflatable."

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The use of a solar propulsion upper stage has been of great interest to the aerospace prime contractors.  We have had previous discussions with them and would continue to solicit their interest by briefing them as the proposed program progresses. After a flight test demonstration, which might be done inexpensively using Phase II hardware, we think that the economics of this device will force interest from the prime contractors.  We would plan to manufacture the reflectors and associated subsystems for the primes for solar orbital transfer vehicles.  If, however, our rigidized reflectors have sufficient accuracy, and remain sufficiently low in mass, they will be of interest for a variety of other space missions.  It could open up the use of inflatable solar concentrators for such devices as Space Solar Power projects, or any satellite needing efficient and inexpensive solar power.  It may be appropriate for high-frequency microwave antennas if sufficiently accurate, being weight competitive with the dense mesh antennas needed for high frequencies.

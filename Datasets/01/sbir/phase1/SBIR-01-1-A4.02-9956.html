<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The regenerated barrel cam engine addresses the needs of the GAA engine subtopic by  providing very large reductions in life cycle cost (40-50% fuel use reduction, reduced aircraft and engine size and weight, less maintenance & overhaul),  substantial performance improvements (smaller, lighter, aircraft and more powerful engines, greater range), increased safety and reliability (diesel-like engine features, safer fuel, ease of operation), improved environmental compatibility (reduced noise and emissions, use of alternative fuels).   Regeneration has been under development at Caterpillar, ReJen, and elsewhere, under NASA, Navy, and Caterpillar funding.  The objective of this program is to combine two engine technologies: in-cylinder regeneration and the axial cylinder, barrel-cam engine design. The successful merging of these two, highly synergistic, technologies will result in a new type of engine with outstanding applicability to GAA propulsion.  The barrel cam engine circumvents several of the more severe problems confronting regenerated engine development, and the regenerated cycle reduces the peak cylinder pressure loads on the barrel cams.  Basic feasibility of the regenerated barrel cam engine appears promising based upon completed analyses and component tests.  In Phase I, detailed design of a Technology Demonstrator version of this engine will be completed.  This engine will be built and tested in Phase 2.  Caterpillar will match Phase 1 and 2 NASA funding.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
In-Cylinder regeneration can have a huge impact throughout the power generation, earthmoving, and transportation industries.  Ultimately, this new engine technology could find its way into nearly all reciprocating engines with dramatic effects on world-wide fuel usage, the national economy and employment, and US technological leadership.  This is why Caterpillar has been so interested in regeneration technology and is supporting this project.  It is most especially applicable to aircraft, where its compact size, exceptional fuel economy, and other features will result in a substantial reduction in aircraft life-cycle cost, increased performance, and improved reliability and safety.   This new approach of a barrel-cam regenerated engine offers a means to bring this technology to market sooner and to further improve its performance and applicability to aircraft.  It offers a means to most dramatically improve GAA propulsion technology.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Innovative Scientific Solutions, Inc. (ISSI) proposes the development of a high-framing rate quantitative flow imaging system, with potential application to a wide variety of optical diagnostic techniques for reacting and nonreacting flows.  The system is based around a novel "burst-mode" laser, which has been recently developed by our Ohio State University (OSU) collaborators, a version of which is currently in place at NASA Glenn Research Center.  The particular emphasis of the proposed Phase I program is to 1) demonstrate high-framing-rate velocity-field imaging using a 2D laser diagnostic technique known as Planar Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) in a reacting flow and to 2) extend the flexibility of the burst mode laser by building a prototype optical parametric oscillator (OPO) to be pumped by the burst-mode laser, enabling Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) measurements of combustion intermediate species.  The Phase II program would build upon this demonstration and design novel ways of attaining high-framing rate measurements of the 2D velocity field and minor species concentration (e.g., OH).

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Products from this program may include new research tools for the laser diagnostics community, in particular, high-speed imaging and Planar Laser-Induced fluorescence (PLIF) tools.  Although this market is relatively small (scientific market vs. broad commercial market), its impact on the understanding of high-speed combustion (and therefore on mobile and airborne power generation) could very large.  Furthermore, advances in diagnostics tools such as that proposed would likewise spur the development of advanced computational tools such as Large-Eddy Simulation (LES).

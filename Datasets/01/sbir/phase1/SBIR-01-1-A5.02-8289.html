<P><B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>A vehicle for access to space 
with the ability to successfully takeoff from and land on a land- based runway 
would have a great potential for reducing the cost and enhancing the safety of 
space access involving a reusable launch vehicle. A significant difficulty in 
attaining such an ability is the need to have acceptable low-speed handling and 
flight characteristics. In addition, a stable and robust control system for the 
low-velocity (as well as for the usual high-velocity) flight regimes is 
required. NASA is developing the X43A hypersonic vehicle with such a vision, and 
is currently exploring the vehicle's high-speed characteristics in another of 
its programs. This Phase I proposal is to explore the vehicle's low-speed flight 
envelope and handling characteristics, by performing flight tests on the 
X43A-LS, a low speed version of the X43A already developed by AAC. This work 
will lay groundwork for a Phase II effort to test adaptive controller designs 
for the X43A, to develop a supersonic version of the vehicle, to develop an 
integrated health monitoring system for the vehicle's small-scale turbine 
engine, and to explore application of AAC's high-compression video recording 
technology. 
<P><B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>The vehicle design and telemetry 
system will be a key part of hypersonic as well as commercial aircraft in the 
future. Therefore, the technology from the X-43A-LS will have a commercial use. 
Accurate Automation designed and supplied the X-43A data collection subsystem. 
The IVHS would be used on all space vehicles and for commercial aircraft in 
FOOQA systems. Accurate Automation is working with Rolls Royce and is talking 
with American and United Airlines for non engine related areas. <BR>The area of 
hypersonics will be a Billion Dollar industry within 20 years. The X43ALS is a 
key componen for the development of reusable hypersonic systems. <BR>

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The operation of the low-pressure turbine at cruise conditions produces a Reynolds number significantly below the Reynolds number at takeoff due to both property and geometric effects. Reduced Reynolds number operation in addition to recent trends towards reduced stages and highly loaded blades increases viscous effects including boundary layer growth and separation. Consequently, the efficiency of the LP turbine at cruise is significantly below that at takeoff. Technology in Blacksburg is proposing the use of an innovative flow control technique designed to improve the LP turbine performance leading to a reduction in operating costs. Flow control is achieved with miniature ejector pumps integrally machined into the blade surface. Ejector pumps provide a simple and efficient way of producing blowing designed to reduce the wake. High-pressure supply air from the compressor is injected into the flow as a high momentum jet that provides a boundary layer along the wall that is resistant to separation.  In addition, low momentum fluid in the boundary layer can be removed with suction upstream of the blowing and combined with the supply air to enhance the jet. Techsburg is proposing a comprehensive Phase I project to determine the feasibility and quantify the benefits that can be gained in efficiency and cost by implementing ejector pump flow control in the LP turbine.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed flow control system has significant potential for both military and commercial applications. Both the government and industry are currently spending significant amounts of time and funding to develop the next generation of gas turbine engines. These efforts have produced innovative technologies that will make tomorrow?s gas turbines smaller and lighter, yet better performing and more fuel-efficient. In order to take full advantage of these advances, the losses occurring in the low-pressure turbine at low Reynolds number operation must be reduced. This can be accomplished by designing a flow control system to effectively reduce separation without the addition of complex moving parts and added weight or the penalties associated with traditional bleed. The flow control system proposed by Techsburg will be designed to meet these specific needs.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Innovative technologies are needed to increase performance and reduce life-cycle cost of rocket engine components. Fabrication of lightweight engine components such as injector faceplates and nozzle ramps offer great potential for increasing thrust to weight ratios and reducing costs. Current research is being conducted on high temperature ceramics and ceramic matrix composites (CMC). Although these materials offer high temperature capability, major challenges exist for improving impact and fatigue resistance. Robust materials are needed to replace existing hardware for the Space Launch Initiative and long term 3rd generation RLV technologies. Plasma Processes, Inc. proposes to fabricate lightweight, high conductivity metal matrix composites (MMC). The composites will be formed to near net shape with a B4C or Al2O3 reinforced copper-based matrix. Diamond and carbon reinforcements will also be investigated to provide enhanced thermal conductivity. The new composites will offer as much as 50% reduced weight and higher temperature capability as compared to existing hardware and provide better fatigue resistance than monolithic ceramic or CMC materials. Additionally, the unique process will allow a HfC or ZrO2 functional gradient protective surface to be formed into the hot side of the composite, which increases the operating temperature capability, protects the composite from oxidation, and significantly increases life.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The results of the Phase I effort will clearly demonstrate the ability to fabricate lightweight high conductivity MMC components. Advanced rocket propulsion technologies will transition to higher performance and lower cost U.S. space, military and commercial rocket engines. Potential clients for MMC components are rocket engine producers and users such as NASA, DOD, Rocketdyne, Aerojet, Pratt & Whitney, Orbital Sciences, Lockheed/Martin, and Boeing. PPI will develop and transfer the technology for other commercial applications such as: Ballistic and tactical missiles, Arc-jet thrusters, heat exchangers, Welding electrodes, Plasma facing components for nuclear reactors, Integral oxidation protective coatings, Coatings for composite parts and structures, Thermal barrier coatings, Structural jackets on tubular combustors and nozzles, and Storage vessels

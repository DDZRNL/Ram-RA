<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Since human physical and cognitive performance capabilities vary over time, NASA requires technology the can help manage individual and team performance in four ways: 1) monitoring performance capability, 2) training to complement and supplement routine demands, 3) designing environments and procedures that reduce long-term degradation and 4) evaluating the effectiveness of the first three steps. Innova Products Corp. has developed a gyroscopic-based resistive exercise technology that can be adapted to a variety of training regimes and platforms for developing strength, endurance and coordination for all major muscle groups, while contributing to bone growth, mental acuity and/or relaxation. The technology includes means for monitoring and evaluating training results and allows for flexible equipment design, providing opportunity for variety and further reducing performance degradation. Phase I R/R&D will explore the limits of these capabilities in a micro-gravity environment, and in the process, demonstrate the merit and feasibility of its development. Phase I will produce: 1) virtual prototype, 2) comprehensive exercise regime, 3) durability/reliability testing, and 4) design and environmental impact analysis. Phase II will tailor these results to NASA?s needs through testing and optimization of physical prototypes supported by short and long-term human trials.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The commercial potential of Innova's Gyroscopic Resistive Exercise Technology (G-RET) lies primarily within the home and institutional fitness equipment markets.  Several leading fitness manufacturers and marketers have expressed interest in the technology and its strong potential for direct marketing sales.  Various platforms for aerobic and strength training are being developed.  The compact size and light weight of a gyroscopic-based exercise device allows for new modes of portable, personal fitness equipment.  The technology creates a highly pleasurable resistance that can more closely match the natural leverage advantages that occur over the range of an exercise movement.  Innova Products Corp. continues to pursue and obtain comprehensive patent protection of G-RET?s ongoing development.

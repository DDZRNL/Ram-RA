<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose using a novel, ultra-lightweight solar panel material in conjunction with high efficiency solar cells to demonstrate the feasibility of creating a low cost, high power-to-weight ratio deployable solar array for micro and nano-satellites.  The solar panel will include high efficiency InGaP / InGaAs dual junction solar cells, a triax laminate substrate and an under-under interconnection connection method.  Current panel technology uses aluminum honeycomb technology that weighs approximately 3.19 kg/m2.  The proposed trial laminate substrate weighs 0.37 kg/m2.  Within certain size limits we believe that this substitution, and associated weight reduction is achievable.  At the panel level this yields a Watts/kg improvement of approximately 378%.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The potential commercial applications are in commercial micro and nano-spacecraft where restrictions on size and weight are paramount.

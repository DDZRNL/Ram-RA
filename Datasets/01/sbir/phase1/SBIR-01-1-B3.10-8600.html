<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Development of key components for the Optical Waveguide (OW) Solar Plant Lighting System is proposed.  In this system, solar radiation is divided into two spectral components: photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) spectra (400 nm < lambda < 700 nm); and non-PAR spectra (lambda < 400 nm, lambda > 700 nm).  The PAR component is directed to the OW transmission line and is transmitted to the plant growth chamber, while the non-PAR spectra are converted either to electric power or to process heat.  The proposed system will improve the efficiency of plant lighting for biomass production by at least one order of magnitude over the conventional electric lighting system.  In Phase I, system configurations for three specific applications: orbit/transit flight; Lunar colony; and Mars colony, will be developed.  Experiments will be conducted to evaluate feasibility of the design concepts for each key components.  Based on the results, design concepts of the engineering system to be built and tested in Phase II will be developed.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The main application of the Optical Waveguide (OW) solar plant lighting technology is in bioregenerative space life support.  This technology meets the crucial criteria of: 1) energy efficiency, since it derives from available solar irradiance its photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) spectra for plant growth, and also captures the heat-generating spectra for storage as electric energy to be used later in operating artificial lighting when solar radiation is not available; and 2) physical volume miniaturization of the plant growth chamber, since the heat-free light transmitted by the OW system will not require extra air space to allow for heat handling.  Commercial applications of the OW solar system include: spacecraft solar power generation (photovoltaic and thermal power generation); laser power transmission and receiving between spacecraft; high pulsed power transmission without causing EMI; transmission of solar light into ocean for bio-culture; in-situ solar toxic material remediation in subsoil contaminants; and solar lighting of residential and commercial buildings.

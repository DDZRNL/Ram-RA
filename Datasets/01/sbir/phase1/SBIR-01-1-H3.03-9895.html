<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA has a pressing need for a cost-effective, miniaturized mass spectrometer to detect hazardous gases on and around space vehicles during ground activities, launch, and descent.  Recent advances in sensor technology at NASA laboratories and commercial firms have led to the development of very small detectors for mass spectrometers.  However, the vacuum systems to support these sensors remain large, heavy, power hungry, and unable to withstand launch loads while operating.  Creare proposes to build a space-qualifiable vacuum system suitable for use with a mass spectrometer.  The high-vacuum portion of the system will be based on the world's smallest turbomolecular pump, previously developed by Creare as part of another NASA effort.  In this project, the current turbomolecular pump design will be extensively modified to withstand launch loads and optimize pumping performance for the gasses of interest.  In Phase 2, this pump will be combined with a commercial diaphragm pump and, for certain spacecraft applications, another Creare-designed vacuum pump.  Together, these pumps will offer an ideal integrated vacuum system for use in a portable mass spectrometer operating under harsh environmental loads.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The high-efficiency, ruggedized vacuum system has commercial applications to support portable analytical instruments such as leak detectors and general-purpose mass spectrometers intended for harsh environments.  This includes mass spectrometers used for military chemical and biological weapons detection and general-purpose field use such as environmental monitoring and responding to emergencies.  Current-generation portable mass spectrometers are limited either by the size, mass, and ruggedness of their turbomolecular pumps or because they use less capable absorption pumps.  Building a small, light-weight, low-power, and rugged vacuum system based on a turbomolecular pump, the performance of which is tuned to the needs of miniature detectors, will greatly expand the market for portable mass spectrometers.

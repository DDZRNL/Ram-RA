<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The recycling of water to produce potable and hygiene water from wastewater is a primary goal of NASA's advanced life support programs.  Nanosize alumina fibers with small (2 nanometer) diameters offer the opportunity to construct filters with a pore size that would intercept and retain virus size as well as larger (bacteria) particles.  These fibers are also known to chemisorb metal ions and halogens such as iodine.  The proposed program would characterize such fibers for virus adhesion and modify the method of producing them to enhance such adhesion.  The optimized fibers would be combined into filter membranes and retested to assure that virus adhesion efficacy is retained in the presence of iodinated water.  Silver ion would be chemisorbed onto the filters as a biocide to inhibit fouling.  In phase 2 the capacity of such filters will be determined for large volumes of known concentrations of virus-containing water and virus + bacteria laden water. The expected filters would provide NASA with an in-line filter of high capacity that would purify pathogens from volumes of drinking water supplies at room temperature and without the use of chemicals or energy. Methods of regeneration of such filters would also be evaluated.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Current methods of virus analysis are hampered by filters that only operate under acid conditions or are extraordinarily expensive.  The proposed filters would enable the cost-effective adsorption/elution of viruses for analytical purposes.  Silver laden versions would be suitable as in-line filters in dental suites for assuring that water and aspirator lines are not cross contaminated with pathogens.  Medical devices and pharmaceutical manufacturing would benefit from on-line filters that would assure sterilization for particles as small as the smallest virus.  The filters may be suitable for purification of water for military personnel in remote locations.

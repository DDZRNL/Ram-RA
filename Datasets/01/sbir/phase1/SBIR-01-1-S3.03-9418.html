<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
An Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator (ADR) will be developed to operate between 2 K and 10 K and provide 0.1 W of cooling at 2 K. The ADR can be used as a pre-cooler for a Dilution Refrigerator (DR) or a low-temperature ADR stage. Alternatively it can be integrated into a He II storage dewar to eliminate cryogen boil-off. The magnetic material selected for operating in this temperature range is Gadolinium Gallium Garnet (GGG). During the magnetic cycling it is necessary to connect or isolate the GGG to/from the 2 K heat source and the 10 K heat sink. This is accomplished by employing components with no moving parts thereby increasing reliability. At 2 K this will be accomplished by means of a 3He heat pipe. The innovative design of the heat pipe minimizes the amount of liquid required in its operation for a fast turn-off time. At 10 K, a 4He gas-gap heat switch will be employed. The efficiency of the refrigeration cycle is greatly affected by the performances of the heat switches. In the design the on and off conductances and the switching times of the heat switches will be optimized to achieve a high cycle efficiency.

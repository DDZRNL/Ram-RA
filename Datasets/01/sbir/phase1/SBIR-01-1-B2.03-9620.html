<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A novel Miniature Automated Cell Sorting (MACS) system based on microfluidic and optical trapping technologies is proposed for separation and purification of living cells both on Earth and on spacecraft or other planets.  The MACS system, which will use laser light to manipulate target cells, will include a cell sorting microchip, laser diodes, a portable spectrometer, and a handheld computer.  Sorting of cells will be based on their induced fluorescence spectrum, size, and optical density.  The MACS chip will be fabricated using a silicone elastomer with embedded optical tweezers and sensors.  The device will perform separation of multiple cell types label-free and without the use of a conventional microscopic imaging system.  The MACS chip will be entirely self-contained, allowing relatively safe sorting of potentially biohazardous material.  The MACS system will be a portable, robust, cost-efficient cell sorter with disposable/reusable chips.
<br>
<br>In Phase I, POC will develop a proof-of-concept cell-sorting demonstration unit, and will analyze its performance experimentally.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The MACS device will meet many present and future needs of NASA and other government agencies and commercial customers for application in genetic screening and analysis, drug discovery and development, clinical diagnostics and prognostics, cell repopulating in immunodeficient individuals, and basic research in genomics and proteomics.

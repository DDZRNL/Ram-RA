<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
XCom Wireless proposes to assemble microfabricated relays with an RF circuit and a package coverplate to realize fully-packaged high-performance RF radar sub-systems.  XCom Wireless expects true-time delay phase shifters to be fundamental sub-systems of a multi-band, high-performance, low-cost, electrically-scanned antenna, so proposes the design, prototyping, and testing of an RF MEMS-enabled TTD phase shifter.  XCom Wireless is presently developing a new type of RF MEMS relay under Department of Defense contracts, which promises superior reliability to that of other RF MEMS component efforts.  XCom Wireless is dedicated to developing MEMS-enabled sub-systems for radar and communication applications using this technology; the engineering vision is to create modular, multi-functional, MEMS-enabled, high-performance beam shaping antenna front-ends.  These systems promise high functionality, operation at multiple frequencies, and a dramatic reduction in system cost, weight, volume and power consumption.  Solutions to the specific satellite radar needs of JPL and GSFC can be furthered through this proposed RF MEMS program.  By the end of the Phase II program, the development of MEMs-enabled phase shifters will allow for electronically-steerable apertures with high performance, multiple frequencies, small size, and low power consumption.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Commercial applications for RF MEMS-enabled phase shifters and related sub-systems include wireless local area networks and broadband point-to-point communications.  These markets are presently estimated at 18 million units using $240 million in components suitable for RF MEMS sub-system replacement, with a future market of 34 million units at $800 million in 2003.

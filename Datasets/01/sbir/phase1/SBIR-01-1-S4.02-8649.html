<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Robotics intended for exploration of extremely remote and harsh environments must be extraordinarily versatile as well as robust. They must be able to perform in and adapt to unknown and potentially variable physical surroundings. Robots with tracks, wheels or articulating legs have provided effective mobility on certain kinds of terrain. However, these same robots would likely fail if their mission's operational requirement included roving over roughly contoured surfaces or in media such as water, sand, slush, or ice that may be found on Mars or Europa. We will investigate a novel method for autonomous robotic locomotion over land, through water and loose sediments, and even through snow and ice. Our focus will be on the mobility methodologies derived from selected biological examples, primarily snake and worm morphologies. These creatures have evolved versatile techniques for mobility that may translate well for robotics operating in unknown workspaces. We shall examine existing research and evaluate its feasibility for our intended applications. We also will draw on our own experience and expertise of designing and building over 450 remotely operated vehicles and manned submersibles to guide us to workable designs to be investigated in Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
An autonomous robot with snake- and/or worm-like mobility has broad commercialization potential. Most robot mobility platforms are confined to a specific relatively homogeneous workspace. Worm and snake robots would possess unprecedented operational versatility, having the ability to adapt to changing conditions and component failures, facilitating seamless negotiation of many environments including land, water, and loose sediment. A natural opportunity for commercialization will be internal pipe inspection, using its capacity to easily navigate complex shapes. A vehicle of this design could perform hazardous waste site inspections and provide in situ analytical sampling and testing. Military applications include surreptitious at-sea deployment, for example, from a submarine, transiting through open water, moving inland via rivers or sewer pipes, and onto shore and then overland, even up stairs if desired. Autonomous deployment of electronic sensors or ordinance packages would be possible. The vehicle could swim to a pre-programmed site, bury itself and remain on station for extended periods either collecting data or awaiting further instructions. Like a silkworm, this kind of vehicle could spool out a real-time communications link in the form of an optical fiber.

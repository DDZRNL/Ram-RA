<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In the area of biomolecular imaging, NASA is seeking new technologies for imaging protein expression in cells at or below the diffraction-limited spatial resolution of optical microscopes.  Nanoscale imaging capable of providing sufficient resolution to distinguish protein or DNA sequence is in demand as well.  Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a novel superresolution optical microscope (SROM).  To increase the spatial resolution of microscopic imaging, several low resolution images of the object will be analyzed.  The first image is the conventional image of the testing object that contains the low harmonics of its spatial spectrum.  The second and third images are the images of the same object overlapped with a high frequency amplitude grating.  These images contain a mixture of low and high frequency spatial harmonics of the object spectrum.  Thus, using the knowledge of the low frequency spatial harmonics from the first image, high frequency spatial harmonics can be extracted from the image sequence.  As a result, we can obtain computer images with high spatial resolution.  This approach does not contradict conventional limits, because the high resolution will be obtained from several low resolution images by specially rearranging the available information.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Space travel is fraught with ever changing emergencies and accidents that place human life and expensive one-of-a-kind autonomous systems at risk.  Hypothetical collisions with space debris, human and computer errors are just a few examples of such risk. In this effort, we propose space based logistics technologies that can ameliorate and minimize the inherent risks due to space travel. We shall adapt agent based logistics technologies developed by 21st Century Technologies for DARPA's Ultra*Log project that can be exploited for use by autonomous systems and by astronauts on shuttle missions. Multiple fidelity processing is one such technology that will be demonstrated to successfully manage a simulated emergency.  Multiple fidelity processing manages the level of specificity involved in reasoning about logistics in order to receive a solution in real time. In this effort we shall demonstrate the utility of automated multiple fidelity planning for space based assets   in the context of satellite operations to present real time potential solutions to simulated emergency situations. The ability to manage such situations is necessary to promote NASA's vision of filling space with robotic explorers and making operations closer to home more efficient using ever more intelligent automated planners.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
We believe that this technology will have application in dispatching emergency services such as police fire and ambulances. With the advent of mobile pagers cell phones, and palm pilots, there is a potential niche for agent software that can help a user dispatch the services that needed while getting confirmation that the request is being satisfied. Firemen can be warned as to what type of equipment they will need when they arrive. In addition systems which monitor processes such as chemical processes in industrial complexes can alert local authorities when there is a problem so they can prepare or be on alert if they are needed.

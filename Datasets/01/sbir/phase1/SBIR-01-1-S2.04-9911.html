<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Even with multi-layer insulation blankets, cryogenic thermal switches, thermal distribution systems (such as cryogenic heat pipes), and advanced thermal/structural isolation systems, the mission capability of a fully-passive, stored cryogen system is compromised by the lack of an active cooler to recharge the system.  This shortcoming is particularly acute at very low temperatures (<15 K) because there are no proven, long-life space cryocooler technologies for that operational temperature range.  The primary technological barrier to extending proven Stirling and pulse tube technologies down to liquid helium temperatures is the absence of a regenerator design that will function at the high frequencies (> 30 Hz) required to enable small, compact designs typical of existing flexure-bearing, space-qualified cryocoolers.  Irvine Sensors Corporation proposes to develop an advanced regenerator, based upon the use of novel rare earth metal matrix designs to enable very-low-temperature Stirling and pulse tube cryocoolers for both ground and space applications.  The matrix will offer the combined benefits of low porosity and an extremely high surface-area-to-volume ratio, both of which are essential for very low temperature operation.  Our goal is to achieve a 50 percent improvement in efficiency for high-frequency regenerators operating around a cold head temperature of 5 K.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed regenerator has broad application for virtually any cryogenic refrigeration need below 15 K.  It will reduce size and mass and increase reliability of the cryocooler required for cooling the switch core of a low-temperature superconducting router being developed by ISC for the Internet backbone.  The SuperRouter? architecture is being defined to ultimately provide Internet message routing at a rate of 1E11 bits/s, which is a virtually impossible goal to achieve with conventional electronics or even optical solutions.  These routers are estimated to represent a $70M/yr. cryocooler business.  The proposed concept will offer improved efficiency, even for traditional 4 K Gifford-McMahon refrigerators, because of increased control over matrix porosity and a reduced pressure drop through the parallel plate matrix.  Magnetic resonance imaging, cryogenic vacuum pumping systems, laboratory instruments, radio astronomy, etc. comprise a potential $21M annual commercial market.  This projection is believed to be conservative in that the advent of compact, long-life 4 K cryocoolers will enable applications that are unforeseen at this time.

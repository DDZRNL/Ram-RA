<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Advanced Ceramics Research, Inc. and Prof. Rick Barrera at Rice University have recently developed materials and freeform fabrication processes based on extrusion (EFF) for high-strength engineering polymer composites reinforced with carbon nanotubes. They have found that extrusion under high pressure is the only technique that can provide some means of aligning and dispersing the nanotube fibers in a polymer composite matrix. Recent developments at NASA LaRC and Rice University suggest that polymers containing hydrogen are excellent materials to resist radiation exposure. If engineering polymers such as polyethylene, PEEK, polypropylene etc can be reinforced with carbon nanotubes filled with hydrogen, it would now be possible to fabricate high-strength, lightweight radiation shielding materials, thus obtaining multi-functional materials where one of the functions is radiation shielding.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Potential applications are for NASA and for commercial space travel, which seems to be increasingly becoming popular. All space radiation environment which humans will travel will benefit from these materials.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Changes in clouds and aerosols due to anthropogenic sources can have a dramatic impact on the earth's radiation balance.  The Earth Observing System (EOS) is a constellation of satellites that will observe clouds and aerosols from space.  These remote satellite observations require reliable in situ measurements for validation.  Current in situ validation instrumentation measures mostly physical properties of clouds and aerosols, with few, if any, direct measurements of optical properties.  An additional limitation is that the in situ instruments sample a very small (~0.1 m3 s-1) volume around research aircraft.  In Phase I we will design and build a breadboard prototype of a new, innovative in situ lidar that samples a very large (~109 m3 s-1) volume and is capable of directly measuring the volumetric extinction and absorption coefficients in clouds and the scattering coefficient in aerosols.  This novel technique emits a pulse of diffuse light and records the times of arrival of scattered photons using a suite of detectors pointing at different angles.  In addition to measuring the the bulk optical properties of clouds, the in situ lidar will measure cloud boundaries.  In Phase II, we will build and test the in situ lidar on a research aircraft and in applications on the ground that will benefit aviation safety.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Direct, large volume measurements of the optical properties of clouds and aerosols are essential for understanding the radiation balance of the earth and global warming.  Sales of in situ lidars for airborne measurements are expected worldwide.  In addition, ground-based measurements of aerosols from biomass burning and polluted urban environments will supplement sales.  Military applications include characterization of aerosols on the battlefield.  The ability of the in situ lidar to measure the depths of fog layers will find application at airports

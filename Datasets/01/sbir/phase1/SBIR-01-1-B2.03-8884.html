<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Cell culturing in space and/or microgravity offers numerous advantages and opens new applications for faster drug discovery and understanding gene expression. A growing body of data suggests that growth of cells in microgravity results in up regulation of apoptotic pathways. Understanding the apoptosis in microgravity will be crucial for long-term NASA missions, and it could provide valuable data on effects of radiation on cell growth. The overall objective of this proposal is to establish on-line, continuous monitoring of apoptotic signaling pathways in microgravity bioreactors as well as to provide a tool to rapidly assess the effectiveness of anti-tumor drugs using miniature microfluidic detectors. Two innovative approaches will be used to provide on-line monitoring of apoptosis and cytotoxicity of anti-tumor drugs in microgravity: (1) microfluidic detection of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified DNA or mRNA of cells grown in the bioreactor; and, (2) detection of cell death signaling biomolecules using molecularly imprinted polymers. Both detection systems will be incorporated into a microfluidic design with electrochemical sensors, which require no complex components. The proposed new DNA/RNA and protein sensors will be investigated on breast carcinoma cells grown in simulated microgravity in the rotating wall bioreactor, and efficiency of few commonly used anti-tumor drugs will be evaluated.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The commercial system will comprise a rotating wall bioreactor with on-line nucleic acid and protein microfluidic sensors that provide simultaneous detection of multiple elements crucial in monitoring apoptotic signaling pathways and/or cytotoxicity in bioreactors. On-line monitoring will significantly accelerate discovery of new clinical therapies and or therapeutical drugs, particularly for cancer treatment. The DNA/RNA sensor will find broad applications in genomics which could be designed as a low cost, portable, field or point of care instrument. The applications will range from biological warfare agent detection, environmental monitoring, point-of-care patient health monitoring, genomic research and forensic analysis. The protein sensor based on molecular recognition using molecularly imprinted polymers is a sensor with a flexible design, which will allow imprinting of a large number of proteins or large molecular weight biomolecules. Because of its sensitivity and specificity, it could be used in numerous point-of-care applications providing a tool for individualized medicine where drugs will be dosed based on person?s gene information.

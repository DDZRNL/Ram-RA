<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The specific innovation proposed is a fully-automated (robotic) cell-culture system (laboratory in a cassette) tentatively named "MULTICULT".  The offeror, Space Hardware Optimization Technology, Inc., of Greenville, IN, will incorporate several technical innovations.  Including options for gentle mixing of suspensions, for monolayer culturing, for controlling inertial load by rotation, for variable oxygenation, pH and oxygen monitoring, real-time imaging of cells in transparent containers.  The compact design includes computerized control of all functions, user-friendly operation, and flexible options for automated fixation of cells and/or medium addition during each experiment. Three designs will be considered, incorporating selected features from this: (1) 2-carousel unit with 0-g and variable g in a single cassette, (2)single-carousel unit with microscopic observation and (3) multidose unit with up to 12 rotating vessels.  The MULTICULT system will fit into a cassette with volume less than 2.0 L (space flight version) or on a fraction of a single shelf of a standard tissue culture incubator with external computer control. SHOT, Inc. has manufactured space-qualified and prototypical space cell culture devices of the type proposed and will utilize this experience and the proposed innovations to establish a position in space and biotechnology markets for fully automated cell culture instruments.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The need for multiple small cultures and for these technical innovations was identified in SHOT's previous research that led to a flight-qualified bioreactor prototype named "Cellcult".  On the basis of at least two surveys biological users of the space-flight environment have been requesting hardware of the type proposed, and a National Research Council report had demanded "increased throughput" in space-based biotechnology research. SHOT, Inc. has an ambitious schedule to provide services on the International Space Station using its cassette-based instruments and is marketing opportunities to use them. SHOT intends to exploit the proposed innovations to establish a position in space and biotechnology markets for fully automated, low-volume cell culture instruments.

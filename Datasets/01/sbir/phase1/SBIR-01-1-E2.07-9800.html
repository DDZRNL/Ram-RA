<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
MaxPower's Phase I proposal focuses on the development of a very high rate cathode material, and an electrolyte solution capable of exhibiting high conductivities over the extremely large temperature range of -100?C to +65?C. The development of these battery components will constitute the bases for more advanced Phase II studies which will focus on high rate, high energy density rechargeable Li-ion cells and batteries capable of meeting the requirements for batteries needed for spacecraft and terrestrial missions over this wide temperature range. Based on MaxPower's previously successful programs on vanadium oxide materials, it is concluded that this cathode is the best choice for a cathode material which can meet the requirements for rate, capacity and energy density over this wide temperature range. The selection of lithiated vanadium oxide as a cathode for a Li-ion cell broadens the choice of solvent components which can meet the very low temperature requirements. Very low freezing point solvents which cannot be used in present day commercial Li-ion cells due to their reactivity at the cathode can now be considered with the use of vanadium oxide cathode materials.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Successful introduction of high rate and high energy density rechargeable lithium-ion batteries is expected to have significance in commercial markets as well for military and aerospace markets. The key features in MaxPower's presently proposed SBIR battery R&D program are high energy density, high rate, and an operational range over an extremely wide temperature range. Uses in commercial markets include power tools, mobile computing (e.g. notebook PCs with energy and power demanding disk drives) which operate via satellite communications, implantable medical devices such as cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators, and the high power battery required for hybrid electric vehicles, e.g. in combination with a low power very high energy density fuel cell.

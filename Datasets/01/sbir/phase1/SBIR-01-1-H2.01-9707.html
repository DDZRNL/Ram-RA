<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The production of fuels from indigenous materials on the surfaces of the Moon and the planets such as Mars will result in cost savings, as these materials will not have to be transported from earth. To assist in this process, GINER ELECTROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS, LLC (GES), proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of producing methanol from the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, found in the Martian atmosphere. The reduction process will be accomplished using a novel cathode catalyst in conjunction with a proton-exchange membrane cell. In addition to methanol formation, the proposed approach will also produce oxygen.
<br>
<br>	The technical objectives of the program are to identify an efficient cathode catalyst for CO2 reduction that results in the production of methanol, develop an efficient cathode electrode structure and fabricate a complete electrochemical reactor, and to operate the reactor under a wide variety of conditions, resulting in the simultaneous production of methanol and oxygen.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Carbon dioxide is a product of combustion, and has been identified as one of the principal factors behind global warming. Removal of CO2 from stack emissions by means of adsorption processes, followed by conversion into a useful organic product such as methanol, would have a large economic potential. The specific commercial product to be developed under the proposed program would be an electrochemical reactor that produces methanol. The methanol could be used as an industrial chemical, as a fuel for automobiles, or as a fuel for direct methanol fuel cells.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A family of lightweight, space qualified, zero-power-hold membrane pre-tension adjustment actuators is proposed.  These actuators would act on the membrane boundary in a quasistatic manner to update and trim out the membrane tension and shape following deployment and after major changes in on-orbit orientation or thermal environment.  They could also be used in a semi-active manner to adjust the tension and shift the resonant modes of the membrane to frequencies separated from the spectral content of narrowband disturbances.  For broadband disturbances, they would be used to prevent the transmission of energy from the supporting structure into the membrane itself or absorb it out of the membrane.  Another interesting application involves the ability to intentionally release portions of a membrane to reduce drag/inertia demands on attitude control systems after the majority of delta V has been extracted.  Three actuator concepts will be developed through component design, testing, and integration into large membrane structure models.  Piezoelectric and electromagnetic transducers will be incorporated.  Gossamer structures such as sun shields, solar sails, improved solar cell arrays, solar concentrators, radio wave antennas and collectors, all the way to science grade optical reflective flats and curved surfaces would benefit from the proposed innovation.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed actuators could be used across a wide range of potential NASA and DOD missions covering a variety of Space Science, Earth Science, and Aerospace Transportation Enterprise major efforts such as Origins (optics and sunshields for NGST, TPF, Life Finder, Planet Imager), Structure and Evolution of the Universe (ARISE), Sun-Earth-Connection and the Living with a Star Initiative (Solar Sails for Geostorm and North and South Pole Sitters), Exploration of the Universe (Solar Sails, SEP Concentrators and large communication antennas), the  Interstellar Probes and Precursor Missions, and ASTP (Concentrators for SOTV and Solar Sails) as well as the CETP own ULSOC and Gossamer Spacecraft Initiative efforts and other programs like technology development for Space Solar Power.  Potential terrestrial applications of the technology are also foreseen in large membrane building structure control and in the multi-billion dollar fiber optic routing industry.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The objective of this SBIR is to develop and demonstrate an innovative 3-D digital beam-steering GPS receiver suitable for installation on a space vehicle.  GPS can provide a cost effective method of navigation in space and also be used for tracking space vehicles during launch and orbit entry.  GPS can also be used to perform attitude determination using interferometric processing from multiple antenna elements. 
<br>
<br>Under this effort, NAVSYS proposes to develop a 3-D digital beam-steering GPS receiver that can provide all-around GPS satellite visibility from a spinning space-vehicle; provide precision navigation for both LEO, HEO and GEO operations; and can also be used to provide precise attitude determination.  This approach leverages the commercial digital beam-steering GPS receiver, the HAGR, which has already been developed by NAVSYS for high accuracy applications.  In Phase I, the 3-D HAGR design will be prototyped using our existing technology and used to demonstrate the performance benefits for space applications.  Under Phase II, an Engineering Development Unit will be built, and delivered to GSFC for testing.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The 3-D HAGR will provide an integrated precision navigation and attitude determination solution for spacecraft reducing the cost of on-board GNC components.  The additional gain from the 3-D HAGR antenna array will provide high accuracy attitude determination and will enable low C/NO signals, such as the GPS sidelobe signals, which will increase the GPS satellite availability for space vehicles.    Applications exist for tracking commercial and military space vehicles.  The 3D-HAGR also has A/J applications for high dynamic aircraft and munitions.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
New materials, manufacturing processes, structural designs, and damage mechanisms pose continual challenges to the state-of-the-art in nondestructive evaluation (NDE).  Thick sections and complex multi-layered structures create difficult to inspect areas in which corrosion or other damage can propagate undetected. Although X-ray and ultrasonics are used for inspection of thick sections for buried flaws and hidden corrosion, they provide little information on absolute material properties.  There is a need for higher speed, wide area scanning capabilities to image not only flaws, voids, porosity, corrosion, and geometric features in complex structures, but also metallurgical properties and stresses. This Phase I effort will demonstrate high-resolution sensor arrays that combine giant magnetoresistive sensing elements with shaped field, distributed drive windings. The goal of this Phase I is to lay a broad foundation on which numerous new applications can be addressed.  Specifically, absolute conductivity and permeability mapping using magnetoresistive sensor arrays will be developed and demonstrated.  Phase I will include demonstrations both of absolute property measurement and geometric feature or defect mapping.  Phase II will demonstrate commercially viable solutions for selected applications for imaging of welds, subsurface features, heat treatment quality, residual and applied stresses (for ferrous alloys), or in-situ sensors for health monitoring.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
JENTEK?s current customer base of Fortune 500 companies (including ALCOA, Siemens, 3M, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Rolls Royce, etc.) and government agencies (including FAA, Air Force, Navy, Army, NASA, etc.) have all purchased commercial electromagnetic sensors and systems from JENTEK, and each have identified specific needs for deeper penetration imaging. These include (1) hidden corrosion mapping in aircraft, (2) in-situ health monitoring, extending the current capability of surface mountable JENTEK MWM eddy current sensors to support deep penetration damage monitoring, (3) imaging and defect mapping for cooling holes in turbine blades, (4) detection of buried inclusions in titanium castings, (5) dwell-time fatigue detection in engine disks to prevent uncontained disk failures, (6) residual and applied stress mapping in landing gear, train rail and wheels, pipelines, welds, and other alloy steel applications, (7) thick metallic coating porosity measurement, (8) 2nd and 3rd layer crack detection for aircraft lap joints, (9) thick composite characterization for impact damage, manufacturing quality, geometric features and porosity, (10) thick plate heat treat characterization, (11) burnishing assessment for ferrous and nonferrous alloys, extending the use of JENTEK sensors for the C-130/P-3 propeller population, and (12) applications in subsurface geometric feature mapping using both contact and noncontact sensors.

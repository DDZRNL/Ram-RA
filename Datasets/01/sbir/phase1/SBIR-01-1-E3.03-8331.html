<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>

<br>Differentiation is the single most important numerical operation in
<br>scientific computing.  Creating derivative functions manually or by
<br>using finite differencing is error-prone, time-consuming and
<br>potentially inaccurate.  Automatic differentiation (AD) holds great promise
<br>for overcoming these problems, but it has not caught on beyond a
<br>handful of research laboratories because the naive approaches used are
<br>inefficient.  Sophisticated static analysis of source code is required
<br>to overcome these inefficiencies.  Such tools are difficult and
<br>expensive to produce.  GrammaTech has a fifteen-year investment in
<br>advanced general-purpose static analysis tools which can be targeted
<br>towards this problem.  Our dependence-graph technology is capable of
<br>providing exactly the right kinds of analysis needed to help create
<br>efficient derivatives.  We propose to build a system for AD that will
<br>use our dependence-graph technology to provide exactly the right kinds
<br>of analysis needed to help create efficient derivatives.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The system proposed has applications in many areas of scientific
<br>computation where derivative functions are used, including
<br>optimization, nonlinear equation solving, and modeling.  These
<br>techniques are used widely in many different industries including
<br>aerospace, defense, automotive, financial, environmental, and energy.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A detailed simulation of the propagation of particles (including  photons, electrons, nucleons, 
<br>mesons and so forth) through matter is the key component of any software which aims to 
<br>evaluate the effectiveness of shielding  for materials and systems.  The same core software 
<br>is also central to the development of high energy and nuclear physics experiments; while
<br>the aim in this case is generally analysis of the performance of particle detectors, the same
<br>physical effects must be simulated, and in considerable detail.  Over the last few decades, the 
<br>high energy physics community has devoted an enormous amount of effort to the development 
<br>of software packages to simulate the  interaction of radiation with matter. We propose to 
<br>evaluate the most current and detailed of these packages to ascertain to what extent it can 
<br>be adapted and specialized for evaluation of biological  shielding.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Potential commercial applications would address any concern involving radiation shielding for 
<br>biological or other materials.  This includes the aerospace industry, where cumulative doses 
<br>to passengers and crew due to cosmic rays at high altitudes are of concern.  The code could 
<br>also be used to evaluate shielding for reactors, industrial radiography installations, and 
<br>medical imaging and radiotherapy facilities.  Other applications involve evaluation of shielding 
<br>for laboratories engaged in basic research where radioactive or X-ray sources are used.

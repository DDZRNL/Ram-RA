<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This research investigates an infrastructure to enable multiple users 
<br>to collaborative on one or more software applications projected on a
<br>large display.  Multiuser collaboration is an important element for
<br>ground operations of planetary rover and lander missions.  During the
<br>missions, scientists need to meet often to plan science activities.
<br>The multiuser collaboration infrastructure allows them to visualize
<br>science data, select targets, generate command sequence using the
<br>planning tools being displayed on a large screen simultaneously.  The
<br>infrastructure includes (1) human-computer interaction techniques to
<br>ensure natural, responsive, and accurate inputs, (2) communications
<br>protocol to ensure reliable and efficient coordinations of multimodal
<br>input devices and host computers, and (3) application-independent
<br>middleware that maintains the states and sessions, and supports
<br>interactions between individual users and the software applications.
<br>The application-independent middleware supports multiuser 
<br>collaboration on commercial and custom applications running under both
<br>the Unix and Windows platforms.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Design reviews, brainstorming sessions, and organization meetings, are 
<br>often conducted with a software application projected to a large
<br>screen to facilitate the discussion.  The software could be a
<br>PowerPoint presentation application or other design tools.  The 
<br>resulting technologies will enable the attendees to interact with the
<br>software application simultaneously, using the handhelds or laptops 
<br>they often bring to the meetings, from anywhere in the room without
<br>leaving their seats.  The technologies can also be extended to
<br>remotely control all different things, such as medical devices and
<br>home appliances.

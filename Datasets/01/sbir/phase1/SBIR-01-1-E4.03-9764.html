<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA is seeking improved capabilities to help make Earth measurement easier to use and more reliable for practitioners. Accordingly, we propose to research advanced methods for generating automatically precise elevation data from modern high spatial resolution digital stereoscopic panchromatic/multispectral sensors using improved digital auto-correlation techniques. Applications for this solution include medium-to-large-scale mapping (e.g., community development and resource/environmental management), planning (e.g., event modeling, urban, and mission), and assessment (e.g., post-disaster reporting). Highly accurate digital elevation matrices  are required to generate reference data having:
<br>
<br>- Results needing little interactive editing;
<br>- Reliable and valid elevation information;
<br>- Postings ranging from 3m-to-cm; and
<br>- Abilities to maximize the utilities provided by modern sensors.
<br>
<br>Automatic digital auto-correlation for elevation data is critical for a variety of users. Current solutions, however, have been limited due to a general lack of algorithms addressing the terrain complexities brought forth in high-spatial resolution data. (They are also typically difficult to use.) This includes generation of reference data for elevation profiles supporting vertical update point technologies and related terrain and feature models. Furthermore, the commercial and defense mapping marketplaces, computer vision industries, and the global medical imaging communities seek similar modeling solutions, which bodes well for eventual commercialization.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
A number of opportunities for a multispectral (MSI) digital correlation solution exist in the marketplace. The most promising involves providing solutions to commercial satellite systems vendors and their value-added resellers and product generation partners for sale and resale. Also, remote sensing/GIS vendors should be receptive to reselling a solution as an MSI add-on or replacement of their existing digital correlation capabilities. Lastly, government mapping agencies and commercial mapping companies worldwide are potential customers of bulk sales of the solution. During both Phase I and Phase II, research into all logical marketplaces will be performed to finalize anticipated revenue levels and per unit pricing. We believe at this point that the market value for the solution will be in the $7,500-$10,000/copy range, with embedded versions resold by partners for roughly 30-50% off standalone pricing.

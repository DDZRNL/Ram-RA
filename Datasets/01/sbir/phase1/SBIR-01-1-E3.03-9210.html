<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Josephson junction based circuits are acknowledged as one of the most promising implementations of solid-state structures for quantum computation (QC). We exploit this advantage by creating networks based on a novel Qubit Quantron "Q2" gate. Our approach features low decoherence rates with a scalability to many thousands of logic gates in existing and soon-to-exist commercial Josephson IC foundry services from HYPRES. In Phase I of this project, we move towards the goal of quantum coherent operation by experimentally demonstrating Q2 gates in the classical, but fully (physically and logically) reversible regime. Reversibility is a key prerequisite for any QC approach. In Phase II, Q2 quantum arithmetic networks comprising a main element (a mod N multiplier) of Shor's factoring algorithm will be demonstrated. By a reduction in the minimum linewidth and operating temperature of these circuits, they can be made to function in the quantum coherent regime, yielding full qubit operations. Initiating this work in the classical regime allows us, unlike others, to study several key issues - most importantly, the optimal organization of the information transfer in large reversible networks. This technology development paves the way for the commercial availability of a scalable quantum coherent logic for complex reversible networks.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed method for performing quantum coherent computing provides tractable solutions to computational tasks that simply cannot be addressed by classical computing methods. We envision Phase III contracts for both programmable, as well as application specific quantum processors, to meet these needs. For example, the factoring of large numbers (the key to US cryptographic superiority) will benefit from an exponential speed-up. Also, the searching (data mining) of terabyte databases (such as NASA experiments produce) will benefit from a quadratic speed-up. Noiseless encoding techniques also become available through the use of quantum data compression algorithms, with application to both NASA/DoD and commercial data transmission. The quantum error-correction and fault-tolerant computational techniques made available address DoE missions of nuclear stockpile stewardship by providing access to the simulation of physical (nuclear) systems at the quantum level. These applications taken together demonstrate a significant economic opportunity for the proposed technology to enhance the security, the science, and the safety of the Nation.

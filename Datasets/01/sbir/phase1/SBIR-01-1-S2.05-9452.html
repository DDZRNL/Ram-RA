<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Lightweight silicon carbide optics and structures are extremely important to explore the Structure and Evolution of the Universe.  State-of-the-art SiC is too heavy, contains other phases which interfere with producing an acceptable optical surface and is anistropic causing distortions with temperature excursions.  In this program a functionally graded density isotropic silicon carbide foam will be formed insitu with a unique high density isotropic SiC structure which has a skin of defect free silicon carbide that can be polished ultra-smooth.  The functionally density graded isotropic SiC foam structure containing no other phases will be utilized to produce SiC optics with an areal density less than 1 kg/m2.  Sample optics will be delivered to NASA.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The commercial potential in addition to lightweight optics for NASA are similar optics for defense systems and some commercial applications.  The density gradient SiC foam has a variety of commercial applications as high temperature insulation and structures.

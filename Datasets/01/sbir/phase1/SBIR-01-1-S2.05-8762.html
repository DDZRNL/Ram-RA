<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Silicon Carbide has been demonstrated as a high performance material for lightweighted optical systems because of it?s high specific stiffness and high thermal stability.  For passively athermal optical instrumentation, the metering structure can also be made of SiC, typically in the form of fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMCs).
<br>
<br>In Phase I, SSG will demonstrate a low-cost CMC material and fabrication process that combines the cost advantages and near-net-shape capabilities of our proprietary reaction bonded SiC with the fracture tough nature of traditional CMCs.  The focus in Phase I will be on developing techniques for incorporating various forms of SiC fiber (weave, long, short, chopped and whiskers) to provide design flexibility and different levels of fracture toughness and casting complexity.  Enabling these advanced CMCs is high temperature resistant SiC fibers and a novel interface layer comprised of nanocomposite boron-aluminum-nitrate (BAN) under development at the University of Illinois-Chicago and Drexel University.  This advanced interface layer will provide high temperature performance and a self-healing mechanism to prevent crack growth and degradation due to oxidation.  
<br>
<br>In Phase II, the fabrication process will be optimized and an all SiC telescope using these techniques will be designed, modeled and fabricated.
<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Commercial applications for a fracture tough, high thermal stability SiC CMCs are numerous. Commercial, space-based optical instrumentation will benefit from lightweight, stable metering structures.  High temperature engines, gas turbines and structures for spacecraft all require CMCs that can withstand high temperatures without degradation of interface layers.  All SiC structures and stages will be beneficial to the next generation of semiconductor capital equipment applications.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This 2001 NASA SBIR Phase I proposal is in response to subtopic S4.01 for Science Instruments for Conducting Solar System Exploration. This proposal describes the design of an innovative high accuracy Self-Calibrating Vector Magnetometer (SVM) for space science applications. The SVM will offer significant improvements over the state of the art in terms of size, mass, power, and accuracy. The proposed laser-pumped helium magnetometer will allow miniaturization of the helium cell sensing element, provide accurate measurements of the orthogonal vector components of the magnetic field, and incorporate a high accuracy scalar field measurement mode for in situ calibration of the instrument. The SVM will utilize fiber-optic technology to deliver and receive the laser-pumping radiation, which will allow remote location of the electronics from the boom-mounted sensing element. The helium cell sensing element will operate over a wide temperature range and will be resistant to the destructive effects of intense radiation from solar flares and energetic trapped particles in planetary magnetospheres. The SVM will have commercial, military, and space applications, and will be an important science instrument for conducting Solar System exploration.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The Self-Calibrating Vector Magnetometer (SVM) will have a variety of commercial applications. The instrument could be used for space-borne measurements of Earth's magnetic field which would support telecommunication applications and climate predictions. The SVM could be used for geophysical airborne and surface exploration, and could be used in geomagnetic observatories. The SVM could find use for intrusion detection, vehicle surveillance and shop-lifting prevention security systems. The capabilities of the SVM, with its absolute accuracy, greatly improved sensitivity, omni-directionality, and high frequency detection could open up new applications for portable magnetometers and general magnetics use.

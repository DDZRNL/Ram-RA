<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
WaveBand Corporation proposes a novel method for subsurface water detection, appropriate for planetary exploration.  It makes use of millimeter-wave/microwave radar.  However, in contrast to the current ground penetrating radar approach that relies on the detection of ice (permafrost), or solid-crust/water, interface due to the difference in their dielectric constants, WaveBand?s system is based on the detection of water-specific resonances in the millimeter wave range of the frequency spectrum.  The specific innovations are: 
<br>- Elimination of the water interface factor from the detection method.  That factor is the main source of uncertainties due to unknown interface geometry and the dielectric constants of the surface(s)
<br>- Ability to detect the presence of water in relatively small enclosures with no defined interface
<br>- Large separation between the resonance excitation frequencies and the frequency of the signal being detected
<br>In addition, the REsonance WAter Radar Detector (REWARD) will be capable of remote surface mapping and possibly of detecting some organic and inorganic water solutes.
<br>Phase I research will prove both experimentally and theoretically the feasibility of the novel method and will lead to the REWARD prototype design to be built in Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Subsurface water search remains an important problem in less developed areas.  A compact REWARD can save the cost of unnecessary drilling.  Small water pocket in various non-metalic structures can be detected using this method.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Advanced Medical Electronics (AME) proposes to develop a modular physiological monitoring and data acquisition system based on the new Bluetooth wireless LAN standard.  This innovative system will consist of battery powered wireless Bluetooth communications modules only two cubic inches in size that may be attached to a variety of equally small physiological sensors/amplifiers.  The system will be adaptable to emergency response scenarios as well as routine physiological monitoring during human space exploration missions.  The new Bluetooth self-discovering wireless networking standard offers low power consumption, small size, 10-meter range, and is well suited for a wearable physiological monitoring application.  Bluetooth uses a fast acknowledgment and frequency-hopping scheme to make the link robust in a noisy RF environment.  Devices operating in a Bluetooth network are identified by type, which allows automatic software configuration of measurement-specific digital processing routines.  In phase I, AME will work with NASA to create a design specification for the system and prototype units will be built to demonstrate functionality.  In phase II, a number of battery powered Bluetooth modules and several different sensor/amplifier front ends will be designed and built to allow full evaluation of the system.  Phase II will also include preparations for commercial production.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The commercial potential of Bluetooth enabled medical devices is significant.  The inherent modularity of the approach and the specific features of Bluetooth make it an attractive option for medical instrumentation system designers.  Advanced Medical Electronics has worked with companies like QRS Diagnostics, LLC in developing PC card (formerly PCMCIA card) modular medical instrumentation in the past.  Modular forms of medical instrumentation take functions such as pulse oximetry, ECG, blood pressure, spirometry, etc. and allow them to plug into a wide variety of handheld and portable computers.  This modularity is very attractive to customers because it allows the user interface components of the system, typically a PC or PDA, to be upgraded without having to replace the measurement specific components of the system.  In phase II, QRS Diagnostics will put the designs completed by AME into production.  The QRS position in the marketplace will allow them to quickly commercialize the products developed under this proposed SBIR.  This will assure NASA a low cost source of Bluetooth wearable modular medical instrumentation after the phase II project is complete.

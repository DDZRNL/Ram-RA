<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In this project, an innovative coremicro(TM) IMU/GPS-based hyperspectral remote sensing processing system will be developed for spaceborne and airborne in situ data collection systems. A spectral signature is a strong function of the underlying materials present within a pixel subtense, the sensor parameters, atmospheric effects and spatial/temporal events that can vary with the characteristics of the underlying materials. The coremicro IMU/GPS-based spectral radiometer registration techniques provide an efficient way to register the image collected at different times of the day and different seasons, so as to enhance the automated image processing system. The location and attitude information provided by the sensor suite of the coremicro IMU and the GPS receiver provide dynamic links to geospatial databases including environmental models. Hyperspectral data reduction is performed by a smart spectral selection algorithm. A neural network-based algorithm is developed for deriving endmembers that are logged with the hyperspectral data sets for facilitating the database query. Commercial applications include satellite image registration for wide area survey.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The techniques generated from this project have broad applications in commercial industries, including wide area remote sensing data set registration, remote sensing data collection, image processing, ground, space and sea navigation and attitude determination. The hyperspectral data reduction and neural network-based endmember selection algorithms enhance material detection/identification, so as to advance the remote sensing database analysis and understanding.

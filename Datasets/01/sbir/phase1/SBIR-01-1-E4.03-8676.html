<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This project will produce a Universal Wireless Sensor Interface that allows wireless location and situation dependent communication, data collection and analysis in near real-time with remote environmental sensors. Additionally, an environmental quality management system for remote environmental sensing and real-time monitoring integrated with predictive models to provide a environmental hazard management system that tightly integrates preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery phases of environmental management will be implemented to construct an end to end system.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
An architecture will be developed that will integrate multiple emerging wireless technologies into a single interoperable wireless communications backbone. This additional capability will enable the advanced location and context intelligent algorithms to extend and enhance existing information systems and networks. Wireless networking is an emerging market with tremendous potential in the US DOD, petro&#64979;chemical, pulp and paper, construction industry, aerospace and chemical manufacturing markets.  Wireless installation addresses the primary cost factor limiting implementation of high performance networking.  As the use of RF spectrum increases, schemes that make more efficient use of the available spectrum will gain commercial advantage and realize the burgeoning market for Wireless networking.

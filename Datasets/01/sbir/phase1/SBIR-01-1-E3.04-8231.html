<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Current atmospheric correction programs (MODTRAN, ACORN, etc.) were designed for a single IFOV imager.  They assume the spectral response for each element in a spectral band is the same.  While this assumption is valid for a single IFOV instrument since there is a single detector element for each band, it is not valid for scanning instruments that use 2D FPA's.  This proposal is to develop algorithms followed by software that performs radiometric calibration and atmopsheric correction on hyperspectral data taken with sensors using 2D focal planes.  Phase I will use third party software (MODTRAN) to generate the atmospheric model.  That model will be applied separately to each FPA element for improved calibration accuracy.  The software will be written to accommodate other models (such as those using polarimetry) for incremental capability improvement.  The processing time will be fast enough for near real time analysis.  The design will include the use of in situ GPS and other (height over ground, etc.) data in the atmopsheric modeling.  Intelligent decision making on the atmospheric modeling will also be supported, allowing automated changes in the atmospheric model based on collected data.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The commercial applications of hyperspectral technology are growing by the day.  The ability to achieve improved levels of calibration accuracy is key to utility in a number of new markets.
<br>
<br>One of these markets is airborne agricultural mapping with the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV's).  GeoData Systems of Washington, D.C. is one of several companies that we are dealing with to provide hyperspectral imagery for land use analysis and mineral exploration.
<br>
<br>Another market that will make use of the technology is the medical industry.  Doctor's offices will be able to routinely detect skin melanomas during physicals before they can be detected visually.  Army physical inductions can employ these instruments for similar purposes.  And airports, and other personnel processing facilities, can provide remote screening for tuberculosis and other communicable diseases.
<br>
<br>Finally, schools will have an affordable technology to explore earth's environmental forces, and provide a training ground for our next generation scientists and engineers.  
<br>
<br>We envision the opportunity to sell several hundred production units over the next ten years in these lucrative commercial markets.

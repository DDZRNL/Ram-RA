<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Future space-based astronomical observatories will require long-life, vibration-free mechanical cryocoolers for sensor cooling.  Of the candidate mechanical cryocoolers, the turbomachine-based reverse-Brayton cryocooler (TRBC) exhibits the most attractive combination of low vibration, high reliability, low mass, flexible integration, and high efficiency.  In recent years, this technology has achieved a high level of maturity through a space flight qualification program and flight test.  The opportunity now exists for breakthrough reductions in size and mass, and improvements in system integration.  The goal of the proposed effort is to develop a compact, lightweight TRBC that will easily integrate with:  (1) high and low temperature radiators to improve system performance; (2) other TRBCs to allow multi-stage cooling at lower temperatures; and (3) other types of coolers such as adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators to allow efficient cooling at sub-Kelvin temperatures.  The key innovation is a single turbomachine that provides both the compression and expansion of the cycle gas.  During Phase I, we will develop a preliminary design of a compact TRBC, identify a range of applications, and demonstrate the operation of the turbomachine at prototypical speeds.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
This program will result in the development of a turbo-Brayton cooler that will exhibit all of the proven benefits of this technology including low vibration, low mass, long life, high reliability, and high efficiency.  In addition, the cooler will be compact and very flexible with regards to system integration and operating range.  Scientific applications include space-based sensors and cryogen production and storage for space exploration missions.  Military applications for this cooling system will include space-based surveillance and cryogenic cooling of fuels on orbiting platforms.  Commercial applications include cooling for communication satellites, superconducting circuits and motors, low-temperature gas separators and liquefiers, and cryogenically cooled computers.  Compact power generation systems using the same basic technology will find application as man-portable power sources.

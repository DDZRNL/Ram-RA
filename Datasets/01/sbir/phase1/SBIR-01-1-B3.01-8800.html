<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Trace Contaminant Control Subassembly (TCCS) to be used onboard the International Space Station (ISS) uses adsorption beds in-line with a conventional high temperature catalytic oxidizer to control trace chemical contaminants in the cabin air. Although effective, the current design has a high life cycle operating cost associated with it. In order to improve the TCCS's process economics, a retrofit to its primary design has been developed by Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI), which utilizes an advanced technology lightweight, compact, long-life catalytic converter and is in advanced stages of technology demonstration at NASA. The retrofit provides significant power and annual-cost savings over the current TCCS design by integrating the catalytic oxidizer and heater through the use of an electrically conducting ultra-short micro-channel substrate. This catalytic substrate, patented by PCI (Microlith&reg;), has very high heat and mass transfer coefficients and has proven to be durable in initial tests at NASA. In this NASA Phase I Proposal PCI intends to build on this innovative substrate based TCCS, to significantly further reduce life cycle operating costs by integrating the adsorption bed within the directly heated Microlith&reg; catalytic oxidizer and thereby eliminate the current activated charcoal beds.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The primary commercial application of the technology as proposed in this NASA Phase I work will be in the manufacture of light weight, compact adsorber/oxidizer components for use in air purification systems.  PCI would first target crew cabins or enclosed spaces such as: Space craft, Airplanes, Submarines, Hospital operating rooms, Ships, and Process Industry Control Rooms.	Regenerative personnel protective devices against toxic gas, airborne toxins or biological agents would be an application for small scale versions of the adsorber/oxidizer.  Industrial manufacturing applications such as semiconductor manufacture where solvents or emissions are a concern would be potential larger scale application areas.  
<br>
<br>Following succesful development of adsorbents on Microlith?Y from the NASA Phase I , some major spin off applications would be investigated by PCI in the area of selective adsorption and desorption/oxidation cycles during automotive engine cold starts, (an area where fast light off Microlith?Y catalytic devices are already being tested).  In the manufacture of chemicals, targeted constituent capture through cyclic adsorption/desorption and integrated catalytic reactor elements may permit active, !?selective!? catalytic reactors to enhance product yields.

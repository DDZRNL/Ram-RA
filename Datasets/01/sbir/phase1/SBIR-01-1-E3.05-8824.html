<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Current and future NASA Cave Automatic Virtual Environments (CAVEs) require high quality multi-channel real-time, full 30-60 frames per second (fps) video compression, for which high-compression-ratio, effectively-lossless compression remains the only practical solution.  Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a unique ultra-high quality video compression based on proprietary, object oriented  compression technology to reduce the high bandwidth requirement for the CAVE system.  The proposed Multi-Channel Object Oriented (MCOO) system will include use of novel multi-channel compression, soft computing, and optimized motion estimation algorithm.  Our goal is to provide virtually lossless multi-channel video compression reducing the data rate to ATM OC-3 level (155 Mbps corresponding to compression ratio of ~150:1).  Such a reduction of the data rate will open completely new applications for CAVE-like visualization where a computational center can send the multi-channel video data to a remote location where the CAVE visualization unit is installed.  The distances between the computing center and the visualization center can be as great as several thousands of miles.  POC will demonstrate a system with a latency of 10 ms.  The Phase I program will be concluded with high quality video compression hardware applicable to the CAVE system.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The MCOO technology will improve the functionality of cellular video-phones, video conferencing, video screens, video surveillance systems, distance learning and many other systems.  In addition, a very attractive market emerges from MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 compatible broadcast Digital TV (DTV) and video editing and interactive (MPEG-4) systems. Video surveillance and telemedical applications represent smaller but still promising markets.

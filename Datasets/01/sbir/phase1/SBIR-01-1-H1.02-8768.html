<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
	In nature, there are numerous examples of complex architectures constructed by relatively simple insects, such as termites and wasps, which cooperatively assemble their nests.  Emulating this biological model, a new cooperative multi-robot control architecture suitable for the eventual construction of large space structures is proposed.  In the proposed system, the actions of each of the autonomous robotic construction agents are only indirectly coordinated, thus mimicking the distributed construction processes of various social insects.   The proposed robotic construction agents will perform their primary duties stigmergically, i.e., without direct inter-agent communication and without a preprogrammed global blueprint of the final design.  Communication and coordination between individual agents occurs indirectly through the sensed modifications that each agent makes to the structure.  The global stigmergic building algorithm proposed assumes that the robotic builders only perceive the current state of the structure under construction; however, the incorporation of additional agent interaction algorithms such as collision avoidance and queuing is required for successful application to real world robotics.  The simulation tools resulting from the proposed research are intended to address the system architecture design and assembly requirements for future large space structures using biologically inspired algorithms.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
	The development of a flexible, cooperative multi-robot control architecture which incorporates a stigmergic building algorithm has the potential to produce significant commercial applications.  Coordinating the actions of multiple robots in order to achieve a particular goal is a very challenging task, but the application of stigmergic principles may lead to a simplification of the undertaking.  It is possible that large scale construction projects (e.g., ships and buildings) can benefit from the coordinated control architecture when used in conjunction with autonomous assembly robots.
<br>	In addition to the construction of large structural assemblies, it may become possible in the relatively near future to build very small items by using nanotechnology to create very small robotic agents.  A common scenario for the envisioned technology involves many individual nanobots working collectively, hence requiring a cooperative control architecture that can coordinate their activities.  It is anticipated that the proposed research will produce a stigmergically based control architecture that can be applied to the emerging field of nanotechnology.

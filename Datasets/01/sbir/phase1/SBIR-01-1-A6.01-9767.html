<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A high power RF plasma thruster is proposed.  A point design is presented capable of ten megawatts with only
<br>a thirty centimeter diameter plasma diameter and less than five meters long.  Subscale tests are planned to verify
<br>plasma separation from field lines, necessary for thruster feasibility.  Plasma density versus magnetic field, 
<br>RF power, and other parameters will also be compared with the model of operation, allowing extrapolation of plasma
<br>parameters to the ten megawatt level.  The RF plasma thruster offers very high thrust density, no grids or electrodes
<br>to limit lifetime or create contamination problems, variable specific impulse, and a simple design with no close 
<br>tolerances which can be cheaply manufactured.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Electric thrusters are much more efficient in use of propellant than chemical thrusters.  They are gradually entering 
<br>service.  The newest proposed commercial geosynchronous communications satellites use electric, with a 
<br>propellant savings of perhaps a factor of ten.  It will be some time before there will be a commercial application for a
<br>ten megawatt thruster, but we expect it will eventually happen.  In the meantime, the RF plasma thruster can be 
<br>used in lower power thrusters, where it may have advantages in terms of cost, compactness, long life, and lack of
<br>contamination.

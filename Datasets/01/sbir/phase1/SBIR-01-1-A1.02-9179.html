<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The ultimate objective of the proposed project is to develop a practical onboard, inert-gas generation system for fuel tank inerting on small transport aircraft (e.g. Boeing 737).  The system would operate autonomously and provide inert gas to the fuel tank ullage, maintaining an inert environment in the fuel tanks during all phases of aircraft operation, including descent and ground operation.  The proposed system would be based upon a novel system comprising semi-permeable membrane air separation modules; a unique two-impeller, one-expander, electrically-assisted turbocompressor operating in foil bearings; and lightweight heat exchangers.  The system will address the key issues associated with small transport aircraft fuel tank inerting: minimal or no electrical power available on the ground, minimal or no bleed air available in most phases of flight, and the critical need for effective inerting during ground operations.  The Phase I effort will focus on developing specifications for the system, producing a preliminary system design, identifying key technology elements that require further development, and producing a preliminary palletized system design for a future flight test.  In Phase II, we will demonstrate key technology components and further define the palletized system test to be conducted during Phase III.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
A small transport aircraft fuel tank inerting system has significant business potential.  It is anticipated that forthcoming rules from the FAA will potentially require that fuel tank ullage be inerted on commercial transport aircraft during a significant portion of the operational envelope.  If this airworthiness directive is issued, it will create an immediate, large and ongoing market for this technology.

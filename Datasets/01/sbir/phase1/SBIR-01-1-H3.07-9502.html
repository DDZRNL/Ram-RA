<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Current nuclear reactor plant sensor technology is heavy, and is limited by the number of sensors that can be placed per reactor penetration resulting in less than optimum efficiency, and reduced reactor safety.  Luna Innovations proposes to develop an extremely lightweight fiber optic temperature sensing system that will allow the precise placement of hundreds of individual temperature sensors along a single optical fiber and will improve reactor safety and efficiency, and reduce weight.  Low reflectivity distributed fiber Bragg gratings are currently used in temperature sensing systems with optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) to measure temperatures along optical fibers with an accuracy of better than 1.0 oC, and a spatial resolution of less than 0.1 mm.  This technology allows the placement of hundreds (800 is common) of individual temperature sensors along a single fiber.  Current OFDR temperature sensing systems must be optimized for use in nuclear reactor plants through the use of radiation resistant fibers and chemically protective housings.  In phase I, radiation resistant fibers will be used to fabricate low reflectivity distributed fiber Bragg gratings, and housing materials will be surveyed for their suitability in various reactor plant environments.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The optical frequency domain reflectometry temperature system may be adapted for use not only in space-based fission reactors, but commercial nuclear and conventional power plants as well.  Implementing these systems will allow more accurate control of energy production, improve safety, and reduce the overall cost and weight of power plant sensor suites.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
WaveBand Corporation (WaveBand) proposes a new sensor for MMW imaging.  The sensor is distinguished by low cost, compactness, and compatibility with microelectronics mass production technology.  The sensor represents an array of monolithically integrated pyroelectric capacitors, MMW antennas and MEMS switches.
<br>WaveBand?s innovative approach blends two recently matured technologies to create a qualitatively new MMW sensor that will make a passive MMW imager a commercially viable product in a way that IR cameras currently are. In this project, WaveBand will address the major challenge involved in designing a pyroelectric-based MMW focal plane array, which is to prove that the proposed sensor achieves high enough sensitivity to generate real-time MMW images.
<br>Specifically, in Phase I of the project, WaveBand proposes to explore new sensitive materials, design the sensor array, and prove its feasibility by simulation its operating parameters.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The millimeter-wave imaging has many applications including aircraft navigation, remote sensing of earth resources, ice mapping, surface mapping, atmospheric data collection from high altitude aircraft, surface sensing of geographic features, oil spill detection, natural disaster assessment, contraband detection, automobile collision avoidance, fire fighting, and aircraft landing/ taxiing in inclement weather.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The purpose of this project is to develop a novel system to support the high speed information exchange between varies spacecraft subsystems. The structure of this system is based on high speed Local Area Network (LAN) and advanced device server technologies, which have been proved to be commercially successful in many areas of applications. This system will increase the rate of data transfer above 20 Mbits/s to fulfill the requirements of self-diagnosis, autonomous control, and science data transfer.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The direct result of this SBIR project is a commercial product ?C a Network Enabled AGNCTM-2000 coremicroTM IMU. It can be used for navigation, guidance, control, tracking, pointing, and stabilization systems in areas such as ground adn sea vehicles, micro rovers, micro tracking mechanisms, robot, and miniature underwater vehicles. The second result of this SBIR project is a network control system. This software package performs functions like network management, monitoring, and self-diagnosys. This is a very promising tool set for business with a Local Area Network.

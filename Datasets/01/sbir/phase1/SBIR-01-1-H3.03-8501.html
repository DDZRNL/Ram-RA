<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Many hazardous gases that NASA needs to monitor on and around space vehicles could be detected using mass spectrometers that need operate over only a limited mass range.  But, stringent requirements of low weight and low power operation, plus the ability to tolerate high G-forces and excessive vibration prevent the ready adaptation of existing, commercial mass spectrometers to these applications.  We propose a novel, compact, inexpensive, low power, time-of-flight mass spectrometer that will tolerate the harsh operating conditions.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The planned technology also has commercial application as a low cost, portable sensor for leak detection, hygrometry, breathing air monitoring, and residual gas analysis.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The key to producing reliable engine diagnostics and prognostics resides in the fusion of multisensor data.  There are many different approaches to support the development of such systems.  These can be generalized into three basic classes.  First are physical models.  Second are rule-of-thumb systems developed and refined by human engineering and maintenance experts. Third are statistical models that ?learn? from examination of real data that contain nominal and known fault conditions.  Each of those techniques has unique strengths and weaknesses.  Proposed here is the fusion of models from all three classes to produce a unique hybrid engine diagnostic and prognostic system.  Fusion of sensors and techniques has been shown to improve detection and classification performance while simultaneously significantly reducing false alarms.  The proposed development team is unique as well.  IAC has proven statistical and hybrid system development expertise and has already developed a variety of statistical fusion techniques for engine diagnostics and prognostics.  Pratt & Whitney, world leaders in the design and production of gas turbine engines, will be supplying expertise and C17/F117 engine data from on-going in-flight collections with NASA.  Luppold & Associates has designed many of Pratt & Whitney?s advanced control systems and will supply physical model expertise.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The potential commercial applications for the technology, techniques, and systems to ultimately come out of this SBIR are significant.  Pratt & Whitney, a partner on Phase I, is interested in applying the technology developed here to its engines.  If Phase I is successful, Pratt & Whitney will also participate on Phase II and will be a potential Phase III transition / commercialization partner. The technology to be developed here can be applied to significantly improve automated monitoring and condition-based maintenance of all military and commercial aircraft gas turbine engines as well as all commercial / industrial gas turbine engines (such as those used in electrical generation plants).

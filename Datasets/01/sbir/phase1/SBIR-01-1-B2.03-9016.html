<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
It is well established that microgravity affects many fundamental biological processes, including cell and tissue growth in culture.  Consequently, NASA has been developing bioreactors for space-based research.  Because opportunities for space experimentation are limited, bioreactors have also been developed to simulate microgravity on earth so that diverse lines of research may be pursued by ground-based laboratory investigators.  An extant challenge is the development of bioproduct recovery systems and analytical sensors for on-line, real-time monitoring of bioreactor status and production.  Ciencia has been developing a protein microarray biosensor system based on Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) detection that will enable highly multiplexed, real-time monitoring of bioreactor products.  To best exploit this technology, improved methods need to be developed to immobilize large numbers of proteins on a high-density micropattern to create a sensor chip.  This proposal addresses this need.  We propose to develop a new technology for production of high-density protein microarray sensing chips utilizing an innovative PNA (peptide nucleic acid) site-directed self-assembly approach. Resulting chips when integrated into the SPR system will permit direct seamless coupling between bioreactor samples and the biosensor to make it possible and convenient to quantitatively monitor production of up to hundreds of products simultaneously in real time.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The commercial application that will be the focus of the proposed SPR technology is high throughput screening for drug discovery. The proposed site-directed, self-assembled microarrays will enable the production of ?disposable? chips, which in combination with the SPR detection hardware will create a highly flexible platform, providing for the first time, massively parallel detection of hundreds to thousands of binding events along with kinetics without the limitations of a reporter molecule.  A recent survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers reflected that the timely development of new products is the most important issue facing the pharmaceutical industry.  There is a multi-billion dollar worldwide market for systems and consumables related to functional genomics, proteomics and drug discovery research.  Pharmaceutical companies alone-spent billions of dollars on tools related to drug discovery in 1999 and this number is rapidly increasing.  Now that mapping of the human genome has been essentially completed, there is increasing emphasis in discovering new ?druggable? targets.

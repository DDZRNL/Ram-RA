<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
An integral element of meeting NASA's objective of tripling airport
<br>throughput over the next decade is the utilization of helicopters and
<br>tiltrotors to provide feeder service to major airports.  Among the key
<br>challenges in ensuring safe, high-volume terminal area rotorcraft
<br>operations are identifying and mitigating potential hazards posed by
<br>complex aeromechanical interactions ranging from wake vortex encounters to
<br>powered flight in steep descent.  To address these challenges, it is
<br>imperative to develop fast yet high-fidelity rotorcraft vortex wake
<br>modeling methods and simulation models in these flight regimes.  To meet
<br>this need, a physics-based analysis will be developed that captures key
<br>aspects of rotorcraft wake aeromechanics in the complex terminal area
<br>flight environment, including both interactions with wakes of nearby
<br>aircraft and "self-interactions", such as vortex ring state.  The enabling
<br>technical innovation will be novel fast viscous/turbulent wake decay and
<br>vorticity transport methodologies tailored to rotorcraft and coupled with
<br>the state-of-the-art real time free wake simulation capabilities of the
<br>CHARM rotorcraft model.  The resulting product will be a hierarchy of
<br>models enabling both detailed off-line assessment and on-line real-time flight simulation of potentially hazardous flight conditions including rotorcraft wake encounters and vortex ring state.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed simulation could be used to determine safe operation
<br>procedures for tiltrotors and rotorcraft used as shuttle service between
<br>local airports and major airport hubs.  Assessment results from this code
<br>could be implemented within or used in support of NASA's AVOSS system for
<br>reducing IFR spacing requirements between tiltrotors and aircraft.
<br>Rotorcraft manufacturers could use this tool to enhance "design for safety"
<br>of future rotorcraft.  In addition, a capability for predicting rotorcraft
<br>flight dynamics in terminal area operations would directly support flight
<br>training activities by simulation manufacturers and rotorcraft operators,
<br>as well as the military services.

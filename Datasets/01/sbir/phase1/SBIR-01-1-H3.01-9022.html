<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal describes a research project to develop a freezable radiator for space systems where
<br>the heat loads and dissipation requirements are time-varying.  The proposed approach is expected
<br>to lead to radiator designs with significantly lower size and weight compared to current systems.
<br>
<br>During the Phase I studies, a theoretical model will be developed in order to provide a basis for the
<br>design of the proposed radiator.  This will be combined with experimental studies to verify/evaluate
<br>the practical feasibility of various designs.  Manufacturing and systems issues will also be evaluated
<br>as part of the Phase I research.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Lightweight, compact, freezable space radiators are critical in reducing costs related to space
<br>transportation of future satellites and other space systems.  The proposed approach is also
<br>applicable for heat sinks for electronic components which have enormous commercial applications.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Human exploration and development of space is currently limited by the high cost and technical difficulty of transporting materials from Earth to develop local infrastructure.  The proposed research will enhance the development of new structural materials which can be produced in large quantities using mineral-based resources which are locally available and abundant on the Moon, and potentially on other planetary bodies.  The innovation is to apply novel glass and glass fiber processing technologies to iron-calcium aluminosilicate lunar regolith materials.  The Phase I research will: (i) establish synthesis conditions and identify critical process-property relationships, including effects of composition, needed for production of structural glasses and glass fibers from lunar regolith, (ii) measure the mechanical properties and thermal stability of selected prototype glasses, and (iii) identify requirements for large-scale production of the materials.  The Phase II R&D will identify requirements for  and implement pilot-scale production of the glass materials for applications testing  by NASA.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The principal commercial application of the proposed process and materials technologies will result from transfer of technology and know how to NASA for use in the exploration and exploitation of space.   The value of the technology derives from the reduced cost of launching and servicing flight programs and from the new capabilities to support NASA?s mission.   Advances in glass and glass fiber technologies enabled by the proposed research will benefit earth-based manufacturing of materials with large commercial markets.

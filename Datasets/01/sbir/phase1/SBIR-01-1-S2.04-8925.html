<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Cross-flow micro heat exchangers and regenerators of the type specified in this proposal offer great savings in applications where both heat transfer/unit volume or heat transfer/unit mass are important.  While prototype micro cross-flow heat exchangers have been built from polymers and metals, the manufacturing methods used are prohibitively expensive for most applications. Presently, no one has shown the feasibility to mass-produce via molding (embossing) metal micro parts with heights of several hundred micrometers and aspect ratios (height/width) that are fairly high (five to ten).  This proposal will test the premise that the surfaces of micro molds can be modified to make embossing of metal micro devices feasible.  The result will be devices such as micro heat exchangers/regenerators made from metals such as aluminum and lead with superior performance.  Specifically, a number of ceramic/metal coatings will be applied to LIGA molds with a variety of aspect ratios using a PVD/CVD system.  Embossing experiments will be performed and the forces required to eject the parts as well as the quality of the parts will be quantified as a function of coating system.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Cross-flow heat exchangers of the configuration used in automobile radiators are used when pressure drop of one of the fluids (usually a gas) needs to be minimized.  A microcross-flow heat exchanger can offer performance advantages over conventional scale radiators in performance parameters such as heat transfer/unit weight with virtually no penalty associated with pressure drop.  In automobile and aerospace applications, highly effective heat exchangers with little mass or volume have great value.  The same principles that make micro heat exchangers effective also apply to regenerators and mass transfer-limited reaction devices such as catalytic converters.  Inexpensively embossing all these devices with high aspect ratio micro features from metals (aluminum and lead have been selected in this proposal) will make them attractive economically.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
HyPerComp Engineering, Inc. proposes to evaluate the potential for superior low velocity impact resistance in hybrid high strength carbon/Zylon? filament wound pressure vessels. 
<br>
<br>High performance pressure vessels utilizing carbon fibers have historically been prone to impact damage.   High tensile strength fibers typically result in light pressure vessels having thin walls; these characteristics combined with carbon fiber's sensitivity to ?bruising' can result in significant  impact damage risk.  Even relatively light and difficult to detect impacts can potentially degrade the capability of the pressure vessel.
<br>
<br>The recent introduction of the Toyobo Zylon? fiber (also know as PBO) provides the potential for significantly improving the impact resistance of  light weight pressure vessels.  While sharing the toughness typical of Kevlar?, Zylon? is noteworthy because of its dramatically increased fiber strength and fiber modulus.  These characteristics make it a very good match to high strength carbon fiber for pressure vessel applications.   In the proposed study filament wound pressure vessel impact resistance as affected by the percent of hybridization, sequencing of hybridization, etc., will be characterized.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
HyPerComp Engineering specializes in the design, development, testing, and certification  of commercial filament wound composite pressure vessels for applications ranging from self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) to compressed natural gas.  While not a commercial manufacturer of pressure vessels HyPerComp Engineering has and continues to work with most of the major manufacturers throughout the United States and in many parts of the world, these include Pressure Technology, Pressed Steel Tank, Structural Composites Inc., and many others.
<br>
<br>Improvements in filament wound composite pressure vessels are constantly being sought after.  Any advance in technology that can make these products lighter, safer, or more cost effective to fabricate is readily incorporated into their design and fabrication.  HyPerComp Engineering intends to incorporate information obtained through this SBIR into the ?next generation' of composite pressure vessels developed for the industry.
<br>
<br>A particular focus for technology obtained from the proposed study would be the high performance pressure vessels used in aerospace and defense applications.  As mentioned previously the thin walled nature of these pressure vessels makes them susceptible to damage and prime candidates for any technology that might improve their damage tolerance.

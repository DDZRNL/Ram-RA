<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Stimulated by the rapidly increasing commercial and military applications, the U.S. infrared sensor market will double from 1994 to 2001, will be over $1.3 billion by the year of 2001 with an annual growth rate of about 12% as predicted by Frost & Sullivan. Reduction in cost, size, weight and power consumption is crucial to both commercial and military applications. In addition, integrated devices and systems compatible with typical semiconductor process are becoming more and more needed. To meet these requirements, pyroelectric thin films are being used to develop new classes of infrared sensors with high sensitivity, low noise, low power consumption and smaller size. Using its innovative, high volume, low cost and open-air Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition (CCVD) technique, MCT?s proposed Phase I program is to deposit dense, textured pyroelectric thin films on single crystal substrates for the applications of infrared (IR) sensors for non-contact temperature measurement, gas analysis, IR imaging, etc. and to evaluate the chemical, dielectric and pyroelectric properties of these films.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed Phase I program will provide the basis for a new enabling technology for the cost-effective fabrication of integrated infrared sensors for the applications of non-contact temperature measurement, gas analysis, IR imaging, etc. The know-how for depositing high quality coatings will be applied to fabricate the textured pyroelectric thin films. So MCT and team members are becoming well positioned to capture a large share of fast growing market of infrared devices and systems. The infrared sensing industry will benefit from this technology, which will enable low cost, low power consumption and high performance infrared devices in the very near future. The success in this work will benefit both U.S. military and commercial applications.

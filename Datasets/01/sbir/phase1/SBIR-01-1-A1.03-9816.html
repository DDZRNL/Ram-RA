<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
One of the most overlooked aspects of health management in aging aircraft is monitoring of the wiring and interconnection systems themselves.  Brought to public attention by the crashes of TWA 800 and SwissAir 111, the problem of wiring faults and even fires on aircraft been the subject of investigation by numerous government and civilian agencies.  Military needs are no less severe.  Using a combined approach which can automatically diagnose problems on the ground as well as in flight, IPITEK's Smart Universal Sensor Interface (SUSI) can provide multi-faceted health monitoring as well as other value-added performance features such as piecewise upgrades, smart functions, reconfigurability, adaptability to a wide range of subsystems, network integration, and support for both copper and fiber interconnectivity.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
SUSI is not only designed for advanced diagnostics and other added features but also to reduce weight, wiring, component, and subsystem overhead, which can lead to further operational cost savings.  Both military and commercial aircraft could benefit from advanced smart sensor systems capable of providing real-time data on subsystem health.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Triton is responding to NASA?s need for space durable polymeric materials for ultra-lightweight structures and optics with an advanced new colorless space durable polymer, TOR-NC.  This new polyimide is specifically engineered for resistance to atomic oxygen (AO), ultraviolet (UV) and particle radiation. This new polyimide also has low solar absorbance and high thermal emittance.  The TOR-NC polyimide is well suited for scaled-up synthesis to multi-kilogram quantities, cost reduction through co-polymer design, and prototype film production by solution casting to give space durable films with good mechanical and optical qualities.  Phase I of this project will feature four innovations, first it will demonstrate multi-kilogram scale production of the diamine, from which  TOR-NC derives its superior AO resistance and low color, with high purity and reproducibility; second we will optimize multi-kilogram production of high molecular weight and low color TOR-NC polymer; third Triton will develop new formulation method to reduce cost of TOR-NC polymer, and fourth we will evaluate various product forms, such as films (i.e. conductive & non-conductive) and fibers (i.e. extruded or electro spun).

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Triton is positioning itself as manufacturer of high quality, large synthesis of specialty monomers and polymers.  Triton is pursuing chemical companies to establish partnership for commercial production of these newly developed monomers and polymers for terrestrial and extraterrestrial applications.  We are also investigating partnership agreements with film manufacturers to produce large thin sheets or continuous rolls of films using Triton?s polymers.  With these team arrangements, Triton will be in position to commercialize its synthesis capabilities and also produce high quality space durable films.  These films can be used in multi-layer insulation blankets for commercial and government satellites.  They also can be used for large inflatable or deployable membranes.

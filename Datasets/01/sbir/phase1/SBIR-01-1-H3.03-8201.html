<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
There is a significant safety need to monitor the concentration of hazardous gases in the vicinity of the main engines and propellant tanks of cryogenic launch vehicles. The current method for detecting hazardous gases includes mass spectrometers (MS) fed by tubes. Mass spectrometers possess excellent sensitivity, specificity, and response time. Their use, however, requires sampling. This results in delays between leak initiation and leak detection.  Mass spectrometers require daily calibration and a highly skilled operator. Also, real time monitoring at multiple locations is not possible with a single MS.  Intelligent Optical System (IOS) proposes to develop a multiplexed optical fiber sensor system (MOFS) for monitoring hazardous gases in real time at multiple locations.  IOS will team with Boeing Corporation in the commercialization of the MOFS device for NASA use.  In Phase I, IOS will demonstrate the feasibility of the device by detecting 1 ppm of hydrogen and oxygen.  IOS will engineer a field-deployable prototype in Phase II, and will deliver the prototype to NASA-KSC.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Aside from spaceport applications, the proposed MOFS will be useful in fuel-cell powered automobiles.  DaimlerChrysler, in a joint venture with Ballard, is expected to produce 100,000 fuel-cell engines annually by 2005 at a cost of $3,000 per engine.  Both Ford and DaimlerChrysler will be testing fuel-cell vehicles in California with commercially available models by 2003.  Thirteen million fuel-cell vehicles are projected to be on the road by 2010 and 35 million on the road by 2020. Hydrogen sensors can be located at several places in the vehicle: fuel cell compartments, feeding systems, and storage tanks, for quality control of hydrogen input and to measure the efficiency of hydrogen use.

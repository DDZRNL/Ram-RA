<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Accurate Automation Corporation (AAC) will develop a distributed, guaranteed stable, adaptive guidance and control architecture for formation flying of satellite constellations. The innovation in this approach is that it is an extremely streamlined approach to a very difficult guidance and control problem.  The guidance module of the proposed architecture is built around a simulation of a "simple physical system" with "desirable characteristics".  The "simple physical system" is a system of particles whose motion is a result of attractive and repulsive forces generated through simulated potential fields.  The "desirable characteristics" are: 1) that a large number of particles, starting at some initial conditions, can move amongst themselves to some desired final conditions with a guarantee that undesirable interactions between individual particles will not occur, 2) that the path taken by each individual particle is a "realizable commanded trajectory" for an individual satellite in a constellation, and 3) that the path taken by each individual particle is optimal in some sense. In order to guarantee stability for the satellite constellation as a whole, we will design a distributed satellite control module that ensures that each satellite will stay within a certain distance of its commanded path (tracking error has a known bound).

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The obvious commercialization of this technology is to U.S. Government applications, but the non-Government commercial potential is also vast. While we intend to first apply this technology to satellite constellation systems and multiple UCAV systems.  We will market it to anyone interested in such applications.  We anticipate Government Phase III customers for the product, primarily DoD, NASA and/or their prime contractors.  We also will market the software to the civilian satellite industry. Other potential civilian applications include automatic automobile maneuvers, cooperating robots, or maneuvering ships.  Automobile applications hold the potential for significant commercializations and we will approach automobile manufacturers.

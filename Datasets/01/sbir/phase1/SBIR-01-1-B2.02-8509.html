<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Southwest Sciences, Inc. proposes development of an innovative five-dimensional fluorescence imaging system that combines spectrally resolved, scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy with fluorescence lifetime detection.  Our proposed multi-dimensional fluorescence microscope is unique from previous work because it provides simultaneous measurement of lifetime decay profiles at multiple wavelengths.  The combination of spectral and lifetime resolution will provide superior contrast between multiple fluorophores and allow the design of more sophisticated fluorescence experiments for structural and functional imaging of cellular and sub-cellular systems.  Complete fluorescence decay profiles will be obtained with one nanosecond resolution at each of 16 wavelengths.   The proposed microscope and detection instrumentation are a flexible system that is generally applicable to a wide range of fluorescence microscopy applications.  The instrument can be designed to accommodate different excitation and emission wavelengths and is compatible with either single or two photon excitation.  A modular design that can accept different excitation methods, optics and detectors can be developed.  Diode laser excitation and radio frequency (rf) detection electronics will result in a compact, low power, lightweight instrument.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Fluorescence microscopy is gaining widespread use as a powerful imaging tool in molecular biology and medicine for both fundamental studies and diagnostic purposes.  We envision commercial research and clinical instruments based on our technology for applications in these fields as well as in other areas such as materials science and polymer science.  The addition of simultaneous spectral and temporal resolution to fluorescence microscopes will enhance their utility and aid new applications.  This fluorescence detection technology is also useful in non-imaging applications.  For example, this technology can be applied to the detection and identification of fluorescent aromatic contaminants in soil or ground water.  We also envision medical applications such as endoscopic probes for the identification of tissue types and the detection of abnormal tissue based on differences in fluorescence spectral and lifetime properties.

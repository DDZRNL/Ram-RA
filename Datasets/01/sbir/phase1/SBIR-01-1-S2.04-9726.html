<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Self-operating, low-vibration 80K - 150K J-T miniature cryo-cooler for long
<br>term space applications is proposed. This J-T cryo-cooler leverages
<br>significant research of low-temperature phase transformation in metallic
<br>alloys with Shape Memory. There are three group SMA's are proposed for
<br>miniature J-T cryo-cooler: (A) - Cu - based and/or Mn-based Shape Memory
<br>Alloys (SMAs) adapted to 80K - 150K valve open/close operations (Mn-based
<br>alloys even to lower 30K - when neon gas is applied). (B) - high-corrosion
<br>resistance Ce-based alloys which exhibit phase transformation with volume
<br>change DV/V over 10% is recommended for valve open/close operation when
<br>low-purity or mixture gases are used. (C)- high-damping porous TiNi SM with
<br>super-elasticity is proposed to provide vibration suppression in broad range
<br>wave band frequencies (from 20Hz to 25KHz). Miniature J-T valve utilizing
<br>Cu- Mn - or Ce- based SMAs enable operation without electric motor moving
<br>parts due to reversible martensite phase transformation. The miniature J-T
<br>coolers utilizing SMAs present achievements of dramatically reduction over
<br>currently available J-T cryo-coolers as follows: (1)- orifice clogging, (2)-
<br>valve size-mass, (3) - energy consumption, and (4) -vibrations during J-T
<br>valve operation. J-T valve operation utilizing SMAs prevents clogging by
<br>coolant contaminants due to great increasing throttle opening tolerance
<br>under reversible phase transformations.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Miniature J-T cryocooler utilizing SMAs offer variety of commercial
<br>applications for satellite, airspace, and instruments where the
<br>low-vibration at cryogenic temperatures is crucial. Miniature J-T cryo-
<br>cooler utilizing SMAs reliable for long term operation without electric
<br>motor moving parts. Potential commercial applications include: efficient
<br>miniature coolers for cryogenic applications, regulator systems for defense
<br>/space electronic-optic systems, solid-state crystal detectors applied for
<br>instrumentation utilizing physics of X-ray detection. Miniature J-T cooler
<br>can be integrated with solid state detector (semiconductor crystal) applied
<br>for microanalysis, automated ultra-scan map, digital imaging, digital
<br>control for precise positioning of electron beam adapted for advanced
<br>technology to manufacture integral circuit central processing units.
<br>Self-operating J-T Cryo-coolers operate at temperatures range of
<br>High-Temperature Superconductors (HTSC) therefore have the potential to
<br>provide inexpensive , accurate refrigeration temperature wherever HTSC are
<br>used. Miniature J-T coolers suitable for biological and micro medical
<br>storage applications.

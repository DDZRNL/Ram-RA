<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The technical problem addressed in this Phase I SBIR project is to innovate solutions to CMOS active pixel sensors (APS's) with increased UV sensitivity by means of backside illumination. Typical image sensors, including charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and CMOS APS sensors, using front illumination are insensitive and have very low quantum efficiency at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. This is due to reflection and absorption of photons in the gate and oxide layers. With backside illumination, the degree of reflection and absorption can be reduced such that the spectral response of these image sensors in the UV region can be extended and enhanced. However, since the photon absorption depth is much lower than the thickness of a typical Si wafer, a large fraction of the carriers generated in the Si can easily be lost by surface recombination. Therefore, backside thinning is necessary for improving UV sensitivity of back-illuminated image sensors. Such research has been doing for CCDs, but not yet for CMOS APS sensors. Thus, we would like to explore the possibility of extending such technique to CMOS APS. Besides, since the sensor is back illuminated, more electronic circuits can be put into the pixel to reduce the read noise of the sensor.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The back-illuminated CMOS APS image sensor will fill a performance vacuum in the image sensor market, enabling high quantum efficiency, UV sensitive, low-power, miniature cameras at lower cost for the first time. The fact that Photobit CMOS APS image sensors can perform as well as CCDs, with the added benefit of lower power (10 to 100 times less) and integration of electronics (enabling miniaturization), allows them to not only compete in the same markets as CCDs, but also to provide opportunities to expand the existing image sensor market.

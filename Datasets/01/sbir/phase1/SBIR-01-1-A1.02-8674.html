<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
An airborne fire is one of the most dreaded emergencies, as all pilots will acknowledge.  Isolated at high altitudes, a fire-induced loss of systems can disable the airplane beyond control.  The space shuttles and the International Space Station face a worse predicament. While an aircraft can land on a short notice, spacecrafts are totally vulnerable.  Existing fire sensors detect smoke or flame, indicating that the fire is in a relatively advanced stage.  These systems produce false alarms 499 times out of 500.  The proposed fire onset monitoring system (FOMS) will: (a) detect fire at a very early stage, without false alarm, by performing trend analysis on key chemical markers and temperature, and (b) provide a continuous status update for intelligent decision making by the crew.  In Phase I, Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) will establish the feasibility of FOMS by detecting 50 ppm of carbon monoxide with a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 5.  The project team, with fifty person-years of hardware and software know-how, will develop and test a compact prototype in Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Terrestrial spin-off markets for the FOMS system abound.  Worldwide, over 100,000 commercial aircraft are operating without reliable fire detectors. The FOMS device will be used in aircraft ranging from large commercial jet liners to small commuter aircraft, private airplanes, helicopters, military fighters, and transport aircraft.  With 3,000 new jetliners on order (900 scheduled for delivery this year), 500 business jets scheduled for delivery per year and 500 fighters being sold annually, demand for FOMS will be very strong.

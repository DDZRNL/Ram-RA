<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Gulf Coast shoreline is a region particularly vulnerable to hurricane landfall due to the shallow continental shelf and high tropical cyclone activity. Not only does this present emergency preparedness challenges for state and local officials, development has altered the land morphology which may result in unexpected flooding from heavy rainfall events and hurricane storm surges. As a result of these uncertainties, emergency preparedness procedures tend to be very conservative, requiring widespread evacuations.  At least $300,000 per day in business losses are incurred for hurricane preparation costs and lost revenue for every mile of coastline evacuated.
<br>
<br>Advances in remote sensing over the past decade have the potential for defining high precision DEMs. One of these techniques uses Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar to generate high-resolution topographic maps; when merged with traditional USGS topographic information, an accurate ?bald earth? map results. This high-resolution topographic data will give unprecedented accuracy to flooding forecasts, potentially saving many lives.  When combined with a storm surge model, the impact of various hurricane landfall scenarios may be analyzed.
<br>
<br>WorldWinds, Inc., proposes to develop an analysis tool to quantitatively characterize flood prediction and monitoring through the use of high-resolution, bald earth topography integrated into a climatological modeling system.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The goal of this research is to develop a commercial product into operational status.  Our intent is to offer a commercial product to address several end-user communities:
<br>? Resource management
<br>? Environmental assessment 
<br>? Community growth and infrastructure
<br>? Disaster management
<br>
<br>Development of leading edge remote sensing technology will lead to applications that create systematic change in these types of end-user organizations, lead to better informed decision making, and increase productivity as measured in cost savings and time.
<br>
<br>WorldWinds? will translate remote sensing and climateological scientific capabilities into practical tools for public and private sector decision makers.  This goal will help national and local officials to realize economic and social benefits for the communities they serve.
<br>
<br>The market is wide open for the application of state-of-art remote sensing improve public safety.  Federal and state agencies, such as Federal Emergency Management Agency, are evaluating LIDAR and IFSAR data as potential solutions for its Floodplain Map Reinvention Program, at significantly less cost [and higher resolution] than traditional means could achieve (Imaging Notes, July 2000).
<br>
<br>This cutting edge technology combined with our ability to bridge the gap from government developed technology to the commercial marketplace puts WorldWinds, Inc., in a unique market position.

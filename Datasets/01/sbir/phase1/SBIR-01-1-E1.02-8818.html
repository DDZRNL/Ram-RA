<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A solid state air-gap Fabry-Perot is configured in tandem with a switchable holographic optic element established by holographic polymer liquid crystal dispersion. This switchable element is the innovative centerpiece to be fabricated during Phase I research. By stacking these tuning elements, one per wavelength channel, any discrete channel within the operating range (which can include multiple orders) of a Fabry-Perot etalon can be selected for transmission to any receiver in a LIDAR or spectroscopy system.  Additional spectral elements can be selected simultaneously or a channel may be switched in milliseconds. The device can thus isolate hundreds of channels across the tunable range of a tunable laser or LIDAR transmitter. These capabilities are accomplished with no moving parts, and with a significant cost advantage over competing technologies.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
This innovative device provides all the benefits of a solid etalon combined with all the advantages of a tunable etalon.  This device has applications in LIDAR, atmospheric sensing, planetary exploration and possibly wavelength division multiplexing.  In production the TIROC device will cost less then a single tunable etalon system.

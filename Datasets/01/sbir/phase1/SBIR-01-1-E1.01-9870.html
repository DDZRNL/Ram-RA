<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The innovation is a compact Airborne VNIR and SWIR Imaging Spectrometer (AVSIS) that acquires calibrated high-quality hyperspectral data within the 400?2500nm range aboard light aircraft. AVSIS is a grating-type scanner using all solid-state Silicon/InGaAs sensors via a virtual common slit imaging approach. Being connected via switching fiber optics to a calibration source or a downwelling irradiance measurement port, spectral radiance or percentage reflectance is measured. With all the desired platform positioning, attitude, and Above Ground Level (AGL) altimetry measurements, its data cube can be geo-rectified. AVSIS has a spectral resolution better than 5nm with a swath width better than 320 pixels and quantization resolution better than 10-bits. 
<br>
<br>AVSIS achieves great expandability with its modularized mounting, interface ports, and protocol. It is an interchangeable node in a multisensing airborne imaging-computer area network, in which, compatible pushbroom/framing type spectral imaging sensors will be synchronized and combined for enhanced Earth surface measurements. All optimized spectral, spatial, temporal, radiometric, directional, and topographic measurements can be achieved by a single flight pass. Such a data set features all the necessary information content for vegetation index, hyperspectral/multispectral imagery, sunglint-free ocean color pushbroom imagery, non-linear corridor mosaic, surface terrain, bi-directional reflectance, land/ice profile, and much more.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The commercial product is a compact, modularized high-performance, airborne VNIR and SWIR imaging spectrometer, which can be fitted onto diverse small aircraft (manned and unmanned) to provide calibrated high quality hyperspectral data for repeatable and operational low altitude remote sensing. Its immediate applications include NASA calibration/validation for the multitude of hyperspectral and multispectral satellites and new application development. The potential commercial applications of this innovative instrument product include operational airborne remote sensing services for precision agriculture, forest management, mining area management, vegetation specie maps, crop and forest growing status monitoring, forest fire forecast, coastal environment studies, surface pollution detection, mineral exploration, hydro-carbon related material detection, and land-use surveys.

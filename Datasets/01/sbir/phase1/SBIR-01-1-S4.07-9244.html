<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This SBIR project will develop nanostructured network polymers for packaging micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) for harsh environments in deep space missions.  MEMS technology enables the development of spacecraft devices and subsystems which are: (1) very small, (2) low-cost, (3) very low mass, (4) very low volume, and (5) very low in power consumption.  While MEMS devices offer major improvements in spacecraft efficiencies and new mission functionalities, MEMS also introduce new problems directly related to their micro-size and solid state structure. Space missions require devices to operate in harsh environments with: (1) extreme temperatures, (2) debris, (3) planetary atmospheres, and (4) electromagnetic radiation.  A single dust particle can upset the function of a MEMS device.  MEMS have a much higher noise floor than other technologies. Nanostructured network polymers are a revolutionary technology for producing crystalline ceramic such as diamond and silicon carbide, from a low cost polymer.  These polymers are: (1) soluble in common solvents, (2) readily applied to surfaces as coatings, (3) shape conformable, and (4) photo-etchable using conventional semiconductor lithographic techniques.  Silicon carbide, diamond, and titanium carbide ceramics can be produced that are wear resistant, vibration (noise) resistant, heat resistant, rad-hard, and chemically inert for packaging MEMS devices.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Commercial Product/Service ? AMT anticipates becoming a packaging service contractor for MEMS devices in manner similar to semiconductor packaging facilities, e.g. Amkor, IPAC, etc.  Target Market Niche ? The market for MEMS devices is in the billions of dollars range and it is expected that a unique packaging technology should provide a market niche that is in excess of $100M.  Unique Aspects of the Technology for the Market Niche ? The materials to be developed for this project provide characteristics that are enabling for many MEMS applications.  The devices that are in use today are failing prematurely because of wear and thermal problems that prevent the devices from working properly.  Low cost diamond and SIC materials will provide unique benefits that will enhance the performance and durability of MEMS devices.  Importance of the Commercial Venture to AMT ? AMT is presently conducting projects and establishing a commercial business for electronics packaging and thermal management of electronics devices.  This project provides a complementary niche to the AMT business plan and will enhance our competitive position in the market for packaging electronics and other micro-scale devices.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Metron, Inc. builds a data mining tool for fleet management that allows the user, in real time, to identify cost benefit opportunities within large quantities of operational data. Designed for Airlines Operations Control (AOC) personnel, we build a tool that manages large quantities of current time and archived air traffic, crew, passenger, hub, weather, and National Airspace System (NAS) data. Our tool exploits standard data mining techniques, electronically encoded playbooks for weather events, a predictor for reasoning about weather and how it affects the future of flights, and an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface (GUI). The user receives personalized reports that identify cost savings due to weather conflicts, hub priority changes, avoidance of traffic congestion, and other factors. Our data mining tool allows AOCs to make real-time decisions that anticipate future events and save the airlines money, reduce traffic congestion, and improve the overall NAS efficiency.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
A data mining tool that focuses on National Airspace System (NAS) level data and Traffic Flow Management (TFM) constraints has commercial application for both the airlines and government Air Traffic Control (ATC) applications. For the airlines, the data mining tool is designed primarily for airline dispatchers.  Metron works closely with airlines on several TFM projects including the Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) program and with the deployment of the Flight Schedule Monitor (FSM) and the Post Operations Evaluation Tool (POET).  These systems, as well as the proposed data mining tool, provide cost benefits to the airlines by providing them access to valuable ATM system and NAS data.  In a collaborative framework, these systems also provide benefit to Air Traffic Service Providers (ATSPs). The proposed data mining tool may be incorporated into the ATSP side of the CDM program or into specific TFM facilities, and can assist in strategic traffic flow management decision making.

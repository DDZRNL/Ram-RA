<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed sensor is designed to produce radiance maps of short lived events such as lightning in 4 (or 5) dimensions including temporal, 3D spatial, and spectral space.   This sensor, for the first time, will enable the study of the spatial and spectral contents at a high temporal resolution of short lived events that until now could only be resolved spectrally, or spatially, or temporally, but not simultaneously in all dimensions.  The proposed program is geared towards building a demonstration unit during Phase-I using primarily hardware existing in-house.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
NASA has been conducting lightning research for over 30 years.  This research has major applications to aircraft and spacecraft safety, as well as planetary sciences.  The proposed sensor will provide new capabilities and improve understanding of the phenomenology.  Other areas in which the new sensor can be utilized include the study and characterization of unstable combustion (from rocket plumes to automotive combustion chambers), ignition devices and techniques (from spark plugs, to torches and laser ignition methods), solar flares and Aurora investigation, arc lamps, plasma physics, etc.  As a scientific instrument, the proposed system has no competition, and OKSI has already had inquiries for such capabilities.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
the proposed Phase I SBIR program will demonstrate the production of diamond- and graphite fiber-reinforced aluminum and copper matrix composites for use in thermal management systems.  Specifically, Powdermet will produce interface-controlled diamnd and graphite (DKDX milled fiber) reinforced aluminum and copper composites, and evaluate their application to battery tubes, structural radiators (and solar panel substrates), as well as heat spreader applications.  Innovations to be demonstrated in the proposed program inlcude the use of surface modified reinforcements, the production of combined fiber-particle reinforced composites, and the develo-pment of net shape composite forming techniques to produce high conductivity, integrally stiffened panels. The program is designed to yield high volume reinforced composites, consisting of 35-65V% high conductivity fillers in aluminum and copper binder phases.  thermal conductivities greater than 600 w/m-k (in-plane) and CTE's of 7-11ppm, with good through the thickness conductivities (>250 W/m-K) are predicted for the combined thermal and structural composite systems selected.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
If successful, the program willr esult in lighterweight, higher thermal conductivity materials for spacecraft thermal management systems.  In addition to mil;itary and commercial satellite applications, the proposed materials are ideal for use as thermal spreaders for microwave circuitry,  fotr battery thermal management in automotive and electronics application, and for the fabrication and production of high perofrmance heat exchangers for the chemical process industry.

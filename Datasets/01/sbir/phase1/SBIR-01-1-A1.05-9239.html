<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA has initiated several programs in recent years that will require distributed/embedded sensors to achieve vehicle safety and efficiency goals. The number of sensors needed implies use of optical fiber sensors for their small size and low mass. Only the technique offered has demonstrated the ability to obtain 1000's of high spatial resolution measurements on a single fiber. The Phase I effort, utilizing both testing and analysis of key technology, will produce a prototype design for a flight capable demodulation system. In Phase II, the prototype will be fabricated, tested, and the design modified to produce demodulation systems NASA can depend on to meet its program goals.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The commercial applications include health monitoring in civil,  aviation, and marine structures. The push to smart materials and structures requires monitoring of all phases of the construction process and will create a large demand for grating arrays and dependable demodulation systems. The technology also competes with traditional foil strain gage and thermocouple technology which is well established in all areas of industry. As demodulation systems are introduced to solve measurement problems not addressed by traditional sensors, the technology will gain acceptance by the engineering community and encroach on the traditional sensors market share.

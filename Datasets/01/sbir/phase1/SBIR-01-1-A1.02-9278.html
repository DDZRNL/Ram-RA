<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
An innovative approach for passenger aircraft seat and restraint system design for improved occupant protection is proposed.  The innovation consists of using metal/honeycomb composites for the seat legs and a tailored stiffness characteristic for the seat back tilt.  Using advanced dynamic finite element modeling for the seat/occupant system under crash impulse loads, the seat design will be optimized and a preliminary design will be developed for improved safety.  The finite element model will be validated using existing seat test data from the manufacturer.  (P-01566)

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The successful Phase I program will provide a solid foundation for a Phase II research and development effort.  Prototype seat designs derived from this research will be manufactured with cooperation from subcontractors.  Use of lightweight metal/composite materials, special seatback stiffness characteristics and inflatable lap belts to mitigate injuries during aircraft accidents will help the airline industry and seat manufacturers to promote better safety standards.

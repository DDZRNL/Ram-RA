<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal puts forward a novel training methodology that takes advantage of automation?s potential as a high-speed decision aid and the strengths of human pattern recognition and conditioning.  The methodology applies optimal control theory to solve for a vehicle?s trajectory and the required control inputs.  A preview of the commanded input suite is displayed to the pilot, which will dynamically update as the vehicle state changes in time.  Using this and other innovative training displays, the pilot should be able to execute numerous maneuvers previously considered outside the operational envelope, in addition to performing ?standard? emergencies with a high degree of control consistency and accuracy.   The preview display?s function can be extended to serve as an on-board pilot cueing aid.  This methodology can be incorporated in flight simulators to train pilots across a range of platforms.  The initial target application will be for rotorcraft autorotation, a particularly challenging and accident-prone multi-axis maneuver.  Phase I will focus on the development of the pertinent optimal algorithms and displays, as well as demonstration of the concept?s feasibility in the rotorcraft autorotation domain.  Phase II will focus on practical application of the concept to rotorcraft autorotation training and expansion to other flight vehicles.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The pilot training software developed under this project can be used to train helicopter pilots to perform safe autorotation maneuvers.  The core technology may also be adapted for use in training human operators of other vehicles (flight, ground, and underwater) where multi-axis control in time-critical situations is required.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Earth Science missions require technology development and near term flight validation of large lightweight deployable antennas.  The antennas are required to meet a variety of science and global monitoring needs including the measurement of soil moisture, precipitation, ocean salinity, and surface wind.  Antenna apertures ranging in size from 10-25 meters are required to obtain the desired spatial resolution.  Deployable polymeric membrane antennas offer high packing efficiency, large deployed area, and meet cost constraints for the science missions. 
<br>
<br>SRS proposes fabrication and assembly techniques which will address characteristic issues including failure of adhesive-bonded seams under space environmental conditions, and non-planarities such as wrinkling or film buckling, under thermal cycle condition experienced on-orbit.  Compliant edge border techniques will be induced to improve flatness.  This proposal addresses the use of a self-metalizing polymer process to demonstrate an innovative printing process for the conductive radiating elements.  This process eliminates the need to laminate/coat and etch the conductive elements.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The development of membrane antenna apertures has commercialization potential throughout the space industry.  There is a commercial need for a membrane SAR that is stowable in a compact volume, is lightweight, and can offer the same performance at a lower cost than conventional SAR antennas.  The antenna mechanical design and fabrication is strongly linked to the materials and processes used for the fabrication of the elements.  This proposed work will further advance the concept for use in small satellites.  Other membrane electronic applications vary from membrane concentrators to photovoltaic array substrates and covers.  Thermal and electrical dissipation is a continuing area of concern to designers trying to create new lighter weight and larger spacecraft.   The self-metallizing printing technology developed for radiating elements in this Phase I effort is directly applicable to flexible electronics for telecommunications devices.

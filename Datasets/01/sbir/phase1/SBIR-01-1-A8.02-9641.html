<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Combustion instability in air breathing propulsion engines can lead to catastrophic consequences. Unfortunately, as engines are operated at conditions to minimize pollutant emissions, the risk of crossing the boundary to unstable combustion increases. This Phase I project twill demonstrate the feasibility of an innovative sensing technique that will identify the onset of combustion instability in turboengines and ramjets. In addition to detecting incipient combustion instability the sensor will provide a means to monitor and diagnose the general operational health of the engine. The product that results from this project (Phases I and II) will provide direct benefit to three of NASA?s ten goals of the 25-year vision: 1) reduction of NOx and CO2 emissions; 2) reduction of accident rates; and 3) cut development cycle time of revolutionary technology.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The product of this project (Phase I and II) has commercial applications in the propulsion engine market and ground-based electric power generating turbine engine market. Both markets have identified combustion instability as a serious challenge to low NOx engine operation, with high potential damage costs. The number of turbine engines in service for propulsion and ground power generation in the U.S. is about 200,000 engines. Significant market growth is indicated since: 1) a NASA objective is to triple the capacity of the aviation system within 25 years in anticipation of commercial and general aviation growth (tens of thousands of new, advanced engines); 2) the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that the world?s annual consumption of electricity will almost double by 2020, and 70% of this increase will be accommodated by about 7,000 new gas turbine engines; and 3) the U.S. Department of Defense projects that about 3,000 advanced engines will be needed for new fleets of military aircraft, such as the Joint Strike fighter, over the next 15 years.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
It is proposed to develop a hybrid piezoelectric/fiber optic (HyPFO) monitoring system for aerospace vehicles and structures for the purpose of quick non-destructive evaluation and long-term health monitoring.  The development of the monitoring system will be based on Acellent Technologies' patented SMART Layer concept of integrating a network of miniature actuators and sensors in the form of a flexible layer onto structures.  Currently, Acellent's SMART Layer product hosts only piezoelectric elements; however, there has been substantial interest in incorporating other types of sensors.  Due to the popularity of fiber optic sensors for health monitoring in recent year, it is proposed to incorporate fiber optics sensors onto the current SMART Layer product to create a hybrid piezoelectric/fiber optic monitoring layer.  The proposed hybrid piezoelectric/fiber optic system will use the piezoelectric actuators to input a controlled excitation to the structure and the fiber optic sensors to capture the corresponding structural response.  The objective of the Phase I study will be to develop a hybrid piezoelectric/fiber optic monitoring layer prototype along with validation and proof testing.  The end product will be a hybrid piezoelectric/fiber optic monitoring layer that can be easily integrated onto structures to perform various NDE and health monitoring tasks.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Upon completion of the HyPFO structural health monitoring system, the U.S. government and the aerospace industry would receive substantial benefits from the developed technology.  The proposed development would bring to market a commercially viable product that will increase the reliability, improve the safety, and reduce the maintenance cost of aerospace vehicles and structures.  Potential structural applications include real-time detection of structural defects (fatigue, cracks, corrosion, disbonds), long-term monitoring of vehicle health, characterization of load environment, and life prediction.  Other uses include in-situ monitoring of material processing, identification of manufacturing defects (porosity, inclusions), and material property characterization.  The technology developed here for critical space structures could be further distilled down to other commercial applications in industries such as aviation, automotive, naval/off-shore, and civil infrastructures.

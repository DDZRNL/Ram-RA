<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Small Business Innovation Research project addresses the development of high performance evaporators for loop heat pipes (LHP) or capillary pumped loops (CPL).    As power levels increase, the thermal resistance of the evaporator must decrease proportionately to maintain device temperature.  Further, it is desirable, that high fluxes be absorbed without dryout of the wicking structure.  Dryout dramatically increases thermal resistance, often leading to system failure.
<br>
<br>We propose an evaporator configuration that has the potential to operate at heat fluxes greater than 100 W/cm2 with low thermal resistance. The key innovation involves a departure from the canonical wick structure in present evaporators -- a novel fabrication approach enables vapor/liquid distribution networks that maximize capillary pumping and substantially reduce liquid and vapor flow pressure drops.   A major advantage is prevention of dryout at localized hot spots until heat fluxes become extremely large.  Moreover, dryout is approached ?gracefully? -- by a gradual, and reversible, increase in thermal resistance, rather than a catastrophic burnout.  The evaporator can thus operate stably well beyond its design heat flux.
<br>
<br>Phase I will demonstrate feasibility through proof-of-concept testing and analysis and will define a preliminary design for integration with a LHP/CPL in Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
This evaporator has current commercial application as a heat spreader for cooling of microprocessors and other electronic equipment.   As chip power levels increase, the most demanding applications now use a heat spreader as a ?transformer? to absorb heat at a high heat flux and ?spread? it over a large surface area, thereby reducing the heat flux.  At the lower flux levels, conventional finned heat sinks are then able to dissipate the heat.  The present evaporator has potential advantages in (1) substantially increasing the heat flux capacity of heat spreaders and (2) in providing a more robust device with greater immunity to dryout.
<br>
<br>We expect that a future application of the evaporator will emerge as LHPs and CPLs are used for cooling electronic systems with densely packed components (e.g., telecom cabinets).  The market is pushing such applications toward smaller cabinets with more components and higher rates of waste heat.  The traditional cooling method of convective airflow becomes problematic, especially as the packing density prevents a direct airflow path to the heat sources.   LHPs and CPLs can provide a low thermal resistance alternative for such volumetrically distributed heat sources.

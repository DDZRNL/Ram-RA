<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
With increasing advancements in Internet technologies the generation of "on-site technical experts" will quickly fade.  With the capability to distribute real-time data over the Internet, collaborative efforts between scientists and field experts can occur instantly between remote locations without the need for costly travel expenses. Real-time data distribution has historically been through dedicated hardware circuits with pre-defined data visualization tools. EZStream proposes to provide a common ground where multiple telemetry processing applications (TReK, SQL, OPC, NI, etc?) can interface and send data over a Local Area Network or the public Internet, using flexible easy to use display development tools.  Phase I will utilize Java software products previously developed to interface with TReK to provide live data displays for the NASA Learning Technologies Project, Live From Space Stationa.  Research will be performed on interfacing EZStream with existing commercial Nematron products.  These systems, which successfully utilize Internet standards (e.g., TCP/IP, Java), will serve as baseline references for applying higher-level standards: data acquisition and distribution techniques. In Phase II the most proven capabilities will be incorporated into a prototype EZStream application and interfaced with TReK and Nematron products to provide telescience tools to both NASA and the commercial sector.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>

<br>The immediate commercial application is providing a simplified means of data selection, distribution, and display of International Space Station data to hundreds of ISS experiment telescience users over the next decade.   These users may be Principle Investigators (PI's) monitoring and controlling their ISS payloads, museums displaying informative kiosks, schools/teachers incorporating live science data into lesson plans, science web sites, or other science interested portals.   Another potential user is Nematron, a process control and automation software vendor. This technology will enhance their existing PC-based control solutions for factories and other automated process facilities. Additional markets are other NASA missions, as well as military and commercial systems such as air traffic control and telemedicine.

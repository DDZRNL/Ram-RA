<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The innovation of the Virtual Collaborative Training and Operations Support System (VCTOSS) is the offering of three dimensional (3D), annotated and interactive graphics combined with procedural information and linked data that can be accessed and used simultaneously by multiple parties over small bandwidth communications and with small file sizes. Thus VCTOSS can be a key tool to significantly revolutionize current multimedia training tools for single or multiple users including teacher-student combinations. In addition, the system is very applicable to show detailed design and operational aspects of a payload or ISS system and can be used in such a way that a person could be guided through operations and system manipulations on which they have never been trained or need only currency training. This latter application may reduce or eliminate training needs prior to flight and will significantly improve the efficiency and capability of off-nominal situations and maintenance procedures.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
One of the most promising aspects of high definition training and operations support media the wide range of applications and benefits that represent markets of 10?s to 100?s of millions of dollars. The primary general applications that can be applied to many market segments include an advance field service support system, training systems for industry and university, virtual education systems, and advanced collaborative customer service systems. The field operations and support market has wide potential in many applications including aircraft, computers, medical equipment, power systems, etc. The virtual laboratory can bring computer simulation techniques that are familiar to researchers into any classroom. Corporate and organizational training systems that bring in collaborative experts for key areas and allow the virtual, remote training to more efficiently use employee and trainer time. Web-based customer service that empower consumers to conduct self-service and allows collaborative service with a remote expert.

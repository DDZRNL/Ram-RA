<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Fiber optical transmission is increasingly applied to computer network, secure telecommunication systems, military aircraft, and even in missile guidance systems. 1550 nm vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSEL) are becoming a preferred technology for transceivers in long-haul, and even enterprise and metro data network. There is significant interest in using diluted nitride InNAsP as active medium at this wavelength due to it high T0 and lattice-matched reflector stacks. We propose a new design, the index guided, implanted structure (I^2-VCSEL) that could lead to far superior performance than the conventional design. Of its advantages particularly notable is the reduced p-layer adsorption which is a signifcant issue in these longer wavelength regions. In Phase I the proposed device structure will be fabricated and evaluated, to demonstrate its potential advantages. Process will be further optimized in Phase II leading to demonstration of high speed single mode fiber transmission.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Low coercivity, high permeability and low power loss are the desirable properties of soft magnetic materials for their efficient use in transformers, generators, motors, inductors etc. The presently used materials have unacceptable power loss while operating at high frequencies e.g. 10 MHz, hindering their widespread commercial and defense applications. Fe-Co alloys are one of the materials, which have excellent soft magnetic property at low frequency, but the power loss increases enormously at high frequency due to its low electrical resistivity.  In this Phase I research, Nanomat, Inc. will develop an inexpensive and easily-scalable process to produce Fe-Co nanoparticles coated with electrically insulating materials. These nanocomposite powders with high resistivities will be compacted to near theoretical densities to produce bulk materials with different shapes and sizes.  The synthesis, structure and frequency dependent magnetic properties of these materials will be evaluated.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Fe-Co nanocomposites can be used for many applications, especially in power converters, motor drivers and other power electronics in commercial as well as military satellites, aircrafts, and spacecrafts requiring soft magnetic materials for use at high frequency. This material may also be used to make antennas and high frequency coils, tunable filters for cellular handset, suppression beads, choke coils, loading coils etc.

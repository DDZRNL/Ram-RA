<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA has identified the need to minimize the use of life support expendables in the closed environment of space missions.  The innovation, black light materials, proposed by Science, Math & Engineering, Inc. (SME), uses an ultraviolet (UV) light source attached to different configurations of UV emitting optical fibers that can be placed within fluids for sterilization or in close proximity to filtration beds for reduction of biofilms.  Elastomer material, which transmits UV, would sheath UV emitting optical fibers from direct contact with fluid while maintaining the flexibility necessary for different delivery geometries.  Black light materials are innovative because different optical fiber delivery geometries can distribute UV light to a volume or surface more effectively than conventional UV sources.  Available UV power is better utilized resulting in less need for life support expendables like filtration beds and disinfecting chemicals.  The treatment of stored water with iodine, for example, could be replaced with sterilization by black light materials.  Anticipated results of the Phase I effort would yield a biofilm control and water recovery and storage system that relieves use of life support expendables in space missions.  Phase I would lay the groundwork for assembling a prototype system for testing in Phase II.

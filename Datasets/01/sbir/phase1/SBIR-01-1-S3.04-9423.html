<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In astrobiology research, it is useful to study benthic microbial ecosystems found under the ice in Earth's polar regions, which give us valuable insights for detecting extant life or evidence of past life in what may have been similar settings on Mars and Europa. These environments are logistically remote, and the barrier of thick ice prevents easy access. Most benthic studies require creating large open holes to give divers access to the water, which are time consuming and laborious, and, in the case of glacier-covered lakes, make it impossible to maintain aseptic conditions. We propose to develop a miniaturized remotely operated vehicle (ROV)/benthic lander system that can pass vertically through a 25cm hole (a standard portable drill size) and is operated through a cable from the surface, thereby simplifying access and reducing hazardous human exposure. The ROV can deposit the lander for long-term in situ measurements, and return later to recover it, increasing the range, depth, and duration of these studies. This system will also be used to evaluate concepts for Europa exploration, including deployment of instrument arrays and imaging systems, and modes of aseptic operation. In Phase II, a prototype system will be constructed and tested in suitable field locations.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Even the smallest commercial off-the-shelf ROVs generally have too large a footprint to be of use in many applications where the only access is through a small opening. The miniaturized ROV and instrumentation package to be developed in this proposal have commercial applications wherever size and/or portability are constraints. Potential applications include inspection and sampling in hazardous environments with restricted access, such as enclosed potable water storage tanks and reservoirs, ship ballast and bilge tanks, power generation coolant pumps and pipework, and oil production storage cells. In the scientific community, this technology has applications for data collection, sediment sampling, and environmental monitoring. This small lightweight system will be highly portable, and can be more easily transported into remote environments that were previously out of reach for scientific research and exploration. Vertically-oriented vehicles such as the one proposed in this study are especially suitable for applications with thermally-generated vertical currents, such as around thermal vents and in nuclear reactor vessels. Deep Ocean Engineering, Inc. (DOEI) has a proven record of successfully commercializing technology funded through SBIR grants. SBIR-funded developments frequently are integrated into DOEI's extensive line of underwater products and sold worldwide through its international network of sales representatives.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposal program will develop and demonstrate an affordable 
<br>manufacruring approach to fabricate the latest generation of damage 
<br>tolerant composite fan case designs. These designs embed a grid of 
<br>stiffener ribs within the composite laminate to limit damage propagation 
<br>that is initiated during the fan blade containment event. This grid blunts 
<br>the crack growth and restricts damage within a "safe zone" that permits 
<br>structural viability of the case after the blade is contained. The 
<br>proposed work package will demonstrate that advanced braiding concepts can 
<br>be used to fabricate these composite-toughening elements in a cost-
<br>effective manner. This economically viable fabrication method will allow 
<br>widespread application of the toughened design concept and enable weight 
<br>efficient, safe containment system designs for high bypass turbofan 
<br>engines.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Assuming that the technology is successfully demonstrated, this approach 
<br>can be applied to the design of all jet engine fan containment cases.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The problem to be addressed in this work is the development of very high speed, low power, compact, and modular CMOS Active Pixel Sensor (APS) image sensors that will be used as a configuration upload link between a holographic memory and a reconfigurable computing system. To achieve very high reconfiguration speed, the image sensor should have signal detection, amplification and quantization in the pixel site that will provide parallelism, speed and modularity. Because of the fabrication technology compatibility, CMOS APS modules can be easily imported in today's state-of-the-art programmable devices, such as FPGAs, which have been used as computational core of today's reconfigurable computing systems. Today's programmable devices have the bottleneck of configuration speed that can be overcome by using dense off-chip memories and by downloading reconfiguration data through parallel, high speed link. Holographic memories provide feasible solutions for the memory problem. Parallelism, and high speed reconfiguration can be achieved by using modular, low power, compact, high-speed CMOS APS sensors that has in-the-pixel signal processing capabilities. In Phase I, we are proposing to investigate such optimal sensor architectures, and circuits.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
High-speed, low-power, and compact CMOS APS sensor modules that incorporate signal detection, amplification and quantization operation in the pixel site are expected to be of use in many military, commercial and home applications, ranging from very high frame rate image sensors, reconfigurable computing systems, machine vision systems, smart target detection and surveillance. Developed CMOS APS modules can be imported in today's Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices because of the fabrication technology compatibility providing very high-speed full chip reconfiguration capability. Developed modular image sensor will strengthen the leading edge of Photobit in very high-speed image sensor market.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Several technologies are under development to replace conventional x-ray film with digital converters.  More of the penetrating x-rays are absorbed into the detector because of its thicker stopping material.  Current x-ray conversion materials are limited because of their relatively low atomic number and density.  The high atomic number and high density of mercuric iodide can offer superior stopping power and improved spatial resolution.  The goal of this application is to evaluate the feasibility of a deposition method for manufacturing thin polycrystalline layers of mercuric iodide for use as a x-ray converter for radiography.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
One application for these converters is digital mammography, where the technology can improve breast cancer detection and diagnosis.  Digital mammography has demanding imaging requirements, including very high-resolution and very high signal-to-noise ratio.  Solid state mercuric iodide technology could replace current digital imaging techniques in existing Mammography imaging systems.

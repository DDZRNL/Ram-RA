<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This SBIR project will test the feasibility of developing a hand-held microcantilever array sensor to detect and quantify the presence of hazardous Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) metals in water.  The sensor would consist of an array of specially prepared microcantilevers integrated onto a microcircuit. Binding and mass adsorption generate measurable defection and resonance frequency changes in the microcantilevers for superior sensitivity and selectivity. The objective of the Phase I work is to demonstrate the feasibility of using a microcantilever-based array to identify and quantify mercury compounds (Hg) under solution with superior time response, limit of detection, and cost relative to currently available compatible sensors.  This objective is to be achieved by constructing a working bench top detection system consisting of an array of specially prepared microcantilevers.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Based on the number of facilities concerned with metals contamination throughout the United States, there are several commercial applications for a hand-held sensor used to characterize RCRA metals in water.  Specifically, the applications include the monitoring of contaminated groundwater, surface water, and acid mine drainage; the analysis of drinking water supplies by municipal facilities or individuals; and the detection of metals in effluent from groundwater and process water treatment facilities.  For example, an environmental professional could use this sensor when purging groundwater wells to determine the metals content prior to or in lieu of sample collection. In addition, the microcantilever array could be combined with other technologies to monitor pH, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen and provide a complete water-quality meter. Furthermore, the environmental professional could use the sensor for spot-checks of streams, lakes, or acid mine drainage. Drinking water, industrial process water, and water treatment facilities could use the sensor to provide more frequent sampling of their treated water. Other applications could include private individuals interested in testing the metals (specifically lead) content of their tap water or the water obtained from their private groundwater well.

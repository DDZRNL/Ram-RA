<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In Phase I of the SBIR program LEEOAT Company will develop and optimize the design and the fabrication process of a high-resolution and cost-effective active deformable mirror (ADM) for space high-contrast astrophysical imaging applications.  The innovative ADM device architecture will be based on LEEOAT Company's unique laser ultraprecision micromachining technology in exotic materials. The effort will also include the theoretical modeling of the ADM performance.  On the basis of the theoretical results, the ADM architecture will be optimized.  LEEOAT Company will reduce the innovation to practice and conduct experiments to verify its expected performance.  Finally, LEEOAT Company will estimate the cost/effort for the fabrication and testing of the ADM system to be performed in Phase II of the program.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The development of the cost-effective high-performance active deformable mirror will open a large window of opportunity for space, commercial and military applications.  Estimate commercial market can exceed 2M per annum.

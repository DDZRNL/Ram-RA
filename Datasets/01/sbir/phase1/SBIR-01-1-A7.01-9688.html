<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Recent research in active control technologies have demonstrated that the introduction of unsteady vortex structures into boundary layers can produce tremendous improvements in the delay of separation of the boundary layers and enhanced mixing in free shear layers. It is clear from a simple scaling analysis that frequency and force requirements of current active control technologies make development of a mechanical actuator extremely difficult for flight conditions of interest. What is needed is a self-actuated device which harnesses the energy available in the free stream. Continuum Dynamics, Inc. (CDI) in collaboration with Professor Earl Dowell of Duke University proposes the development of Flow Driven Oscillating Vortex Generators (FDOVG) which offer the benefits of active control technologies without the system integration penalties associated with existing concepts. The FDOVG device introduces oscillatory longitudinal vortex structures to enhance mixing within the boundary layer through self-excited aeroelastic actuation, eliminating the need for drive motors and power delivery requirements.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
FDOVGs offer the potential for increases in maximum lift and controllability of both new and existing commercial and military aircraft with minimal cruise drag performance penalties. In addition to separation control, FDOVGs have application to control of free shear layer dynamics, cavity noise reduction, flow induced noise reduction, and enhance mixing and heat transfer in a wide range of chemical and combustion processes.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The safety and efficiency of transportation will be enhanced by systems that provide on-line health monitoring and management of vehicle subsystems and overall system information.  The health management systems will require the ability to combine information and data from many sources over local/wide area networks and make the data and processing of the data transparent to the many users who have a need to view and monitor the information.
<br>
<br>The specific aim of this project is to develop a suite of object-oriented software tools that will support design, analysis, implementation, and use of on-line aircraft subsystem health monitoring systems.  We will achieve this aim by building on Creare's previously developed, patented, award-winning middleware software which enables processing, communication, and administration of real-time and on-line data.  We will augment this enabling technology with an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) for configuring health monitoring systems including smart sensors and sophisticated signal processing routines.
<br>
<br>During Phase I of this project, we will demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by developing a bench-top prototype.  During Phase II, we will optimize, implement, and test a full-scale health management system for an aerospace vehicle.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
This system could be used to enhance the safety and effectiveness of any electronic control or health management system.  As such, it is relevant to military and commercial vehicles of all types, and also to a broad range of other equipment and facilities, particularly in the process and control industry.

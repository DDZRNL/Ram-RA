<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
	Propulsion systems that provide high thrust to weight and minimal mass are necessary for the planned generation of nanospacecraft and nanosatellites.  MEMS-based Micro-Rockets utilizing silicon semiconductor fabrication technologies are predicted to produce such high efficiency systems at a low unit cost.  To achieve the necessary specific impulse and thrust levels, these devices must operate at significantly higher pressures and temperatures as compared to conventional thrust chambers.   Therefore a refractory material that possesses excellent thermo-mechanical properties is necessary within the combustion chamber and the expansion nozzle.  Silicon carbide (SiC) is a refractory material with the necessary thermo-mechanical behavior as well as possessing compatibility with silicon MEMS processing.  
<br>	The Phase I effort will demonstrate the fabrication of a SiC thrust chamber liner within a predominantly silicon MEMS.  The silicon carbide will be produced by selective chemical vapor deposition, which eliminates the need for etching SiC or mechanically planarizing the SiC coated wafers.   The thermo-mechanical performance of the silicon carbide coated silicon will be measured at temperatures up to 1473 K to demonstrate the benefits of incorporating a refractory liner within a Micro-Rocket.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
	The successful incorporation of a refractory material, such as silicon carbide, is an enabling technology for power MEMS devices.  In addition to Micro-Rockets, MEMS heat engines such as Micro-Turbines can benefit from technology that allows SiC incorporation in a low cost, high yield manner.  Power MEMS devices are predicted to be a rapidly growing field characterized by high specific power output.  Initial commercial applications would likely be for compact, low weight power sources.  However due to their high specific efficiencies, these heat engines may also be utilized in more traditional power applications.  The selective deposition of SiC would also greatly advance the fabricability of elevated temperature MEMS sensors and controls.  Elevated temperature pressure sensors capable of operation at greater than 400C is one such market.

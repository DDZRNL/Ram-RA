<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to design, build, and deploy a Toolkit for Enabling Adaptive Modeling and Simulation (TEAMS).  The proposed approach uses a combination of data mining and knowledge discovery methods to automatically reconfigure and optimize systems simulation models.  Because it operates over the internet, the TEAMS solution will be platform independent and enable collaborative spaceport systems modeling and analysis over geographically dispersed locations.  The technical viability of the approach will be established in Phase I by designing and prototyping an adaptive simulation tool that will facilitate the collaborative design of future NASA spaceports.  The Phase II effort will implement the innovation on an actual NASA spaceport and rapidly commercialize the research results.  Key innovations include (i) hybrid approach that combines multiple soft computing and knowledge discovery methods for self adaptive simulation, (ii) model-based approach that maximizes re-use of domain knowledge for rapid simulation model development and deployment, and (iii) HLA-compliant, distributed, plug and play software architecture that allows for mass customization and rapid deployment of TEAMS tools in multiple application situations.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The first application of TEAMS will be to provide a simulation-based infrastructure for quickly and easily developing, maintaining and reconfiguring simulation models with NASA spaceport designers.  Other NASA TEAMS applications include space transportation systems analysis and design, spaceport process and infrastructure design, spaceport decision support systems, spaceport performance optimization, and virtual spaceport prototyping and validation. TEAMS commercial applications include air transportation system design, airport systems analysis and design, supply chain analysis and design, simulation-based acquisition, and virtual systems prototyping.

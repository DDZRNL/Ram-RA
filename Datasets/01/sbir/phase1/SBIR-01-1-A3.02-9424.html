<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovation is the design of an active control system to reduce aircraft turbofan engine rotor-lock inlet noise generated when rotor tip speeds become transonic.  The system design for this program would be tailored to the requirements of the NASA GRC 22-inch diameter Source Diagnostic Fan.  The proposed Phase I research program consists of (1) a conceptual design of a prototype active control sound source and (2) a MatLab based design of an active control system.  The concept is an innovation because it uses an active/passive segmented liner noise cancellation concept, developed at Hersh Acoustical Engineering, Inc. (HAE) to cancel rotor-lock noise.  A successful Phase I research program will establish the feasibility of developing an active control system capable of efficiently suppressing rotor-lock noise.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
1.	One of the primary commercial applications of the technology would be to license it to airframe and engine manufacturers.  The control of engine noise in the community surrounding commercial airports is known to be a difficult problem to solve given the cost and weight constraints of the aircraft industry.  It is envisioned that the rotor-alone active noise control software/hardware elements could ultimately be an integral part of a hybrid active/passive liner that efficiently suppresses multiple BPF harmonic tones as well as broadband noise.
<br>2.	HAE intends to seek patent protection of its intellectual property and license the technology to manufacturers of modern large commercial jet aircraft such as Boeing, manufacturers of large aircraft engines such as General Electric Aircraft Engine Division, Pratt & Whitney and Allied Signal Corporation as well as manufacturers of engine nacelles such as Vought Aircraft Industries, Inc.
<br>3.	HAE intends to seek Phase III funding and partnership with Boeing, GEAE and/or P&W to further develop the technology and commercial potential of the active broadband noise control concept.

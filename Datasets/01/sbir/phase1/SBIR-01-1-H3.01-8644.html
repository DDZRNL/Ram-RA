<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Phase I will experimentally demonstrate the performance benefits of a Heat Pump Loop (HPL) Thermal Control Bus employing a unique working fluid which is not only non-toxic and environmentally-safe, but it will also survive the catalytic oxidizer on board spacecraft.  Phase I will compare this unique system to pumped single-phase, pumped two-phase and heat pipe thermal control systems. Phase I will demonstrate a high-performance, environmentally-acceptable, manned-spacecraft-compatible heat pump loop thermal control system that exhibits the benefits of a two-phase pumped loop system, the thermal control and temperature lift of a heat pump augmented system, and the simplicity of a single-phase pumped loop system.   Phase I will demonstrate that the HPL approach has the operational stability and flexibility to accommodate highly variable heat loads, variable radiator temperatures, and multiple cold-plate  operating temperatures: That means increased thermal control flexibility for future spacecraft, and the possibility of a much more flexible and universal thermal bus.  The Phase II effort would address coupling this technology with Mainstream's long life magnetic-bearing or oil-less compressor technology, coupling to compact high-temperature thermal storage devices, and fabrication of demonstration hardware for a Phase III flight test experiment.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Phase I will demonstrate a  heat pump loop thermal control system that has high efficiency, is very compact, does not exhibit the traditional two-phase liquid-vapor micro-gravity issues, and does not pose any safety hazards because the working fluids are non-toxic, nonflammable, and thermally very stable. While such a system has obvious NASA/DoD applications, such a system would also have tremendous potential in large industrial/commercial  heat pump applications where the inventory of refrigerant would poise a safety threat (A standard 100 ton chiller, used for providing air conditioning in a small hospital or office building has more than 1000 pounds of refrigerant.)  Mainstream has a solid commercialization plan to market the heat pump thermal bus to telecommunications and computer markets and to license the new refrigerant to a chemical company (for marketing to the HVAC/R industry).  We have already developed the necessary commercialization partners, performed the marketing studies, and have  secured Phase III commercialization funds.  Furthermore, Mainstream has a very successful track record of commercializing thermal control products!  Mainstream is also developing and commercializing other key technology components of future spacecraft systems including the long life (magnetic-bearing or lubrication-free) compressors,  high-heat flux cold-plates, and controls systems.

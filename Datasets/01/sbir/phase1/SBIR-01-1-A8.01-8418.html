<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Advanced Propulsion Inc. proposes a Revolutionary Concept (RevCon) integrated aircraft and propulsion system that provides aircraft drag reduction and propulsion system efficiency increase, thereby improving aircraft fuel efficiency by as much as a factor of two. The key feature is the ducting of a high fraction of the aircraft total boundary layer from distributed airframe inlets to turbofan engine(s) in the rear of the fuselage. This fully integrated, boundary layer pumping engine(s) will provide the sole propulsive thrust for the aircraft. API?s intent is twofold: First, to design the wing and fuselage configurations and boundary layer ingestion features for a very high fraction of laminar flow and greatly reduced parasitic drag. Second, to match the mass flow of the ingested boundary layer, the turbofan engine(s) and the aircraft cruise thrust requirement at the cruise design point to yield an extremely high level of propulsive efficiency. 
<br>
<br>With reduced fuel loads, aircraft can be smaller, and less costly. With less drag and greater efficiency, aircraft can have higher performance. This integrated aircraft/propulsion technology is applicable to all types and sizes of subsonic airplanes.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
API envisions a global general aviation and transport category airplane market for its revolutionary airplane design. Special sector airplanes are also feasible because the new economy era demands long-range personal transport that can fly an un-refuelled mission range of 8,000 nautical miles with reserves allows global coverage from the United States.  The world air cargo market is also expanding at a greater rate than the passenger market and represents and has needs for long range capability that offers time savings.

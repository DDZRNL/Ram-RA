<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This SBIR will result in a system for Automated Noninvasive Health Monitoring and Failure Detection in Aircraft Electrical Wiring Systems.  A Smart Insert Connector (SIC) will be designed for one-time insertion into all wiring end-connectors in existing aircraft.  Each SIC will be based on VLSI/MEMS technology and will incorporate several systems on a microchip: a wiring testing and inspection system, an on-line wire failure analysis and diagnosis system, and a switching system for testing large bundles of multiple wires.  A VLSI/MEMS hand-held Interrogator Unit (IU) will be designed to allow a roaming human Maintenance Technician to communicate with the distributed network of SICs for noninvasive harvesting of the wire health status resident in the memory of each SIC.  Additional decision-making software will allow the integration of the SIC inputs into an analysis of the overall health status of the complete aircraft wiring system.  This system will avoid the removal for testing of 5,000 wires per year and drastically reduce the probability of aircraft malfunctions, which cause crash disasters such as TWA 800 and SwissAir 111.  WPI, Inc. has 40 years of experience with aircraft connectors and wiring, numerous patents, and a successful product line of military and commercial electrical connectors.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Phase III commercial applications of this wiring testing and health monitoring system are already being explored.  The first is refitting existing aircraft with Smart Insert Connectors for wire monitoring, an application being explored in partnership with Delta Air Lines, and the second is equipping new aircraft with Smart Connectors as they are built, which is being explored in connection with Boeing.  Rob Lyon, Manager of Electromechanical Systems Engineering for Delta Air Lines, will provide consulting advice for this Phase I SBIR to give guidance on the airline industry?s wire testing needs, regulation procedures and requirements, and commercialization procedures.  WPI has the experience to handle product development and commercialization, having obtained 36 patents and taken them on to develop a full product line of over 100 electrical connector products and numerous other military/commercial products.  Our initial analysis shows that applying this technology to the aerospace industry alone could be a niche market of $1-2 billion.  We will also explore markets in a large class of other systems, such as wiring fault detection in automobiles, power transmission lines, home/office wiring infrastructures, and more.

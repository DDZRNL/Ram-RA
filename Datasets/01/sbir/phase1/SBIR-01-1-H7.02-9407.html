<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The objective of this effort is to develop high performance rare earth permanent magnets that can survive temperatures as high as 500?C for Xenon ion propulsion systems applications.  Rare earth permanent magnets based on the SmCo13 phase were shown to possess good magnetic performance at temperatures as high as 500?C.  We propose to initiate the development and commercialization of new rare earth permanent magnets of composition based on the 1:13 SmCo13 phase of the general form: (Sm(1-t-u-w)GdtEruHow)(Co(1-v-x-y)FevCuxZry)13.  TASK 1 will investigate 1:13 magnet compositions using SEM-WDS to determine the exact composition of the (Sm,Er,Ho)TM13 phase previously observed.  TASK 2 will prepare single-phased Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr)13 alloys.  TASK 3 will determine basic magnetic parameters of the 1:13 compounds such as magnetization, Curie temperature, magneto-crystalline anisotropy constant, magnetic anisotropy field, and the crystal structure.  TASK 4 will perform preliminary investigations of high temperature coatings that eliminate or provide minimal thermal degradation for long-term high temperature exposure.  Permanent magnets that maintain acceptable performance at high temperatures will permit higher thrust to weight ratios, and reduce the weight of cooling systems required to maintain magnet performance.  This weight savings will translate into increased payload capability.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The world market for permanent magnets is well over $10B annually, with the rare earth permanent magnet content of that market over 40%.  Some of the applications of these magnets are: Spacecraft (Momentum wheels, Reaction wheels, Stepper motors, Ion propulsion), Microwave Sources (TWTs, Klystrons, Magnetrons, Microwave Components (Isolators, Circulators), Inertial Guidance (Accelerometers, Gyros), Sensors (Position, Force, Torque, Acceleration, Speed, Electric current, Magnetic field), Commercial Systems (Computer disk drives, Computer printers, Audio systems, Satellite communication, Medical imaging, Watch stepper motors, Motors, Generators, Actuators).  Many of these applications would not be possible without high temperature rare earth permanent magnets.  The payoff for commercial satellite launch systems includes high temperature, stable permanent magnets that permit XIPSs to operate at higher temperatures and minimize the system cooling requirements and the associated weight.  The use of permanent magnets that can withstand the bakeout process will permit simplification of the permanent magnet designs, improve efficiency, and reduce XIPS manufacturing costs.  Using magnets that provide high performance at high temperature will improve system performance.

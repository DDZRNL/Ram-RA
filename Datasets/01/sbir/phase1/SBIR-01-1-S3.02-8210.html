<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Alameda Applied Sciences Corporation proposes to develop a new type of electric propulsion device dubbed the Throttleable Vacuum Arc Thruster (TVAT).  This thruster is itself a variant on an earlier thruster (the Vacuum Arc micro-Thruster (VA?-T)) that has been demonstrated via a recently concluded Phase I SBIR contract from BMDO (NASA/GRC contract NAS300129). The VA?T was verified to be a low mass (~100g) high efficiency (~13% measured), high Isp (1000-3000s) electric propulsion device. By combining the simple technology of an inductive energy storage circuit PPU with powerful electronics control, we will develop a thruster that can be remotely adjusted to deliver individual impulse bits from 0.25?Ns to 50?Ns with repetition rates varying from 1?1000 Hz while all the time providing an Isp of >1000s. The throttleable VAT proposed here is a pulsed device and hence can provide a wide range of impulse bits and a variety of repetition rates, which could satisfy coarse and ultra-fine control demands integrated in the same simple system. This thruster will be well suited to provide precision control for spacecraft constellations including optical interferometry, while offering low mass (<300g including the PPU), simplicity (no moving parts), high efficiency (?15%) and low cost of manufacturing.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The primary application of the specific electric propulsion thruster to be developed in the proposed work will be for the StarLight Optical Interferometry mission. However, beyond this immediate application, the thruster could find use for larger or smaller spacecraft, with further development.

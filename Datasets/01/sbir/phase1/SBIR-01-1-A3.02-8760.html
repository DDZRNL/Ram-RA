<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Innovative materials and processing capabilities are needed for the fabrication of ceramic matrix composite (CMC) components for efficient engine systems.  NASA has identified CMCs as the only materials that will meet the combination of increased safety, reduced cost, and reduced weight as operational temperatures climb to higher levels (per AeroMat 2000 Annual Conference, June 2000).  The current UEET (Ultra Efficient Engine Technology) initiative at NASA is looking at components such as combustor liners and vanes in particular.  In light of these needs, this Phase I SBIR proposal addresses lightweight, high temperature, and low cost CMCs for engine and propulsion applications, particularly in the temperature range of 1200-1400?C.  The work will specifically address the development of a hybrid PIP/MI SiC fiber-reinforced SiC-matrix composite (SiCf/SiC).  Effort will focus on using SiC-yielding preceramic polymers and a combination of PIP and melt-infiltration processing routes that will reduce the cost and time for producing SiCf/SiC composites compared to traditional CVI/MI processing.  The intent of this work is to carry out PIP/MI process development, generate a preliminary database of thermal and mechanical properties, and select a process to use for component development and demonstration in a Phase II effort.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The results of this program will be immediately applicable to the on-going work of a number of companies for programs such as Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT) and other initiatives.  For example, Boeing-Rocketdyne is interested in evaluating the use of CMCs for transpiration cooled injector faceplates or rocket engine thrust chamber liners for use on the IHPRPT initiative and other advanced engine programs requiring lightweight high temperature CMC materials.  Understanding the thermal and mechanical performance of PIP processed CMC materials will improve the timeline and extent of insertion of CMC materials into a variety of lightweight, high temperature applications.
<br>
<br>Rockwell Science Center has also expressed interest in C/SiC and SiC/SiC CMCs to use as the exhaust ramp material for the Aerospike Engine concept.
<br>
<br>General Electric Power Systems and Solar Turbines, Inc., are investigating SiC/SiC CMC materials for turbine engine applications and are very interested in opportunities for reductions in cost and processing time.

<br>NASA has identified CMCs as the only materials that will meet the combination of increased safety, reduced cost, and reduced weight as operational temperatures climb to higher levels (per AeroMat 2000 Annual Conference, June 2000).  The need for high-temperature CMC materials is evident in applications such as turbomachinery, thrust chambers, seals, bladed-disks (blisks), and various structural panels that may have a requirement for integrated cooling channels.  The NASA UEET program in particular has identified applications such as combustor liners and vanes that will require CMC components.

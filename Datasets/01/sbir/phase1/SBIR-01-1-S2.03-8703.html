<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The beginning of stellar interferometry was marked by the concept first suggested by Fizeau in 1867, and the completion of the famous 20-ft interferometer by Albert Michelson in 1920.  The technology has progressed through the century and the success of the space program has opened up new possibilities of deploying space-based interferometers to allow a superior view of the universe without the undesirable atmospheric effects.  Numerous space missions are planned for the next decade to verify different enabling technologies towards very-long-baseline interferometry to achieve high-resolution imaging and high-precision astrometry.  These techniques will involve coordinated formations of spacecraft separately carrying optical elements comprising the interferometer.  High-precision sensing and control of the spacecraft and the interferometer-component payloads are necessary to deliver sub-wavelength accuracy to achieve the scientific objectives.  In the case of x-ray interferometers based on nanometer wavelengths, the optical metrology requirements will be in the sub-nanometer range.  For these concepts, the primary scientific product of interferometer measurements may be the only source of data available at the precision required to maintain the spacecraft and interferometer-component formation.  The proposed research investigates the use of these measurements as a form of real-scene wavefront sensing to infer the control error towards a formation-control solution.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Commercialization opportunities of the control technologies developed under this SBIR fall into three categories.  Full application of the technologies is constrained to space interferometry missions.  Although other countries may have plans to perform space interferometry missions, NASA remains the largest customer in this area.  Since the space missions all require custom-built solutions and systems, the market value will still be substantial, despite the market size.  The second category involves some of the control technologies that may be applicable to other synthetic aperture systems.  They will be applicable to surveillance and other applications, with organizations such as the defense agencies being likely customers.  The third category involves the more general control techniques, which can be commercialized along with other control-related products.

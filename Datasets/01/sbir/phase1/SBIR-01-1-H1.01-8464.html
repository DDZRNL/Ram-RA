<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The objective of this proposal is to investigate how DiscoveryToolsTM, a knowledge acquisition tool for capturing, representing and automating strategic knowledge, can be applied to spacecraft launch and payload processing (SL&PP).  Primary focus will be placed on capturing knowledge and rationale for facilitating spacecraft launch and payload processing.  DiscoveryTools allows process engineers to identify control processes. It also enables graphical display of the control processes and algorithms. This can, and should be, immensely useful for spacecraft launch and payload process engineers and operators.  The DiscoveryTools interface allows the engineer to simulate and monitor a process as it executes, which means that needed changes can be identified and corrected without recoding.  This potentially saves time and effort, and because the control process is explicitly represented as knowledge, it can be stored, manipulated, shared, and edited as knowledge.  Here we investigate how DiscoveryToolsTM can support SL&PP and how it can be enhanced to better support SL&PP in the future.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The market opportunity for more effective utilization of design data and the knowledge experts who interpret and use that data is extraordinary, particularly given the explosion in data collection and warehousing and the scarcity of skilled designers and other experts who can make use of that data.  Initially, the key target market for Discovery Machine will be design-intensive businesses in industries with high percentages of their budgets allocated to research and development (e.g., Automotive, Aerospace, Device Manufacturing and Computing).

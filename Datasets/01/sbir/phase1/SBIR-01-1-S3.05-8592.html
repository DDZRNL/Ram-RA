<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Imaging of extrasolar planets requires a high-channel count deformable mirror to correct for system aberrations thereby narrowing the point-spread function.  The mirror would be used in experiments such as coronographs that would obscure the bright star while enhancing imaging around the star.  Requirements for such a system demand extremely fine control of the surface of the deformable mirror.  While the mirrors built by Xinetics have been shown to be controllable to angstrom resolution, the electronics needed for such a system must be refined.  Xinetics multiplexer electronics allow for mirror control in an extremely compact package.  The next step is to develop electronics that allow the experimenter to take advantage of the ultra-fine resolution capabilities of the mirrors.  This proposal outlines the steps needed to increase the resolution and decrease the noise where resolution would approach 0.1 Angstroms.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Low-Noise multiplexer electronics have applications in a variety of low-speed adaptive optics applications.  Currently applications such as opthalmic imaging, laser correction, and satellite imaging would all benefit from this technology.

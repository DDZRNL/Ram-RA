<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Distributed spacecraft systems composed of spacecraft constellations present significant challenges for system designers particularly for integrated control of heterogeneous assets.  As certain functions require coordination of constellation members, efficient means need to exist for establishing the collective operation in a System of Systems (SoS) context.  The requirement to act as a unified information system places requirements on the system architecture that go above an beyond what is required for traditional systems.  We propose a software based infrastructure that facilitates dependable formation and operation of distributed real-time control systems with several innovations that advance the state of the art in distributed systems technology.  These innovations include: 1) cold start algorithms that allow for autonomous, dependable system organization and formation, 2) distributed on-line configuration control, monitoring and health assessment processes that operate in concert across the entire system allowing for coordinated system operation, 3) a multi-level scheduling approach that allows for distributed control elements to be responsive to local events and to participate in system wide coordinated operations and 4) a robust fault/error model that accounts for arbitrary fault/error cases and anomalies, thereby providing superior fault tolerance, particularly for Single event Upsets (SEUs).

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
As distributed real-time systems move toward network centric architectures, the demand for dependable clustering capabilities multiplies appreciably.  Distributed clustering is a technology with broad application with relevance to commercial markets for ecommerce, automotive, industrial, and medical, and distributed system/testbed/simulation applications.  It has recognized applications in all manner of distributed information processing systems that are the basis for the information age.  The clustering architectures of significant scale are fairly recent and have not yet matured to the point where they offer appropriate dependability and real-time performance.  The avionics market value (both military and commercial) can be projected as sufficient to establish a viable business case.  In addition to this market,  WWTG also see opportunities in automotive/truck markets where there is interest in architecture concepts for intelligent highways and fleets of vehicles. WWTG's strategy for entering this market is based on using its extensive experience and strong background in successful fault tolerant systems developments translated into dependable distributed cluster technology focused on facilitating commercialization.

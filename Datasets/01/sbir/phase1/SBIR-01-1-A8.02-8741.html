<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
MicroEnergy Technologies and Technology Assessment and Transfer propose to develop an E-field microinjector array for liquid fuel atomization.  This development effort hinges upon the application of a novel system of ion-propelled and dielectrophoretically-controlled micro-injectors in parallel.  Using an electric field, the spray process is controlled precisely to match the high response time required for most liquid fuel air-breathing engines.  Using micro-injectors of smaller than 100 micron provides the fine mist desirable for optimal mixing and combustion.  The proposed atomizer offers a number of advantages over the state-of-the-art technologies in liquid fuel atomization: (1) It requires little to no driving pressure (<10 psi) and significant weight savings, (2) System design requires simple engineering in that total mass flow rate is only a function of number of active injectors in operation, (3) It generates and maintains uniform and fine fuel droplets for more controllable and efficient combustion, (4) It can generate muti-mode droplets size distributions for specific applications, (5) It provides rapid control since there are no moving parts for flow control, and (6) It offers flexibility for control strategy.  During Phase I, we will perform analytical and computational modeling for system design and analysis, experimentally demonstrate the significant advantages and improvements in atomizer performance, and evaluate the fabrication feasibility of the atomizer using a ceramic micro-fabrication technique known as stereo-photolithography (SPL) and developed at TA&T.   The challenge in this project is in integration of the electrodes for implementing the electric force for control of the atomization process and droplet formation.   Efforts during Phase I option will be focused on development and testing of an atomizer fabricated using SPL, which will be adopted for prototype and final product development.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The final product, Ion-Propelled Micro-Injector Array Fuel Atomizer, in addition to application in space technologies, will have a significant commercial value to a broader industry, including the aerospace and automotive manufacturers.  Efficient atomization will reduce exhaust emission, increase system throughput, and reduce system downtime caused by equipment failure due to fouling and deposit formation.   Fuel atomizers are utilized in almost all combustion systems used for energy production and heat recovery.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Static charging of surfaces is a twofold problem for spacecraft.  On the ground, static charges can easily lead to sparks that might ignite fuel or other flammable materials found frequently around launch facilities.  In flight, charge absorption from solar wind and other cosmic sources will lead to high voltage differences across different parts of the spacecraft.  Electrostatic discharges can damage sensitive equipment like the on-board computers, scientific instruments or power controllers.
<br>Adherent Technologies, Inc. has recently developed a new series of electrically conductive white thermal control coatings.  These new materials based on polysilylene semi-organic binders show promising initial properties and can be tailored to a surface resistivity appropriate for anti-static coatings.  The unique chemical nature of these materials promises high resistance to atomic oxygen, good UV resistance and toughness to overcome the brittleness usually associated with common inorganic binder systems.  The materials can be produced in a meltable form to allow easy application; crosslinking of the resin will then form a stable thermoset network to guarantee long-term stability under space conditions.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Adherent Technologies' new antistatic polymer system with high emissivity at ambient spacecraft surface temperature, atomic oxygen resistance, and resistance to surface charging by ion and electron impact is ideal for aerospace applications.  One of the primary commercial markets for antistatic and thermal control coatings is in satellite manufacturing.  In the commercial sector, the markets for space systems are extremely large, particularly for communications antennas and radars.  In addition, the military satellite market is expected to experience a steady growth through the next ten-year period and is expected to deploy a consistent number of satellites despite budget cuts.  In addition, these silylene copolymers may also find a small niche commercial market for specialty products such as electrically conductive "O" rings and seals.  They may also be an attractive replacement for metal-filled elastomers in many shielding applications.

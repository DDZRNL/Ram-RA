<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Phase I SBIR describes a new approach to enhancing the sensitivity at 1064 nm of high gain avalanche photodiodes (APDs), developed at Radiation Monitoring Devices (RMD).  The process utilizes an innovative technique to microtexture the front surface of the APD using high power, ultra-short laser pulses (100 femto-seconds). The laser processed silicon surface exhibits remarkably high absorption characteristics over a large range of wavelengths (0.4 - 3 mm).  In addition, specular reflectance and transmittance are extremely low for wavelengths up to 12 mm. Evidence of silicon bandgap transformations makes this remarkable absorptance extremely promising for present detector technology needs.
<br>The ultimate goal of this project is to use laser microtexturing technology to develop a high speed, high gain, low noise APD array sensor module with significantly improved near-infrared (IR) response.  The APD array sensor will be an extremely valuable tool for long distance communication and LIDAR/LADAR applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed technology will have numerous important commercial applications, such as imaging altimeters, LIDAR systems, near-IR spectroscopy, free-space optical communication, optical mammography and tomography, tissue oxygenation studies and many other applications.  A successful program could potentially revolutionize any field that is presently limit by the lack of sensitive detection at 1064 nm, where robust and compact transmission technology is readily available.

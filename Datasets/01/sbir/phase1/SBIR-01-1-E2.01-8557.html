<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
	Large ultralightweight inflatable structures that can be compactly stowed for launch then deployed in space in a controlled manner to geometric precision offer enabling capability for various earth science platforms.  This work will apply space environment resistant, thermally stable polyimide film material to produce precision structural components with single and double curvature that are inflation-deployed then inherently self-rigidizing without internal gas pressure.  Novel design approaches, manufacturing processes and assembly techniques will be used to fabricate self-rigidizing structural components  and assemblies that will be characterized for stiffness and strength, buckling, and dynamic behavior.  Methods for enhancing the dynamic stability of these structures by passive means will be evaluated.  Emphasis is placed on minimizing stowage volume and ensuring scalability of the structures manufacturing technology.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
	This structures technology is applicable to large antennas, high resolution earth observation satellites, solar thermal and electric propulsion, space solar power, and high temperature materials processing systems.  Ground commercial applications include emergency shelters in extreme environments and lightweight articles exposed to long-term weathering conditions.

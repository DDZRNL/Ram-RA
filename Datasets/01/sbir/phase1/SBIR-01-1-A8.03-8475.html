<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal describes a research study to define a high-speed inlet model for flight-testing on the F-15B at NASA Dryden. The objectives of the flight test program are to obtain off-design performance and shock wave signatures for a high-speed inlet designed for supersonic cruise.  This proposal identifies a new design concept that not only provides very high inlet performance but also incorporates design features that minimize contribution to sonic boom.  The proposed effort includes inlet aerodynamic design, subsystem designs for off-design airflow matching, a conceptual mechanical design, and a detailed plan for follow-on flight research.  It is expected that this Phase I effort will identify an inlet in sufficient detail to allow quick model fabrication for flight-testing in a Phase II effort.  This follow-on effort would result in verification of off-design inlet operation and airflow matching, and the near-elimination of inlet contribution to sonic boom.  This proposal responds to the SBIR subtopic by proposing a study for flight research that will verify low sonic boom technology to help enable supersonic flight over land.  Overland flight is critical for the success of a supersonic business jet, and will enhance the economic viability of a supersonic transport.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The commercial benefit of the proposed new inlet concept is based on the expectation of achieving very high inlet performance while nearly eliminating inlet shock contribution to overall sonic boom.  For supersonic cruise, this inlet design concept will provide inlet performance that meets or exceeds current status levels.  The inlet has the potential to provide higher performance, high operability, reduced weight, and minimal sonic boom contribution.  Low sonic boom will be necessary for a commercially viable supersonic passenger aircraft.  The technology proposed herein may eliminate a significant portion of the boom signature of the aircraft.  An additional benefit is that overland flight might be possible if overall boom levels can be sufficiently reduced.  Overland flight is critical for the success of a supersonic business jet (SBJ), and would greatly enhance the economic viability of a commercial transport. The design options offered by the proposed new inlet concept will enable the development of propulsion systems for high-speed aircraft that offer increased range and payload/profit. Commercial applications include aircraft for transportation of people and packages throughout the world.

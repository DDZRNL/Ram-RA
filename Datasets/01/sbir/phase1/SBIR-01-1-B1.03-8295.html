<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The discovery of multiwalled (MWNT) and singlewall (SWNT) carbon nanotubes with their unique structure, electronic and mechanical properties has the potential of creating novel and advanced composite materials.  The carbon nanotubes, which are, formed of seamless graphene layers, represent the ideal carbon fiber with Young's moduli that are orders of magnitude higher than other reinforcement materials. This nanoreinforcement can potentially provide the revolutionary advances in ultra-lightweight structures and materials technology required for the broad range of components required for future NASA missions. It proposed to develop nanoreinforcement based on hydrogenated SWNT. The SWNT reinforcement can potentially produce extremely strong ultra-lightweight thin film composites, and the hydrogen in the SWNT will impart unique radiation shielding properties to the composites.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Carbon nanotubes are now the fastest growing sub-field of nanostructured materials.  Applications of carbon nanotubes include their use a probe tips in atomic force microscopes, electron field emitters, electrode materials in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, gas storage, gas purification, and as strengthening agents in polymer and metal matrix composites.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This purpose of this SBIR Phase 1 project is to select and test the basic elements of a dual-energy, computed tomography imaging system that will travel to Mars and examine small rocks and minerals for evidence of fossilized life. The goal is to achieve three-dimensional volume images with 10-micron spatial resolution in the reconstructed image and to provide identification at that resolution, of both the density and the effective atomic number of the material being examined.  The focus of phase I will be to determine the dual-energy formalism and to understand the best combination of detector and radiation source to provide a useful imaging system.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed effort is significant, not only for space exploration but also for earth-based micro-tomography applications. Microfocus CT is needed for better inspection of printed circuit boards and microelectronic components.  Other applications are in military and civilian non-destructive testing, mineralogy, paleontology, composites, forensics, small-animal scanning, etc.  In several of these, dual energy can improve visibility of constituents that are not readily distinguishable by density.  These include fossils in rock matrix, fibers in two-component composites, and small concentrations of metal-tagged drugs in mice in pharmaceutical research.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Phase I project will prototype a very compact, lightweight, non-RFI/EMI generating power supply component used in a variety of essential space power applications involving traveling wave tubes (TWT). The innovative design replaces for the first time conventional electromagnetic transformers (heavy and EMI noisy devices) with Transoner?, a new piezoelectric transformer invented by Face Electronics, LC. The proposal supports the current trend to improve state-of-the-art TWT power conditioners and will allow spacecraft designers to lower payload mass and volume while maintaining system efficiency. In addition to its significance for TWT power supply applications, the project design represents an innovation in the piezoelectric transformer field due to its unique modular design which provides: (1) a paralleling design for achieving large amounts of power and high step-up ratios, and (2) a tapped concept for achieving multi-output voltages. While Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of the Transoner? technology and its modular topology, Phase II will integrate the technology and adapt it to the specifications for current TWT power conditioners. The project will be undertaken in close co-operation between two leaders in the field of piezoelectric transformer applications and piezoelectric materials development, Face Electronics, L.C. and Penn State University.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
A surge in satellite telecommunications is being driven by a vision for a universal network of terrestrial and satellite systems for broadcast television, new multimedia services to the home and office, and land mobile services. Consequently, the share of satellite communications in the total global telecommunications market is expected to triple and reach $80 billion by 2005. As a result of the expanding satellite communications market, the current worldwide annual TWT market (including commercial and military ground and space applications) is estimated to be on the order of $500 million; the U.S. market alone is about $250 million. This is a very growing market for Transoner? technology. Additionally, Face is currently servicing over 300 piezoelectric product clients who could all potentially benefit from the new product designs. The piezo-device market is presently estimated at about $6B per annum. Piezoelectric-based products continue to grow rapidly in application uses and market size. In addition to wide application in piezoelectric market segments, space, commercial, and military applications, Face?s Transoner?  technology addresses a tremendous number of commercial power applications from light fixtures to PC screens to small computer and communication component power supplies.

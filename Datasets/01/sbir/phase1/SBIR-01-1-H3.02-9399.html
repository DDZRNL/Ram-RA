<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
MiTi proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a highly reliable and efficient oil-free LOX transfer pump suitable for application to space based cryogenic fluids, handling and storage systems. This novel pump is based on MiTi?s patented hybrid passive and active magnetic bearing and blood pump technology, which has already demonstrated extremely low losses and vibration signatures. The proposed pump is inherently reliable even in the presence of transient shock or overloads due to the integration of auxiliary backup bearing technologies that generate hydrodynamic pressures necessary to carry rotor loads in the event of a magnetic bearing overload or failure.  The bearing system is robust, simple in design, is lightweight, and can be designed to fit into low volume areas.  Under this effort, MiTi will identify the materials needed to ensure LOX compatibility, conduct parametric design tradeoff studies to establish the necessary scaled design, and will conduct preliminary baseline testing with an existing pump.  Finally, a preliminary conceptual design of the qualification test hardware needed for Phase II will be completed.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The commercial potential for the LOX transfer pump is substantial, including both commercial and military applications.  System applications for the developed system include Space Station, communications satellites, and manned Mars and Lunar stations as well.  Ground based applications include pumps for toxic chemical and liquid cryogenic transfer both for stationary and mobile applications such as aircraft, marine and industrial machines that require hermetically sealed devices. Beyond the fluid transfer systems, potential applications include medical devices such as the total heart pump, dialysis machines and the like. The key benefit to many of the systems is the elimination of the lubrication system with its high parts count, and need for seals.

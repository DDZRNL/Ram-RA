<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Diversified Scientific, Inc. requests support for a phase I proposal to genetically engineer viral self-assembling capsid fusion proteins for the crystallization and structure determination of macromolecules.  This system is novel in that the target molecules are displayed on the interior surface of a phage capsid with known crystallization conditions theoretically reducing protein crystal growth to a routine process. This system lends itself to automation and would make significant contributions to all proteomic and structure based drug design projects.  In particular, the ability to grow crystals for any suitable target protein would provide substantial samples for NASA?s Biological and Physical Research Enterprise that utilizes micro-gravitational effects to improve crystallization conditions for molecules that have intellectual, therapeutic and commercial value.  It is anticipated that successful construction of first generation systems will be the subject for a phase II proposal to automate and commercialize the Trojan phage crystallization system.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
We anticipate two classes of clientele, academic institutions currently involved in structural biology or genetics and pharmaceutical industries using structure based drug design strategies. The current proposal is for the development of a potential tool directed at solving the crystallization of protein. This technology may be adopted for development of novel drug delivery systems that could replace or enhance particular biological activities; construction of nano sized laboratories and bio-probes useful for a variety of therapeutic and industrial applications.

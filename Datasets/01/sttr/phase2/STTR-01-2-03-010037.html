TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The innovation proposed is the development and characterization of a family of engineered-materials with initial application to NASA's Space Launch Initiative (SLI) and hypersonic aircraft development. Nanostructured and microporous morphologies will be optimized to provide materials with high specific strength and low thermal conductivity required for multifunctional integrated thermal structures. Based on Phase I results, key research and development areas were identified for emphasis in Phase II.  These include; the improvement of material processing techniques to achieve complete densification and compaction, expansion of the experimental test database to high temperatures, measurement of thermal shock resistance, determination of oxidation resistance, further variation of material parameters to improve mechanical properties, incorporation of other types of reinforcements such as platelets, fibers and cloth, and finally detailed mathematical modeling. NASA mission requirements will be used to define typical applications for these engineered ceramics.  Prototypes will be built and tested.  The developed material database will be used to evaluate application in a variety of industries that utilize high temperature processes.  Industrial firms will be identified and contacted to establish appropriate business relationships for subsequent commercial production. Clear technical and business plans will be developed for Phase III, leading to a smooth transition to commercial production. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>There are wide spread applications in industries requiring high temperature ceramic material for insulation, filters, mirrors and structure. This is enabled by the ability to polish the material to high reflectivity, to control the porosity from highly porous to helium tight, to vary the thermal conductivity by material selection and porosity and to optimize structural properties with fiber and nanomaterial reinforcements. Applications with these requirements include aircraft (structure and propulsion), power generation (heat exchangers and combustion liners), heat recovery (air preheaters and recuperators), waste incineration (burners and scrubbers), filtration (centrifuges and membranes), chemical processes (reformers) and optics (lasers and mirrors). Products suitable for NASA applications are high temperature thermal/structural subassemblies for Reusable Launch Vehicles, Planetary Entry Spacecraft, Hypersonic Vehicles and advanced ram, scram and rocket propulsion systems.

TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>As The Center of Excellence for Human Operations in Space seeks to expand the possibilities of space exploration, they have recognized the limitations when it comes to medical care.  Small crews have mission critical skills, but receive little training and practice in emergency medical response.  If a medical emergency were to occur, these crewmembers will have to handle the diagnosis and treatment under extremely stressful conditions.  NASA has recognized that the use of physiological simulation models can aid in protocol and procedure development for emergency medical response.
<br>
<br>During PH 1, we showed that traditional medical treatment used on Earth may not always be transferable to a space environment.  A number of physiological changes take place in space flight and these changes may have important effects on response to treatment. During PH 2, we will model these changes in human physiology using the Emergency Care Simulator.  This will aid in both the teaching and learning of appropriate medical management of the most likely medical emergencies that may arise.  The simulator will be modified to provide additional visual and audible cues to aid in the diagnosis of conditions, will allow for interaction with commonly used defibrillators and function in rugged environments. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The enhanced simulator will facilitate the teaching and evaluation of non-medical personnel on medical procedures by providing visual and audible cues to aid in the diagnosis of conditions.  The enhanced simulator will allow for interaction with commonly used defibrillators and function in rugged environments.  Besides medical education institutions and the military, other environments that require medically trained professionals and can use the enhanced simulator are disaster relief organizations, fire organizations, integrated emergency management system organizations, offshore oil explorations, scientific explorations of remote areas, major industrial factories and shipyards, Native Indian tribe reservations, wilderness medicine, and recreational facilities such as golf courses. </B>

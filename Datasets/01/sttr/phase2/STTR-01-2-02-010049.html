TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC) and the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UWM) have teamed in this STTR project to develop and validate an atomization/spray module that more accurately models many of the complex physical processes involved in spray combustion. Accurate predictions of atomization/spray characteristics are vital to successful analyses of combustion systems for gas turbine, rocket, and internal combustion engines. In Phase I, a cutting-edge pressure-swirl atomization model, a plain jet atomization model, and a drop secondary breakup model were successfully developed, implemented, and validated in an unstructured and parallel CFD code environment. A preliminary spray/atomization module was transferred to NASA for implementation in the National Combustion Code (NCC). In addition, UWM successfully developed and validated a comprehensive supercritical drop vaporization model that will be fully implemented in Phase II. The Phase II work will focus on the development and validation of additional submodels including airblast atomization, turbulence-spray interaction, spray-wall interaction, deformed drop drag, and multicomponent spray. Each submodel will be developed in a highly modular fashion, and the atomization/spray module will be transferred to NASA for easy implementation into NCC. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>An atomization/spray module for advanced CFD spray-combustion codes is essential for accurate combustion simulations. Such CFD codes can be used in designing and characterizing advanced gas turbines, rocket and diesel engines to improve the combustor performance, stability, durability, and pollutant emissions. Other examples of applications include characterizing nonreacting sprays for ignition calculations, spray cooling, spray painting, nozzle design for power plants, and any other application where liquid sprays are involved in industrial processes. The module will enable a range of commercial opportunities including software license sales and consulting services. </B>

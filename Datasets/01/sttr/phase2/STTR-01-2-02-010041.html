TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>Under this STTR Phase II, MiTi? will further characterize and validate the high temperature foil coatings and materials identified under Phase I for use in compliant foil bearings and seals. Methods of applying the identified coatings to achieve the desired surface finish will be optimized. High temperature friction and wear tests to 1500oF will be completed using both journal bearings and thrust bearing pads to evaluate and characterize the candidate coatings and foil materials. The use of sacrificial coatings as identified in Phase I will also be investigated. High temperature foil material manufacturing processes specifically designed for foil bearings and seals will be conducted. Final validation of selected materials and manufacturing methods will be conducted under dynamic bearing testing at elevated temperatures. The test results will be used to refine the bearing/sealing/coating system designs for incorporation into a candidate General Aviation gas turbine engine. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>The commercial potential for the proposed coating system resulting from this program is significant, including both commercial and military applications that will use compliant foil bearings/seals. System applications for the developed bearing/coating system include gas turbine engines for helicopters, business jets, general aviation commuter jets, gas pipeline compressors, auxiliary power units and remote power generation systems.  Other applications include smaller and lighter air cycle machines for aircraft cabin pressurization and cooling; oil-free turboexpanders for high purity cryogenic gas/liquid production; motor driven compressors; and hybrid thrust bearing configurations for large gas turbine engines. The key benefit to these applications is the elimination of the lubrication system. Other coating applications include high temperature thermocouples and wires for high temperature magnetic bearings and electrical actuators. </B>

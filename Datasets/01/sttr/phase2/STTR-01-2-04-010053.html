TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>NASA/KSC is a center that is rich in needs for affordable, reusable software control systems.  Population of knowledge for a control system has been labor-intensive and costly task prone to errors and omissions.  This STTR addresses the need to automatically populate control system tools from historical archives. The use of Adaptive Machine Learning (AML) techniques has proven that we can populate the SCL Rule-Based Expert System with monitor and control rules for a Space Shuttle Main Engine data stream.  This approach keeps the human in the loop but removes mundane tasks, and allows analysis in real-time, post-test, and post-flight.
<br>
<br>Our Phase I work focused on determining nominal and off-nominal behavior during real-time monitoring. In Phase II we will expand and refine this capability and add an advisory system coupled with a diagnostics engine.  This will greatly enhance the system as an operator aid and provide insight into the source of the anomaly and suggest corrective actions.  An expanded GUI capability for data signature analysis and real-time monitor and control is also planned.  The system is envisioned as being applied to testsets and range systems to help automate equipment monitoring, aid in preventative maintenance and increase range capacity.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>With our background as an Aerospace subcontractor, there are consistent requests for new and structured methodologies for automating the monitoring of real-time systems for Testsets, Simulators, Control Centers and Flight software systems. ICS is a subcontractor to Lockheed Martin who has autonomy and fault management requirements for both the SBIRS-High ground system and the Advanced EHF satellite. 
<br>
<br>Commercial Satellite operators could mine past performance data and feed the results into the manufacturing process to influence component designs and change the day-to-day operational constraints to lengthen the service life of the satellite.
<br>
<br>NASA Life Science Growth Chambers, KSC testsets, and industrial control systems can benefit from this capability to automatically generate control laws from the mining of historical archives to infer the optimum control system settings for the desired experiment or industrial control application.
<br>
<br>The proposed system provides a cost effective solution to a wide range of control system problems and market segments. ICS?s Open-Source Model accelerates market penetration. ICS offers the SCL toolkit as a documented and supported COTS product -- a first in our industry. Our software is available at http://www.opencontrol.org.

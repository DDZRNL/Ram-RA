TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>Current thermal protection systems (TPS) severely limit the flight path and the mission flexibility of space transportation vehicles, including reusable launch vehicles.  TPS are essential, but add parasitic weight rather than providing both structural functionality and thermal protection.  Multifunctional TPS with combined thermal-structural capability would be highly desirable.  TPS are also subject to limited life due to rapid failure or need for replacement if the outer surface suffers damage.  The overall objective of this project is to overcome the limitations of current TPS and enhance capabilities over developmental systems by demonstrating an innovative, multifunctional and self-healing TPS.  This unique new system provides an unequaled combination of performance, large cross-section fabricability and low fabrication cost.  Phase I emphasized baseline application definition and process development for the innovative carbon aerogel-filled, carbon foam core structure.  A new lower-cost, larger-scale aerogel infiltration method was developed and demonstrated.  This reduces processing time by >50% and no longer requires equipment-intensive, costly and scaleup-inhibiting supercritical drying of the aerogel.  In a parallel, but secondary, effort, development was started of enhanced and potentially self-healing carbon/carbon facesheets.  In Phase II, the technology will be scaled up and demonstrated for a selected application. </B>

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>Next-generation systems applications for the proposed advanced TPS include future space transportation vehicles, including reusable launch vehicles, the Military Space Plane and Space Maneuvering Vehicle or Space Operations Vehicle, reentry vehicles, and hypersonic missiles.  The proposed TPS could also benefit existing applications, such as the leading edges and windward surfaces of the space shuttle orbiter.  The proposed system has potential for dramatic weight reduction and higher operating temperature compared to state-of-the-art TPS designs, as well as improved durability, enhanced fabricability, and lower cost.  Broader derivatives of the technology are also foreseeable.  For example, using lower temperature variants of the aerogel filler (e.g. polymeric aerogels rather than pyrolyzed carbon aerogels within a rigid open-cell foam structure) could lead to structural, low temperature insulation systems.  These systems could be used with low temperature aerospace tank structures or could be considered for low temperature commercial applications. </B>

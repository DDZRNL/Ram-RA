TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
Accurate CFD predictions of atomization/spray characteristics are vital to the successful design of gas turbine, rocket, and internal combustion engines. To achieve this capability, it is necessary to establish a comprehensive model for each spray sub-process. CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC) and the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UWM) will team in this STTR project to develop and validate an atomization/spray module easily adaptable to almost all CFD codes.  The goal of this Phase I research project is to transfer the innovative pressure-swirl sheet and jet breakup models recently developed by UWM to a preliminary atomization/spray software module, and test it in CFDRC's commercial CFD code, CFD-ACE+, for gas turbine applications. The new models fully consider the effects of liquid viscosity, surface tension, and the surrounding gas on the wave growth process with both long and short wave breakup mechanisms. The predictions using the spray atomization module will be compared to benchmark spray data sets, such as ones from NIST and AFRL. In addition, UWM will develop a preliminary version of a cutting-edge supercritical drop vaporization model, which will be validated and implemented in the module in Phase II. In Phase II, models for airblast atomization, drop/drop collision and coalescence, drop drag with drop deformation, multi-component drop vaporization with consideration of fuel superheated and supercritical condition, and spray/wall impingement and wall film vaporization will be developed and included in the module. The module will be thoroughly validated and made ready for commercialization.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
An atomization/spray module for advanced CFD combustion codes is essential to accurately simulate combustion environments. Such CFD codes can be used in designing and characterizing advanced gas turbines, rocket and diesel engines to improve the performance, stability, durability, and pollutant emissions of their combustors. Other examples of applications where the module can be used include characterizing nonreacting sprays for ignition calculations, spray cooling, spray painting, nozzle design for power plants, and any other application where liquid sprays must be modeled.  The module will be implemented into a commercial CFD code and will be easily adaptable to other spray combustion codes, such as the National Combustion Code.

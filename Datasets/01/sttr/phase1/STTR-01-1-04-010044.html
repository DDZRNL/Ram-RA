TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
This research will investigate a new technique for analyzing operation characteristics of future space transportation systems using a variation of activity based cost modeling. The unique element of the new technique is its focus on simulation modeling to translate vehicle design parameters into a set of activities and a related process map in a domain (operations characteristics of future space vehicle concepts) where there is limited knowledge. This approach is innovative because it will, for the first time, combine activity-based cost modeling (which is known to work well in well-defined environments) with expert knowledge to estimate the activities, cost, and time characterizations associated with proposed space transportation concepts. With this approach, ground processing assessments of future launch vehicles could be substantially improved.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
Preliminary assessments of the need for the modeling technology proposed above indicate a strong desire in several sectors of the space industry. CCT?s involvement in the Vision Spaceport partnership has included extensive market research and commercialization planning for a space operations modeling tool.  In addition, the basic concepts of modeling in this manner have direct relationship to modeling similar systems such as airports, seaports, and over the road traffic.

TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
The innovation proposed is the development and characterization of a family of engineered-materials applicable to NASA?s Space Launch Initiative (SLI) and hypersonic aircraft development.  Nanostructure and microporous morphologies will be optimized to provide materials with the high specific strength and low thermal conductivity required for multifunctional integrated thermal structures.  Phase I deliverables will include thermal/mechanical test data, analytical models to predict material performance, and proof-of-concept panel test results. Reducing dry weight supports NASA?s SLI goal of lowering launch costs by 1-to-2 orders of magnitude.  Thermal-structure integration will result in a significant weight reduction of propellant tanks, structure and thermal protection system.  The critical component required is a low-thermal conductivity material to join the hot external skin to the cool structure or tank.  Our solution is to combine microporous and nanostructure technologies to develop new materials that have the low thermal conductivity of foams but with significantly higher strength and damage tolerance.  Phase II will be directed at designing and testing an integrated thermal-structure panel for a typical space launch or hypersonic vehicle application.  The analytical models developed in Phase I will also be used to identify design solutions for a variety of other applications such as jet and rocket engines.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
The initial STTR focus is on developing technology to meet NASA?s need for efficient, light-weight structures for future vehicles.  If this new material exhibits the characteristics we expect, the range of applications goes considerably beyond aerospace structures.  There will be broad applicability to propulsion systems, ground-based gas turbines, heat exchangers, and various process furnaces. BTI has  had discussions with Aeroflex Laboratories, who were interested in investigating the use of this new material for an in-orbit space propulsion system contract they are currently working on.

TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
In this first phase of technical development, this proposal for research and development seeks to design an architecture that will enable MIL-STD-1553B digital data bus monitoring through an isochronous channel of an IEEE-1394A High Performance Serial Bus.
<br>
<br>The traits of this design will give I&T (integration and test) and launch operations teams full access to the spacecraft avionics bus, including the ability to monitor both IEEE-1394 traffic as well as MIL-STD-1553 traffic.  This development will allow operators to more reliably detect and analyze anomalous conditions from a remote location through a retractable umbilicus.
<br>
<br>The second objective of the first phase of this development is the design of a bridge, which will enable two-way data communications between the IEEE-1394A and MIL-STD-1553B buses.  The design will implement the fault-tolerant architecture developed at the JPL Center for Integrated Space Microsystems.
<br>
<br>Technical challenges include maintaining the redundant nature of the MIL-STD-1553B digital data bus, maintaining signal timing requirements of MIL-STD-1553B, and encapsulating MIL-STD-1553B signals on an IEEE-1394A bus.
<br>
<br>If Phase I proves feasibility, Phase II will be proposed to develop a commercially viable system around this architecture and test its capabilities in a laboratory environment.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
SEAKR Engineering, Inc. is a preeminent provider of spacecraft and military memory systems.  This technology transfer proposal, in Phase I alone, will bring SEAKR Engineering the technical expertise in IEEE-1394A.  This will create an availability of IEEE-1394A-compliant memory systems for spacecraft development by government agencies and private companies.
<br>
<br>In Phase II of this proposal, a commercial computer system will be developed that has the capability to support IEEE-1394A components and MIL-STD-1553B components.  This will have the effect of accelerating the state of spacecraft, and other vehicle, technology.  It will create a demand for IEEE-1394A avoinic components, science instruments, and so forth as it becomes more common.
<br>
<br>Without this innovation, the demand for modern components will be stalled.  Without the ability to use proven components in a spacecraft design, government and industry will be slow to migrate to this new architecture being considered by the international community.  Insufficient demand for modern components will cause costs to escalate for those programs that require them.  This proposal will create a greater demand for IEEE-1394A spacecraft components, which will stimulate the commercial sector with new business and reduce costs for end users.

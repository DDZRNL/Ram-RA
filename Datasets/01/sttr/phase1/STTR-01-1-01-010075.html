TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
The practice of medicine is confounded by severe restrictions as the Human Race reaches farther out into space. A Mars mission will have communication delays of up to 40 minutes and make emergency support difficult.  Intelligent medical systems will have to be devised to support these efforts.  Current technologies have developed to where a combination of different artificial intelligent methodologies can be used together to fuse the data from multiple heterogeneous sources, and create a diagnosis and treatment path.  This path will coach and/or assist a crewmember to complete emergency treatment.   The system can be used in both in  ?sickbay? and remote environments.  It will be able to work with delayed Earth support as well as be able to stand alone in cases of emergencies and communication failure.  Intellas has outlined a Phase 1 project for a proof of concept for the unique distributed artificial intelligence infrastructure that will be required to be the foundation of such a system.  This system will be able to grow and adapt to new patient information gathering devices, diagnosis, and treatments as technology changes, thus allowing the system?s knowledgebase to continually develop and advance.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
The initial adaptation of an Intelligent Medical System from NASA use would be for use by the United States Military.  Forward deployed field medics and physician assistants will be able to provide rapid expert care to casualties beyond their current abilities.  This can help relieve the scarcity of doctors on the battlefield.  The use of such a system may also be used for United Nations missions to remote areas where health care does not exist.  The system could be used either by the Team or used to provide disaster relief.  The next adaptation would be to civilian use by paramedics to perform more extensive care.  It will also be able to be used by clinics and emergency rooms to expand the capabilities of the staff.  This can provide a great social benefit by providing low-cost health care to those who may not be able to afford health insurance.  The final adaptation may even be its availability to most any individual similar to the recent approval of publicly available defibrillation devices.  The programming and development techniques may also be adapted to manufacturing to assist in quality assurance by allowing multi-modal, non-destructive testing and inspection of assembled items.

TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
The opportunity addressed in this proposal is to transfer a fuel-additive technology developed for NOx and particulate matter reduction in diesel fuels, to applications in ultra-efficient jet engine fuels, with no reduction in performance and power output of the engine. The innovation is based on a novel fuel additive, PuriNOx(TM), developed by Lubrizol Corporation. Unlike conventional fuel additives that reduce combustion efficiency and performance, this new chemical will lower the flame temperature to reduce NOx and particulate matter production, with no penalty to efficiency or performance. Transfer of this technology by the SEA, Inc./Kettering University team will have significant positive impact on national air quality concerns of commercial and military aircraft. During the Phase I program, our team will analytically quantify the impact of the fuel additive on NOx reduction for jet fuels and overall engine performance (specific impulse, thrust/weight, combustion efficiency). In addition, some limited, simple testing of the fuel additive will be performed. In the Phase II effort, full scale testing at NASA/GRC facilities is anticipated, and the results shared with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), jet engine manufacturers and commercial airlines.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
Current commercial airline flight schedules have been impacted by Federal deregulation of the airline industry, which has led to large increases in passenger travel, a shortage of available runways, and other infrastructure issues. Resolution of these issues (e.g., constructing more runways, scheduling more flights) is often limited by air quality standards at the airport locations, and the current levels of engine emissions during flight takeoff and landing. The proposed technology is expected to have a significant impact on the reduction of NOx and particulate matter emissions, which will improve overall air quality at the airports, and allow for greater flexibility in commercial flight planning. Significant application by commercial jet engine manufacturers and airlines is anticipated, based on successful demonstration of the technology in diesel fuels (14% NOx reduction, 63% particulate matter reduction in commercial diesel-powered products), as certified in February 2001 by the California Air Resources Board.

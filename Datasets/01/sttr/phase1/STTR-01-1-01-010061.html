TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
RosettaMed, Inc. (RMI) proposes to develop and test (1) an optimized, intelligent and cost effective medical system that supports current medical operations concepts performed by non-physician astronauts (or civilian paramedical support personnel) with minimal medical experience who are supported by extensive communications with Earth-based (or medical center based) medical personnel; (2) an embedded real-time, expert system in the medical system that allows capture of expert knowledge and direction and real time distribution of that knowledge and direction from the computer system as well as knowledge and direction from an on-line medical expert such as a medical doctor; (3) a compact, radio frequency linked personal computer device that allows rapid, one-handed text and numeral data entry as well as fully functional keyboard-based data management operations, as opposed to pointer-based menu selections; and (4) an embedded real-time, training system within the medical system that allows on-the spot training of various medical problem case scenarios based on medical diagnostic input, injuries, and illnesses.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
Funding and execution of this proposal will result in two products.  The first is an intelligent medical system with expert training system (IMS/ETS) that will help improve the effectiveness and timeliness of health care services.  There are at least three very large classes of clients for an IMS/ETS: (a) the professional health care service providers who need clinical decision support tools at the point-of-care, be that in the clinic exam room, at the hospital bedside, or at the scene of an accident; (b) the public consumer who needs to make family or personal health decisions such as whether to buy an over-the-counter antihistamine versus decongestant, or whether to go to the emergency room at night versus wait to go to their doctor?s office the next day; and (c) the public or occupational health intermediary who needs an efficient way to deploy population health policies, procedures or protocols to staff and employees for use in the field or factory.  The second is a compact, radio frequency linked computer with rapid, one-hand data entry capability that will support a variety of software applications on a standard operating system platform.  The commercial applications for this type of computer, beyond supporting an IMS/ETS, are nearly infinite.

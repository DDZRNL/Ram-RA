TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
This effort focuses on the development tool, which evaluates the safety-critical requirements of future HEDS program requirements. The software will enhance the design and analysis of space systems with the objective of enhancing their safety-critical success. Results from this software will provide the needed evidence to quantify the level of risk in software intensive systems. This tool uses failure mode effects analysis (FEMA), critical items list (CIL) and other intelligent and adaptive techniques to link undesired system events to their mitigating requirements, ultimately tracing to design and implementation. Undesired system events are described in the form of linguistic inference flow charts, such as fault trees and Petri-nets. Strategies to automatically translate linguistic inference flow charts into extended logic equations, and methods for verifying software systems safety-critical or mission-critical requirements are implemented. Also, where appropriate, subsystems are designed with the use of adaptive models, with the objective of enforcing safety or mission-critical requirements at subsystem interfaces. Also, the input of data or the transfer of output data to other software tools is automated. Interfaces for interchange of data, in software and hardware modes are carefully integrated, so the possibility of sharing of capabilities between models can be readily executed.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
Current market research indicates that systems engineers are lacking a serious tool that is required for safety and risk analysis.  Systems engineers are investing large resources and time to learn and reinvent systems, with the single objective of validating or verifying their design. These efforts are time consuming and totally unnecessary, especially when their major goal is the use of the system as a black box.  The commercial potential of this tool lies in its ability to fill this market gap, while providing a niche for the small and disadvantage company, Software Safety-Critical Systems, Inc (S3Inc). Phase I funds will be used to demonstrate the proof of concept of the software technology developed at S3Inc over the last five years.  The software engineering concepts to be implemented in Phase I are generic, and are applicable to a vast number of software intensive systems, especially to the US military and other safety-critical and mission critical systems.  S3Inc intends to corner this market niche and build a profitable business.

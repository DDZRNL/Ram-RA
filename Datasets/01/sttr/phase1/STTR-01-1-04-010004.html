TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
OKSI is joining with Wisconsin Center for Space Automation & Robotics (WCSAR), a NASA co-sponsored Commercial Space Center, to develop and demonstrate a technology for the automation of plant health monitoring for the creation of bio-mass and regenerative environments in space and for future greenhouses in space, on moon or Mars. In the short range this technology will support ongoing space and Earth bound (i) plant growth research by enabling automated monitoring of plant health and the detection and identification of stress causes, and (ii)automated transgenic crop development research.  The technology will allow commercial screening of gene transfer events.  The instrumentation developed under this program is based on OKSI's experience in imaging spectroscopy, and WCSAR's expertise in plant growth research and gene transfer technology both in space and on Earth.  
<br>
<br>Early space flight tests may be possible in conjunction with the WCSAR plant growth chambers and Commercial Plant Biotechnology Facility.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
Efficient food production for domestic use and export is a major pillar of the US economy.  Economic strength and environmental safety considerations require continuous development of new varieties of crops.  The number of transgenic crops already approved and those awaiting approval steadily increase.  Efficient gene transfer processes require maximum automation.  The instrumentation technology to be developed under this program contributes to this end.  Moreover, the plant health monitoring techniques will allow the implementation of spatial crop management based on vehicle mounted sensors, which is a key requirement for precision farming techniques.  Spatial crop management techniques, just as genetically improved crops, optimize the use of irrigation water in regions where water is costly (e.g., California), reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers, thus protecting ground waters, wild life, and humans, and improves overall production efficiency.  OKSI has a number of commercial customers interested in these technologies and ready to support the commercialization stage.  
<br>
<br>Finally, the instrumentation technology will allow the development of regenerative environments in space for recycling water, carbon dioxide, and food production.

TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
Under this STTR Phase I, MiTi? proposes the development of low cost, low coefficient of friction, long life high temperature coatings capable of operating at temperatures up to 1500oF. The coatings are intended for use with compliant foil bearings and foil seals and are innovative because they may be applied using conventional air spray application. This technology is relevant to NASA?s Aerospace propulsion objectives and efforts towards increasing engine efficiencies and reduced pollution and noise as detailed in the UEET and Gap Plans. Specifically, the application of MiTi??s compliant foil seal technology to advanced gas turbine engines will improve engine specific fuel consumptions. Similarly, the use of compliant foil bearings, which can eliminate oil in the engine will have lower powerloss than existing high speed ball bearings, thus enhancing fuel efficiency. MiTi? will use state-of-the-art foil bearing / foil seal analysis tools to establish bearing design parameters for high temperature applications. To ensure consistent performance over the engine life, the lubricated coatings for both air bearings and film riding seals must be able to sustain large numbers of start/stop cycles.  Due to the criticality of materials for this environment RPI will further identify the material system for Phase II.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
The commercial potential for compliant foil seal/ foil bearings resulting from this program is significant, including both commercial and military applications. They are already being developed for a wide range of turbomachines.  System applications for the developed bearing include gas turbine engines for helicopters, business jets, general aviation commuter jets, as well as gas pipeline compressors, auxiliary power units and  remote power generation systems the employ magnetic bearings will also benefit.  Other applications include smaller and lighter air cycle machines for aircraft cabin pressurization and cooling; oil-free turboexpanders for high purity cryogenic gas and liquid production; motor driven compressors; and hybrid thrust bearing configurations for large gas turbine engines. The key benefit to many of the systems is the elimination of the lubrication system with its high parts count, limited temperature capability, and need for gear driven generator system.  Besides simplified designs, the new class of bearing is robust and permits expanded operating envelopes.

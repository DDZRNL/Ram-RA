TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
High-speed, real-time diagnostic and advisory systems are part of ICS?s heritage.  Unstructured and labor-intensive knowledge capture systems have been the downfall of many monitor and control systems.  We believe that an adaptive learning system can greatly aid in the population and refinement of automated reasoning systems.  Our proven, man-rated expert system must be populated with the fault monitoring rules for a given domain.  Exhaustive path analysis for complex systems has proven to be labor-intensive and error prone without a structured methodology or an automated approach.  
<br>
<br>ICS and FIT believe that an automated learning system can define relationships between sensors and effectors and automatically generate rules for the Expert System to aid the operator in real-time monitor and control.  This new tool would be a leap forward in extending the capabilities of the system to perform system validation procedures and offer advisories to operators and other web-based users in real-time.  FIT?s  research into adaptive learning and data mining systems holds great promise for non-invasive applications to mine knowledge from data streams.  Using ICS and FIT?s research, we believe a derivative architecture can correlate data measurands and auto-generate rules for an expert system for monitor and control.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
With our background as an Aerospace subcontractor, there are consistent requests for new and structured methodologies for automating the monitoring of real-time systems for Testsets, Simulators, Control Centers and Flight software systems.  ICS is a subcontractor on Lockheed Martin?s SBIRS-High ground system and the Advanced EHF satellite.  Both systems have autonomy and fault management requirements which could be serviced by this proposed technology.  ICS is currently under contract with the NRL for the FAME program which also has a requirement for a sophisticated level of onboard autonomy. 
<br>
<br>ICS has also fielded systems for e-Business applications.  Business Rules, work flow automation and other business practices require a structured methodology for population of automation tools.  Several commercial (transportation, robotics, etc) and government customers have expressed a strong interest in these technologies to aid in the automation of their missions.  Network monitor and control is another use of this technology for root-cause analysis.
<br> 
<br>The proposed system provides a cost effective solution to a wide range of control system problems and market segments. Market penetration is accelerated by ICS?s Open-Source Model.  ICS offers documented and supported open source software solutions as COTS -- a first in our industry.  Our software is available at http://www.opencontrol.org.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The overall objective of this STTR effort is to evaluate and demonstrate the potential for well-designed, strategically-located synthetic jet actuators to provide improved aircraft safety by: (1) delaying wing stall and improving aircraft controllability at high angles of attack and (2) providing low-cost actuation redun-dancy to improve controllability in the event of a mechanical control surface failure.  Delaying flow separa-tion (i.e., wing stall) and providing "back-up" control power could allow an aircraft to recover from adverse conditions (due to a control surface failure, pilot/autopilot error, etc.) that would otherwise result in a loss of control.<br>Flow control studies have shown that synthetic jet actuators are efficient devices for controlling separated internal and external flows.  However, an obstacle to the widespread application of synthetic jet actuators for practical flight control is that modulated input signals to achieve closed-loop flow control objectives have been shown to be complex.  Barron Associates, the University of Virginia, and the University of Wyoming propose to develop a software toolbox for the creation of adaptive control systems for actuators having complex, nonlinear dynamics.  The Phase II effort will culminate in a wind tunnel test that quanti-fies the safety improvement potential offered by adaptively-controlled synthetic jet actuators.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed research effort clearly offers the potential for a significant leap in vehicle performance, op-eration, safety, cost, and capability.  The technology will require a Phase III demonstration in an actual-flight environment to fully characterize and validate the performance that is predicted in simulation and demonstrated in wind tunnel experiments in Phase II. The research is particularly relevant to NASA's Intelligent Flight Control System (IFCS), which has the objective of enabling a pilot to land an aircraft that has suffered a major systems failure or combat damage, and also to the Single Aircraft Accident Preven-tion thrust of the Aviation Safety Program in which Barron Associates has participated for a number of years.  The adaptive control system toolbox will have widespread application to traditional and newly-emerging flight control system actuation technologies.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Adaptive active flow control methods could enable significant advances for numerous aerospace sys-tems, including military fixed-wing aircraft, unmanned air vehicles, projectiles, and commercial and gen-eral aviation aircraft. The vast array of corporations and federally-funded entities currently engaged in active flow control research creates the potential for a large contract R&D market. Furthermore, active flow control technology provides a natural complement to other advanced intelligent vehicle control prod-ucts already under development at Barron Associates.  <br>The most direct commercialization route is via collaboration with the major airframers.  Fortunately, Bar-ron Associates has strong, existing working relationships with these companies.  As parallel research advances at the major aerospace companies, BAI will pursue commercialization and collaboration oppor-tunities.  Although it is difficult to predict the rate of advancement of the ongoing research activities upon which future commercialization may depend, even a relatively small market can play a significant role in our growth as a company.<br>

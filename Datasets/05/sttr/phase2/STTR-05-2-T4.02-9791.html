<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
During the phase I program Northwestern and APS, Inc., have manufactured several different materials systems that are lighter than Beryllium and stiffer than Aluminum.  These high specific strength materials are also easily fabricated into larger shapes or even net shape processed. The mechanical (tensile and modulus) and thermal physical (CTE, thermal conductivity) property data for several systems never before manufactured, will be presented as well as fabricated coupons, mirrors, structures and other parts will be available for review.  Several different diameter parts ranging for 3" to 11" have been demonstrated.  These various extremely lightweight systems are easily machined, threaded/joined and have highly variable properties, including variations of thermal conductivity, and radiation hardening/protection capabilities. Phase II will continue with this success for mirrors an dlightweight structure.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Other applications where newly developed high stiffness, light weight materials are desirable include UAV and ultralight airship applications. UAV payloads are extremely mass sensitive and therefore would benefit from stiff, yet light materials that can be readily machined into optical components and structures.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Lightweight structure, mirrors, insulation, shielding, HES, TAFIR, and Next genreation shuttle

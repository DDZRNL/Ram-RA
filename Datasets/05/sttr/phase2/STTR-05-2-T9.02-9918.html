<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Payload Systems Inc. (PSI) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) were selected to jointly develop the Rule-based Analytic Asset Management for Space Exploration System (RAMSES) in this NASA STTR project. This system implements a modular layered architecture that enables automated multi-level asset tracking and management for both space and ground applications based on state-of-the-art RFID technology. The main advantages of this system over current bar-code based asset tracking are: (i) significant time savings through automation, (ii) real-time remote status monitoring through the internet, and (iii) rule-based analytics for proactive asset management.<br><br>In Phase 2 we propose to redesign the Smart Container by taking advantage of Generation 2 RFID tag technology, lightweight RFID readers and batteries as well as integrating container technologies in a more tight and robust manner. We plan to build a total of three (3) smart containers to demonstrate scalability of the system and interaction among containers. The RAILS software will be upgraded to provide enterprise-level capabilities such as user authentication, inventory and item time history analysis, and an expanded analytic rule set. Testing will be conducted both in the laboratory and in the field to demonstrate seamless three level tracking (container level, room level, outdoors). Finally, we will perform a detailed RAMSES cost/benefit analysis and market survey in preparation for Phase 3.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The design-driving NASA commercial application for the RAMSES system is for asset management for space exploration systems. Primarily, this is aimed at ISS, Lunar, and later Mars exploration with human crews. NASA commercial applications also abound for Earth-based implementations, which are also within closer reach due to the less stringent technical and certification requirements.  The architecture of RAMSES can be easily adapted to other applications that involve multiple distributed assets, agents with extraordinary time and resource constraints, and the need for comprehensive data logging and database management.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
We anticipate that there are other applications that are more near term both within NASA and beyond, and in military and commercial sectors.  The system could be used for humanitarian aid in remote locations, military outpost establishment, and remote exploration bases on Earth.  The system could also be used in the planning and management of assets in complex search and rescue scenarios. Generally, RAMSES excels when the movement of assets is somewhat dynamic, unpredictable and where it occurs across multiple levels (in and out of containers, shelves, rooms, etc.).

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Radiative heat fluxes are important in the design of launch vehicles for Project Constellation.  In this Phase II STTR, CFDRC and its partner Mississippi State University will develop an innovative, comprehensive, high fidelity radiation module in the LOCI CFD framework that will enable NASA to design/analyze heat transfer challenges that include radiation.  In Phase I, CFDRC/MSU successfully demonstrated the feasibility of developing a radiation module in LOCI-Chem.  A preliminary module was developed that included a gray gas model, as well as simplified nongray gas and particulate radiation capabilities.  Following successful implementation and validation, LOCI-Chem with the radiation module was successfully applied to a Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) plume on a launch pad as a demonstration case.  The proposed Phase II effort continues the development by: 1) implementing more accurate, robust nongray gas and particle radiation models, 2) increasing tool-fidelity by developing innovative methodologies to minimize modeling uncertainties, 3) formally verifying the module using the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and 4) validating the module and applying it to cases of direct relevance to NASA.  NASA, ATK, and Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne will be beta testers of the software in Phase II, and provide user feedback. At the end of Phase II, a final version of the software with full documentation will be delivered to NASA.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The LOCI radiation module will enable NASA and government contractors to design and analyze rocket engine flows with gaseous and particle radiation.  As part of Project Constellation, NASA/MSFC is embarking upon the design of Ares launch vehicles, in which radiative heat fluxes from the solid rocket booster (SRB) plume to the launch pad must be considered.  For Ares-V, challenges exist in simultaneously predicting the multiple plume environments, including gas-generator dumps, RSRM-V plume and overall heat transfer to the base of the first stage.  These and other applications involving radiative heat transfer can be successfully analyzed by the end of Phase II.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The LOCI-Chem radiation module will have a wide appeal to rocket engine manufacturers and universities developing rocket engine technology (e.g., Purdue, Penn State, UAH, etc.) under the CUIP Program.  The LOCI suite of codes (e.g., LOCI-Chem, LOCI-Stream, etc.) has become an important design/analysis tool at NASA, and NASA's primes are beginning to show interest and use the LOCI codes, such as ATK, Pratt & Whitney, and Aerojet. A support letter is included from ATK, showing their intent of assessing the LOCI-Chem radiation module. A stand-alone radiation module will also be developed for commercialization in other CFD codes. Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne has expressed interest in implementing the stand-alone radiation module into their in-house CFD code, and purchasing the module following successful demonstration (support letter included). Another source of revenue will come from implementing the radiation module into CFDRC's DREAM code, a next generation combustion LES code for gas turbine combustor/augmentor analysis.

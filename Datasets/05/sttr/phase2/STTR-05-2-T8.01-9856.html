<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The intent of the proposed effort is to investigate the detailed composite material performance characteristics after being subjected to cryogenic temperatures and impact damage.  HyPerComp Engineering, Inc. (HEI) and Utah State University (USU) further propose to correlate these characteristics to composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) and demonstrate the correlation through actual COPV testing.  This will result in a safer, more reliable design for high performance COPVs in a cryogenic environment.<br><br>HEI and USU also propose to study the cryogenic bond necessary between composites and aluminum for thin walled aluminum lined COPVs to prevent the buckling of the aluminum during depressurization.  This intent will be demonstrated by actual pressure vessel testing.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA applications for the research proposed herein would include the following:<br>?	Cryogenic storage vessels.  The research proposed herein is applicable to earth-based and space-based cryogenic storage vessels.<br>?	Habitat structures.  The research proposed herein is applicable to space-based habitat and other structures manufactured with fiber-reinforced composite material.<br>?	Space-based cryogenic COPVs.  It is probable that COPVs utilized in space will experience impact damage due to micrometeoroids and other space debris.  The research proposed herein will assist the COPV designer by identifying the effects of impact damage and developing mechanical property allowables for the designer.<br>?	Thin walled aluminum COPVs for cryogenic storage.  The research proposed herein will assist the development of maintaining the bond between composite and thin walled aluminum to prevent the aluminum liner buckling during depressurization.<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Non-NASA commercial applications for the research proposed would include the following:<br>?	LH2 fuel cell.  HEI is currently executing a contract for LH2 storage for a vehicle application.  In fact, HEI has completed six (6) other contracts for similar applications.  The research proposed herein will aid the mobile fuel cell industry safety and reliability.<br>?	Vehicular CNG storage.  HEI have completed as many as ten (10) contracts for CNG storage applications.  These applications were primarily for vehicular applications.  The research proposed herein will aid the safety and reliability of the CNG vehicle market.<br>?	Environmentally-friendly earth-based cryogenic fluid storage.  Composite structures do not react to environmental corrosion as do the typical cost efficient metals such as steel.  Therefore, composite structures do not require painting, paint stripping, and repainting which is very unfriendly to our environment.<br>?	Safer earth-based cryogenic fluid storage.  Due to the high strength of composite materials, little raw material is required to perform draconian structural feats when compared to typical cost efficient metals.  Therefore, the manufacturing and movement of large composite pressure vessels is much less expensive and much safer to the technicians performing the manufacturing and moving of such vessels.<br>

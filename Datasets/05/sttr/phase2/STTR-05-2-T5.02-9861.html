<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
In integrating the following three significant components for its research/research and development (R/R&D) effort, the power of this candidate Phase II project will be demonstrated and developed the following<br>1. Software Application Development Toolkit for Simulation and Training <br>2. Physiological Hardware/Software Interface for Dynamic Balance Trainer.<br>3. A Data Glove and control system captures the motion of the Robonaut hand and finger<br>The multi-faceted CVEST development environment operates as a plug-and-play interface to various software and hardware products specializing in virtual reality-based simulation development. The final Phase II demonstration will feature to show the CVEST toolkit for the CEV Seat design concept<br><br>This STTR Phase II candidate project will concentrate on some new physiological hardware/software devices to produce a Dynamic Balance Trainer System to improve Post-flight Locomotor Performance.<br><br>Lastly STTR Phase II candidate project will develop and demo a prototype concept device to capture the positional and rotational of the Robonaut hand<br>

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The Integrated Data Assimilation Architecture (IDAA) addresses the fundamental problem of command, control, and communications systems interoperability.  Interoperability of Explorations systems is necessary to improve reliability, reduce complexity, increase software and hardware reusability, and enable multi-developer / multi-agency support. The IDAA architecture consists of a software component, the BioNet middleware, and a hardware component, a Mobile Data Acquisition and Communications processing System (MDACS).  Development and advancement of the BioNet middleware was the primary focus of the Phase I STTR effort.  Continued BioNet middleware development will occur as a proposed Phase II activity along with the development of the MDACS generic hardware platform.  From a functional perspective, the BioNet middleware provides a standards-based command and control capability, while the MDACS provides a generic space-rated hardware platform for general-purpose computations and communications.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Potential near-term NASA applications of the proposed architecture include vehicle health monitoring of the Shuttle and CEV, structural and environmental monitoring in and around the International Space Station (ISS), and crew medical monitoring.  As part of the Exploration Directorate, proximity networks could easily be deployed on the Moon and Mars, with inherent interoperability and coexistence capabilities even when provided by multiple sources.  Such networks could include imagery collection, crew communication, remote sensing nodes for scientific applications, robotic command and control, and environmental and safety monitoring of crew habitats. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The development of the proposed architecture for use by NASA on the International Space Station and for Exploration-class missions has significant application to commercial space-based and terrestrial markets, including military network centric warfare applications, homeland security, satellite data systems, medical instrumentation and the healthcare industry, and industrial facility monitoring.

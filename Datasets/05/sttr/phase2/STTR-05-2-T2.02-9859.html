<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Under NASA Phase I funding, we have developed a system for the ball bearing fault detection and identification. Our system can effectively identify multiple fault modes related to the evolution of friction within the contact in the coated ball bearings. To detect bearing faulty modes, we have developed a new bispectrum and entropy analysis method to capture the faulty transient signals embedded in the measurements. To classify the fault modes, we further developed a set of stochastic models using hidden Markov model (HMM) and Gaussian mixtures. Test results using lab experiment data have shown that our system can identify coated ball bearing fault modes in near real-time. In Phase II, we will further develop and test our system developed in Phase I for spacecraft mechanical parts health monitoring and mitigating actions. A thorough understanding of the failure mechanisms of the moving parts will emerge by the end of the Phase II effort, as well as the methodology to prevent catastrophic failure while in orbit. Algorithms developed in Phase I/II will be implemented in C/C++. Effort will be focused on the accuracy, autonomous, speed and efficiency of the system. The Boeing Company has teamed with us for Phase II effort.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The immediate benefits for NASA will be the reliable operation of many precision machinery used in tracking systems satellites, telescopes and other space instruments require very stringent position accuracy ? in the range of microns. Our system will make it possible for these enormously expensive systems to operate reliably with little or no maintenance and long service-life duration. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Our technologies can also be used for commercial industries. For example, process industry represents a major industrial segment, including oil refinery, gas, metals & mining, food processing, pulp & paper, power, pharmaceutical, etc. Our core technologies can be used in the process industry where many rotation machines are placed in the field. These instruments are either connected in a local network or connected to the central control room. Our bearing health monitoring system can be used to monitor and perform real-time diagnosis for the process systems where instruments and control equipment are placed across the entire plant. Our system can help the plant operators avoid unnecessary costly shutdowns.

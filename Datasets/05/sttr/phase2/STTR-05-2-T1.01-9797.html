<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>( Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
With embedded software becoming ever more complex, assuming that it behaves perfectly is not realistic. The adaptation of fault protection concepts to embedded software is attractive, particularly in the context of the fault containment and health management capabilities provided by ARINC 653. In Phase II we shall develop tools to define simple, verifiable models that characterize the software with respect to its interface behavior, resource usage, and data reasonableness. We shall provide a software framework to instrument and monitor the software as it executes in both test and operational environments. When a deviation from the model is detected, a simple remediation action, including a hard or soft component reset is invoked. These tools will be integrated into ARINC 653 to support fault detection and recovery in an operational context, and the Eclipse software development environment for application in a  test and verification context such as DSIL and engineering analysis context such as  CEAL. Further we shall produce a methodology to assist in certification of instantiations of our software fault protection framework.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Software errors have had adverse effects on NASA missions. Project Constellation has stringent requirements to recover from mission- and safety-critical faults. As such ISHM plays an important role. Yet ISHM methods for detecting and recovering from software errors are not well-developed. The approach developed in Phase I is targeted to Constellation and builds on the ARINC 653 Application Executive, which has been selected for use on the CEV. Further, we supply tools to be integrated into DSIL and CEAL that aid in test and verification of Constellation software. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Our key innovation is a certifiable, efficient, and effective concept for detecting and recovering from software faults. These concepts have relevance and application to any safety-critical embedded software system, including automotive, plant control, and medical systems. ARINC 653 has been widely adopted for use in both commercial and military avionic. We propose a realization of our fault protection concept as an extension of the ARINC 653 health management framework.

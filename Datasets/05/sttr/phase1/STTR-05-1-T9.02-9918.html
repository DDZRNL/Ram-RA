<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Currently, the state-of-the-art in space asset tracking and information management is bar-coding with relational database support. To support NASA's need for reliable and low-cost asset management, Payload Systems Inc. and MIT propose to develop Rule-based Analytic Asset Management for Space Exploration Systems (RAMSES) ? an intelligent space exploration environment in which information is shared and automatically harmonized among disparate data sources. This information is then combined with mathematical models and rule-based analysis to produce meaningful data for asset tracking and intelligent decisions. The combined data will communicate with analytic models that provide analyses, estimates, predictions and plans. This intelligent space exploration environment will be equipped with sensors, radio frequency identification (RFID) equipment and sophisticated information infrastructures to make full use of multiple data streams.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The prime commercial application for the RAMSES system is for asset management for space exploration systems.  Primarily, this is aimed at Lunar and later Mars exploration with human crews.  The architecture of RAMSES can be easily adapted to other applications that involve multiple distributed assets, agents with extraordinary time and resource constraints, and the need for comprehensive data logging and database management.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The system could be used for military outpost establishment and remote exploration bases on Earth.  The system could also be used in the planning and management of assets in complex search and rescue scenarios.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
An Integrated Sensing and Control of Aeroelastic Deformation (ISCAD) Toolbox is proposed. Specif-ically, this toolbox will provide a methodology, both hardware and software, that serves to compensate for uncommanded de?ections of ?ight systems. This toolbox is meant to augment existing procedures for design of both aircraft and autopilots by providing additional capabilities that address aspects unique to for aeroelastic control. The sensors are provided by the ?ow and loads measuring systems pioneered by Tao Systems while the control synthesis builds upon expertise at the University of Florida in ?exible -wing aeroelasticity.  The approach integrates state--of--the -art sensing capability with advanced control synthesis systems.  In this way, a collaborative partnership is formed that is ideally suited to develop the ISCAD Toolbox.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Advanced aerospace vehicles and system components tend to be slim and elastic, resulting in severe aeroser-voelastic problems at high speeds, which require attention in both design and routine performance for safety and ride quality. The proposed innovation has signi?cant potential applications for both NASA and the aerospace industry (commercial and military):  Fixed wing aircraft, Rotary wing aircraft, Turbo-machinery,  planetary-exploration vehicles. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In non--aerospace applications, the proposed innovation will be of value for the health monitoring of tall structures (skyscrapers, suspension bridges, chimneys and cooling towers),  sails, keel, rudder, and control surfaces of sailboats (particularly racing sailboats), ship masts and tall ship deck structures, submarine and its subsystems (e.g., control surfaces and propulsor)

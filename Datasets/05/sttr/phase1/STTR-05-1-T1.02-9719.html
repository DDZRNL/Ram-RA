<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The goal of this proposal is to explore a novel proprietary biopharmaceutical agent, named deltaFL-AA', a first in the series of innovative radioprotectors to act as an agent providing protection of the organism against major space radiation risks. These risks include organism death resulting from acute irradiation as well as radiation-induced carcinogenesis caused by low-dose exposure. An unprecedented radioprotective potency of deltaFL-AA' demonstrated by its ability to cure 100% of mice from supralethal (14 Gy) doses of gamma-irradiation and its strong immunostimulatory properties (especially the ability to trigger natural killer response, which is well established as one of the antitumor firewalls) make this drug an extremely attractive candidate for testing in a NASA-funded program.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
deltaFL-AA' and related inhibitors of cell death will be useful in the protection of human organisms from damage caused by both acute high-level and chronic low-level irradiation during space flights.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The projected market for the new class of inhibitors of cell death in the biopharmaceutical industry is broader than radioprotection associated with the specifics of space flights.  Our data demonstrates that deltaFL-AA' is extremely potent in curing mammals from supralethal, single doses of gamma-irradiation, thus making it a candidate radioprotector for biodefense needs.  These same properties also position the drug on the civilian radioprotectors market as a radiation antidote in the case of nuclear accidents. Another, not less important, civilian application is cancer treatment, where the administration of deltaFL-AA' may increase the efficacy of chemo- and radiotherapy enabling dose escalation by protecting normal tissues from the side effects of anti-tumor therapy. Additional, othert unexplored uses include other life-threatening injuries that involve massive cell death or require immunostimulation.

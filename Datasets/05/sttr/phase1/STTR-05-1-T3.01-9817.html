<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Reconfigurable antennas are attractive for remote sensing, surveillance and communications, since they enable changes in operating frequency and / or radiation pattern, resulting in high-bandwidth antenna systems, with broad areas of coverage. Additional functionality would be achieved by integrating: control, processing, and communications directly onto the antenna substrate; MEMS sensors into the antenna substrate to monitor the system health; and opto-electronic beam forming networks, providing immunity to electromagnetic interference. In order to make such systems affordable for space exploration, it is critical to minimize the cost of transporting them into space. For this reason, antennas fabricated on flexible substrates are highly desirable since they can be rolled up and launched in a low-volume configuration, then inflated in space. While these advantages are significant, the fabrication of antennas providing these features is challenging due to the lack of manufacturing technologies that can meet all of the processing requirements for fabrication on flexible substrates. In this program we will develop antenna designs and lithography-based processes, enabling manufacturing processes that cannot be carried out using existing patterning technologies, in particular: laser-crystallization, allowing for the integration of ICs; and a combination of processes to produce MEMS for on-board sensors and for reconfiguring the array.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed program will lead to highly-integrated flexible antenna systems, featuring sensors, processors, and command and communications systems. Additionally, the antenna will feature highly directional gain patterns as well as reconfigurability, to cover a large bandwidth and a wide range of scan angles. These antennas will be lightweight and, since they are flexible, they can be "collapsed" into a small volume for launch into space, and then "inflated" at the destination site. This highly integrated systems-on-flex program would also have applications in other areas of interest to NASA, such as integrated sensor skins, and solar sails / gossamer spacecraft.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The highly-integrated systems-on-flex technology developed in this program can be used for fabricating mobile electronics, where a high level  of integration on lightweight, flexible substrates is critical. There are also commercial applications in other large consumer market segments such as flat-panel displays, where portable wall-sized displays that can roll-up are the long-term goal of the industry; and in commerce, particularly in the areas of electronic labels and RFID tags.

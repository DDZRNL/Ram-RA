<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA/ Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) needs sensors that can be operated on rocket engine plume environments to improve NASA/SSC rocket engine performance.  In particular, NASA/MSFC would like to develop sensors to monitor the performance of rocket engines. The measurement of soot volume fraction and soot particle size can be employed to develop a sensor for on-line, real-time measurements to characterize the performance of hydrocarbon rocket engines and study the effects of the rocket engine exhaust on the environment. The goal of this proposed effort is to develop a laser-induced incandescence (LII) sensor, which is able to provide near real time measurement of soot concentration in the engine plume. During Phase I, a LII system based on telescopic collection optics for remote applications will be designed. The experimental parameters will be evaluated to achieve optimum response time and sensitivity. The study from Phase I will provide the necessary information to improve the phase II prototype design to achieve millisecond response time and better sensitivity. In Phase II, a prototype fieldable LII system will be developed and tested at MSFC and will be delivered to NASA/MSFC for further testing.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The LII sensor will be an advanced, non- intrusive, real-time, diagnostic tool which will be used for rocket engine testing. The sensor can provide an indication of engine performance and efficiency of the combustion process and effects on the environment of the engine testing. It will be needed to develop new hydrocarbon rocket engines.  The sensor can monitor the performance of the rocket engine by monitoring the soot volume fraction and soot particle size in the plume. It can also be used to evaluate new rocket engine fuel and help to develop new engines that are needed for the President's vision for US Space Exploration.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A compact, low cost, miniaturized LII sensor can be designed for non- NASA applications to monitor soot volume fraction and soot particle size in various engine exhausts. The sensor's non-intrusive, near real time performance capabilities will have a number of environmental applications.  It can be used to inspect diesel engine vehicles on the road to satisfy EPA requirements for soot emission from the engine. It can also be used to monitor the exhaust of certain chemical industries and combustion based power plants. This sensor will be very useful in monitoring large populated cities with heavy traffic to provide an indication of the health status of the atmosphere.

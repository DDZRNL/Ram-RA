<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary focus of Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) has been on faults due to hardware failures. Yet software is growing in complexity, controls critical functionality under a wide range of conditions and does so with greater autonomy. Furthermore, software errors have negatively impacted major missions.
<br>
<br>Runtime recovery from software faults is gaining momentum in research community with major efforts such as the IBM autonomic computing effort and the Stanford/Berkeley Recovery-Oriented Computing project. We propose application of these methods to flight software in the context of JPL's Mission Data System (MDS), an integrated systems and software architecture for next-generation space missions.
<br>
<br>Specifically, we consider:
<br>
<br>?	Detection and repair of radiation induced Single Event Upsets (SEU) that can either change data values or code.
<br>?	Recovery from bugs manifested as the use of computational resources outside of a specified mode-dependent resource profile.
<br>?	Software organization and infrastructure to help diagnose and limit the impact of errors. We shall study how to restructure MDS as a distributed system with redundant hierarchical components.
<br>?	A recovery strategy based on component-level rebooting. 
<br>
<br>This STTR is a cooperative project between the small business Kestrel Technology and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This technology is relevant to all NASA mission- and safety-critical flight software. The technology will not be specific to MDS. It can improve margins of safety for all critical software. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The technology is relevant to all safety-critical embedded control systems, now commonly found in automobiles, airplanes, other transportation systems, power plants, etc.

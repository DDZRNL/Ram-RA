<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The goal of this SBIR Phase I research project is to develop batteryless, wireless magnetic sensors with orthogonal frequency coding (OFC).  These sensors will be based on surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology already in common use in microwave filters and signal processing elements for communications devices.  We will develop new magnetostrictive structures to be combined on-chip with SAW devices to create innovative magnetic field sensors that can be individually interrogated from a distance with a microwave reader.  Combining the magnetostrictive materials with OFC SAW transponders will provide new sensor capabilities that are compatible with the orthogonal frequency coding scheme recently demonstrated under NASA funding.   The novel magnetic field sensors will be individually coded, inexpensive to manufacture, and require no on-board power?making them ideal for distributed and embedded monitoring technologies, for both government and commercial use.    
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NVE Corp. foresees a variety of applications for these sensors within NASA. These wireless sensors would have a particular advantage over other magnetic sensors in applications (including retrofit situations) where installing wires is expensive, inconvenient or hazardous.  Applications of these sensors will include:
<br>
<br>* Remote magnetic field sensing
<br>* Remote sensors for nondestructive evaluation and structural 
<br>   health monitoring.
<br>* Remote current sensors
<br>* Remote position sensors, level sensors and rotary encoders
<br>* Remote proximity switches
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Non NASA applications are similar to the NASA applications.  The sensors can be used for nondestructive evaluation of both aircraft and sea-going vessels (military and commercial), industrial control, robotics, automotive sensors, power line monitoring, and structural health monitoring of civil structures.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
HyPerComp Engineering Inc. (HEI) and Utah State University (USU) propose to develop technology for lightweight composite materials for use in composite structures suitable for both cryogenic and damage tolerant environments. The proposed effort will incorporate previous work performed by HEI in the cryogenic performance of composite materials as well as previously developed improved impact technologies for micro-meteor/space debris survivability.  The application of filament wound composite pressure vessels in pressurized storage tanks at cryogenic temperatures has been undertaken at HEI and NASA MSFC with promising results.  Likewise, HEI has been conducting research and has patented, jointly with NASA MSFC, a robust impact resistant composite pressure vessel technology.  This technology shows great promise in its resistance to performance degradation from impacts, such as those that might be experienced in the space environment in the form of micrometeoroids and space debris.  Both of these technologies have been characterized for lightweight composite pressure vessels separately.  However, little if any understanding currently exists of their combined potential for both cryogenic and impact resistant composite structures applications, of those including, composite overwrap pressure vessels (COPV's).  The combination of the foregoing cryogenic technology with an impact resistant, robust composite pressure vessel technology would be studied.  Further, we believe, that combining these two technologies will provide a baseline technology from which to develop a dual-use composite structure.  This would be to ensure the integrity of the light weight composite structures, such as cryogenic fuel is stored in an orbiting depot, when exposed to the harsh environment a spacecraft will be expected to encounter during the life of its mission.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA applications for the technologies we propose researching and developing would be light weight composite structures that could be used for reliable and safe cryogenic propellant (i.e. fuel depots) storage and robust structures and tankage capable of withstanding micrometeoroid and space debris impacts<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The commercial pressure vessel industry is always hungry for improvements in performance (i.e. weight) and safety.  There has been some significant discussion on the usage of cryogenic pressure vessels for efficient gaseous fuel storage, particularly with regard to the transportation of large volumes of gaseous fuels such as CNG.  The improvement in environmental robustness of cryogenic capable light weight pressure vessels will be noted by the commercial industry and this technology will be incorporated into specialized application.

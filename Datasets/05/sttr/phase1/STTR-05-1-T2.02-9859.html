<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The investigation of the coating friction as a function of time is important to monitor the ball bearing heath. Despite the importance of the subject mater, there is a crucial lack of information in the literature about coating life and friction force in ball bearings as coating wear of progressively increases. Here we propose to develop a strategic space vehicle health monitoring system that will identify potential and/or imminent lubrication problems, analyze these parameters in real time, and provide direct input so that these problems are mitigated prior to failure. We will set up a lab experiment environment with a universal microtribometer and acoustic emission sensors measuring the signals associated with wear and the changes that tend to occur as a function of time. Friction force and acoustic signal will be measured with respect to the bearing condition. To capture the dynamic nature of friction evolution, we propose to extract the temporal transient features from the sensing data and develop Hidden Markov Models with four distinct states associated with four operation conditions of the ball bearing. Our system uniquely combine both physics-based and stochastic models for the online diagnosis.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The immediate benefits for NASA will be the reliable operation of many precision machinery used in tracking systems satellites, telescopes and other space instruments require very stringent position accuracy ? in the range of microns. Our system will make it possible for these enormously expensive systems to operate reliably with little or no maintenance and long service-life duration. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Process industry represents a major industrial segment, including oil refinery, gas, metals & mining, food processing, pulp & paper, power, pharmaceutical, etc. Our core technologies can be used in the process industry where thousands of instruments are placed in the field. These instruments are either connected in a local network or connected to the central control room. For example, our component health monitoring system can be used to monitor and perform real-time diagnosis for the process systems where instruments and control equipment are placed across the entire plant. Our system can help the plant operators avoid unnecessary costly shutdowns.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We will design and implement an interface between the Paramesh computational libraries, developed and used by groups at NASA GSFC, and the Cactus computational framework, developed primarily by scientists at Louisiana State University, the RI on this proposal.  Our innovation falls in the domain of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), a technique to focus computational resources in regions of small scale dynamics.  Our approach is innovative as it brings together one of the leading AMR packages (Paramesh) with Cactus, a widely used modular, parallel problem solving environment that is supported on multiple computing architectures.  Our innovative proposal responds specifically the to the "Computing" subtopic in the solicitation in three areas:  It will (1) reduce costs for current Paramesh users at Goddard, by providing access to the wide variety of validated tools already available through Cactus and which would otherwise need to be redeveloped at NASA; (2) facilitate sharing of novel algorithms between Paramesh and Cactus users worldwide through the existing and proven interoperability features provided by Cactus; and (3) position Paramesh users to benefit from the many next-generation computer science innovations that are actively researched by the core Cactus development team (such as grid computing) and other Cactus contributors.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In Phase 3, we would continue the work started in Phases 1 and 2 by offering consulting services to existing Paramesh users, government and private sector, who wish to convert to Cactus via the interface developed under this proposal.  We will also investigate the possibility of charging a licensing fee for commercial users of the Paramesh driver thorns developed under this proposal.
<br>
<br>Building the interface proposed here will also play an important role in DAC's long-term commercialization strategy in combination with similar products developed under outside funding.  DAC has allocated internal investment dollars for developing tools and marketing consulting services based on an internally developed, Paramesh-based computational fluid dynamics code.  The PI for this effort, Dr. David Fiske, is actively pursing specific opportunities with the Rotorcraft Dynamics group run jointly by the U.S. Army and NASA Ames Research Center.  Our approach to this industry already uses Paramesh, so by integrating this with Cactus, we will also enjoy all of the benefits that NASA end-users will enjoy after Phases 1 and 2.  This combination will provide DAC with a competitive advantage in this market, since we will be able to leverage open source tools provide through Cactus with proprietary tools developed in-house.
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
We will combine the results of this effort with an existing effort to develop a CFD code.  Customers for the results of this combined effort will be the big 3 rotorcraft manufacturers; Bell-Textron, Boeing, and Sikorsky for the design of the next generation of military rotorcraft. The ability to do accurate vorticity modeling will grant greater understanding of the capabilities of current platforms, as well as aid in the design of rotor geometries to meet the future goals for rotorcraft.
<br>
<br>The ONR S&T Division has also identified "Computational Mechanics" as a core area for basic research, and there will be cross-over in the hydrodynamic issues that arise for helicopters and naval vessels.
<br>
<br>Another application where results of this effort would be useful is in the analysis of river currents. Vortex systems are sometimes created around pillars, for example, and can lead to the shifting of sediment at the base of the pillar. The increased understanding of how these flows behave will allow for the better design structural pillars. A similar application is a priority of the U.S. Geological Survey and the State of Louisiana. In Louisiana the Mississippi Delta Tidal Basin has lost 70% of its land mass since 1932, and the State has made it a priority to study preventive measures. Numerical models of the hydrodynamics of the Basin will be important in solving this problem. We will explore partnerships with companies that provide consulting services in these applications.

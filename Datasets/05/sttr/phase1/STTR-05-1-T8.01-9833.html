<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Molybdenum has been identified as a promising material for many high temperature NASA applications due to its high melting temperature, resistance to liquid metals, resistance to hot hydrogen, high thermal conductivity, and relatively low density.  However, molybdenum's ductile to brittle transition temperature is above room temperature, which makes fabricating complex components extremely difficult by conventional fabrication techniques.  Recent, advancements in Vacuum Plasma Spray (VPS) forming technology have enabled the fabrication of complex molybdenum and molybdenum-rhenium components.  However, further increases in performance could be gained by the development of higher use temperature molybdenum alloys.  During this investigation, innovative dispersion strengthened, molybdenum-rhenium alloys will be developed using VPS forming techniques and through the proper selection of advanced transition metal (TM) based ceramic dispersoids.  These alloys have the potential to operate at temperatures greater than 1800?C for extend durations.

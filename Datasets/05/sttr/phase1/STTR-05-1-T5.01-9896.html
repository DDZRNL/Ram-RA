<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The energy generation and storage for modern-day sensor networks, communications, and electronics presents a variety of unique challenges.  To achieve the long-duration missions away from Earth as outlined in the Vision for Human Exploration in Space, these energy storage systems will need to undergo a dramatic increase in their specific energy densities.  Recently, Mainstream has made startling advances in the area of high energy-density batteries using carbon nanotube (CNT) electrodes.  However, theory suggests that silicon actually possesses an intercalation capacity that is an order of magnitude above that of carbon.  If this is able to be translated into added capacity, it would truly revolutionize Li-ion electrochemistry and energy-storage technologies in general.  The Universities Space Research Association has recently developed a process of growing silicon nanorods and has agreed to team with Mainstream for this Phase I STTR effort.  This Phase I focuses on developing and testing electrodes comprised of both silicon and carbon nanostructures in Li-ion batteries.  Because the basic battery chemistry will not be affected, safety will not be compromised.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
High energy density batteries have potential space and air-based applications that are simply too numerous to list.  The primary benefit of any such battery for NASA is that it will permit NASA greater flexibility in planning future missions to meet new long-term objectives.  Specific potential applications include orbiters and satellites, deep space missions, instrumentation balloons, and communication equipment.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Independent marketing studies have confirmed a significant commercial application for CNT batteries; the commercial electronics battery market currently produces millions of lithium-ion batteries per month with end applications as diverse as watches, palm pilots, cell phones, hearing aides, and pacemakers.  Larger applications such as electric vehicles, space satellites for cellular communications, air-based platforms, hybrid vehicles, and tractor-trailer fleets will have need of advanced silicon and CNT electrode batteries as well.

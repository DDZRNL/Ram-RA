<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed STTR is the combination of a small business with unique materials experience, and Northwestern Unviersity, with expertise in Mirror applications, processing and characterization.  The combination of these two entities with various prime contractors providing assistance makes for a successful STTR program.   The applications for these materials have significant impact on NASA and other commercial entities.  The unique materials being demonstrated under this program also have significant commercial applications.  A successful Phase I will result in the identification of various parts and programs that can be supported by these materials.  Phase II will focus on characterization and qualification of these materials.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Light weight materials play a major role in many applications from mirrors, to electronics to secondary structure.  Possible mirror applications include IR, NIR and LIDAR with various prime contractors.  Since weight is critical a material 30% lighter than Be (also lighter the Gr/Epoxy) and stiffer than Al has many applications due to its weight advantage. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Light weight matarials such as these can be used in computers, cell phones, electronics, automotive and many other applications to name a few.

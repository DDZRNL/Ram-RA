<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The increased aircraft safety potential of active flow control using synthetic jets - specifically, using synthetic jets on the leading edge of the wing to delay flow separation - is of critical importance.  Delaying flow separation could allow an aircraft to recover from adverse conditions that would otherwise result in a loss of control.
<br>Active flow control using synthetic jet actuators has been the subject of significant research in recent years due to its immense potential to expand the operating regimes of unconventional airfoils and provide "virtual" shaping.  Barron Associates (BAI) and its research partners at the University of Virginia and the University of Wyoming propose innovative active flow control solutions that will allow achieve virtual sur-face shaping objectives and delay flow separation at high angles of attack to provide a safer and more efficient flight environment. The proposed integrated actuation and control systems will be demonstrated using a Boeing 747 flight simulation.
<br>In Phase II, the team will:  (1) implement the control algorithms in real time in hardware; (2) fabricate a Boeing 747-like scale model with integrated synthetic jet actuators, and; (3) demonstrate the actuation capacity and control algorithm performance for achieving desired flow control objectives.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed research effort clearly offers the potential for a significant leap in vehicle performance, operation, safety, cost, and capability.  The technology will require a demonstration in an actual-flight environment to fully characterize and validate the performance that is predicted in simulation and demonstrated in wind tunnel experiments. The research is particularly relevant to NASA's Intelligent Flight Control System (IFCS), which has the objective of enabling a pilot to land an aircraft that has suffered a major systems failure or combat damage, and also to the Single Aircraft Accident Prevention thrust of the Aviation Safety Program in which BAI has participated for a number of years.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Adaptive active flow control methods could enable significant advances for numerous aerospace systems, including military fixed-wing aircraft, unmanned air vehicles, projectiles, and commercial and general aviation aircraft. The vast array of corporations and federally-funded entities currently engaged in active flow control research creates the potential for a large contract R&D market. Furthermore, active flow control technology provides a natural complement to other advanced intelligent vehicle control products already under development at BAI.  
<br>The most direct commercialization route is via collaboration with the major airframers.  Fortunately, BAI has strong, existing working relationships with these companies.  As parallel research advances at the major aerospace companies, BAI will pursue commercialization and collaboration opportunities.  Although it is difficult to predict the rate of advancement of the ongoing research activities upon which future com-mercialization may depend, even a relatively small market can play a significant role in our growth as a company.

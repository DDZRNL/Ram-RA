<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposal outlines a research program for developing a novel soft-computing technology composed of an Artificial Immune System and Bayesian Belief Networks for monitoring, knowledge and information processing, and decision support infrastructure for testing of rocket engines of future spacecrafts. An engine failure during test operations may cause catastrophic results for the test article, supporting infrastructure, and potentially to supporting resources. The ability to effectively monitor health and status of a testbed and test article during a test firing and to take corrective measures for peak performance and improving reliable operations is of utmost importance. Using an existing SR-30 Jet Engine testbed utilizing artificial intelligence control techniques, novel algorithms are being developed by The University of Alabama that can function under faulty sensor conditions, can work effectively with thousands of sensors at high data rates, are self-checking, and are self-correcting can be of further support. The proposed effort builds on an existing joint MSFC/University of Alabama project where NASA's NSSTC is only funding graduate student research. This proposal will further enhance technology research for realization and synthesis of needed advanced algorithms in larger scale test platforms for propulsion health management, thereby furthering educational research addressing NASA's education missions.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed technology will help NASA test programs with advanced test platforms with improved abilities to monitor, process knowledge and system information, infer about system state, and provide supporting information for performing real time decisions. The technology is widely applicable to complex robust systems such as a rocket jet engine and supporting test infrastructures. For the test environment, insuring that reliable engineering data and supporting information from the test facility is provided to test personnel will further enable them to make qualified real time decisions. This will further guarantee mission success and further insure safety to the test article. Cases such as premature engine shutdowns, pump cavitation, propellant leaks, and numerous problems inherent in cryogenic environments (i.e., with sensors and data) are costly and pose risk in social acceptance of current and future space-based programs. Other non-propulsion (complex) systems can certainly benefit from the core technologies proposed. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
For improving commercially based test systems and their operations, the proposed technology will help provide a deeper ability to monitor, process knowledge and system information, infer about the system states, and aid personnel in their critical decisions during all phases of test operations. Such information may entail system parameter adjustments, critical reconfiguration of the test article, or halting all operations for safety concerns.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This STTR Phase I project describes the development of a high-performance, robust, portable, and compact laser ultrasonic system for multi-purpose Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE). Laser ultrasonic has now become a valuable tool for on-line inspection, demonstrating its advantages in the steel and aerospace industries. Non-destructive laser ultrasonic inspection equipments use large size laser components.  They are not designed for light-weight, portable and power sensitive applications. Currently, NDE of space transportation vehicles is primarily carried out on the ground, between missions but for future space missions, more inspection will need to be performed in space in order to monitor the aging process of the structure and to insure its integrity.  For inspection during space flight, the NDE equipment must be compact, lightweight, easily operated by human with limited mobility or robot, and exhibits low power consumption. To satisfy these requirements we proposed to develop a laser ultrasonic inspection system integrating an amplitude-modulated continuous wave laser source for high efficiency generation and a multi-channel random-quadrature interferometer for robust and highly sensitive detection. The proposed system takes advantage of fiber technology for both the generation and the detection in order to achieve a compact, portable and versatile inspection system.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed system will be designed to satisfy the size, weight and power requirements for NDE systems to be embarked during space mission. The primarily target is the NDE during space flight, but it will also be applicable to on-the-ground NDE. Potential NASA applications covers a variety of NDE inspection needs, including the detection of subsurface inclusions and surface breaking cracks, the inspection of wiring and detection of cracks in the insulation, characterization of coating materials and bonding properties.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Potential non-NASA commercial applications include ground based aircraft and spacecraft inspection, the inspection and characterization of thin films and coatings, residual stress measurement, fatigue crack detection, and the inspection of metallic and composite plates.

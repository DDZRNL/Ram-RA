<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal describes the development of passive surface acoustic wave (SAW) based hydrogen sensors for NASA application to distributed wireless hydrogen leak detection systems.  Orthogonal Frequency Coded (OFC) SAW devices have been demonstrated as passive wireless temperature sensors in NASA Contract NNK04OA28C, and are being further developed under NNK05OB31C.  The proposed hydrogen sensors will use a novel OFC SAW device structure, combined with Palladium nanocluster film elements to produce fast, reversible, highly sensitive hydrogen sensors capable of detecting a wide range of hydrogen concentrations at room temperature.  The proposed research will utilize results from Argonne National Labs on the formation of Pd nanocluster films on self-assembled siloxane monolayers on glass.  These optimized nanocluster films demonstrated hydrogen sensing from 25 ppm to over 2% hydrogen, with response times of milliseconds, complete reversibility, and no baseline drift at room temperature.  The films experience large conductivity changes due to the hydrogen induced lattice expansion of the Pd nanoclusters and the quantum nature of conduction in nanocluster films.  The performance of the SAW device will change in response to a change in conductivity of this film.  Issues including SAM formation on piezoelectric substrates, nanocluster film deposition, and simulation of device performance will be evaluated.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary NASA application for the proposed sensors would be in a wireless multisensor system for hydrogen leak detection.  With uniquely identifiable sensors, such a system could use low cost sensors mounted at numerous locations to remotely detect hydrogen leaks in real time.  This system could continuously monitor "boot" air for leaks, and remotely alert personnel and/or trip alarms or initiate protective action if a leak is detected.  The extreme sensitivity of these films to low levels of hydrogen, and their ability to operate reversibly without baseline drift at room temperature, should provide an advanced warning capability for leaks.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary potential commercial applications for the proposed hydrogen sensor relate to fuel cell monitoring, and to hydrogen generation, delivery, and storage monitoring.  Given the emerging use of hydrogen as a fuel for automotive and fleet vehicles, there is a need for hydrogen sensors to monitor the safe handling of hydrogen.  Presently, it is not clear if wireless operation would necessarily be beneficial in a sensor for these applications.  However, the high sensitivity, fast response times, reversibility, wide range of hydrogen concentration sensed, low cost, and small size would make the proposed sensors applicable to these emerging market segments.

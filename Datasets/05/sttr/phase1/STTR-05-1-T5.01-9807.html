<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
While the protective qualities of activated carbon have been enhanced by the addition of specific metal salts, activated carbon technology has changed little over the last 60 years.  In this Phase I, Agave BioSystems and the Universities Space Research Association, propose to develop next generation smart adsorbents using novel carbon nanotube (CNT)-based structures for the adsorption and destruction of potentially toxic air contaminants.  Since CNTs have extremely high surface area, can be readily modified with metals or functional groups, and can function without the mass transfer limitations of traditional activated carbon, they are an ideal material for integration into spacecraft air handling systems.  Our goal is to build upon the unique structural and chemical nature of carbon nanotubes to generate a new generation of smart adsorbents.  The exceptionally high mass transfer properties of these in situ grown carbon nanotubes should reduce problems of current filters such as pore clogging or limited accessible material.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Low-gravity environments are particularly susceptible to dust nuisance and hazard.  In near 0-g, dust and particulate matter in general can float or become attached to nearly any accessible surface and can enter nearly any mechanical device or electronic module, potentially wreaking havoc.  In fact this is one of the main causes for false fire alarms aboard the international space station.  More recent reinvestigation of moon dust has shown that it consists of both micron and submicron (ultrafine) particles.  The ultrafine material is of particular concern as the health dangers represented by such material on Earth are well known, being regulated by the EPA's PM2.5 rule.  The super high surface area coupled with the reactive nature of the material then mandates its filtration from EVA related systems and generally from within spacecraft and space habitats.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Volatile organic compounds present one of the major environmental problems today.  Filters for airborne particulate matter are essential in many instances, including air purifiers, respiratory protection equipment and clean rooms.  In the manufacturing sector, semiconductor manufacturing requires ultra-high filtration.  Not surprisingly sub-micron sized particles are the most difficult to remove.  Within the consumer market, pollen from a variety of grasses, flowers and trees creates misery for millions across the US.  
<br>Applications for this technology include indoor filtration systems to remove VOCs from indoor air streams, personal protective gear for workers exposed to occupationally high levels of industrial chemicals, and equipment for military personnel, firefighters and other public health officials who may come into contact with toxic air contaminants while dealing with the aftermath of industrial spills and leaks.readily removed from a water processing system would have dramatic advantages over existing methods.

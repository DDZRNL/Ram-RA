<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
SSCI, in collaboration with Boeing Phantom Works, proposes to develop and test an efficient Integrated Damage Adaptive Control System (IDACS). The proposed system is based on the development of a coupled structural and aerodynamic model of aircraft dynamics under wing damage, and multiple-model damage estimator whose estimates are used in the reconfigurable control law to stabilize the aircraft and achieve acceptable performance of the closed-loop flight control system.  In order to achieve these objectives, we propose to carry out the following tasks in Phase I: (i) Develop an integrated structural and aerodynamic model of wing damage; (ii) Evaluate the feasibility of a multiple-model wing damage estimator; and (iii)  Test and evaluate the performance of the IDACS. Boeing Phantom Works (Mr. James M. Urnes, Sr.) will provide technical and commercialization support under the project. The main emphasis of the Phase II work will be on enhancements and integration of the proposed IDACS algortihms, and the development of the corresponding software tool.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Due to increasing terrorist threats, in the recent years there has been a lot of interest in the development of effective adaptive reconfigurable control systems that can compensate for the damage in commercial aircraft caused by  man-portable  air  defense systems  (ManPADS), and NASA added this aspect of the fault-tolerant control problem to the existing Aviation Safety program. The techniques developed under this project are also expected to contribute to technologies that will enable autonomous or semi-autonomous Space Exploration mission.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Potential non-NASA applications of the IDACS are in the area of commercial and military aircraft. Autonomous IDACS will find wide applications in other programs such as spacecraft control and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).

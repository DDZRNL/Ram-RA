<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Recent innovations in noncrystalline solar cells are beginning to emerge as viable replacements to traditional CVD grown single crystal counterparts in applications that demand high specific power, low product cost ($/sq.ft.) and ultimately scalable unit energy cost ($/W). Future NASA missions stand poised for adopting these new photovoltaics systems that are deposited onto lightweight, flexible substrates. Nanohmics proposes to fabricate a heterojunction solar cell composite consisting of high weight fraction titanium dioxide nanoparticles blended with amphiphilic, regioregular conducting polythiophene that are highly organized at an air-water interface. Furthermore, Nanohmics is proposing to prepare a novel device geometry that involves a low-cost, co-axial deposition process of all the cell layers onto core metal (e.g. copper, aluminum) or metal-coated fibers. Deposition of the blocking layers, heterojunction phase, and transparent conducting electrode in this fashion will lead to individual solar cell "threads", SuntwineTM.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The ability to create a large area conformal solar cell fabric that can passively scavenge supplemental solar energy bodes well for NASA space missions where opportunities for renewable energy are limited. A lightweight solar cell material that can be fabricated as large area solar collection device bodes well for minimizing the launch cost presently ~ $10,000/pound of lifted weight.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
With successful implementation of the proposed research effort, a new paradigm in passively scavenging radiant energy through integrated solar cell fabric materials will be enabled that could provide enough energy to power consumer electronic devices. First, a sizable market would exist for conscious consumers who could harness power from an apparel item. For example, textiles (e.g. a shirt or seat cover) woven from threads that are independent solar radiation energy scavengers could collectively generate enough power under the right environmental conditions to power/charge displays, handheld equipment such as PDA or cell phone batteries or other electronic devices during for example routine exercise or bicycling.  Similarly, the ability to passively scavenge solar radiant energy in for example a temporary shelter such as tents or canopies would enable complementary power supply to main power requirements that would otherwise not be utilized. Other envisioned devices would include automobile or marine screens and canopies.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA has numerous requirements for in-space repair capabilities to aid future missions beyond earth orbit.  A subset of these requirements is adhesive patch materials that provide permanent or temporary repair of a wide variety of surfaces with minimal surface preparation.  Prior work on light (UV and visible) curing composite matrix resins for rigidizing inflatable spacecraft shows that there is an opportunity to use similar technology for in-space repair kits.  Light curing provides a controlled, clean, low power rigidization technology to harden repair patches.  Rapid cure at low temperatures (-20?aC) has been demonstrated with these specialty resins.  They are also low outgassing, 100 percent solids materials with no hazardous ingredients.   Repair kits for light-curing tape can be tailored for a wide range of applications.  This concept for !?structural duct tape!? provides a means of producing glass fabric repair patches impregnated with safe, visible light-curing resins that cure rapidly with low power using hand held light emitting diode (LED) arrays or similar light sources.  The tape will be housed in a light and radiation resistant, easy to use dispenser.  A companion battery powered LED array will complete the kit.  Surface cleaning materials can also be included.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
These in-space repair kits will provide a means to repair a variety of materials under a wide range of conditions including in vacuum at low temperatures.  These epoxy-based composite patches will have good adhesion characteristics and may replace multiple repair technologies.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This novel repair technology is expected to find large consumer and industrial markets.  The convenience of forming structural repairs with a rapid, safe, low power system will find applications with professionals and do-it-yourselfers alike.

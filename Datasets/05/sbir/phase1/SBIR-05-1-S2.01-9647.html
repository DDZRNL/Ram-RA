<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
To address the NASA need for robotic platform-mounted instruments that can chemically analyze extraterrestrial surfaces, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new integrated standoff Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) and Raman Spectroscopic (LIBRA) system to perform rapid material analysis from a distance of >20 m.  Dual LIBS and Raman measurements ensure high specificity in chemical analysis.  While LIBS identifies trace elements, Raman spectroscopy enables the robotic rover to distinguish complex materials such as hydrous and anhydrous gypsum that indicate the presence of water on a planet.  This system features embedded chemical fingerprinting software for real-time analysis of material signatures, and has a software interface to NASA robotic platforms.  Through POC's compact excitation laser and high-resolution spectral detection subassemblies, LIBRA has unprecedented specificity of material identification in an energy efficient (<10 W), compact (<0.03 cubic meter volume), light (<2 kg) hermetically sealed package that is ruggedized (no moving parts) and optimized for robotic exploration.  In Phase I, POC will demonstrate LIBRA system feasibility by assembling and testing a proof-of-concept laboratory prototype, and investigate issues of space qualification.  In Phase II a fully functional prototype system will be developed and its standoff detection capability from robotic platforms will be demonstrated.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A combined LIBS and Raman spectroscopy platform in a compact and space deployable platform can be adapted to many extraterrestrial exploration efforts.  The proposed instrument contains no moving parts, and is designed to identify trace chemicals in air, soil, rock, or dust.  This makes it a universal instrument for rovers even on Mars and the icy moons of Jupiter.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A highly sensitive, portable, and accurate standoff detection system will be extremely useful for environmental monitoring of toxicants and for detecting contraband and lethal chemicals.  First responders and border security and customs personnel will benefit greatly from an accurate standoff chemical detection system that will enable them to determine the lethality of substances.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA is seeking means to increase surveillance efficiency during mission launch operations. Launch delays are expensive, so any incremental increase in efficiency of launch range surveillance should produce large cost savings. To meet this requirement, Broadata Communications, Inc. (BCI) proposes to develop a new combined hardware and software sensor package for early intrusion detection called Multi-Sensor Aerial Intrusion Identifier that will be suitable for mounting in small UAVs of 10 feet wing span or less.  The proposed intrusion detection system will be based on combining the output from three separate sensor systems: IR, Doppler Motion, and Stereo Video, to increase the reliability and sensor detection range compared to using any of these sensor systems on its own. The combined systems will have a 3-5 nautical mile forward detection range, compared to 1 nautical mile detection range for each individual sensor.  It will produce a reduction of at least a factor of 3 in the number of small UAVs needed for launch range surveillance, and consequently, a dramatic reduction in the cost of surveillance.  The UAVs will be equipped with warning sirens and warning lights to issue warnings to intruders, further automating launch range safety operations.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed technology will provide an intrusion detection system suitable for protecting a wide variety of NASA assets, including launch ranges, future space ports, DSN radio installations, and very large array astronomical radio observatories. A non-AUV version of the intrusion detection system could efficiently monitor the perimeters of any NASA facilities engaged in sensitive non-exportable research. The underlying sensor fusion technologies used in the proposed system could have a wide variety of NASA applications such as improved processing of hyperspectral imagery for environmental studies, and more reliable fusion of sensor readings on board space craft for diagnostic assessments.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed technology is generic and can be easily adapted to match the needs of many related government and commercial applications.  In addition to NASA's Range Surveillance applications, this technology also applies to applications where surveillance of large geographically diverse areas is required, including military base perimeter defense, energy pipeline protection, critical infrastructure protection, border patrol, mountain area search and rescue, and coast guard search and rescue.

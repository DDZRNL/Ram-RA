<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Photon-X has developed a proprietary EO spatial phase technology that can passively collect 3-D images in real-time using a single camera-based system. This technique provides the capability to sense and understand objects and features within a range of distances from low atmospheric altitudes to space. Feedback from the camera allows the Photon-X system to perform 3-D path planning and trajectory assessment for multiple objects of various sizes and shapes. Spatial phase technology provides scene date that is range independent and angle invariant allowing data of tumbling objects to be collected even in the presence of smoke, clouds, or haze. During Phase I, Photon-X plans to model 3D views of tumbling objects and develop preliminary feature extraction and predictive trajectory and range software tools. These tools will be used to demonstrate proof-of-concept for a single controlled scenario. This initial groundwork will be used in selecting the best design approach for Phase II to meet established system goals. A Phase II system will build on the concepts shown in the Phase I proof-of-concept demonstration. A Phase II system will collect image data and track an object in real-time with collected data stored and processed later for feature extraction and 3D modeling.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A real-time, passive, polarimetric 3-D imaging system will have numerous uses for NASA space exploration.  Multiple applications include advanced sensors to be used for robotic vehicle perception, terrain mapping or 3D path planning with intelligent trajectory assessment feedback for unmanned space operations. For situations too hostile for life, the system could be operated remotely to capture inaccessible 3D spatial video or snapshots for transmission to an outlying base location for viewing from a distance. A polarization and 3-D measurement system also has many uses in manufacturing and industrial activities undertaken by NASA (i.e. material characterization, reverse engineering, rapid prototyping, etc.). Applications of the underlying technology include 3-D tracking of human motion, 3-D facial recognition and ID, and spatial phase tagging applications for tracking known items in adverse environmental conditions such as smoke, clouds or haze.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A passive, high-resolution, quick, robust, and affordable 3D measurement system is highly desired in commercial industry.  The current commercial thrust of the Photon-X sensor is in the area of machine and robotic vision applications.  The camera-based 3D targeting system described has immediate potential, not only in remote sensing and autonomous reconnaissance, but in such diverse applications as machine and robotic vision, 3D facial verification/recognition for security purposes, imaging enhancement for fire-fighting, asset/part tracking for inventory/process control and optimization, and dynamic, real-time 3D object creation for the entertainment industry.  When applied to measurement, the system furthers its benefits into surveying, mechanical structure modeling, and equipment assembly/maintenance/manufacture (with non-contact inspection, reverse engineering, rapid prototyping, and digital documentation of "as-built" and legacy manufactured assemblies.) Photon-X is actively pursuing commercial and military applications in automated 3D Robotic and Machine Vision perception systems.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA is expending a significant amount of effort to develop large imaging telescope systems to explore the Evolution of the Universe (SEU).  Adaptive optics will play a large role in these efforts because of the need to produce high quality imaging with lightweight optical systems.  Adaptive optics allows the spacecraft designer to sacrifice traditional requirements with regard to weight and stiffness in order to make the spacecraft as light as possible.  However, the adaptive systems must be compact and lightweight also.  Normal AO systems utilize a series of discreet components to satisfy the correction requirements.  These would consist of tip/tilt mirror and deformable mirrors.  Xinetics has engaged in developing a series of integrated adaptive optical components that will improve the optical quality of traditional wavefront control systems while simultaneously reducing system volume, weight, and cost.  The proposed effort is the result of a strategic vision to develop small robust wavefront control systems designed to be employed in spaced based optical systems.  Xinetics proposes designing and building a 1024-ch integrated wavefront corrector using Photonex module technology and Xinetics cofired ceramic actuators.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This technology applied to systems such as Eclipse and TFP where compact lightweight optical systems with adaptive optics will be a necessity.  This also has far-reaching implications to other imaging platforms.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are currently many systems investigating the use of adaptive optics.  Many tactical and strategic applications such as Airborne Laser, MTHEL, and JHPSSL would greatly benefit from this technology.

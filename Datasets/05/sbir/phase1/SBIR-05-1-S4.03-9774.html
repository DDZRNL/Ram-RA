<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Future missions to investigate the structure and evolution of the universe require highly efficient, low-temperature cryocoolers for low-noise detector systems. We propose to develop a highly efficient low-cost regenerator for regenerative cryocoolers with cooling temperatures in the range of 15 K and below. The proposed regenerator uses an innovative non-rare-earth material to achieve a volumetric specific heat of about 0.65  to 0.31 J/cm3-K at temperatures of 15 to 4.2 K.  The large heat capacity will substantially reduce the thermal swing during periodic heat transfer and therefore improve the efficiency of low-temperature regenerative cryocoolers. The regenerator will be lightweight and easy to fabricate. In Phase I we will optimize the regenerator for a specific cooling application.  We will use the resulting design and model to show that a regenerative cryocooler can achieve a very high efficiency. In Phase II we will build a prototype regenerator, measure its key performance parameters, and integrate it with an existing cryocooler to demonstrate its high thermal effectiveness.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed regenerator can be used in cooling systems for space-borne science instrument operating at temperatures in the range of 10 K or below. Its superior thermal performance makes it especially suitable for the low-noise detector cooling systems for future observatory missions, such as the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF), Constellation-X (Con-X), and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The military applications for the proposed regenerator include cooling systems on space-based surveillance, missile detection, and missile tracking systems.  Scientific applications include cooling systems for communication satellites; superconducting instruments, digital filters, and magnets; MRIs; and SQUIDs.

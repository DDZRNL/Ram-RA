<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
There is a need for lightweight high-density (4000+ lines/mm) novel diffraction grating elements in modern telescopes to advance EUV and X-ray astrophysics.  Current grating technologies (ruling and holographic beam interference) do not provide optimal solution for all grating requirements.  In response to NASA request, we propose to apply state-of-the art DUV reduction photolithographic tools developed for modern semiconductor industry and LightSmyth's proven design expertise in the application of this technology to the development of grating devices with constant and varying line spacing (VLS).  The proposal will focus on four major areas:  
<br>(i) Development and demonstration of constant and VLS reflective diffraction grating elements for EUV and X-ray spectroscopy at glazing angle of incidence with straight lines. 
<br>(ii) Development and demonstration of VLS reflective diffraction grating elements for EUV and X-ray spectroscopy at glazing angle of incidence with curved lines to produce focusing diffraction grating elements on a plane substrate. 
<br>(iii) Design of in-plane and off-plane reflective diffraction grating elements for NASA's Constellation-X.  
<br>(iv) Design of VLS blazed near-normal incidence focusing diffraction grating elements on plane substrate for EUV imaging spectroscopy to replace diffraction grating on toroidal substrate for Goddard Space Flight Center's NEXUS project.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Simple straight-line VLS gratings fabricated by DUV photolithography may be of high value for existing NASA projects, such as in-plane diffraction gratings for Constellation-X. More complex, focusing diffraction elements fabricated using proposed approach may be used for EUV and X-ray spectroscopy in space astrophysics (X-ray astronomy, solar corona astrophysics). Specifically, conceptual grating element design for NASA projects (off-plane gratings for Constellation-X and NEXUS) will be proposed.  
<br>Grating elements for a lot of other on-going and future NASA projects may be addressed with the proposed technology as it matures, such as EUNIS (Extreme Ultraviolet Normal-Incidence Spectrometer) of GSFC, RAISE (Rapid Acquisition Imaging Spectrograph Experiment) of Southwest Research Institute and SUMI (Solar Ultraviolet Magnetograph Investigation) of Marshall Space Flight Center by replacing traditional holographically and mechanically ruled gratins with the proposed light-weight, robust and inexpensive computer-generated diffraction gratings produced by DUV reduction photolithography.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Non-NASA commercial application include diffraction grating elements for spectrographs used in synchrotron radiation instrumentation, high-laser harmonics and plasma diagnosis.

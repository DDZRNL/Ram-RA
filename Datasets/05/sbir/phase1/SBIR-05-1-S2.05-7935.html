<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This innovation is a low mass, low volume, gas based system that will acquire size selective powdered samples from the extreme ambient (such as Mars or Venus surface). Then it will transfer and deliver samples to the analytical instrument(s) that are situated in a controlled environment such as a robotic or lander platform where measurements can be made. This research will further develop a miniature sample acquisition, transfer and delivery system that will enhance NASA's capability of studying the origin, evolution and distribution of life in the planets.
<br>
<br>This system has a compact-robust construction and consumes very low power with no moving parts, which make this system very reliable for extreme environmental applications. It is a pneumatically operated system and has great potential for using in-situ resource (e.g. concentrated CO2 on Mars) for the operations.  
<br>
<br>Size selective precision sampling, low cross-contaminations, possibility of high temperature sterilization are many of the unique features of this system. Proper development of this innovation (in the course of Phase I, II and III) will be key for the astrobiological, resource allocations and geophysical investigations that are addressed in NASA's defined Mars and Venus science missions.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Direct applications of this system are readily related to the defined NASA landed science missions for solar system explorations including: Astrobiology Field Laboratory (AFL) '13 for Mars, New Frontiers "Venus In Situ Explorer" for Venus and other low cost missions such as Discovery Missions or Mars Scout missions. All these missions will carry in situ instruments and will require varieties of powdered surface or sub-surface samples for analysis. 
<br>
<br>This can also be a potential sample acquisition and containment system for future Mars Sample Return Missions. Many other potential NASA use of this innovation will emerge as it matures and publicizes.
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Many commercial analytical instruments such as Powder XRD, GCMS, LCMS and ToFSIMS can be integrated with this system for process monitoring (pharmaceutical, cement, mining, biotech etc.) in a controlled environment. This can also be a complete tool for size selective field collections and assisting online or isolated offline investigations of bioaerosols, hazardous, unstable, suspicious materials (national security screening and terrorist threat assessment), geological materials, drugs and other particulate matters. The sample handling system that we propose is easily cleanable and can transfer multiple powder samples with minimal cross contamination. Analytical investigations of toxic or unknown material that is thought to be a threat can be facilitated with this system.

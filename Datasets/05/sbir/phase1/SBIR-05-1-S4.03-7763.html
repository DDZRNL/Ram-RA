<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The key element in producing an efficient low temperture cryocooler is the performance of the regenerator. It must have good heat transfer characteristics while providing low pressure drop, especially for compact high speed coolers. The axial thermal conductivity must be low to reduce losses but provide good radial conductivity for flow uniformity and maximum use of all material. At low termperatures, the heat capacity of the regenerator material must be high to achieve these low temperatures. The geometry of the regenerator material will be investigated to meet the requirements and minimize losses while providing the necrssary characteristics for efficient cryocooler performance. Altermative fabricaiton methods and materials, including rare earths will also be investigated to take advantage of the improved low temperature material properties.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The potential NASA applications include all regenerative cryocoolers used for cooling sensors and detectors that are required to operate at tempertures in the range of 35K to 15K and 4K. It is expected that lightweight stirling and pulse tube coolers will have an increased coefficient of performance (COP) resulting in lighter weight and smaller size.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The non-NASA commercial applications are a more efficient recondenser for MRI magnets, cooling of sensors for military use and cooling electronics for high speed computer controls and power devices. This regeneror technology would also apply to the thousands of cryocoolers used in vacuum systems in electronic chip manufacturing industry by providing an oil free vacuum more efficiently.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The goal of NASA's Quiet Aircraft Technology project is to reduce perceived aircraft noise by half in 10 years and by 75 percent in 25 years, using 1997 levels as the baseline. These reductions are necessary to meet the expected demand for air travel and increasingly stringent noise standards around the world. A significant portion of noise reduction will be achieved through lighter aircraft as a result of advances in composite materials, such as nanocomposites.  Vibrations are undesirable for structures, due to the need for structural stability and dynamic response, position control, and durability.  Vibration and acoustic reduction can be obtained in structural materials by increasing the damping capacity (expressed by the loss factor) and/or decreasing the stiffness (expressed by the storage modulus).  It is proposed to investigate carbon nanofiber composites for their expected acoustic damping properties by adjusting fiber volume fraction and length to appropriately tailor acoustic damping responses for this material.  Nanocomposites based on carbon nanofibers have high potential for advances in material performance (weight specific strength and stiffness, vibration damping, flammability reduction, and electrical conductivity) as well as manufacturing simplification and cost reduction.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This innovation is applicable to any metal or polymer-based aircraft or aerospace structures which are subjected to vibration / noise.  This innovation will enable the substitution of nano-enhanced polymers, with increased stiffness and superior damping properties, to be substituted for metal components which tend to have inferior acoustic damping properties. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Beyond the aircraft and aerospace applications, this innovation would increase the substitution of polymer components vs. metal components to reduce vibration and noise in automobiles, and other transportation vehicles, as well as machinery, sporting goods, anti-sonar submarines, and loudspeaker diaphragms.

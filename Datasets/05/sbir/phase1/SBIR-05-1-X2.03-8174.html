<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Pollution of the environment is a world wide concern and is the subject of broadly based R&D into means of prevention and remediation.  The innovation proposed here is the design of and electron beam source for clensing air.Bombardment by electrons has proven to be effective in destroying a wide spectrum of chemical and biological pollutants.  Maintaining air purity becomes particularly critical in densely populated closed spaces. Such as occupied buildings, passenger transport vehicles, orbiting space vehicles and lunar or planetary exploration stations. The work proposed here is to appraise the feasibility of down sizing this effective technology to meet the much more restrictive cost, weight and reliability requirements attendant to commercial passenger transportation and manned space exploration. Key to meeting those requirements are carbon nanotube (CNT) field emitters to replace the thermal electron sources as was done, by MPT, in developing the cold cathode x-ray tubes subsequently produced by Oxford X-ray Technology. MPT, working with Valence Corporation and others, have developed systems for eliminating odors and chemical components from air streams exhausted from sewerage treatment, large scale painting and food processing plants and environmental remediation installations.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This phase I proposal involves the design of large-array CNT cold cathodes for an electron beam source suitable for use air conditioning systems for confined populated spaces. This technology has been demonstrated to be effective for destroying a broad spectrum of chemical and biological agents on a large scale.  The key to applying e-beam technology to small scale applications is reduced weight and cost made possible by the use of CNT field emitters. Large numbers of such systems will be used for the reduction of emissions from small industrial and commercial applications. They will be particularly efficient for maintaining air purity in densely populated closed spaces, such as occupied buildings, passenger transport vehicles, orbiting space vehicles and lunar or planetary exploration stations. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This work will allow us to develop large arrays of more intense, narrow electron beams as are required for such applications as x-ray diffraction and development of other vacuum electron devices. MPT is currently working on designs for electron beam tubes for industrial applications. The current tubes utilize thermionic cathodes but focused beams from cold cathodes would greatly improve both performance and efficiency. Uses include the purification of air, elimination of odors, non-burning destruction of evaporated hydrocarbons from fuel tanks and painting operations, cleaning of flue gasses and enhancing chemical reactions such as increasing the ignition of fuels, drying ink on high speed presses and sterilization of surfaces. They have the potential of reducing the build up of green house gasses and cleaning up the atmosphere on earth.

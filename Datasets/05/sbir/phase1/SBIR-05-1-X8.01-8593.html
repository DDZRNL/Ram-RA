<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This SBIR Phase I project will develop the Spacecraft Power Monitor (SPM) which will use non-intrusive electrical monitoring (NEMO).  NEMO transforms the power distribution network in an spacecraft into a multiple-use service, providing not only power distribution but also a diagnostic monitoring capability based on careful measurement and analysis of power usage and start up and shut down transients.   In depth analysis of this data enables real time assessment of system and component functioning and identifies potential system and component faults and failutes.  We will use NEMO's ability to track load operation to verify that the systems and components of a spacecraft are operating properly   This "spacecraft power monitor" or SPM, based on  NEMO, will notify astronauts or ground support personnel when unexpected sequences occur.  It can also generally track the health and diagnostic condition of key loads on the system.  The system is light weight, small and inexpensive because the system requires only a sensor at the mains power input and uses existing power wiring to carry data.  Phase I will involve ground measurements of spacecraft components.   Phase II will involve measurements and analysis of an integrated system.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Applications for the Spacecraft Power monitor will include spacecraft for the Mars project plus other near earth spacecraft.  NEMO promises also to provide monitoring and support for crew members in commercial, general and military aviation.  During Phase I,  specific initial system(s) for commercial application will be identified and SPM for an integrated spacecraft will be developed and built during Phase II.   NEMO technology can also be applied to electronic health system monitoring on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and on ground test and support systems.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Nonintrusive electrical monitoring (NEMO) is also applicable to wheeled vehicles including autos,  trucks and military vehicles and to ships and hovercraft.   It also can be used for energy monitoring and conservation in buildings and other industrial facilities.

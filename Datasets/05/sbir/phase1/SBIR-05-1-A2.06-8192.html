<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The objective of this Phase I project is to demonstrate an automated on-line structural health monitoring system for aircraft structures using a combination of wireless data acquisition and fault detection filter via a sensing network for vehicle-embedded large arrays of MEMS sensors and actuators. A fault detection filter, whose functions are to identify and localize the damage, is considered as a new concept in the field of structural health monitoring. Sensor validation is implemented in the distributed sensor network to ensure only validated data are sent to the central station for further system utilization. Wireless communication provides a safe, affordable, and more efficient method for the online health monitoring of vehicle subsystems and information monitoring.  It also involves signal processing to support decision-making related to safety, maintenance, or operating procedures.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In addition to the potential applications for on line monitoring of spacecraft, it can be applied to remote sensing platforms and distributed monitoring environments, such as, a robotic systems, long-endurance sensing platforms (LESPs), unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) and ground engine tests.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed component can be applied in many fields for real-time data sampling and processing. Applications can support general manufacturing, the commercial aviation industry and real time monitoring sensors environment.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Timely processing of raw Earth science data for calibration and validation in a highly distributed and networked environment, and its storage at Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) for presentation to the global scientific community is critical in NASA's mission for Earth Sciences. Here we propose to develop a stream processing engine approach to earth science data processing. Our innovation is based leveraging the emerging stream processing engine technology. Traditionally stream processing applications have been built using customized DBMS., which tend to be costly, and hard to change by non-specialist end-users. Our proposed architecture offers several significant benefits. First, an SPE developed application enables the refinement of stream filtering, the rapid development of new stream filtering capability faster than any other database or middleware based solution using StreamSQL , thus improving the maintainability and adaptivity of the system especially by non-specialist end-users. Second, by design, SPE technology offers inherent fault tolerance against asynchronous data input with attendant drop-outs.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
While we anticipate our proposed application innovation be widely relevant across NASA's missions, operating units, and technology interests, our plan in Phase I will be to focus on those applications that are directly relevant to our Phase I work. Our proposed innovation can serve the NASA Terra SDP Toolkit initiative, Raytheon ECS (EOSDIS Core System) Maintenance and Development Project, and Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAAC) computing facilities. In general, our application will enable the faster design, development and modification of Level 1 through 3 algorithms used in direct broadcast of NASA earth Science data. Ultimately, our application has the potential to be used by consumers of EOS products to access and manipulate data structures. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Our innovation can serve several DoD applications.  As a 'system of systems' the Army Battle Command System (ABCS) presents numerous opportunities to exploit synergies between  SPE and spatiotemporal in a range of applications, with emphasis on Situation Awareness.  At Air Force Research Labs we will explore opportunities in security event detection, incident response, and information filtering.  NGA is also a priority target for information filtering, and the Navy and Coast Guard have a number of surveillance monitoring programs that will be targeted. In the civilian sector, NOAA, DOI, EPA, DOT, and DHS all have wide range of programs that intersect our geospatial and SPE technologies.

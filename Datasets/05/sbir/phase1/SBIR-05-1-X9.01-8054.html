<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In this phase I program MicroCell Technologies, LLC (MCT) proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of an electrochemically modulated phase separator for in situ processing and refining in future space missions.  Two-phase (liquid and gas) flow can be a vital part of many life support and or thermal management systems which will be supported using in situ resources on spacecraft and on future habitations on the Moon and Mars. In this phase I program, we propose to demonstrate the use of an  innovative electrochemically modulated gas/liquid separation system for use in 0-g conditions. In phase I, we propose to develop a supported ionic liquid membrane electrode assembly and demonstrate the separation of CO2 from water. The phase II program will optimize this system, as well as adapt this technnology to selectively separate other gases of interest for ISRU applications such as nitrogen and oxygen in a two-phase flow. In phase II we will also develop innovative reactor designs to minimize size and weight for space applications.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The development of an electrochemically modulated gas/liquid separator has significant commercial potential for NASA.  We propose in phase I to demonstrate the feasibility of  separating two-phase flow through the development of a supported ionic liquid membrane electrode assembly. The goal of this research in phase I and phase II is to provide an efficient means to incorporate the advantages of ionic liquids into an electrochemical device. The resultant MEA can be easily incorporated into conventional electrochemical cells, membrane separation device, or innovative designs. We foresee that this technology  has the capability to become a platform from which  many separation schemes can be achieved. This directly addresses NASA's need for downstream processing of product streams resulting from different ISRU technologies.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This technology has significant commercial application in  sequestering atmospheric C02 for conversion to methanol via fixation. Thus this technology is important to the commercial production of renewable fuels which is becoming increasingly important to the Nation

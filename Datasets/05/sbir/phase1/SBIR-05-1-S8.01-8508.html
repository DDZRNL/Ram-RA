<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA science and exploration missions will continue to require observation and sensing platforms with enhanced guidance, navigation and control (GN&C) subsystems.  In fact, GN&C technology improvements have the potential to enable new and revolutionary missions that will accelerate the exploration and scientific understanding of the solar system.  Since, attitude determination and inertial rate measurement systems are a significant fraction of the spacecraft or platform resources there are opportunities to exploit recent technology advances in imaging and computing to produce an inertial measurement system (IMS) that has lower mass and power.  A novel approach for high speed estimation of spacecraft attitude and rates from celestial observations has been conceived that could revolutionize the performance of platforms in many challenging environments including highly elliptical Earth orbits, libration point orbits, and lunar and planetary orbits.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The significant performance enhancements that will be enabled by development of the SpeedStar concept can be applied to many NASA missions.  Any three-axis stabilized spacecraft can benefit from the mass, power, and performance advantages of a stellar gyroscope.  Of particular interest are exploration and science missions that have observation platforms that required precise pointing.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are many Non-NASA commercial applications of the stellar gyroscope.  The commercial satellite communications industry and the growing demand for satellite imagery on-demand will create the need for enhanced spacecraft inertial measurements systems.  The SpeedStar concept will also have applications to responsive spacecraft for the military.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Many are pursuing the development of electric propulsion systems for large aircraft due to the potential of being cleaner, quieter, lighter, and more versatile than current platforms and because the use of liquid hydrogen (LH2) fuel in these systems decreases our dependence on petroleum.  It is desirable to have very light components, such as the stator, for these electric propulsion systems.  Superconducting stator coils can be lighter weight than cryogenically cooled copper stator coils.  The recent development of magnesium diboride (MgB2) superconducting wires makes possible the potential to have much lighter weight superconducting stator coils than with any other metal or ceramic superconductor.  The MgB2 superconductor, cooled in the available liquid hydrogen fuel, is the ideal candidate wire material for stator coils for large aircraft motors.   The lighter weight coils, especially in the stator, will enable a lighter weight motor.  During the Phase I we will demonstrate using this magnesium diboride superconductor wire in diamond wound stator coil form.  This will show feasibility of fabricating full size diamond patterned stator coils in a Phase II effort.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Besides large aircraft motors, magnesium diboride superconductors can benefit NASA applications for superconducting ADR coils, transformers, inductors, magnetic bearings, actuators, MHD magnets, and other potential power conditioning applications.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercialization of magnesium diboride superconducting wires will allow less expensive and more open MRI systems for medical use, and lower cost and more efficient power utility applications such as transformers, motors, generators, fault current limiters, and SMES.

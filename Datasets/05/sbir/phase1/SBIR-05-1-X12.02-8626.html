<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Wireless optical communication systems have gone through considerable development in the past few years, as optical components have experiences important technologic advances and price decreases. Thus data communications are increasingly using wireless optical systems at higher speeds. These systems are being used as an alternative to cabled media, mainly due to their simpler deployment and reconfiguration. The high data rate and large information throughput available with laser communication are many times greater than in RF systems, furthermore WDM technology can also be used in free space laser communication system. To provide optical wireless communication between crew and the base of NASA advanced extravehicular activity (EVA) systems, Boston Applied Technologies Incorporated (BATI) proposes an innovative laser communication system based on our recent breakthrough of high performance light intensity and polarization management devices. The laser communication devices developed at BATI have the advantage of significantly reduced size and complexity, small power consumption, high extinction ratio, and solid-state ruggedness. Rather than using two laser transmitters, the proposed laser communication system can establish a two-way optical link using a single conventional laser transmitter.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The goal of this program is to develop an advanced laser communication system using electro-optic light modulation for optical wireless communication between crew and the base with the capability to integrate audio, video, and data on the same data stream. This system has many critical advantages in term of weight, power, platform stability and the number of laser source. This proposed system can also provide a communication link between an earth observing balloon or airplane and the ground.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A similar system can provide a communication link between a satellite and the ground. The success of this program will have great impacts in military, space, industrial, and consumer sectors. The proposed system may provide a viable approach for the "the last mile" application.

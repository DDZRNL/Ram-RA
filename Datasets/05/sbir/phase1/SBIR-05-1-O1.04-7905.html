<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Flexible electronic circuits can be easily integrated with large area (>10m aperture), inflatable antennas to provide distributed control and processing functions. Flexible electronic circuits can also perform dynamic antenna sub-arraying and gain pattern reconfiguration for active phased-array antenna (PAA) and thus significantly enhance the reliability of NASA's space radar systems. However, existing flexible electronics are based on organic semiconductor materials that have carrier mobility four orders of magnitude lower than conventional single crystal silicon. Such low carrier mobility limits the operating speed of flexible electronics to a few kilohertz and thus makes it unsuitable for multi-GHz RF antenna applications. The proposed research aims to develop a printable silicon nano-FET with high carrier mobility of over 400 cm2/V?s. Such a high carrier mobility provides an unprecedented opportunity to achieve flexible electronics with high operating frequency of over 40GHz. The high-speed flexible electronics are expected to be integrated large-area, inflatable radar antennas and achieve smart antenna systems for high performance and reliable space operations. In this SBIR phase I program, a preliminary printable silicon nano-FET will be developed and characterized for proof-of-concept verification. The feasibility of building high-speed flexible electronics and its monolithic integration with large-area inflatable antennas will also be demonstrated.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed printable silicon FET provide a promising approach to achieve high-speed flexible electronics that can be monolithically integrated on NASA's large aperture, deployable antennas. The integrated high-speed (> 40GHz) electronics offer enhanced control, signal processing and reconfiguration functionalities for numerous radar bands, such as L- band, X- band, S- band, Ku- band and Ka-band. It also provides an enabling technology for the development of smart antennas with self-orienting, reconfiguration and fault-element adapting capabilities.   <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The printable silicon nano-FET offers an enabling technology for large-area flexible electronics with high operating speed and built-in control capability. It offers an attractive technology for many high-speed, low-cost electronics applications, particularly those that require or may benefit from flexible polymeric substrates such as RF identification tags, smart cards, electronic paper, and large area flat panel displays.

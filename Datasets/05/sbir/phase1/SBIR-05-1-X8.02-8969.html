<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Composite Technology Development, Inc. (CTD) proposes to address NASA needs for high power, active thermal control, and high bandwidth communications capabilities by expanding a current rollout, passively deployed array technology into a modular, deployable support structure that is scalable and adaptable in size, and can be used to deploy and support many different types of functional systems.  Work in Phase 1 will demonstrate the feasibility of expanding the current approach to a broad range of functions, focusing on adapting and tailoring the concept to meet the specific needs of NASA's adaptable and reconfigurable intelligent modular systems.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed technology will have application to a broad range of system for increased and improved infrastructure for terrestrial applications, and on orbit, in space and on planetary surfaces, through an adaptable, modular, and intelligent deployable structure. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercial spacecraft and satellites, as well as aircraft and terrestrial structures, could benefit from the technologies proposed herein.

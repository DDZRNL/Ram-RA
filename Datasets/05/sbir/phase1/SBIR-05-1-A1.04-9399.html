<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Metis Design Corporation (MDC) proposes the development of a strain-based power replenishment technology to harvest energy for recharging remote sensors.  MDC has been working to development of a structural health monitoring (SHM) device, which essentially evolves the embedding of sets of sensors into a structure to allow continuous remote monitoring.  MDC's work is aimed at developing a robust infrastructure package to support a variety of sensor types and detection methods for aerospace structures.  Components have been developed to acquire data, excite transducers, store and wirelessly transmit data, as well as a thin-film battery and packaging to protect the electronics from moisture, EMI and impact.  During the course of this SBIR, MDC will work to develop a power replenishment patch that uses piezoelectric technology coupled with an innovative circuit design to "top-off" SHM system batteries.  These thin patches would be intimately bonded to the structure in order to harvest strain energy to recharge a thin-film Lithium battery slowly over time.  This concept is unique since it takes advantage of the low duty cycle of SHM electronics, instead of attempting to harvest energy for continuous system operation.  MDC will demonstrate the ability to performing structural integrity testing using only harvested power.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are four basic areas of applicability to NASA.  The first is long duration spacecraft, such as satellites and space exploration vehicles, which need cheap and light monitoring to confirm damage that occurs during launch or deployment.  Another important area is expendable launch vehicles to facilitate launch/no-launch decisions, due to damage sustained during vehicle assembly or pre-launch.  Of probably greatest importance, SHM systems will be a key technology for reusable launch vehicle for quick turn around times.  Lastly, SHM systems would also be useful for the space station to help guide wear and maintenance, especially near docking regions.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Structural integrity monitoring has the potential for economic benefits in a broad range of markets.  These systems can be utilized by structures from military or civil aircraft, to cars, ships or civil infrastructure.  The first major benefit is that integrity monitoring eliminates the need for scheduled inspections.  A second major economic benefit is that a continuously monitoring system would allow for the use of the much more efficient condition based maintenance (CBM) design methodology of a structure, otherwise known as need-based repair.  A third benefit would be from increased service time of the structure.  Finally, an SHM system could have a significant financial impact if it is able to detect the need for maintenance before a catastrophic failure, potentially saving lives and a costly vehicle.

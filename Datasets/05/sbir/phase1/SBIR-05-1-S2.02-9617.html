<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA's program for Solar System Exploration will augment the current remote sensing approach to solar system exploration with a robust program that includes in situ measurements at key places. This requires robotic explorers capable of operation and survivability in high-temperature/high-pressure environment to service the needs of the future in situ exploration of Venus as well as atmospheric probes for giant planets. This program will design a Venus probe thermal management system capable of sustaining operation for 20 hours or more. To support the design, new thermal management technologies will be evaluated and considered for use the harsh Venusian environment.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary applications for this high temperature and high pressure probe design technology are limited to NASA probes being sent to Venus or deep atmospheric probes to giant planets. Project Prometheus is seeking radiators capable of operating at 1000 K and may face similar needs for lightweight insulating systems.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
While the system may have limited application, the components included within the program have great relevance here on earth. The use of lightweight moderate and low temperature insulation may find use in defense and commercial flight vehicles. The use of a lightweight, recycling, thin cooling layer may find use in automotive and electronic applications, and the use of phase change materials in power electronics cooling is already being studied. Low mass vacuum vessels may be useful as Dewars for liquid gas storage and chambers for chemical processing.

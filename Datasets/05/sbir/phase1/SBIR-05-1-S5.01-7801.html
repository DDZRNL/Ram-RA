<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The individual software tools that make up the analytical capabilities for the design of entry vehicles using an aero-assist/aero-capture device have been fully developed. In fact the performance of such software against the flight data has been superb, and NASA has used the results to make real-time decisions on the entry vehicles. However, the couplings among such software for estimation of weight and performance has not been developed. In part, the couplings of areas such as the fluid-structure interaction and trajectory still remain undeveloped. Lack of coupling of such software for space application has been the result of the types of structures that have been flown to date, i.e. the entry vehicles have exhibited relatively large stiffness and the TPS has been an integral part of the vehicles. However, when inflatable decelerators are becoming an essential part of the future interplanetary missions, the influence of inflation or structural displacements of an inflatable decelerator on lift and drag should be considered. Furthermore, development of a computational environment that hosts a combination of important disciplines to provide answers in a timely manner should be given a priority. A successful coupling of such software is the essential ingredient for engineering of inflatable decelerators.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The system analysis and integration groups across NASA will be able to use the software developed under this proposal to more accurately estimate the weight and performance of entry vehicles during Phase A of a project.  The initial and accurate weight and performance results will enable NASA to setup the design requirements for entry vehicles. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The aerospace companies will be able to either use or extend the capability of the software developed under this proposal to more rapidly and accurately analyze the entry vehicles and setup the design and operation specifications during Phases B and C/D of a project.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
High temperature power electronics have become a vital aspect of future designs for power converters in spacecraft, battle zone electric power, satellite power conditioning, and well drilling. The performance of these applications would benefit significantly from materials designed for high temperatures and harsh environmental conditions. NASA's Venus mission has some of the most stringent requirements with an operating temperature of 486C. Power systems must operate efficiently at these temperatures to eliminate the need for onboard cooling systems. The removal of these cooling systems will save space, reduce weight, and improve reliability. Currently, BaTiO3-based X7R capacitors are re-rated for use above 125C, and are rendered inoperable at temperatures approaching 300C. NPO-type dielectrics tend to operate at somewhat higher temperatures, but have low dielectric constants and become unreliable above 400C. TRS Technologies is pleased to respond to NASA's need for high temperature capacitors with this Phase I SBIR proposal. In this SBIR program, TRS Technologies and its subsidiary, Centre Capacitor, will develop a new family of high temperature capacitors based on high Curie temperature ferroelectrics that operate at temperatures far beyond conventional dielectric formulations. These new higher temperature (~490C) materials will be suited for the advanced power electronics required for Venus exploration.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary NASA application for these high temperature capacitors is in planetary exploration. The capacitors will be specifially designed to withstand the harsh temperature and pressure conditions that Venus probes and rovers are expected to encounter. The technology developed will also be adaptable to other space and Earth science missions requiring high temperature operation.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In addition to NASA applications, high temperature capacitors are expected to find use in electric vehicle inverters, oil well drilling, satellite power conditioning, jet engine electronics and avionics, and military and industrial distributed power conversion systems. The particular capacitors developed in this program will be fairly specific to NASA's planetary exploration needs; however, the technology and IP developed will be immediately applicable to these other markets.

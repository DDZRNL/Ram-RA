<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This project aims to provide Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools for radiation-tolerant, wide-temperature-range digital, analog, mixed-signal, and radio-frequency electronic components suitable for operation in the extreme environments of the Moon, Mars, and other deep space destinations.  All such exploration systems will need reliable electronics able to operate in a wide temperature range (-230?C to +130 ?C) and high radiation levels. There is very little knowledge of semiconductor device behavior in extreme low temperatures (currently ongoing research) and no reliable models or design tools. CFDRC will develop first commercial-quality validated models and CAD tools for predicting the electrical performance and reliability of electronic components in extreme low temperatures, with included radiation effects and reliability analysis, using coupled semiconductor and thermal-mechanical simulation. This work will use and implement the newest data from the ongoing NASA Exploration Systems and Research Technology (Code ES&RT) program, led by Prof. Cressler at Georgia Tech (subcontractor in this proposal), involving JPL, BAE, Boeing, Vanderbilt, and others, aimed at developing electronics technology for mixed-signal circuit applications for lunar (to -230?C) applications. Reliable and validated CAD tools will help to predict electronics performance and radiation response in the extreme temperatures, and reduce the amount of testing cost and time.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Improvements in electronic components and systems reliability and radiation hardness are required to enable NASA future exploration missions. The proposed Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools will support development and design of radiation-tolerant, wide-temperature-range digital, analog, low power, mixed signal, and RF electronic components, and integrated modules suitable for operation in the extreme environments of the Moon, Mars, and other deep space destinations, in particular, in extreme low-temperatures. The new CAD tools for predicting the electrical performance and reliability for low-temperature electronic systems and components will help NASA to:
<br>?	better understand and predict behavior of electronic devices and systems in deep space environments;
<br>?	assess and select new electronic technologies, devices, and materials for extreme low temperatures;
<br>?	better evaluate the extreme-temperature performance and radiation response at early design stage; 
<br>?	set requirements for hardening and testing;  reduce the amount of testing cost and time.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Potential users include other space electronics suppliers, in particular for DoD space communication and surveillance systems as well as commercial satellites. There is also an interest in cryogenic electronics for high-sensitivity, low-noise analog and mixed-signal applications, like metrology, sensors (radiation, optical, X-ray), radiometrology, radio and optical astronomy, infrared and photon detectors, and other high-end equipment.

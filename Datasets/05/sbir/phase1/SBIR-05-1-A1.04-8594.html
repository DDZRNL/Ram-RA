<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Phase I research proposal is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of an innovative architecture comprising control augmentation and on-line health monitoring system. This architecture integrats Flush Air Data System (FADS) with Reconfigurable Generalized Predictive Control (RGPC) technologies.  The Phase 1 effort includes identification and description of all supporting modules, their functionality and associated algorithm structures, connectivity, and final simulations using a specific aircraft for system performance evaluations.  Proof-of-concept study will include demonstrating the capability using selected aircraft health degradation and/or failure situations.  The concept innovation is derived from the prognostic nature of the system feedback used by the controller for applying corrective aircraft control.  In traditional controllers the errant transients possessing loss of control potential are detected after the fact and corrective actions for recovery are commanded by controller posteriori. The proposed system performs a real-time autonomous monitoring of aircraft surface pressure fields that contain precursor information for prediction of incipient errant transient motions.  The proposed system will enable reconfiguration of control based on measured pressure field anomalies that indicate standard control system equipment malfunctions.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
If the proposed research goals are achieved NASA will be benefited in following different areas:
<br>
<br>1.  Overall aircraft safety - Due to predictive nature of FADS and RGPC control system several failure and/or malfunction scenarios can be avoided. Also, in the event they are not avoidable, the proposed system will detect the problem sooner and exploit its reconfiguration capability to recover from the failure efficiently.  
<br> 
<br>2.  On-Board Health Monitoring - The FADS system coupled with RGPC provide wealth of information that can be used to monitor the health of the aircraft. 
<br> 
<br>3.  Improved Pilot Information System - The incipient perturbations/ anomalies can be made known to the pilot instantaneously with cockpit display.
<br>
<br>4.  Enhanced Attitude Determination and Control and Enhanced Guidance, Navigation, and Control - Direct consequence of predictive nature of the system.  
<br>
<br>BROADER IMPACT:  The proposed system can also be adopted in spacecraft avionics.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The civil aviation, general aviation, and recreational aviation industries will have largest impact of the proposed technology. The primary benefit these industries will receive is the ENHANCED SAFETY of the aircraft and its occupants. Several of the accidents that occured in the last decade due to malfunction and/or failure and pilot errors could be avoided with the proposed system. The passenger safety coupled with aircraft safety can translate to billions of dollars for civil aviation industry.

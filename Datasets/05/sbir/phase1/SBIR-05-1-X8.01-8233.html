<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Acellent Technologies proposes to develop an autonomous and automated diagnostic system for condition based maintenance (CBM) of safety critical structures for space exploration vehicles. The proposed system will provide real-time information on the integrity of critical structures on launch vehicles, improve their performance, and greatly increase crew safety while decreasing inspection costs. The system will encompass a gamut of functions from sensing hardware through diagnosis and prognosis all the way to presentation of the asset condition with recommended maintenance actions. Additionally the system will be developed for qualification and reliable use with space vehicles from the time of manufacture through launch. The biggest payoff of IVHM is development of system determining health prior to vehicle operation. Technologies will be developed to reliably instrument and monitor damage in critical structures such as rocket motors. The system development will be based on Acellent's SMART Layer technology that utilizes a network of sensors and actuators to query and monitor the integrity of a structure. In Phase I, a prototype CBM system for rocket motors will be developed and preliminary qualification tests conducted in collaboration with ATK-Thiokol. Phase II will focus on complete system development and interface with the rocket motor IVHM system.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
System self-assessment support platform technologies for self-assembly, in-space assembly, in-space maintenance & servicing, and high energy space platforms such as highly reliable autonomous deep-space cryogenic propellant refueling systems. These technologies/methodologies have the potential of significantly increasing safety, reliability, affordability, and effectiveness of NASA missions.
<br>
<br>Recent structural failures, such as those associated with the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia and damage due to foam impact on Discovery, have reiterated the requirement for onboard systems that provide comprehensive, reliable, real-time integrated assessment of systems health including as a subset SHM. This requirement is especially true for long-term space deployments in which structural integrity and systems' reliability is essential due to decreased opportunities for remedial action, mission abort, or crew rescue. The proposed system developed in the Phase I and Phase II effort can ensure safety and reliability of these mission critical structures. 
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Since nearly all in-service structures require some form of inspection and maintenance procedures to monitor their integrity and health condition to prolong life span or to prevent catastrophic failures, the potential applications of the proposed system are very broad. In the future, this system can potentially be used to monitor all types of aircraft, spacecraft and civil infrastructures.

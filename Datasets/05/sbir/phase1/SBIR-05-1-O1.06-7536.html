<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This project addresses the need for a framework and domain architecture suitable for reconfigurable transceivers and associated component technologies. The goal of this effort is to provide flexible, reconfigurable communications capability while minimizing on-board resources and cost.  WW Technology Group's (WWTG) approach provides a formalized structure for: (1) the design and implementation of reconfigurable computing (RC) using FPGAs for high performance parallel processing and (2) algorithm updates over the life cycle of the platform.  In addition, this RC-Enabled approach can replace manual, ad-hoc development methods and support Runtime Reconfiguration (RTR) activities that allow the dynamic modification of the functional configuration of the RC hardware and adaptive computing.   Specifically, WWTG's approach offers reconfigurable software and firmware that provides access control, and reconfiguration process including partial reconfiguration.
<br>
<br>The WW Technology Group (WWTG) presents a novel approach for reconfigurable, reprogrammable communication systems that provide high performance within the constraints of power consumption, reliability, size, and weight.  By combining the system on a chip (SoC) technologies in a distributed platform supported by a flexible software infrastructure, our system strikes the optimal balance between size, power consumption, and functionality.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
WWTG foresees a variety of NASA Applications that can benefit from this activity.    Specific projects include Constellation X, GMSEC Testbed, Leonardo, and Stellar Imager.  Our review of these projects confirms common aspects of technology for autonomous formation and reconfiguration, fault tolerance and reliable operation, flexibility and scalability of architecture configurations, and support for dynamic assessment of resources and schedulability mechanisms.  Overall, these technology objectives fit into NASA's Goal 3 of the Aerospace Technology Enterprise - "Pioneer Technology Innovation to enable a revolution in Aerospace Systems".  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Applications for reconfigurable computing can be found in both military and commercial applications and are typically centered around areas where processing requirements are high and variable.  Example application spaces include high bandwidth signal processing, telemetry, and process control.  The resiliency being added to the RC domain through our approach affords added advantages when considering deployments in particularly harsh or toxic operating environments.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA's programs to send manned and unmanned missions to Moon, Mars and the planets beyond will require structural materials that can protect the crew and the spacecraft from Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR), Solar Energy Particles (SEP) and micrometeroid impact. In this Phase I effort, MMI proposes to reinforce high hydrogen content epoxies with nanotubes to obtain high performance composites with 20-25% higher primary load-bearing properties
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary NASA application for the proposed multifunctional composites will be for the CEV, the International Space Station, lunar and Martian habitats, micro spacecrafts and planetary rovers. The composites also could be used to shield the numerous spacecrafts and satellites against meteoroid and space debris impact.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
	DoD: The major government sector that will utilize these composites besides NASA will be the Department of Defense. They also have spacecrafts and satellites that need protection against micro meteoroids and space debris. Military aircraft and helicopter structure, reconnaissance satellites and high flying long-duration spycraft, structures for long range missiles, and uninhabited combat air vehicles, can be fabricated using the proposed composite materials. The excellent impact properties indicate these composites can be used for ballistic armor. 
<br>
<br>Civilian: Applications will focus on commercial aircraft structure and interiors, satellites, wind turbine blades, and ballistic protection for law enforcement officers.

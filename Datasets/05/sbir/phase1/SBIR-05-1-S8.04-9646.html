<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposed SBIR Phase I addresses the development of catalysts and technology for the ignition of advanced monopropellants consisting of mixtures of hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN) and a combustible component.  The catalysts will possess intrinsic activity for ignition and will also possess requisite thermal stability and erosion resistance.  Minimal delay times will be achieved by the catalyst composition and enhanced surface area, which will accelerate rate limiting steps of ignition.  Phase I will consist of the synthesis and physical characterization of catalysts, evaluation of catalyst activity, initial optimization of composition and preparation of catalysts, and testing in a combustion chamber.  In Phase II, the preferred catalyst(s) will be optimized, synthesized in larger quantities, and subjected to more rigorous and extensive testing in a device.  The goal of the proposed program will be to develop a catalyst exhibiting a low ignition temperature, but also possessing the favorable attributes described above.  Successful development of such catalyst technology will lead to applications in a number of propulsion-related devices.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Successful completion of the proposed program will result in the availability of rugged catalysts for ignition of HAN/fuel mixtures and other monopropellants.  Such materials will find application in thrusters, as well as in other devices, such as as liquid gas generators, emergency power units (EPUs), auxiliary power units (APUs), and thrusters.
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Potential non-NASA applications include use as an ignition catalyst in thrusters, liquid gas generators, emergency power units (EPUs), and auxiliary power units (APUs).  Another application will be in catalytic combustion as found in natural gas powered turbines and in environmental control technologies.  Interested companies would include not only those involved in development of propulsion technologies, but also catalysis companies and waste management companies with interests in catalytic destruction of environmental pollutants.

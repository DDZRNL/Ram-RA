<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal outlines a program to develop a vibration-free reverse-Brayton cycle cooling system using specially-tuned magnetic bearings.  Such a system is critical for the level of sensitivity required by future electromagnetic and gravitational wave detectors.  The nature of magnetic bearings and their accompanying control systems make them ideal for applications that demand zero vibration, low-gravity, and maintenance-free operation.  Further integration of these bearings into a reverse-Brayton cycle for cooling instruments is an ideal solution for use in high-sensitivity, long-term operations.  In Phase I, Mainstream will develop a control algorithm designed to eliminate virtually all vibration and will be developed and tested on an existing machine operating under similar operating speeds and conditions.  Design of the system and individual components will be finalized for immediate fabrication and testing in Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The development of a vibration-free reverse-Brayton cooling cycle using magnetic bearings will significantly increase the lifespan, efficiency, and sensitivity of space-based detectors as well as reduce system size and mass.  The use of magnetic bearings in future cooling systems is critical in achieving NASA's goal of larger, more powerful, more sensitive, and longer-term detectors and exploration missions.  The technology developed during the Phase I program can be seamlessly integrated with Mainstream's existing magnetic bearing spacecraft programs including low-lift heat pump refrigeration compressors and space-based hyperbaric chambers.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Vibration-free turbomachinery, and especially its use in cryogenic systems has tremendous potential in the military and industrial markets.  Such technology is directly applicable to high-sensitivity surveillance as well as commercial medical, semiconductor, supercomputer, and telecommunications applications where high accuracy and efficient thermal control is a must.

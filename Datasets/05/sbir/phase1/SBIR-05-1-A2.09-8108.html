<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The development of condition-based monitoring sensor network systems has the potential to provide an enhanced aircraft safety by real time assessment of the aircraft's structural integrity.    Los Gatos Research proposes to develop a structural health monitoring sensor system, capable of simultaneously monitoring  dynamic strain and structural  damages in aircraft components in real time.  Our novel sensor technology offers a number of advantages including compactness (0.2mm x 5mm x 5mm), lightweight (few grams), low cost, and fast response (milliseconds).  We achieve this by fabricating Bragg gratings on stress-sensitive polymer planar waveguides on a flexible substrate, which is capable of measuring stress, strain, and temperature, and monitoring damages in advanced material structures.  In Phase I, using a DFB laser with a feedback control we will demonstrate the sensor's capability to measure both static and dynamic strain with large dynamic range, high accuracy and high sensitivity. In addition, combing the low-cost laser-based demodulation technique and an acousto-ultrasonic method we will demonstrate the polymer gratings' capability to monitor ultrasonic stress waves indicating the presence and severity of damages in a metal structure, when the structure is probed by an ultrasonic wave generation actuator device.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Integrated optical technology provides significant advantages for advanced aerospace platforms because they are lightweight, immune to electromagnetic wave interference, and do not produce short circuits or ground loops.  The development of integrated optic Bragg grating sensors has the potential to increase reliability, enable lower cost, and facilitate  effective condition-based structural health monitoring of NASA's advanced aircraft and spacecraft components and systems.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The novel dynamic strain and damage monitoring sensor system will offer significant cost saving for the civil and aerospace industries by providing a cost-effective solution for structural monitoring for large aerospace and civil structures.

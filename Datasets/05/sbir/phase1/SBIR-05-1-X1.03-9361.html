<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In Topic X1.03 NASA (JPL) is seeking to extend and implement long distance exploratory surface rover missions to gain knowledge of surface topology and roughness.  The benefit is to identify suitable sites for future landings of human or robotic missions and to aid in pinpoint landings.  High resolution millimeter wave radar sensors provide a low cost, reliable way for a Moon or Mars Rover to detect hazards and negative obstacles (i.e. holes and drop-offs) while moving or stationary.  A radar sensor is effective as a stand-alone sensor, or as a complement to the stereo vision based and laser line systems used on previous successful rover missions.  The low computer overhead and inherently rapid response of a radar sensor enables a rover to rapidly traverse extremely rugged terrain without risk of falling into a hole or being otherwise trapped.  The rapid traverse speed provides a wider area for collection of science data, and reduces the fraction of limited mission time spent on moving, as opposed to measurement.  The overall objective of the proposed program is to develop a practical rover radar sensor for negative and positive obstacle detection.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Beyond the application stated in SBIR topic X1.03, the radar sensor is applicable to all NASA robotics and rover requirements, whether for Mars, the Moon, and destinations beyond.  The proposed concept may also be applicable for certain landing and docking activities, where precise, automated actions can be supplemented with MMW radar.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Potential Non-NASA commercial applications include robotics and unmanned vehicle applications, where concerns similar to that of the Moon/Mars rover apply ? ie. avoiding positive and negative hazards.  This may include all areas of robotics and unmanned vehicles, including those used in Homeland Security Operations, Surveillance, Rescue Operations, and Land Surveys.  Another application includes terrestrial robots for exploration of hostile environments (arctic, volcanoes, etc).

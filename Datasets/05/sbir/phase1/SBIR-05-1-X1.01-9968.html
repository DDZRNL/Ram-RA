<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Current and future programs of near-Earth and deep space exploration require the development of robust serial data transfer electronics within the spacecraft's subsystems while preserving open system architecture. The electronics must be reconfigurable, fault-tolerant, and have the ability to operate effectively for long periods of time in harsh environmental conditions. Existing data transfer systems based on passive backplanes are slow, power hungry, slightly reconfigurable, provide limited expandability, and have low tolerance to radiation effects. One of the most promising approaches to alleviate these system shortcomings is based on  switching fabric (SF) backplane architecture with serial (i.e. Space Wire (SW)) interfaces. In response to the described needs, we propose to develop a novel, radiation-tolerant, SF with a user-selectable standard SW interface or our patent-pending multi-level (ML) interface that features a high frequency range, low power consumption, and advanced functionality. Our ML interconnect technique eliminates the need for the second information channel utilized in the SW data-strobe encoding scheme. Instead the channel can be used as a redundant link for improving the system's fault tolerance specification. Radiation tolerance of the proposed system is achieved through the combination of the state-of-the-art and proprietary hardening-by-technology, hardening-by-design, and hardening-by-architecture techniques.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The successful accomplishment of this project will result in the development of a compact Application Specific Integrated Circuit or Multi-Chip-Module, which has the potential to revolutionize intra-space craft system development. The universal software-reconfigurable interface will not only speed-up the system's design and assembly process, but will open the way for the implementation of a true Plug and Play architecture and in-situ hardware adaptation. This is extremely important for the realization of future innovative concepts for space exploration over the next decade.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The novel space wire protocol based switching fabric approach that will be developed during Phase I will be implemented as a low power, open architecture, radiation hardened, application specific integrated circuit. The developed technology will mitigate new mission risks and minimize system cost and development time. This communication technology will also help computer and system designers to increase the processing power of future large computer systems in the movie industry and in a variety of military and industrial applications.

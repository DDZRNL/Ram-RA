<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The concept of a smart device capable of communicating and making its own local decisions for wireless sensing, monitoring control, data acquisition, tracking, and identification has already been implemented and tested by military and commercial world in recent years.  Methods for improving wireless transmission efficiency, data rate, power consumption, security, flexibility, scalability, and availability have also been proposed and some are implemented and tested.  However, the usage trends for wireless sensors are changing from a single sensing purpose to a wide range of multipurpose services such as geo-location, first response, identification, security, and multimedia. This is making the limited quantity of radio frequency spectra a scarce resource (expensive) and is forcing an optimization shift to software programmable capability that provides control of a variety of modulation technologies for wideband or narrowband applications, emergency, and security functions. Mobitrum is proposing an innovative Software Defined RF Transceiver targeted for emerging wireless sensor with multiple capabilities from real-time data acquisition and monitoring to emergency response, geo-location via GPS, security, images, and RFID applications. The device will be designed to be low power, reliable, secure, high speed, low cost, and highly portable in a small self-contained form factor for easy plug-and-play.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed software programmable RF transceiver will enable NASA Space Transportation Test and Earth science for spatial data input, manipulation, and distribution activities.  This transceiver will also improve the design and engineering collaboration to be more effective in the process of the data management. By developing programmable air interface techniques for transmitting large volumes of sensor data between sensors and central servers, operations and data transfer will become more effective.  Mobitrum anticipates that NASA will benefit from: (1) Data analysis, processing, and visualization for Earth science observations (2) Rocket engine test (3) Remote test facility management (4) Field communications device for spatial data input and distribution (5) Sensor measurement and field verification (6) RFID (7) Condition-aware applications (8) Location-aware applications (9) Biometric identification (10) Data collaboration and distribution and (11) Wireless instrumentation for robotic manipulation and positioning for audio and visual capture and real-time multimedia representation.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are tremendous business applications and deployments for cellular 4G networks on the mobile multimedia based on software programmable radio. Mobitrum anticipates the increasing popularity of mobile handheld that includes PDA/Cell phone will create opportunity to enhance mobility and service provisioning that are two key factors making handheld deployable throughout wireless networks. The software programmable RF technology can provide enhanced wireless data acquisition and control in a variety of applications such as the following: (1) Global cellular service, (2) Utility ? remote meter reading (3) Defense ? data communication links for test ranges and launch facility (4) Building automation systems ? real-time monitoring and control of security and surveillance systems, alarms, HVAC, etc., (5) Manufacturing and distribution ? industrial automation using RFID (6) Health care ? wireless monitoring equipment (7) Security ? location tracking (8) Converged handsets ? integration of cell phone, PDA, notebook, GPS navigation system, and broadcast radio and TV receiver.

<P><B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>Multi-roller traction drives 
have several advantages relative to geared units for aerospace and commercial 
drive applications. Among these are zero backlash, low torque ripple, 
compactness, light weight, and unlike gears, the potential to operate without 
liquid or grease lubrication. Current traction drives are made from heat treated 
bearing steels and require special traction fluids which limited their use to 
terrestrial applications. Space applications such as planetary vehicles operate 
in hostile environments. Innovations in material technology for non-lubricated 
operation will be required in order to benefit from the inherent advantages of 
traction drives relative to gears. Phase I work of this proposal will provide 
the basis for alternative nonmetallic materials to be substituted for bearing 
steel. These materials must have low wear but high traction characteristics. The 
proposed effort under Phase I will be used as a basis for a Phase II effort, in 
which one or more prototype systems will be designed, built and tested for space 
exploration applications. Applications include robotic arms, speed and torque 
balanced drives for scientific instruments and zero torque reaction drives for 
planetary vehicles. 
<P><B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>Potential 
NASA space applications for these drives include: Moon and Martian rover 
transmission drives, robotic arms, construction vehicles and equipment, and 
essentially any application needing either drive speed increasers or reducers. 
<P><B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>If 
successful, many more Earth-based uses of these drives may occur, since 
fabrication of bearing steel drives are very expensive and this has inhibited 
their use. Alternate affordable processing and manufacturing technologies for 
final net shape forming roller geometries without final machining or heat 
treatment will enable much cheaper drives to be made. We will also conduct 
design and life analysis using non-metallic materials to quantify the benefits 
of polymer drives. These drives may find uses in automobiles, power lifting 
equipment, windmills, etc. <BR>

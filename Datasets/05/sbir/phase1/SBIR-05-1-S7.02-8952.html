<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal explains procedures of using regional and local geoid undulations to improve and convert the global positioning system (GPS) elevations (ellipsoidal heights) into orthometric heights.  The Geoid Undulation Model (Geoid 2003) for the North America has reached the centimeter level accuracy. Although the GPS accuracy has reached to millimeter level, the elevation component (converted to orthometric height) has not been optimized to the same level of accuracy as X and Y. This research will select a test site in North Georgia covering a 2&#61616; x 2&#61616; of hilly as well as plain area. The test site will also include an urban area such as the City of Atlanta, and a large water body such as the Lake Lanier. The 2&#61616; x 2&#61616; area is divided into 1&#61616; x 1&#61616;, 5' x 5', and 1' x 1' grid elements to compute global, regional, and local geoid undulations. Gravity data will be observed and compared against the gravity data obtained from the GRACE program. Also, the accuracy of existing geoid undulation in Georgia will be compared with the developed geoid undulation model, which will incorporate local and regional level gravity anomalies.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The following would be the potential NASA applications of this research:
<br>a. Improved geoid model (gravity field) for the regions where the geoid models are not precise.  The new gravity data can be used in testing the gravity field of the earth and also to compare the accuracy of gravity data derived form space technology such as GRACE program.
<br>b. Gravity study and orthometric heights are critical for structural development; the research can be replicated to Moon or other planets if NASA's goal to build base station in the Moon by 2015 is implemented.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The precise geoid undulation is a must to optimize the accuracy/minimize the cost of obtaining elevation data using GPS technology. Establishing benchmarks (elevation stations) by conventional method (running a differential level loop from mean sea level or from known bench mark to the point of interest; for the land locked countries where conventional differential leveling is not only cumbersome and costly, but sometimes it is almost impossible to get permission from the neighboring country to run a level loop to the mean sea level) is time consuming and cost prohibitive. Given that EMI is successful in developing a methodology for computing local and regional geoid undulation, there is a vast market to commercialize this product worldwide. 
<br>
<br>State Agencies such as (DOT, DNR) could update their elevation data utilizing the recent gravity data to improve the accuracy and consistency within the sate agencies.

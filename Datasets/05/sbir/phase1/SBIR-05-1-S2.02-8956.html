<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The purpose of this project is to develop and demonstrate a communications system capable of operation at extreme temperatures and pressures in hostile and corrosive environments such as found on the surface of the planet Venus.  Although already explored by various orbiters and short-lived atmospheric probes and landers, Venus retains many secrets pertaining to its formation and evolution and also the ability to further probe and investigate Venus' surface is of significant scientific value.  However the measurement of data and collection of information in an extreme environment is of limited use or value unless the data and information can be sent out of the environment.  This proposed project will address vital communication needs of the future in situ exploration of Venus and atmospheric probes for giant planets.  The technology to be employed in the proposed extreme environment communications system is based on a proven class of electronic devices called solid state vacuum devices (SSVD<SUP>TM</SUP>s).  S-band (~ 2 to 4 GHz) power amplifiers and transmitters along with S-band receivers will be designed and built in this proposed SBIR project to enable essential and critical communications between vehicles and probes located on Venus' surface and systems in orbit around Venus.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The potential NASA applications of this SBIR project and, in general, for SSVD <SUP>TM</SUP> are significant and, in addition to extreme high temperature communications needs discussed in this proposal, includes both "near room temperature" and rugged high to extreme high temperature communications, electronics, integrated circuits and related systems along with high temperature electronic devices, circuits and sensors, energy conversion, operation amplifiers, control and process circuits, pressure sensing, motor and robotic controllers and drivers, power supplies and related applications, radar, high temperature and radiation insensitive imaging systems, small scale integrated circuits, microwave and millimeter communications for terrestrial, space and planetary exploration applications and sub-millimeter wave and terahertz power sources for exploratory and communications applications.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Potential non-NASA commercial applications are vast and include: harsh environment communications and electronics, low frequency to millimeter wave sources for communications and other applications; power supplies and converters; control, monitoring and sensing applications for harsh environments in terrestrial, automotive, avionics, and aeronautics, geothermal, oil exploration, nuclear, industrial controllers, and distributed control systems; imaging; sensors and detectors, impedance transformers; wireless communications for harsh environments; fuel combustion; high temperature, vacuum and MEMS packaging; and other applications needing three dimensional microfabrication/micromachining; in addition to security, and defense and military systems.  There are additional applications ranging from DC to RF to millimeter-wave to terahertz power amplifiers to extreme environment and temperature communications, electronics and sensors.  Other markets include high temperature micro-heaters to macro-heaters, high ratio planar transformer design, and new component development.  Many of these requirements include, among others things, light weight, compactness, power efficiency, and most of all, cost effective manufacturing.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Range surveillance is a critical component of space exploration because of its implications on safety, cost, and overall mission timeline.  However, launch delays, due to the difficulty of verifying a cleared range, are common and will increase as spaceports are developed in new areas.   In order to expedite range clearance, it is vital to see "through" the atmosphere.  Unfortunately, the quality of the images taken with long-range optical systems is severely degraded by atmospheric movements in the path between the region under observation and the imaging system.  We therefore propose the use of custom hardware, specifically designed to compensate for atmospheric disturbances in long range imaging.  Furthermore, we propose the use of a reconfigurable hardware platform, specifically field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), to reduce costs and development time, as well as increase flexibility and reusability.  Alternative hardware platforms are not well suited for this particular application.  Our unique approach would allow a single device, with the computational power of a computer cluster, to be used for not only atmospheric compensation, but also encrypted communications, audio and video encoding/decoding and transmission, neural network implementations, etc.  The applications of such a technology are virtually limitless!

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Because atmospheric disturbances become the dominating source of noise in long-range imaging, technology that compensates for such phenomena has far-reaching applications.  There are numerous uses for this technology within NASA.  Such applications include range surveillance, air traffic monitoring, earth-based astronomical measurements, atmospheric compensation in extra-planetary missions, and high-altitude mission optical monitoring.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Many government and commercial groups will benefit from this technology, from law enforcement to the study of natural phenomena.  Some specific applications include vehicle monitoring and identification, remote site monitoring, border patrol, perimeter security, costal monitoring, long-range wildlife photography, and airport security.

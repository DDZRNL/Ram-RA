<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Ongoing work under NASA sponsorship is defining promising High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) demonstration vehicle designs for remote sensing, communication relay, environmental monitoring, and other critical missions.  Continuing challenges in preparing these vehicles for flight test include issues that will also be critical in the development of operational HALE vehicles: time-accurate simulation of aeroelastic effects; simulation-based design of flight control and propulsion systems for high efficiency, structural stability, and adequate control at all flight conditions; and effective, validated, full-vehicle dynamics analyses for aeroservoelastic applications.  The proposed effort will address these needs by making available modular, state of the art modeling tools for use in full aircraft simulations to support vehicle assessment and control system design throughout the HALE flight test and development process.  These tools will be operable in a range of modes with up to real-time turnaround and will feature a unique ability to support hardware-coupled ("hardware in the loop") simulation in conjunction with finite element-based aeroelastic modeling.   This capability will support both near term flight demonstrations of prospective HALE vehicles and long-term design and analysis tasks for NASA HALE platforms.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A key benefit of the proposed effort would be the development of a fully-coupled nonlinear aero-elastic analysis, simulation, and design tool for HALE aircraft that would support projected NASA flight test activities.  This tool would enable non-real-time design/optimization analysis functions and real-time hardware-in-the loop flight simulation, testing and support capabilities; this functionality improves on competing approaches that offer only non-real-time analysis of a purely computational nature and require the acquisition of commercial analysis tools.  The ability to couple directly to flight hardware is judged to offer a significant advantage in terms of providing direct support to flight test preparation.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This effort would provide major defense contractors, DoD agencies, prime contractors for HALE programs, and manufacturers of high altitude aircraft or airships a comprehensive analysis with the capability for high fidelity, configurational aerodynamics analysis of both high altitude fixed wing aircraft and airships in calculation times conducive to both support of flight test activities and design.  No computational tool exists that can provide this capability incorporating full airframe aerodynamics and aeroelastic modeling, as well as a capability for hardware-coupled simulation.    In addition, design information on high altitude propulsion systems would be generated to assist optimization current propeller and wing designs.

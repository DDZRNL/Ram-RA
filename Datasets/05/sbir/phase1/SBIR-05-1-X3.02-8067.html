<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Sion Power is developing a rechargeable lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery with a demonstrated specific energy exceeding 350 Wh/kg and the range of operating temperatures from ?40 to +45oC. The range will be extended to ?60 +60oC and specific energy to 400 Wh/kg. Performance improvement will be based on developing three components: 
<br>1.	Advanced electrolytes with high ionic conductivity at liquid or glassy state at temperatures down to minus 70-100oC;
<br>2.	Advanced cathode with homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts increasing electrochemical sulfur utilization to 90% and energy to 400 Wh/kg;
<br>3.	Additives protecting lithium anode surface from reaction with electrolyte and providing long calendar life and low self-discharge;
<br>
<br>To demonstrate the effectiveness of components developed, we will build and cycle the series of 1.2 ? 2.5 Ah cells in the range of temperatures from ?70 to +60oC at rates from C/20 to 2C.

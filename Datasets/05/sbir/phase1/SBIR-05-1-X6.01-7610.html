<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed project is aimed at developing a model based diagnostics system for spacecraft that will allow real time assessment of its state, while it is impacted by a failure mode, and provide to the crew the possible reconfiguration strategies to continue the mission. 
<br>While a lot of research is being done on the development of Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) system, very little effort is made to provide the spacecraft with the capability to use IVHM information in order to assess the possible strategies possible when a failure event has impacted the vehicle. A model based system can use its understanding of the system state to deduce the potential reconfiguration commands and optimize the outcome in order to preserve the mission goals.
<br>Our proposed project is targeted at supporting the spacecraft fault tolerance capability by searching the system states space and selecting the most appropriate sequence of actions to execute in order to optimize the possibility of mission success, by reconfiguring the spacecraft to a desired new state.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA is engaged in one of the most ambitious program with the Vision for Space Exploration which will take the next step in robotics explorations and human expeditions to the Moon and beyond. The concept proposed for this SBIR Phase I is generic and will be developed in such a way that it can support all the multiple kinds of advanced spacecrafts or robotics systems that NASA is going to develop. In the coming years, the CEV will be one of the focus of attention as it represents the new generation of manned spacecraft. Many additional spacecraft systems will be initiated in parallel to accomplish the Vision for Space Exploration. They include among others, complex advanced robotics assistants such as the Science Crew Operations Utility Testbed (SCOUT), the Robonaut project, or the mini AERCam. Providing these programs with a capability to recover from a failure mode by allowing the crew to intelligently select the best set of actions among the numerous alternatives will minimize risks associated with failures modes. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In the commercial arena, any complex system that is directly impacted by different failure modes and requires the operating crew to select the best set of actions in a limited time could benefit from the proposed concept. Specifically, Power plants and Chemical plants, in which a failure mode could incur millions of dollars of lost revenue are clear target of our model based prognostics system. Other areas such as airplanes maintenance can also benefit from the technology.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to develop a novel thermal interface material (TIM) that is based on an array of vertical carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for high heat flux applications.  For high precision, spaceborne lasers and other high power devices critical to NASA's Science Mission Directorate, heat flux levels are projected to reach 100 W/cm2.  The state-of-the-art in space-compatible thermal interface materials (TIMs) is limited to a maximum achievable thermal conductance of approximately 5 W/cm2<SUP>o</SUP>C.  Preliminary testing of our innovative TIM approach has demonstrated thermal conductance values of 
<br>33 W/cm2<SUP>o</SUP>C, a nearly seven-fold increase.  For an incident heat flux of 100 W/cm2, this corresponds to a temperature drop of only 3<SUP>o</SUP>C, compared with 20<SUP>o</SUP>C for current technology.  Thus, the use of our innovative CNT-based TIM will enable increased reliability, decreased size, and increased performance of spaceborne thermal management systems for the SMD.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The goal of our innovative thermal interface material (TIM) is to increase the ability of the Science Directorate to answer the fundamental questions about space, the universe, and our solar system.  Specifically, our innovation has broad applications to all thermal management systems including lasers, high-temperature radiators, and other high-power devices.  Because of the high durability of our approach, our CNT-based TIM can be used in cryogenic applications as well.  The net result will be an increase in the efficiency of space-based thermal management systems as a whole, which will ultimately increase functionality and decrease weight.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A developed CNT-based thermal interface material (TIM) would have wide commercial applications particularly with respect to high-power electronics and laser systems.  For ground-based laser and high-power systems, the heat exchangers, chillers, and other thermal management components make up the majority of the system size and weight.  Our innovation could be a key element in reducing the footprint of these systems and increasing their applicability in communications, power facilities, and other challenging thermal management applications.  Future applications may also include high-power microprocessors in rack-mounted servers and high-power electronics used for actuators, motor controllers, and power distribution.

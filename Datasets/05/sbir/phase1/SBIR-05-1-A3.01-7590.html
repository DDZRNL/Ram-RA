<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The development of an Eulerian model based en route traffic flow management agent for the ACES software is proposed. The proposed research will use a recently-developed automatic modeling technique, together with a predictive air traffic flow control approach. Performance of the traffic flow management agent will be evaluated in several traffic flow control situations. The sensitivity of the traffic flow management system to variations in traffic patterns and weather will be investigated.
<br>
<br>Phase I research will demonstrate the feasibility of developing the traffic flow management agent.  A complete version of the proposed software agent will be developed during the Phase II work. It will be fully integrated with the ACES software and commercialized during the Phase III work.
<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
ACES software is being used by NASA researchers for developing and evaluating advanced ATM concepts. The traffic flow management agents developed under the proposed research effort will help support NASA's research initiatives. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The strategic flow control methodology developed under the proposed research will help develop decision aids for future air traffic flow management.  This flow control technique is also useful for developing decision support tools for collaborative flow control and for designing regional metering strategies.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Offerers will build on their recent innovation of a microwave-induced route to the rapid functionalization, solubilization and reactive synthesis of carbon nanotube-ceramic and nanotube-polymer composites. The microwave process is environmentally friendly and results in the complete removal of metal catalysts used in the synthesis of the pristine nanotubes. These residual nanoscale metals are known to be toxic. The functionalization will be carried out via different routes so that the nanotubes can be rendered soluble in different solvents including water, alcohols, and nonpolar liquids. This will facilitate mixing with different polymer matrices for fabrication of composites, and also facilitate the formation of coatings and films. The reactive synthesis of ceramic and polymer composites involves the formation of the composite structure on the nanotube sidewalls via a microwave-assisted reaction. This will lead to the formation of a novel class of nanomaterials with unique structural, electronic and thermal properties.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The opportunity addressed in this proposal is in the critical NASA Research Topic area X2.03 on Nanostructured Materials. Within this research topic we will focus our Phase I R&D effort on two areas that are of significant interest to NASA. It will include: (1) demonstration and initial development of metal-free, functionalized, soluble and alignable single wall carbon nanotubes that can be used in the fabrication of next generation composites; (2) development of  reactive synthesis routes and the production of ceramic and polymer nanocomposite with single wall carbon nanotubes for high strength and tunable electrical/thermal properties.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed work will have non-NASA applications in the areas of adsorbents, solar cells, light emitting diodes, active coatings, fuel cell electrodes, nanoenergetics and medical imaging.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Many UV photon-counting and imaging applications, including space-borne astronomy, missile tracking and guidance, UV spectroscopy for chemical/biological identification, and UV medical imaging, demand very high performance in detector sensitivity, speed, resolution, and background noise. This proposal is directed toward the development of innovative high-efficiency UV photocathodes based on the wide bandgap III-nitride semiconductors for reliable operation in space missions.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
High performance photon counting sensor systems are essentials part of the enabling technology for future space-borne astronomy as well as many civilian and military applications. The same technology can be used to fabricate high-brightness electron emitters for applications in maskless electron lithography, metrology, and solid-state lighting. Large-format UV imagers are in great demand for space science and military applications.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Detection of light in the ultraviolet (UV) range (wavelength < 400 nm) has a wide range of applications, both commercial and military, particularly in those areas where the UV component of light needs to be analyzed in the presence of large visible and/or infrared (IR) backgrounds. The proposed work can also result in the development of high-brightness electron emitters for applications in metrology and maskless electron lithography.

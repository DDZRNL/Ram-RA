<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Significant cost and weight savings of a space mission can be achieved by improving the cryogenic storage technology.  Added cryogen mass due to the cryogen boil-off, the oversized tanks and storage systems make the planetary missions prohibitive.  The recently proposed Zero-Boil-Off (ZBO) strategy for cryogen tanks, which combines both thermal insulation and "cryocooling" technologies to manage the heat leaks.  It is a straightforward concept that could lead to a significant weight/cost reduction for long-duration missions.  However, several issues must be resolved before the ZBO benefits can be realized.  One of which is the management of the through-the-tank-wall "heat leaks".  Loop Heat Pipe (LHP) is a passive two-phase heat transport device that utilizes solely capillary action to circulate the working fluid in a closed loop to transfer heat from one location to another.  LHPs do not contain mechanical moving parts and therefore are highly reliable and durable for space applications.  A novel cryogenic LHP system is proposed for the ZBO cryocooling.  It is capable of acquiring heat from a large area of the cryo-tank wall, transporting it to a cryocooler for heat rejection, and meeting other design requirements of cryogen storage systems for space missions.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Cryogenic cooling has become increasingly important not only for the cryogen storage technology but the thermal management of IR sensors/detectors and high temperature superconductors.  Spaceport operations, both on Earth as well as extraterrestrial, are heavily dependent upon a wide range of cryogenic storage systems such as liquid Oxygen and liquid Nitrogen.  Each has unique performance requirements that need to be met.  In addition, Far IR (FIR) telescopes require temperature control in the range of 20-30K.  The LHP system will meet all aforementioned requirements offering a robust passive cryocooling transport over large areas.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) technology has reached a level of maturity that HTS electronic devices could be reliably produced.  There were already feasibility investigations of utilizing all-HTS electronics for next generation Navy spacecraft.  The proposed HTS electronics subsystem would have to be cooled to 77K for the superconducting properties to take effect.  Cooling methods for maintaining an entire HTS electronic box or a cryogenic thermal bus at 77K are being seriously sought.  The large area LHP cryocooling technology would provide a perfect solution for the aforementioned cryogenic thermal bus.

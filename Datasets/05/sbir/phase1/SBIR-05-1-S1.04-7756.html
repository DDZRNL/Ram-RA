<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
System & Processes Engineering Corporation (SPEC) proposes a miniature solid state surface imaging LADAR, for imaging the landing areas providing precision surface profile and range to impact.  The LADAR utilizes an advanced hybridized detector Readout Integrated Circuit (ROIC) single chip solution that supports an integrated detector and ROIC configuration enabling a single chip LADAR receiver solution capable of operating at multiple wavelengths.  This single chip receiver is combined with multiple laser diodes to give a miniature flash LADAR with high frame rates, 3mm range accuracy, low power draw and small data frames (100x smaller than typical LIDARS).  The LADAR provides the range and amplitude of the first three targets encountered in each pixel, giving the ability to detect subpixel rocks and craters without overwhelming data rates or image processing.  The integrated Micro Channel Plate (MCP) allows ultra high receiver sensitivity, with high gain and wavelength flexibility by changing the photo cathode materials.  The use of a MCP with CMOS chip anode pickup pixels, allows the chip to be vertically integrated using a standard CMOS process, the pickup anode on the top layer, the sample and holds and amplifiers below.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Terrain Hazard Detection for Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) systems.
<br>The MGML system will provide a real-time three-dimensional terrain mapping capability to allow for terrain hazard detection approaches during parachute descent and powered terminal descent. The MGML system will be an enabling component of future planetary surface and airborne explorations.
<br>
<br>Autonomous Vehicles Performing Remote Spacecraft Inspections.
<br>The use of a MGML by astronauts in extravehicular activity (EVA) or by autonomous vehicles performing spacecraft inspections greatly increases operational safety while improving collision avoidance between the imaging platform and spacecraft being inspected.  A display of the three dimensional shape, not distorted by perceived shadows or patterns, allows detection of unspecified changes in objects being inspected under diverse or changing lighting/viewing conditions to be easily interpreted. The MGML is compact, low power, and produces a depth map of the scene, which supports a free flying, remotely controlled imaging platform for various NASA remote inspection applications.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are many DOD UGV and UAV applications for the MGML system for collision avoidance and to accurately locate and identify objects. Commercial applications for 3D imagers on UGV include robots utilized for bomb identification and disposal, 3D imaging for Police Tactical Units and robots, and 3D imaging for Fire Departments, Search and Rescue, Underground Workers, Construction and Mining. The discrimation capability of the MGML system will provide for the capability to allow for detection.

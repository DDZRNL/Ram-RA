<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The innovation of the proposed effort is a unique automated process for the analysis, design, and sizing of CEV structures and TPS.  This developed process will permit hundreds of conceptual and preliminary design trade studies to be performed in a matter of only a few days rather than several months. This shorter time is made possible by replacing or reducing currently required experienced analyst interaction (man in the loop) with predefined knowledge based sizing templates and floating virtual structural component definitions for both surfaces zones and connecting bonded/bolted joints. The resulting capability will be an open architecture built within the HyperSizer<SUP>REG</SUP> commercial software suitable for internally integrating NASA or industry developed specialty discipline analysis codes and externally integrating HyperSizer with NASA larger design systems. This new capability will be unique in that no other commercial or non-commercial tool will have the same level of depth, breadth, accuracy, speed, verification & validation, and software robustness for performing weight prediction and reduction, structural integrity margins-of-safety reporting, and reliability prediction and improvement.  
<br>
<br>This innovation will involve four tasks: 1) Development of knowledge based sizing templates; 2) Development of floating virtual components; 3) Support for NASA on-going multi-disciplinary design system integration activities; and 4) Development of an automated HyperSizer-FEM iteration process for achieving FEA load convergence.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The SBIR developed capability for CEV specific structural components will be integrated into the existing commercial HyperSizer<SUP>REG</SUP> structural sizing software. HyperSizer has and is currently being used by both Lockheed Martin/OSC and the Boeing/Northrop Grumman teams for their CEV designs. The listed innovative new capabilities proposed in the work plan are direct requests from these companies for application to their CEV trade studies, and from NASA users. 
<br>
<br>Other active NASA users include Langley, Glenn, and Marshall research centers for planetary structures such as aerobrakes, UAV vehicles such as High Altitude Long Endurance, and cryogenic composite/metallic tanks. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
HyperSizer is being used by aerospace engineers around the country for airframe design and analysis. For example, at Scaled Composites in Mojave, California engineers are using the software for various different experimental airframe designs since 2001, including the unconventional all composite Global Flyer that in 2005 flew non-stop around the world. 
<br>
<br>Non-NASA applications include Boeing's commercial transport 7E7/787; Northrop Grumman's UAVs such as J-UCAS, Global Hawk, and composite ship superstructures; Lockheed Martin's F-22, C-130J, and JSF; Gulfstream's general aviation aircraft and Pratt Whitney's Hypersonic engines.

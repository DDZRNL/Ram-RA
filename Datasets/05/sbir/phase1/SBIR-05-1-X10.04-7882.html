<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop heat pipe and loop heat pipe (LHP) working fluids for what is known as the intermediate temperature range, from roughly 500 K to 700 K.  Currently, there are no working fluids in this range that can be used in NASA applications, due in part to unknown physical properties and insufficient life test data.  The overall objective of the proposed Phase I and Phase II programs is to validate one or more fluids for use in the intermediate temperature range.  This will include life tests, determination of the physical property data required to design heat pipes and LHPs in this temperature range, and the design, fabrication, and testing of suitable heat pipes and/or LHPs.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary application is the development of intermediate temperature heat pipes/LHPs for low-mass space radiators, such as the radiators currently being designed for Project Prometheus, as well as radiators for the lunar and Mars surfaces.  One design that is being examined uses a Brayton cycle to generate electricity.  The radiator could operate in the intermediate temperature range of 450 K to 750 K, where there are currently no commonly used working fluids for loop heat pipes and heat pipes.  The proposed program would develop fluid/wick/envelope systems for these temperatures, and validate them with long-term life tests.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Electronics cooling is a second application, for both NASA and commercial electronics, particularly for SiC devices.  The benefits of SiC over silicon include its wide bandgap energy, high breakdown electric field, and high thermal conductivity.  Some of these SiC devices operate in the range of 450 K to 750 K.  Heat pipe or LHP cooling of SiC devices will require the intermediate temperature systems that will be developed in the proposed program.

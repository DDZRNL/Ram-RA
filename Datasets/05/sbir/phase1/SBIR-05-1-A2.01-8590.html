<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Noise has become a primary consideration in the design and development of many products, particulary in aerospace, automotive and consumer product industries. Communities near airports are often exposed to high noise levels due to low flying aircraft in the takeoff and landing phases of fligh and the major contribution to the overall noise is comming from the propulsion source noise. It is proposed to develop solutions based on integrated generalized acoustical holography and active noise control technologies that will enable the identification and reduction of turbomachinery noise. In this development, generalized acoustical holography will be used for noise source identification and active noise control together with passive control will be used for the noise reduction.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The developed system will enable the identification and reduction of noise radiated by turboengine, rotocraft and advanced propeller aerodynamic noise. The adaptation of the developed system will enable noise reduction in other situations such as control of aircraft cabin noise and helicoper cabin noise.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The adaptation of the developed system will have applications in many areas such as identification and reduction of noise radiated by internal combusion engine, exhaust noise, automotive interior noise as well as noise radiated by industrial noise sources such as vacuum pumps, forced air blowers, gas turbine exhausts, and airconditioning systems.

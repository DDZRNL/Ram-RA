<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Surmet will demonstrate a novel processing method to develop environmentally resistant C/SiC composites for turbomachinery.  The need to reduce the weight, size, and costs of current systems make the use of SiC ideal in these high temperatures and extreme environments.  Traditional processing of SiC materials are inherently limited in terms of component thicknesses and overall sizes that can be processed, as well as uniform densification.  Also, pure SiC matrices are subject to attack in the environments expected for these components, e.g., hydrogen rich steam and oxygen rich environments.  
<br>	Surmet proposes a protected C/SiC composite from preceramic polymer as a solution to NASA systems' weight, environmental resistance, and cost requirements.  A number of specimens will be fabricated to demonstrate mechanical strength, thermal capability, and environmental durability of these materials.  The Phase II program will demonstrate repeatability in properties and produce relevant CMC components that will be tested under simulated service conditions.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Preceramic polymer based SiC CMC's provide affordability and potential for scale-up in size.  After resolving the major shortcoming of current PIP based CMC's ? poor environmental resistance, these material will find a number of airborne and space based applications, including space optics, advanced earth-to-orbit propulsion systems, and hypersonic vehicles.  Specifically, rocket turbomachinery components such as nozzle ramp (active cooled structures), turbine blades, thrust chambers, resulting from this technology will produce substantial improvement in propulsion system performance and cost.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
After this environmentally durable CMC technology is demonstrated in government aerospace applications, it will find a number of military, commercial and industrial applications.  These include:  a) turbine, combustion chamber and recuperator components in gas turbine engines for unmanned combat aircraft as well as commercial aircraft, b) automotive/diesel engine components such as turbocharger rotors, rocker arms, etc., c) tribological applications such as brake materials, capstans, etc, and d) industrial applications such as pump vanes for handling and distribution of corrosive chemicals and erosive slurries.

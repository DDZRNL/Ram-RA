<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose the development and space-qualification of a 1.06 micron ultrastable fiber laser source that fully satisfies the requirements of this SBIR opportunity (Laser Technologies for Gravitational Wave Detection).  Our recommended approach builds on extensive experience developing and using single-frequency laser sources in the near infrared, both for aerospace and commercial applications. Our technical approach is based on emerging technology, spawned by the telecom industry that is only now reaching the maturity level where space qualification can be undertaken.    NASA requires ultrastable laser sources for a variety of ongoing and planned missions including LISA and GRACE.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA is planning space-based sensors, a critical component of which are single-frequency ultrastable oscillators.  These missions include LISA (Laser Interferometric Space Antenna), upgraded GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiments), terrestrial and space-based distributed aperture telescopes, interferometric instruments such as SIM and TFP (Space Interferometer Mission and Terrretrial Planet Finder) and general space-based metrology, where ultrahigh wavelength stability is the dominant requirement.  These missions require lasers with sub-kHz linewidth at wavelengths from 1.06 to 1.5 ?m.  Several nearer-term missions also require single-frequency seed or local oscillator lasers with Mhz linewidth.  These missions include global Doppler winds lidar and coherent sensing of atmospheric constituents including CO2 and water vapor.  <P>

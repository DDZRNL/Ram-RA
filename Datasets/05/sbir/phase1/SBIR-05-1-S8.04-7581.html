<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In response to RFP S8.04 Spacecraft Propulsion, innovations in propulsion technologies are needed to increase the capabilities of the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) spacecraft.  Towards this need, MicroPhase Coatings, Inc. (MPCI) proposes tank bladders compatible with advanced monopropellants.  MPCI is well underway in development of polymer liners for lightweight propulsion tanks for containment of gelled inhibited red fuming nitric acid (IRFNA) and monomethylhydrazine (MMH) under an Army Redstone Arsenal contract in collaboration with partner Northrop Grumman Space Technology (NGST).  Most MPCI bladders are composed of FEP thermoplastic fluoropolymer into which glass flake is compounded for additional barrier properties.  Glass flakes within the polymer matrix overlap to yield tortuous paths to chemicals that might otherwise migrate through a polymer matrix. When needed, we also incorporate auxiliary fluorinated silicate coating or even pure gold plate within the bladder interior.  Fluoropolymers, glass, gold and silicate coatings are all materials well known for chemical inertness.  MPCI's innovation is to combine the materials in a form that yields a flexible bladder which serves as an inert barrier for monopropellant containment and stability.  The time is ripe to expand compatibility testing of MPCI's bladder technology to advanced monopropellants for SMD needs.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Flexible bladders will serve as inert barriers for monopropellant containment and stability, which will increase the capabilities of the SMD spacecraft.  The bladders will be compatible with the advanced monopropellants used by NASA.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Preliminary research indicates several different commercial opportunities for the development of the monopropellant containment technology.  1. The development of non-toxic materials for power generation continues to gain momentum.  Several programs investigating the use of high concentration hydrogen peroxide are exhibiting promise for low cost and wide applicability.  A containment strategy to prevent decomposition over time will be required to develop this technology.  2. Possible use for storage of Pyrophoric Materials that will combust when exposed to moisture or air.  3. Replace glass vials for very reactive materials that are scored and then broken in a glove box contained area). 4. Non-breakable containment vessels for highly reactive chemicals used in academic and industrial laboratories.  5. Potential for transportation industry for air, rail and ocean either as individual containment packaging or integral to the vessel design.

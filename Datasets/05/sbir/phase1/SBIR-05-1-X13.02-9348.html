<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>

<br>Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) proposes a non-intrusive method to measure an individual's capacity for vigilance while comfortably seated at a computer workstation. The individual will be monitored by overhead, side, and front cameras and one or more microphones. The cameras and microphones will not interfere with the normal operation of the individual, and, in fact, could be virtually hidden from view. No other sensors will be used. We propose to engage an individual in an intensive exercise that includes aspects of hand-eye motor control and cognitive recall ? much like game playing. Over the course of the half-hour exercise, we expect the individual to fatigue, thereby demonstrating decreased quantifiable performance and common visual or auditory symptoms of fatigue.  In extreme cases of fatigue, eye closure is a very robust and consistent indicator of heavy fatigue. Under light and moderate fatigue conditions, the signs may include yawning, lack of concentration, dull face, change in voice characteristics (speed, tone), etc.  We hypothesize that these symptoms can be correlated with the individual's capacity for vigilance.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed fatigue detection system has great potential in real-time vigilance monitoring. The information can be utilized to schedule recesses to prevent loss of the productivity. Hence the performance of operators will be significantly improved. 
<br>
<br>NASA Applications
<br>The proposed approach can be used to assess the performance of astronauts during space missions. It can be also used to assess performance of operators on the ground.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Non-NASA Applications
<br>Consequently, we hope the technology will reduce accidents caused by miscommunications between tired people in military command and control centers. Besides military applications, the system can also be applied to 911 operators, telemarketers, etc. The system would be useful for fatigue management and countermeasures to mitigate fatigue-induced errors.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposed Phase I program will address NASA's need for large diameter high radio frequency (Ka band 27- 40 GHz) apertures that provide greater gain and resolution for communications and remote sensing systems. This will be accomplished by developing a new high accuracy electro-textile antenna surface as well as investigating a novel involute wrapped rib deployable support structure for large aperture antennas that is light weight and deploys out of a very small volume. The combination of light weight composite components will provide a new set of solutions for this growing need, both at NASA and the Air Force.
<br> 
<br>Successful completion of the phase I program will demonstrate feasibility of the innovative electro-textile mesh and begin to quantify the potential benefits of Infoscitex's novel involute rib backing structure for deployable antennae. The phase I program will show that the new electro-textile mesh composite mesh has the necessary reflectivity and low PIM performance required of Ka Band antennae. A Phase II program would further refine the new electro-textile composite and permit the fabrication of an antenna demonstration article for deployment and RF testing with our aerospace industry partners.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are a range of commercial applications for more efficient and higher resolution capability satellites. NASA's program, "Studying Earth's Environment from Space (SEES)" is an example in which higher resolution capability for studying our environment would be valuable. High resolution satellite images of Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere have proved to be valuable tools for studying the complexity of Earth's environmental systems. 
<br>In the next series of Lunar and Mars exploration projects at NASA ,the possible antenna applications involve high reliability data rate ground to space communications as well as large data volume communications for future interplanetary missions. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are a range of commercial applications in high-performance aircraft, spacecraft, satellite and missile applications, where size, weight, cost, performance and ease of installation are constraints, readily deployable antennas are not only desirable, but are required. While Composite Electro Textile High Frequency Antennas clearly benefit these applications, flexible lightweight antennas have many other applications where low profile is desirable. This is demonstrated in the expanding use of wireless technologies like cellular phones, GPS, Bluetooth, and WiFi.

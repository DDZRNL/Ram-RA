<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA and DoD are seeking economical and high-performance bipropellant thrusters for various applications. These goals cannot be achieved using the silicided C103 chambers in current use. Ultramet has developed and successfully demonstrated carbon fiber-reinforced zirconium carbide (C/ZrC) and carbon fiber-reinforced zirconium-silicon carbide (C/Zr-Si-C) ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) for use in liquid propellant applications up to 4200<SUP>o</SUP>F. Although the density of these CMCs is less than that of C103, further reducing overall weight is desired with a target goal of 2.6 g/cm3. Carbon/carbon (C/C) is widely used because of its light weight and high specific strength at elevated temperatures. However, adequate long-term protection of C/C is the limiting factor for its use in liquid propellant propulsion components. Ultramet will combine the light weight of C/C and the ultrahigh temperature oxidation resistance of C/Zr-Si-C CMCs in a unique laminate composite. This system will possess an overall density that is similar to C/SiC while increasing the operating temperature to 4000<SUP>o</SUP>F in liquid propulsion applications. Net-shape fabrication of CMC-lined C/C combustion chambers will be accomplished by adapting an innovative variant of Ultramet's melt infiltration technology.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed materials concept will apply to many NASA applications, including hot gas components for liquid propulsion applications. The combination of the long-duration oxidation resistance of ultrahigh temperature CMCs with lightweight C/C will also make this system ideal for applications such as surface skin structures in leading edges and thermal protection systems.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Many applications in DoD and DOE systems require lightweight, high strength, high temperature oxidation-resistant structures. DoD applications that use liquid propulsion, such as IHPRPT programs, would benefit from the developments in this project. DOE has significant needs for energy generation and management that could also be targeted.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Catalytic oxidation of contaminants in air and water remains a key unit operation available to NASA. Its advantages include production of high-quality effluents, good microbial control, and extremely low expendable rates. Extensive research by both NASA and industry demonstrates an order of magnitude more activity for catalysts supported on carbon versus any other support.  Carbon supported noble metal catalysts have previously shown susceptibility to physical degradation (due to shear forces and metal leaching) and chemical degradation (by oxidation of solid carbon). Previous studies have demonstrated that at small (bench) scale, physically robust catalysts can be manufactured that could provide a significant advancement in performance. The purpose of this effort is to accomplish several innovations that will allow the catalysts to be produced at a scale that is suitable for direct integration into NASA's water processor hardware.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed technology has immediate application to provide post-processing capabilities in numerous water recovery systems under development. The technology is highly desirable for integration into both  physical/chemical and biological processes. The technology also has applications in contaminant removal from air streams, and has the potential to allow much lower operating temperatures and consequent energy savings in TCCS applications. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A great deal of effort is being committed by industry to develop advanced catalyst support technology.  This technology has been identified by two major industrial polymer and specialty chemical manufacturing companies as having high potential for application to at least five processes with annual product sales in excess of $100M each.  Industry partnership documentation is included in this proposal.

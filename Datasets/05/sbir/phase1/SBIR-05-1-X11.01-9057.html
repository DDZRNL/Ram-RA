<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to develop a Cell/Tissue Culture Radiation Exposure Facility (CTC-REF) to enable radiobiologists to investigate the real-time radiation effects on cells/tissues at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  Up to 18 bioreactors with various types of cells/tissues can be placed in the radiation target area for either short- or long-term radiation exposure.  Samples can be taken and fixed automatically at desired time points on site during exposure to the ion beam.  Specimens within the bioreactors can also be moved from the target area to nearby biology laboratories for investigation of delayed radiation effects using a culture transport system that maintains the proper culture environment during specimen transport.  The concept for CTC-REF is an evolution and extension of the hardware already developed by Payload Systems for other space life sciences applications.  The main advantages of CTC-REF over currently available hardware are:  higher sample throughput, automatic sampling and fixation during and after radiation exposure, and accommodation of long-duration, low dose radiation experiments. 
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed CTC-REF could improve the efficiency and throughput of radiobiology studies at NSRL significantly with a fully automated culture protocol operation including sample fixation, culture subcultivation, etc.  The CTC-REF will support both short and long term radiation exposure studies..  A variety of cell/tissue cultures, including mammalian, plant, microbial cells, and tissues, both in suspension and attachment culture modes could be supported in CTC-REF, making CTC-REF a universal tool for NASA radiobiology research at the cell/tissue level.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Automated bioreactors are used throughout the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.  The technology that is utilized by CTC-REF sits in a unique niche, between low-volume, high throughput automated systems used primarily in drug discovery, and large volume systems used in actual bioproduction.  The underlying technologies in the proposed work therefore can be used in a wide range of ground-based biotechnology and pharmaceutical applications, including the optimization of cell/tissue culture processes and media, selection of cell strains, high throughput drug screening at the cell/tissue level, etc.

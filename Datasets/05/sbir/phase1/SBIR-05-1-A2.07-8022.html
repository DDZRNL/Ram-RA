<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A robust flow control method promising significantly increased performance and virtual shape control for natural laminar flow (NLF) sections is proposed using a novel momentum porting concept.  Significant aerodynamic, systems, and control benefits are possible through the integration of virtual aerodynamic shaping technology into modern aircraft.  Virtual aerodynamic shaping involves using flow control technology to manipulate the flow field to achieve a desired result regardless of the geometry.  A high-payoff approach to significantly increased air vehicle performance is the use of a novel momentum porting concept for the virtual shaping of extended run natural laminar flow sections.  The objective of this research is to incorporate a robust and simple tangential pulsed jet blowing system that requires no external air to design and virtually shape an extended natural laminar flow section offering radical performance enhancement in the form of increased lift-to-drag and maximum lift.  Additionally, the system will produce a wing design enabling a hinge-less, full-span virtual shaping capability which can be used for fully pilot reactive roll control, span load tailoring, and gust load alleviation.  The system will provide significantly enhanced performance for the air vehicle throughout the entire flight envelope.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed virtual shaping natural laminar flow technology has significant potential application in several NASA programs. The virtual shaping system could be fielded in several NASA aircraft unmanned systems, including UAVs, high-altitude long-endurance remotely operated aircraft (HALE-ROA) for reconnaissance, and Mars exploratory aircraft.  NASA designers will be eager to exploit the advantages of the virtual shaping technology coupled with realizable pilot reactive flow control.  The technology developed in the program can be applied to several other active flow control areas.  The system will be applicable throughout NASA's high altitude sensor and UAV aviation community.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The commercialization potential for advanced, high performance airfoils, designed with a reliable and robust active flow control system is quite good.  By using Rolling Hills Research's new design approach coupled with realizable pilot reactive flow control, designers of new air vehicles will be able to take advantage of virtual shaping for unconventional designs.  The technology developed in the program can be applied to several other active flow control areas.  The air vehicle industry will be eager to exploit the advantages of robust active flow control technology.  Both commercial and military air vehicle designers will find the technology extremely appealing, allowing significant commercialization potential.  The system will be applicable across a wide range of platforms, including high flying UAV type aircraft and sensor platforms and smaller, mid-range UAVs.

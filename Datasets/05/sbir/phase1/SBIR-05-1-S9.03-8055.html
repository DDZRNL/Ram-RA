<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In response to NASA's need for a 3D virtual reality environment providing scientific data visualization without special user devices, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes a new Holographic Image Plane Projection Integral (HIPPI) 3D display that projects real moving (video rate) 3D color images in air.  These 3D images will appear to a viewer as real, opaque (hidden line obscuration), volumetric 3D images over a wide look-around field-of-view (180 to 360 deg.) with high-fidelity realism.  The proposed HIPPI-3D display consists of a high-speed, high-resolution, full-color projector, a spinning beam scanner, beam-forming optics, and a lightweight, transparent, spatially multiplexed (thin strip) off-axis reflective holographic projection screen.  By projecting 2D perspective views of a 3D object, via the strip hologram, and by scanning multiple strips at 30 Hz, a multiplanar integral volume 3D image is created in the air in front of the curved screen.  The screen and the projector can be set up and disassembled very quickly.  In Phase I, POC will conduct a detailed feasibility study by analytical design supported by experimental verification, and a proof-of-concept demonstration setup.  Phase II will focus on optimizing the system design and component technologies to complete a fully operational prototype.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed HIPPI-3D display system will primarily benefit modeling and simulation for scientific studies of earth and planetary systems.  It can also benefit real-time telepresence, remote space exploration, and EVA applications, space flight training, flight navigation, and spacecraft and space station design.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The HIPPI-3D display system will create a more inviting and pleasant virtual reality environment for simulation, training, and entertainment.  It can be used for simulation and training for government and civilian personnel in areas such as commercial airplane flight simulation, flight control and monitoring, scientific modeling, medical imaging, engineering design, home entertainment and arcade games, and remote-controlled robot telepresence.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
To address the NASA need for a miniature pressure-leak sensor, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Microelectromechanical System-based Internally Unpowered Sensor (MEMIUS).  Fabrication of MEMIUS involves integration of a small MEMS piezoresistive sensor with proprietary miniature electronics and a novel wireless power transfer mechanism for device power-up and data read-out for a miniature footprint (2 cm x 2 cm x 1 cm, < 20 g weight).  MEMIUS can be applied to both nonshielding and metal alloy shielding containers by utilizing inductive coupling with a small, efficient antenna, or a dual-band sensor antenna mounted on metal with a feed-through capacitor.  MEMIUS represents an accurate pressure-leak sensor (~0.01 mbar) with no-battery on board electronics.  It operates at low-temperatures with remote and efficient wireless power transfer capabilities at variable distances (1-10 m).  These specifications are critical to the NASA search for an extremely rugged power efficient pressure sensor less than 5 cu. cm operating from -70 deg. C to +20 deg. C.  The proposed MEMIUS thus solves the problems of weight, size, power efficiency, shielding, and electro-magnetic interference.  The Phase I effort will demonstrate MEMIUS feasibility, and confirm its ruggedness and sensitivity.  In Phase II POC will develop an advanced MEMIUS prototype.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Potential applications of the MEMIUS wireless sensor system for NASA will be in situ monitoring of spacecraft structure and integrity, and gas monitoring of in-flight and on-the-ground systems.  Since MEMSs can be easily redesigned, other applications include high-temperature and pressure analysis of propulsion systems and chemical mixtures, GPS, and acceleration assessment.  Coupled with wireless and external power-up, MEMIUS will be particularly valuable in enhancing the reliability of manned aerospace platforms.  Other NASA applications of MEMIUS are automation and diagnostics of satellites and rockets, and sensor networks for analysis of new materials/substances.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The MEMIUS compact pressure-leak sensor has significant applications for commercial aircraft, ships, automobiles, gas turbines, the oil and gas industry, and industrial machine processing.  Because of its robustness and small size, MEMIUS will be useful in medical sensing (blood pressure analyzers or gas-monitoring capnography), for environmental control (at nuclear waste or chemical sites), and even in home safety systems or to monitor appliances.  The successful demonstration of wireless power transfer will lead to a new generation of sensor networks, greatly enhancing sensor capabilities, especially for recently adopted unified data/voice/image telecommunication networks.

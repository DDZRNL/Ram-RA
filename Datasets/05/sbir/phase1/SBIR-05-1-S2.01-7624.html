<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The present proposal describes  the development of an adaptive Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS), or "Snapshot" spectrometer which can "instantaneously" capture a full 3D data cube. The technology is applicable to hyperspectral imaging for remote sensing of extra-terrestrial planetary bodies and deep space objects. The snapshot capability of the technology makes it possible to capture transient events otherwise inaccessible with conventional pushbroom or whiskbroom imagers. The adaptive component of the innovation is a liquid crystal spatial light modulator which replaces the standard computer generated hologram in this technology. As such it can be rapidly tuned at KHz rates for optimal performance in real time improving the signal to noise ratio and data cube image reconstruction.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The potential benefits to NASA of the proposed technology lie in the areas of planetary hyperspectral imaging remote sensing, deep space hyperspectral imaging, transient event solar physics and earth based hyperspectral imaging. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercial applications include: Chemical imaging in microbiology, medical science, thermal imaging and remote sensing

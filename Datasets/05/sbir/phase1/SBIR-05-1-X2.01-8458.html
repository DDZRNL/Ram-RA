<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
High performance silicone coatings are desired for flexible fabrics used in several space and consumer applications.  For instance, the total weight of silicone coatings that are used on Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) airbags can be reduced by improving their thermal stability and mechanical properties.  The proposed program focuses on developing advanced silicone coatings by working with a manufacturer of coated and laminated fabrics for industrial and general-purpose applications.  In Phase I, we will develop coating formulations, deposit coatings on a few different types of fabrics, and characterize the coatings for various properties that are required for airbag applications.  Additionally, plans for commercialization and scale-up will be developed during Phase I for implementation in Phase II, so that the product can be manufactured and marketed in Phase III.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed silicone coating technology will help to reduce the coating weight on airbags used for MER applications while maintaining or increasing the seam strength.  This generic technology may also be utilized in a broad range of space-related flexible fabric applications, including inflatable space structures, parachutes and space suits.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The silicone coating technology that is being developed in this program has immense potential in industrial textile coatings that are used in various sectors, including manufacturing and processing, transportation, construction, sports and leisure, and personal and property protection.  For example, transportation applications, such as airbags, inflatable boats, interior trim and lining, convertible tops, truck covers and lifejackets, need coatings with high abrasion resistance and durability, high chemical resistance, fire resistance, high thermal stability, and good tear strength.

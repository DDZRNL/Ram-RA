<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Recent advances in ontology development support a rich description of entities that are modeled within a domain and how these entities relate to each other. However, even with ontology information, interoperability of a (sub-) system with other systems remains a serious issue. Interoperability issues may arise when two sub-systems that had not been designed as a unit must now work together. Interoperability issues also arise when extensions to a sub-system result in conflicts with the remainder of the system. In this work, we target (sub-) systems pertinent to advanced life support that are developed using software agent technology. Our innovation is to develop an ontology-aware meta-model to support designers and developers in exposing the information that must be captured in order to achieve the goal of 'designing for interoperability, extensibility, and re-use'. Additionally, the meta-model will be integrated into the agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) design process. Even beyond development of the meta-model and methodology for coupling into the design process, we propose to develop tool support so that the meta-model can be easily utilized within the design process. The success of this innovative meta-model, process, and tool, will support agent-based software re-use and rapid, trouble-free integration of upgraded sub-system components.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
 IAI's proposed effort is relevant to any NASA applications that involve agent ?based system design. Our work involves not only ontology-aware meta-model development and improvements on the agent ?oriented design process to include ontology inputs, but also tool development. As such, it supports NASA needs for quickly developing, verifying, extending, and integrating agent systems built for any application that requires autonomy. A compelling example of such applications is the Advanced Life Support system for space exploration.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Recently, IAI has released its commercial software agent platform, CybeleProTM.  As a result of the work we are proposing to do in this SBIR effort, IAI will be able to develop a new ontology- aware, interoperability supporting tool for design and development of software agent systems.  We plan to develop this tool (MASI) so that it can be used in conjunction with our soon-to-be-commercialized DIVA tool that supports agent protocol development and verification. We will package MASI as a 'plug-in' Eclipse, a popular freeware integrated development environment.  MASI will be part of and enhance our CybeleProTM. product line.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
To address NASA needs for quiet crew volumes in a space habitat, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Adaptive Intelligent Ventilation Noise Control (AIVNC) system to reduce acoustic noise and vibration inside the crew living quarters.  The proposed AIVNC is based on multifrequency active patches as a thin-skin-type actuator inside the ventilation system, and an intelligent adapting module instantly and continuously suppresses broadband noise in crew rest areas.  The AIVNC active adapting module provides actuation signals to the multifrequency active patches by means of real-time intelligent adaptation to time-varying noise sources.  The AIVNC multiple-modal actuation array targeting different frequency ranges enables users to perform fast active adaptation for acoustic noise suppression in a space habitat with an easy retrofit capability.  In Phase I POC will demonstrate both the feasibility of AIVNC by testing active actuation patches, and an intelligent adapting model including an optimized system configuration and methodology.  In Phase II POC plans to implement AIVNC into a fast, compact, standalone board with a complete actuator subsystem for precise acoustical control.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
As an effective means of controlling structural/acoustic noise, POC's AIVNC adaptive active control technology will have myriad NASA space applications in addition to habitat noise suppression.  The AIVNC system can be incorporated, for example, into the acquisition, targeting, and pointing stabilizer to reduce structural and acoustic noise/vibration, including aerodynamic noise such as future civil tiltrotor noise, and both rotary and fixed-wing aircraft noise for UAVs; space applications such as SBL, ABL, space-based mirrors; high-altitude balloon experiments; and advanced high-energy lasers.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Our AIVNC technology can address a wide range of large, exceptionally rich, and diverse markets in the aerospace industry, including cabin and cockpit noise cancellation and fuselage vibration.  Because of its flexibility and adaptability, an intelligent active control system based on AIVNC technology can be implemented into any noise or vibration controller.  It will allow aeroacoustic noise in civilian aircraft and exterior noise during takeoff and landing to be suppressed, and will reduce fan discharge noise propagation.

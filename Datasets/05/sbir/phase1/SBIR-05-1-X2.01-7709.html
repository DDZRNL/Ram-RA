<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This SBIR proposal is to establish a platform technology of space durable thermally/electrically conductive fabrics for space environment applications.  The fabrics are based on nanoengineered fibers and yarns under development at NanoTex Corp.  With increased emphasis on long term manned space missions with limited resources, there is increased need for efficient passive thermal control systems. Furthermore, the proposed fabrics are multifunctional as they will have improved strength and tenacity, designed electrical conductivity, and greater thermal stability.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This innovative manufacturing technology will provide lightweight high-strength, thermally conductive textiles that can also carry electrical charge for space-based applications. Other NASA areas such as: weight/cost reduction of spacecraft systems; radiation shielding; nanoscale devices; electronics and thermal management would benefit from increase nanotube composite availability.
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The initial applications will focus on high value added components for the $10 billion advanced composites market segment (aerospace/ defense, semiconductor, sport) and niche applications requiring minimal material such as electrostatic dissipative films and thermal management.

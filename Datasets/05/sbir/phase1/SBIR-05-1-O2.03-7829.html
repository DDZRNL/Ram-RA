<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovation will utilize a small network of remote sensors to perform Radio Interferometry (RI) and Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) techniques to survey, identify and locate Radio Frequency (RF) energy signatures within a given geographic area such as a launch range or other strategic area.  The survey mission will use radio interferometry techniques to create RF "images" of the surveyed area.  These images will show the locations of all RF activity within an area.  While an area is secure, a set of images will be captured and averaged to establish the nominal RF baseline for that area.  Once the baseline is established, real-time RF surveys will be instantly compared to the nominal baseline to detect the existence of RF spectral anomalies.  The TDOA and RI techniques used to establish the RF images will determine the precise location of any spectral anomaly source so that it can be quickly and cost effectively identified and mitigated.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Range Surveillance would be a primary use for the RI/TDOA system.  It greatly increases the speed and efficiency of insuring a clear and safe range by quickly identifying and locating any sources of radio emissions.  The system will identify inadvertent emissions such as a boater who has wondered into a secure area as well as intentional hostile threats like someone attempting to Jam or intercept communications.
<br>  
<br>Personnel Tracking RI/TDOA system could be used to locate or identify NASA personnel during operations.  If personnel were given a small RF beacon the RI/TDOA system could track personnel whereabouts during critical operations or improve security by identifying people in areas who do not have proper access.
<br>
<br>Asset Tracking- the RI/TDOA system could be employed to track certain assets as described above or it can be used as a kind of passive radar to track and locate objects (equipped with a small RF beacon) like the solid rock boosters during reentry and recovery. 
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Interference mitigation around commercial airports is a problem that the RI/TDOA system could help resolve and locate sources of interference that are a potential threat to safe commercial flight operations.  Uninterrupted communication between flight crews and ground operations is critical to the FAA's mission of safe flight operations.  
<br>
<br>Personnel Tracking in prisons and corrections institutions can be accomplished with the RI/TDOA system by placing RF beacons on inmates and tracking individuals movements.  The RI/TDOA system could be employed to alert prison staff when members of rival gangs are gathered together allowing for intervention prior to any trouble.
<br> 
<br>RF Surveillance along US Boarder is another application for the RI/TDOA system.  The system can be deployed along a boarder region where RF emissions of individuals attempting to illegally cross the boarder can be identified and located significantly improving the boarder patrols responsiveness to potential illegal boarder crossings.

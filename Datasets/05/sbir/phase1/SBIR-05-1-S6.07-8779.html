<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
As the need for thermal control technology becomes more demanding Micro-Channel Embedded Pulsating Heat Pipes (ME-PHPs) represents a sophisticated and enabling solution.  Currently laboratory tests indicate that a magnitude jump in thermal conductivity can be expected with ME-PHPs over conventional materials like aluminum and copper.  ME-PHPs will give NASA and the spacecraft community a powerful tool for the thermal control of instruments, detectors, lasers, communication systems, MEMS and power systems.  Especially those requiring tight thermal control to the micro Kelvin levels.  By embedding heat pipes within a plane of a sheet or plate the heat exchanging media can be placed as close as physically possible to the warm source thus maintaining the narrowest possible temperature gradient.  The thermal energy can then be easily transported to any other area within the plane of the sheet for dissipation purposes.  ME-PHPs are stackable and scalable to any thermal load requirement.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
ME-PHPs will be used pervasively for many NASA space borne applications on instruments, electronics, optical systems, detectors and communications systems.  They will easily replace heatsinks, thermal planes, cold walls and some face sheets.  In addition, they could be used for heat spreaders and will enhance current radiator designs.  They can even replace existing conventional heat pipes as a lighter weight alternative.  We also see ME-PHPs being able to provide thermal control in areas where it was not possible before because the ME-PHPs are complete systems.  They can be mounted to a warm source with a form that would allow the condenser to radiant to space to dissipate the thermal load. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
As with the NASA applications many satellite manufacturers and domestic equipment producers will use ME-PHPs to replace heat pipes, heatsinks, thermal planes, cold walls and some face sheets.  They could readily be used for heat spreaders and will enhance current radiator designs.  In commercial electronics they could provide the thermal control for laptop computers and other portable devices.  They could also provide enabling thermal solutions for many airframe applications including radar and weapon systems.

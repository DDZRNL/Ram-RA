<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Exploration of planetary surfaces will require a communication architecture that supports operational capabilities in which fixed and mobile assets on the planetary surface can communicate seamlessly and securely.  
<br>Aeronix understands the issues and believes that the solution lies in the development of radiation tolerant wireless devices that employ the benefits of FPGA technology as an underlying architecture feature.   Aeronix is currently developing two technologies that will be directly leveraged.
<br>?	A FPGA/DSP based enhanced 802.16-2004 wireless LAN air-to-ground solution targeted for DoD applications with peak throughput of  65.5 Mbps. 
<br>?	A Radiation Tolerant FPGA based, NSA Crypto Mod compliant  cryptographic module for space.  
<br>The specific problem addressed by this Aeronix Phase I SBIR effort is to identify enhancements to the 802.16-Terrestrial architecture and design required to meet the harsh environmental and radiation conditions expected in space and on planetary exploration missions.  The new radiation tolerant communications solution will be identified as 802.16 RadT and will have operational capabilities of 65.5 Mbps / 70 miles.   Additionally, this SBIR will address the unique requirements for Information Assurance and Type 1 crypto for classified command, control, and data requirements via integration of radiation tolerant crypto.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Potential NASA applications include spaced-based wireless networks, lunar-based wireless networks, and Mars-based wireless networks.  Usage models include point-to-multipoint and Mesh networks for communication between base stations, mobile rovers, mobile humans, and sensors. Equipments supported via this SBIR include base station access points, subscriber stations, wireless bridges, and wireless NICs for radiation environments.
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
IEEE 802.16 (i.e. WiMax) is an industry-lead standard that is being targeted broadly for metropolitan area networks and last mile applications with extended range and high-speed data requirements.  Aeronix is investing in 802.16 PHY and MAC intellectual property to address markets such as DoD, NASA, and commercial.  Award of this SBIR will extend the capabilities.
<br>
<br>Commercial applications include applications that require Aeronix extended Doppler and rotor craft communication capabilities.  Examples include air-to-ground commercial wireless LAN's (such as air-to-ground Internet access) and ground-to-ground high speed mobile applications (automobiles).  Traditional 802.16 last mile applications are a market potential market.

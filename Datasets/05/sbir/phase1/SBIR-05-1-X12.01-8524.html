<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to develop and demonstrate a small, gravity independent, vapor compression refrigeration system using a linear motor compressor which effectively addresses the efficiency, lubrication, scalability, and/or longevity issues limiting current space flight refrigeration systems.  Unlike previous and currently used thermoelectric, Stirling, oil-free reciprocating and diaphragm compressor systems, the linear compressor will provide very high efficiency, excellent capacity modulation, nearly unlimited scalability, and very long life all due to the hydrostatic bearing of the linear compressor and use of the reverse-Rankine cycle.  The linear can also readily be developed as a single unit two-stage compressor for higher lift applications.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
We see this linear motor compressor technology as having excellent application potential within NASA as the prior art is very limiting in efficiency, and life expectancy.  Once developed, this technology will be far superior to the current thermoelectric and oil-free reciprocating technology used in many micro-gravity applications by NASA today.  Current applications include food refrigeration and freezing (ISS), scientific sample cooling and freezing (ISS and Shuttle), and crew cooling (Shuttle).  Developing applications include water heating and cooling and vapor compression enhanced water distillation.  We also feel that once the linear motor refrigeration technology is ready, new applications will develop that were not practical with the prior art.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The world-wide market for a low-cost, high efficiency variable capacity compressor for refrigeration is counted in the low ten's of millions per year.  Further, higher cost units will have a niche in specialty markets, such as solar and will lead the way for initial commercialization.  Almost every major refrigerator compressor manufacturer is seeking to provide variable capacity via variable speed reciprocating type compressors.  The only exception is LG in Korea, which is using a linear compressor in its side by side refrigerator freezer model.  If we are able to achieve good performance and low production cost on this linear compressor, the market would be extremely large.

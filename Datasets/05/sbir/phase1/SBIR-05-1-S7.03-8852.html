<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Low power, robust communications protocols such as IEEE 802.15.4/Zigbee have made the concept of smart sensor networks attractive across many applications. These systems promise portable, networked, wireless, sensor suites capable of monitoring and controlling environments as needed. Theseus Logic and MachineTalker will provide NASA with a rapidly deployable, wireless, intelligent, sensor system based on their proprietary enabling technologies, and their experience in wireless sensor systems for enhanced shipping container security.
<br>1.	Communications based on MachineTalkers<SUP>REG</SUP> that providing self
<br>        configuring, self-healing ad hoc networks with minimum
<br>        intervention.
<br>2.	Low power radio protocols such as the IEEE 802.15.4/Zigbee
<br>        standard. Gateways to reach a central monitoring/decision
<br>        authority.
<br>3.	Secure communications with personal identification numbers (PIN)
<br>        assigned to each sensor node to ensure data security.
<br>4.	Signal processing based on clockless logic providing on demand,
<br>        ultra low power, data driven, processing and low noise/EMI that
<br>        maintains performance of sensors and on-chip RF/analog circuitry.
<br>5.	A Simple Machine Management Protocol<SUP>REG</SUP> (SMMP<SUP>REG</SUP>) controlling both
<br>        sensors and communications. This also manages power consumption
<br>        of the system. 
<br>6.	Multi-sensor data fusion to reduce false alarm rates.
<br>7.	A modular architecture allowing optimization of the sensor suite,
<br>        and including features such as GPS location, and biometric
<br>        identification.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Intelligent, wireless, sensor suites that are networked into local area and satellite communications will provide a capability for NASA to gather information and reliably distribute it from a broad range of systems including field personnel and robotic platforms. These sensor systems will provide location and time stamped data that is made secure with biometric identification of the users, and encrypted communication links. This will provide NASA with a new capability in terms of monitoring and controlling the environment.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Wireless sensor systems are rapidly being deployed, in a broad range of markets such as Industrial Controls, Home Automation, Medical Telemonitoring, Homeland Security and Digital Battlefield. In all these situations the capability to reliably provide real time monitoring and control though secure systems is vital.
<br>Ad hoc communications systems are providing a new capability for first responders in emergency situations where the communications infrastructure has failed, or does not exist.

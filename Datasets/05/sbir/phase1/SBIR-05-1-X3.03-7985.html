<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The innovation addressed in this proposal is Sprayable Thermal Insulation for Cryogenic Tanks, or STICT.  This novel system could be applied in either an automated or manual spraying process, with much less sensitivity to process chemistry and environmental parameters than cur-rent spray-on foam insulation (SOFI) products like BX-265, while providing better insulation performance.  The resulting material would form an aerodynamically smooth, uniform coating with better cohesion and significantly lower thermal conductivity.  This would allow thinner layers of insulation which, when combined with greater material strain-to-failure, will eliminate the generation of in-flight debris.  In this way, the proposed CryoGel insulation can render future space transportation systems safer and more reliable.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
STICT would replace some of the spray-on foam insulation (SOFI) products used on launch vehicles employing cryogenic propellants.  In this application, it would exhibit higher thermal performance and mechanical durability than competing systems.  Most importantly, it would minimize in-flight debris shedding, thereby improving the safety and reliability of US space transportation.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
STICT would compete against polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foams anywhere consistency, high quality, and low thermal conductivity are valued.  Some examples of this would be subsea oil and gas pipelines, fuel cell systems, and LNG transport ships.

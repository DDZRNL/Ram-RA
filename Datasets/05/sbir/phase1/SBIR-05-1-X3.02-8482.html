<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Li-ion batteries with  specific energy >180 Wh/kg, calendar life (>15years), and a wide operating temperature range (-60<SUP>o</SUP>C to 60<SUP>o</SUP>C) are crucial for the deployment of exploration vehicles such as rovers, landers, and penetraters as well as for low temperature burst power communication. The sub-ambient conductivity and liquid range of present rechargeable Li-ion battery electrolytes severely limit low temperature use. Co-solvents freezing as low as -132oC and Li salts with highly delocalized anions, enabling high degree of ionic dissociation in low dielectric environments provide us with a unique opportunity to develop non aqueous electrolytes for the low temperature with ionic conductivities well above 10-4 Scm-1.  Our aim is to use these novel electrolytes as a direct substitute for the present electrolytes without affecting Li-ion battery performance or life during normal operation and access as least half the rated capacity at  -60<SUP>o</SUP>C and 1/2C discharge rate. Working in collaboration with a leading developer of Li-ion batteries in Phase I, our low temperature electrolyte formulations will be evaluated in Li test cells containing anodes and cathodes used in commercial scale battery manufacture. In Phase II, electrolyte composition  will be further optimized and prototype batteries will be fabricated and tested for performance.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Robotic landers, rovers and penetrators play an important role in modern planetary explorations enabling mission of enormous scientific value without risking the lives of astronauts.   Rechargeable Li-ion batteries in these spacecrafts are required to perform efficiently over a broad temperature range extending close to ?60oC. The electrolytes being developed will find exclusive use in these batteries.  They will also be useful for batteries employed in cold-climate terrestrial applications, high altitude balloons, and applications where non flammability of electrolytes is essential for safety of Li-ion rechargeable batteries. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
We anticipate that flame retardant character of the proposed electrolytes will improve the safety of all Li-ion cells by reducing the reactivity between electrolyte and the electrode materials in the "charged" state. This may allow relaxation of stringent and costly safety related controls without increasing risk and, greatly reduce damage from cell venting by preventing flames, which could lead to injuries or collateral damage. Particularly sensitive applications include portable telephones, laptop computers, video cameras, and heads up displays, night vision equipment and batteries used in enclosed spaces e.g. underwater vehicles or underground bunkers.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
An electrochemical reactor is proposed by MicroCell Technologies, LLC to electrochemically reduce carbon dioxide to oxygen. In support of NASA's advanced life support processes and human exploration missions, recovering oxygen from carbon dioxide is important since oxygen resupply is not a viable option. The proposed process is based on using a low temperature molten salt to selectively adsorb carbon dioxide from the ambient and reducing it to an oxide ion and carbon monoxide. The oxide ion is subsequently oxidized to oxygen. This carbon dioxide removal and oxygen generator may be used by NASA to provide oxygen for cabin crew life support or for propellant generation on Mars as a part of the In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) process. During the Phase I project, we will demonstrate the electrochemical reactor using pure carbon dioxide and using low concentrations of carbon dioxide in air.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Potential NASA applications of the proposed technology include carbon dioxide reduction on board International Space Station and for long duration exploration missions to Mars. Elements of the proposed technology may be used in other electrochemical reactor schemes for generating propellants as a part of NASA's In Situ Resource Utilization program.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercial applications of the proposed technology may be found in processing or sequestering carbon dioxide from the ambient environment. Additional commercial applications may be found in sensors for carbon dioxide in air detection using components of the base technology developed here.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NovaSol proposes to develop an advanced hyperspectral imaging system for earth science missions named BRASS (Broadband Advanced Spectral System). BRASS combines state-of-the-art, existing NASA detector technology and proven electronics with a novel spectrometer design to provide a compact instrument that covers the full wavelength range from 0.4 to 5 ?m. Applications for such an instrument range from vegetation characterization and environmental assessment to mineral mapping and measurements of trace gases and aerosols, fully supporting important research goals of NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD). 
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The utility of broadband hyperspectral imaging has been demonstrated by the frequent deployment of NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). A simplified, single detector instrument expanding the wavelength range from 2.5 ?m to 5 ?m will provide an extended application range while improving the cost effectiveness of hyperspectral airborne data acquisition. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
It is expected that the scientific community outside NASA, such as universities and other research organizations, will find widely accept BRASS as a very useful research tool.

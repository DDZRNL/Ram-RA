<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The complexity of the current launch platforms makes their maintenance and operation very costly. In order to successfully design the next generation platforms, it is necessary to understand the complex, multi-disciplinary environments that exists during a launch sequence. The proposed research and development effort will use state of the art techniques in the various fields involved to compute the virboacoustic environment during launch. The physical insight gained from these models will help guide the design of a new cost-effective launch platform. In particular, the problem of unsteady turbulent flows will be addressed using a newly developed turbulence modeling approach known as partially averaged Navier-Stokes (or PANS). Using PANS nearfield results, the acoustic farfield will be obtained through the use of acoustic analogies. In addition, various passive and active control techniques will be assessed to effectively reduce noise levels in the vicinity of the launch platform.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
It is well-known that a very harsh vibroacoustic environment exits during launch. This environment could be responsible for structural fatigue and failure, debris entrainment and impact on launch vehicles and damage to payloads. Therefore a good understanding of the various physical phenomena taking place during launch is necessary in order to design cost-effective, safe and reliable future launch systems. It is this goal that we strive to achieve through the proposed research work. The benefit to NASA will be significant in both cost, efficiency and most of all safety.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed research and development effort will benefit greatly the commercial launch area and companies such as Boeing and many others will reap te benefit. The outcome of the proposed work will reduce the complexity of the current launch plateforms and hence reduce the launch cost. In addition, many small and cost effective launch sites will be developed around the country. The single most important element that will be gained from the proposed effort will be increased launch safety, which is priceless.

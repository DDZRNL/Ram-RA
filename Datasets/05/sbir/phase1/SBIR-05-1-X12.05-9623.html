<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Current interests within the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) foresee extension of exploratory space missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.  Realization of these targets will require development of a range of advanced technologies including life support systems.  Food represents one of the most crucial components of life support, as the ability to supply safe, nutritious and organoleptically pleasing meals to space flight personnel for the duration of their mission will be of paramount importance in maintaining  crew functionality and morale.  In this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, Infoscitex Corporation will develop an advanced barrier film, ElastiGlass, which will enable 3-to-5 year shelf life, with the added benefit of reducing the logistic burdens associated with waste handling, and minimizing package weight and storage space requirements.  Follow-on efforts will focus on the development of food preparation and packaging processes that will ensure near zero oxygen content within the sealed food pouch.  Specific benefits of ElastiGlass thermostabilized food pouches will include: increased shelf-life (3 to 5 years), reduced weight, reduced waste, zero metal content, and optical transparency.  
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed food packaging solution will find use in any application where extended food shelf-life is of interest.  The technology will be of significant interest for manned expeditions to the Moon, Mars, and other bodies within the solar system.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed food packaging solution may find interest in military field-feeding operations (i.e. MRE and UGR).  The zero metal content of the packaging solution may increase interests within the DoD, as the increased energy content of the packaging will increase potential energy output of waste-to-energy conversion technologies currently under consideration. Civilian applications may include emergency response food stockpile and personal emergency food supplies.

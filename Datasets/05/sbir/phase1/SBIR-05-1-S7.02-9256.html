<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This project develops Web based distributed image analysis system processing the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to provide decision makers or non-specialists with high-quality, environmental scientific information and coastal predictive tools. The system provides the underpinnings for ecosystem-based environmental awareness and management in coastal regions, such as, sea surface temperature, sea surface height and ecological forecasts, etc. The Web Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is utilized to build remote intelligent components in advanced applications server (JBoss), which implement MODIS image processing to extract useful features to identify events of interest. The AGNC innovative neural network is employed as internal knowledge representation and classification engine to map image feature vector to internal numerical presentation. The initial prototype of the system is given as example demonstration.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
An innovative microwave system is proposed for the continuous production of medical grade water.  This system will utilize direct absorption of microwave radiation to rapidly heat potable water well above normal autoclave conditions, achieving equivalent microbial lethality in much shorter times. High thermal efficiencies will be gained by placement of the microwave antennae directly in the flowing water stream allowing very efficient volumetric coupling of microwaves.  The sterilized water stream will then pass through a regenerable endotoxin filter to achieve water for injection (WFI) purity standards. This filter will remove endotoxins by selective adsorption.  The combined system will enable the energy efficient and practical production of WFI aboard spacecraft or planetary habitats under microgravity or hypogravity conditions with a low equivalent system mass (ESM).  In the Phase I research, sterilization chambers and endotoxin filters will be designed, assembled, and tested. The Phase II program will deliver a fully instrumented, computer-controlled system with a low ESM whose performance is well documented.  This technology will form the basis for multiple applications in commercial sterilization markets.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The NASA application of the advanced microwave based medical grade water system will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future long duration exploration objectives such as a lunar mission, lunar base, Mars transit or Mars base.  The primary application will be in support of medical and experimental use of pharmacological preparations, which must be reconstituted on-site.  Secondarily, this device can be used to produce WFI for use during medical emergencies.  It is anticipated that numerous other uses will be found for this system within NASA.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The technology may be employed in small-scale systems for efficient production of sterile water in the laboratory, or in a range of larger scales to meet various industrial requirements.  Lightweight and portable systems for production of WFI could also be rapidly deployed at remote locations, and during humanitarian emergencies or military actions, where logistics must be minimized.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
ITN Energy Systems, Inc., in collaboration with Hamilton Sundstrand, proposes to design and develop multifunctional fibers for use in energy generation, energy storage, and thermal control controls for extravehicular mobility units (EMU). Next generation spacesuit concepts, such as the Chameleon Suit , offer the ability to dramatically extend extravehicular activity (EVA) mission time and space beyond anything currently available today. Revolutionary advances in technologies, including energy generation and storage as well as climate controls, are required to eliminate the reliance on expendables that currently limit missions with today's EVA.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The MFF technologies are well suited for next generation EMU concepts, such as the Chameleon Suit. The integration of advanced technology components has the ability to drastically increase mission time and space by enabling the space suit to become an active part of a system that interacts with the local environment rather than acting as a passive barrier. This transition, however, requires the complete removal of reliance on expendable technologies for power, thermal control, life support systems, etc. 
<br>
<br>ITN's MFF are an ideal solution to many of these challenges. The integration of these functions directly into the suit enables greater responsiveness in the suit. For instance, current suits only allow the body to interact with the environment aver about 1/2 to 1/3 of the roughly 2 square meters of available surface area. MFF offer greater potential to increase suit capability with minimal impact on the mass and volume, flexibility, and other desirable functions.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The desire to create clothing that increases the user's ability to interact with the environment without sacrificing comfort, style, or functionality also has many applications in commercial markets. The growth of wearable electronics for health monitoring, communications, or entertainment functions also require power and comfort control that could benefit from the proposed technologies. One can imagine similar integration of functions for military markets where MFF are integrated into tents, micro air vehicles, high altitude air ships, tactical satellites and other remote sites that require power for communications and data management.

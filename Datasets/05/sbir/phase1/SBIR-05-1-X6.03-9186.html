<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Miniaturization of mass spectrometers is restricted almost exclusively by the ability of small vacuum pumps to remove gas loads during operation of the instrument.  Our answer to this dilemma is a specialized interface that focuses a parallel beam of ionized gas molecules through an orifice that is at least 10 times smaller than ever before achieved in a mass spectrometer inlet.  Our recent patent application describes this interface.  Not only can we use this interface to radically reduce the pumping requirements within the mass spectrometer, but it should also enable an unprecedented cooling and focusing of the ion beam.   This in turn will enable attaining mass resolutions of  over ten thousand in a phase I instrument which uses a linear time of flight tube of only 10 cm.  A small overall instrumental footprint (probably 1.5 cubic feet including pumping and electronics) should be attainable in a phase II effort.

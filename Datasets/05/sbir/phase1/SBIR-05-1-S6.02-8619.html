<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The focus of the proposed effort is maximizing the brightness of fiber coupled laser diode pump sources at a minimum cost.  The specific innovation proposed is to challenge the historical choice of a 10mm width for the laser bars used in fiber coupled pump packages and to demonstrate that an alternative bar width can offer higher brightness and lower cost than the current state of the art. We intend to show that the choice of laser bar width, emitter size, and emitter spacing can have a dramatic effect on pump source brightness, and can further have a substantial impact in the package cost.  We propose to demonstrate the capability for a 10X improvement in pump brightness and a 3X reduction in laser diode cost through this investigation.  This innovation will allow for the design and fabrication of ultra high brightness, low cost fiber coupled laser pump packages operating at any wavelength over the span of 635nm to 2000nm. This innovation is relevant for any laser system which uses fiber coupled pump sources, specifically "Novel, high-power laser diodes capable suitable for pumping Holmium-based solid-state lasers" as described in Subtopic S6.02 Lidar Remote Sensing.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The device could be used in all applications that require fiber coupled laser pump sources with high brightness and low cost.  We anticipate that any NASA program which uses fiber lasers, LIDAR systems, and target designators that use fiber coupled laser diode packages would benefit from the improvements in brightness and cost that will come out of these efforts.  This work is independent of the laser diode operating power and wavelength and the results can be applied to any diode product that nLight produces, over the wavelength range of 635 ? 2000nm.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Improvements in brightness and cost would benefit all fiber coupled laser diode packages that nLight produces.  Commercial applications for these devices include direct material processing, LIDAR and target designators, medical instruments, and industrial laser soldering systems.  This work is independent of the laser diode operating power and wavelength and the results can be applied to any diode product that nLight produces, over the wavelength range of 635 ? 2000nm.

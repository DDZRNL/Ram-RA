<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
MetroLaser proposes to design and develop an innovative narrowband tunable IR filter based on the properties of a one-dimensional photonic crystal structure with a resonant cavity. Such a structure can exhibit an ultra-narrow, high-throughput band in the middle of a wide low-transmission stop-band. During Phase I, we will demonstrate experimentally the proof-of-concept for the proposed filter with sub-angstrom bandpass and a tuning range of at least 10 cm-1 in the spectral region around 10 um. We will complete modeling of the functional characteristics, based on the specific features of photonic crystal structures with a resonant cavity, and develop a strategy for building a prototype of the instrument. Fine-tuning of the filter will be accomplished by varying the optical cavity length. The proposed filter is expected to have an acceptance angle of at least 1 degree and an aperture of about 1 inch. During Phase II, the compact prototype module will be demonstrated with an expected tunability range of 10 cm-1 and a bandpass range of 0.1 cm-1. A compact, rugged, monolithic filter architecture will allow this instrument to be incorporated in air- or space-based platforms and provide stable performance in harsh operating environments.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed narrowband tunable bandpass filter will find commercial applications in space-based and airborne multi-spectral imaging and remote sensing systems, including tropospheric chemistry study and atmospheric science. It will expand capabilities for high accuracy spectral measurements within the tunable narrow spectral regions necessary for resolving individual spectral features. Due to its high spectral resolution, wide tunability range, compactness, ruggedness and stability, the proposed filter will allow for innovative solutions in high-resolution spectroscopic instrumentation, especially when portable devices are of interest.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed narrowband tunable IR bandpass filter will expand the capabilities of NASA's Earth-Sun System Division for high spectral resolution and high accuracy measurements of tropospheric, atmospheric, and surface parameters from space and airborne platforms. These include remote sensing capabilities, measurements of climate and meteorological parameters, and terrain mapping.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A ferroelectric non-linear dielectric was recently discovered that, in their film form, possess a number of properties that make it an excellent choice for radiation-hardened electronics, particularly a radiation hardened (total dose hardened and SEE immune) non-volatile (NV) static random access memory (SRAM).  Electrical measurements of these films demonstrated a relatively low dielectric constant (~20), an inherent ability to form a native buffer layer when deposited directly on silicon, and a strong polarization hysteresis effect. These results indicate that this film may be used to replace the two n-channel and two p-channel transistors in a traditional 4-T SRAM latch cell with two n-channel and two p-channel non-linear dielectric field effect transistors (NLDFETs). The threshold voltage hysteresis effect of the NLDFET should achieve full SEU immunity to at least 80MeV-cm2/mg of ionizing radiation, when used in a standard 6-transistor SRAM cell structure, thus have ultra-fast access times (like commercial SRAMs) while offering full non-volatility.  In Phase I we will provide the device proof of concept, then in Phase II build a prototype memory.  Phase III will see commercialization by licensing and sales. The resulting NV-SRAM products have the potential to be orders of magnitude faster than any existing EEPROM or FLASH devices because the nonlinear dielectric film forms a native dielectric with silicon giving the structure resistance to "wear-out" or "data-retention" problems.  Finally, the SMI material is fully compatible with CMOS processing and has been accepted into major commercial silicon fabrication lines as a high-k dielectric for linear applications.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Potential NASA Commercial applications include licensing of 6T SRAM technology to major semiconductor manufacturing companies, radiation hardened high-density SRAM 916 - 32M) and Non-Volatile embedded memory product that operate fast with state-of-the-art microprocessor speeds. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The commercial products derived from this program have the potential to be orders of magnitude faster than any existing EEPROM or FLASH devices because of the employment of the non-linear dielectric, which also give the structure resistance to "wear-out".  Thus the technology can be broadly applied to slicon semiconductor devices in general.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A recently developed mathematical theory has great value for deployable space structures and in situ manufacture of large beams, panels, cylinders and other components.  The new technology offers diverse capacity to design, manufacture, and self-assemble periodically folded sheet material.  The range of materials includes many customized core materials for laminated panels, cellular habitat wall constructions, structural beams, parabolic reflectors, and efficient truss systems that can be packaged ideally as a roll of sheet material and deployed in space by inflation or passive radiation.  The goal of this proposal is to launch the technology by demonstrating the diversity of folding architectures for deployable and in situ manufacture of space structures, and by developing the design and simulation software for distribution to the engineering community.
<br>
<br>To fully illustrate the scope of applying the design methodology for deployable space structures, inventories of the strategy for deployment, the desired laminate geometry, and the folding architectures will be made. By relating the dynamical constraints of these three inventories in a three-axis matrix and then optimizing the found solutions through the software, a diverse scope of deployable structures will be illustrated.  Moreover, proof of concept for a second generation of software operating through new algorithms will be  shown concurrently for space applications and others.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal will generate a comprehensive summary of the applications of this new materials technology to deployable and in situ manufactured space structures.  This summary will give an overview of the architectural structures and deployment strategies available.  Habitats, rigid panels, box beams, I-beams, large rings, large cylinders, large tori for possible space station design and others.  The key advantages are that rolled sheet material transports compactly, the self-assembly, in situ manufacture and deployment strategies are diversely controlled through the algorithms, the sheet material is natural for shells, and many multi-laminate constructions are available.  
<br>
<br>Other applications are in stretchable fabrics, nano-devices, self-correcting parabolic dishes, and self-healing multi-laminate flexible cloth. 
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This new sheet technology applies to paper, metals, polymers, composite cloths, wire meshes, nano sheets, and ceramic filled papers.  The technology is completely scaleable and the structures generated diverse.  Specific applications include cores for stronger corrugated cardboard, protective packaging wrap, high-performance cores replacing honey-comb in airplanes, steel sub-floors in office buildings, nano light boards for high speed processors, crash and vibration absorbing materials in automobiles, composite bridge decks, a particle board substitute, and ceramic filters.

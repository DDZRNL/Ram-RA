<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Nanotechnology which includes carbon nanotubes has the potential to produce materials that exhibit properties beyond those expected from conventional materials which are anticipated to have a profound impact on NASA's future missions.  Graphite fiber composites are multifunctional with high strength to weight ratios which form the basis of many aerospace systems.  The combinations of carbon nanotubes with graphite fibers have the potential to significantly enhance fiber strength; offering significant advantages in multi-functional space flight applications.  A unique approach will be utilized to incorporate carbon nanotubes onto existing graphite fibers to produce exemplary fiber strengths that will be utilized in composites with significantly higher strength to weight ratios.  Nanotube reinforced graphite fibers will be produced and characterized in epoxy composites to demonstrate the expected property enhancements.

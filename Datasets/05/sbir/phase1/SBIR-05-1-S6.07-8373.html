<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Cooling electronic components in the space environment still remains a challenge for thermal engineers. In the current
<br>design practice, copper straps are used to transfer the waste heat from various high-power dissipating components to
<br>the side walls of the electronic box. Another heat transport device then collects the waste heat from the box mounting
<br>plate and carries it the space radiators for rejection. As the heat load of next generation electronics increases at a very
<br>fast rate, a more efficient heat transfer mechanism at the box level must be developed. Loop Heat Pipes (LHP) become
<br>popular heat transport devices for space-based thermal control systems for they are highly reliable and maintenancefree.
<br>Almost all LHPs in service at the present time contain one capillary pump. Thus one LHP provides only a "single
<br>point" heat acquisition. In addition, when redundancy is required for the mission long lifetime, many LHPs are
<br>therefore needed to provide adequate cooling for the electronic components. Miniature LHPs with multiple evaporators
<br>and multiple condensers will solve the aforementioned cooling problem without complicating the integration process.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
With its operational reliability and robustness, the proposed miniature LHP system is perfect for space-based thermal
<br>control at the electronic box level. In addition, it can be used in applications such as high-power electronic cooling or
<br>even in personal protection equipment (helmets, clothing).<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Terrestrial applications include: cooling of sport gears (shoes, ski jackets) and firefighters' protective clothing, laptop
<br>computer thermal management.

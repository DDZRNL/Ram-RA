<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA faces many systems engineering challenges as it seeks to conduct exploration and science missions concurrently.  One such challenge is implementing a repeatable systems engineering process to missions that vary greatly in scale and complexity.  The same process applied to lunar and Mars exploration missions, for example, do not necessarily scale well to Earth science missions.  Existing systems engineering tools do not adequately address this problem.  They tend to be inflexible implementations of a "one size fits all" approach to process, and provide little or no interoperability with other tools used in the system engineer's workflow.  Emergent Space Technologies, Inc. proposes to develop the Systems Engineering Process Realization Toolkit (SE-PRO).  SE-PRO will broaden the capabilities for capturing, communicating, and implementing the systems engineering process, regardless of the size of the mission based on the ability to customize the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) approach to process implementation.  The innovation lies in the intuitive graphical user interface that allows systems engineers to combine processes like CMMI, NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR's), and Goddard Procedural Requirements (GPR's), into a single process that is modifiable by the missions to specify the workflows, team assignments, and output products according to their needs.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Systems Engineering Process Realization Toolkit has numerous applications within NASA.  Process engineering is a fundamental aspect used to achieve the high quality and reliability necessary for realizing NASA's goals.  The key enabler is the fact that the Process Realization Toolkit will not be tied to any specific process and can be applied to processes outside of the system engineering domain.  Processes exist everywhere and this tool when applied properly could help users carry-out a process quickly, when time is a factor.  An application would be to target mission operations, when a satellite operator who has a limited satellite-uplink window needs to perform an operating procedure in response to an anomaly.  This tool could be used to document the steps involved in the procedure, and the organization of the tool would allow operators to quickly find relevant information.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Outside the NASA and aerospace domain, the System Engineering Process Realization Toolkit has broad commercial applications.  Processes are documented and followed all the time in business.  It may be a proposal process, sales call process, manufacturing process, etc.  The market we see for this toolkit are areas where a) access to process must be timely, and b) where the process is very complex or where there are high turnovers in users of the process.  Both these scenarios focus on the ability for this toolkit to timely display information in ways which are meaningful for users.

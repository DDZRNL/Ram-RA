<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
IAI proposes an innovative solution to enable unrestricted flight in low-altitude airspace for small aircrafts This solution includes an L-band RF transceiver-sensor package, which continuously transmit Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) compatible beacons to alert other cooperative aircrafts and ATC ground stations about the UAV's position and intent.  In addition, it uses the reflected beacon signal as a radar signal to detect and track any non-cooperative targets within its effective range.  A multifunctional RF transceiver serves as both the primary radar and secondary surveillance radar (SSR).  The advantage of the proposed sensor package is low-cost, low-power (estimated power consumption < 50 watt) and compatibility with current aviation technologies. This sensor package is coupled with on-board collision avoidance logic and situation awareness display concepts for a remote ground control station.  Simulation-based demonstration ? leveraging IAI's CybelePro<SUP>TM</SUP> agent infrastructure ? is also proposed to exercise the system "end-to-end" and allow for nearly seamless transition to human-in-the-loop evaluation of display concepts.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
One of the applications of NASA-related application for this sensor system is UAV collision avoidance. For UAVs to be more efficient in their increasing applications, they must be integrated into the Air Traffic Control system that currently only controls piloted aircraft. To achieve this, developers must deliver collision avoidance equipage sufficient to assure air safety. Current procedures for UAV operation within the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) are cumbersome and unsustainable for the long term.  They often require separate attention from air traffic control authorities, limiting user flexibility and responsiveness, and hindering effective operations - military or commercial.     The proposed research will add the ability to see and avoid both cooperative (transponding) and non-cooperative aircraft to UAVs.  Such capability is crucial to providing military services and industry with sustainable, flexible UAV operations, sufficiently robust to safely deploy whenever and wherever needed. Additionally, these technologies will increase safety in the civil sector through integration on manned aircraft.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed sensor package can also be used on other onboard-pilot operated aircrafts as a replacement of expensive TCAS system. In the near future more and smaller size aircrafts will be equipped with low-cost ADS-B or UAT system.  Current technologies are based on beacon signaling instead of active sensor, thus cannot effectively detect and track noncooperative threats. The proposed technology will help to develop next generation collision avoidance systems with enhanced situation awareness and minimum cost.

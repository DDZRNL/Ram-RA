<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This SBIR Phase I project will develop the Flight System Monitor which will use non-intrusive electrical monitoring (NEMO).  The electronic system health of components and systems will be measured and tracked by carefully monitoring and analyzing of power usage and start up and shut down transients.   In depth analysis of this data enables real time assessment of system and component functioning and identifies potential system and component faults and failutes.  The system is light weight, small and inexpensive because the system requires only a sensor at the mains power input and uses existing power wiring to carry data.  Phase I will involve ground measurements on the control and power systems of a small UAV.   Phase II will involve measurements and analysis of a system in flight.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Initial applications will provide safety and system reliability to NASA UAVs including including the ESCD (Earth Science Capabilities Demonstration) Project and its REVEAL (Research Environment for Vehicle-Embedded Analysis on Linux) system,  the Airborne Electric Remote Observations Systems (AEROS) project and the High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) platforms and systems.    During Phase II,  capability will expanded to be used on manned aircraft,  spacecraft and ground support systems.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Nonintrusive electrical monitoring (NEMO) is also applicable to wheeled vehicles including autos,  trucks and military vehicles and to ships and hovercraft.   It also can be used for energy monitoring and conservation in buildings and other industrial facilities.

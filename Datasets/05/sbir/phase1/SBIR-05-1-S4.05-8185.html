<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Sensor Electronic Technology, Inc. (SET) proposes to develop ultraviolet detectors for focal plane arrays based on wide-bandgap semiconductor materials.  Direct gap III?N AlInGaN materials are the only materials capable of combining a high sensitivity for detecting UV radiation with a sharp cutoff for either visible blind (cutoff < 400 nm) or solar-blind (cutoff < 290 nm) operation.  These solid state detectors are rugged, suitable in high temperature applications, have fast response times, and have spatial resolution when integrated with a silicon readout integrated circuit (ROIC).  
<br>
<br>This Phase I effort will focus on the feasibility for fabricating high quantum efficiency UV detectors with the possibility to integrate multi-wavelength detection onto a single pixel.  This will include heterojunction optimization that will be applicable for both single color and multi-color UV detectors.  SET will perform MEMOCVD growth of high Al containing heterojunctions and will investigate the influence of material properties such as doping efficiency, donor and acceptor compensation, dopant diffusion and profile, and adatom surface migration and their influence on heterojunction performance in advanced UV photodetectors.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA related applications for UV detectors include measurement analysis sensors, astronomy, combustion detection, flame detection and engine flame-out detection.  Current UV detection technology includes silicon photodetectors and photo-multiplier tubes (PMTs).  Silicon based detectors are not suitable for operating environments with elevated temperatures or with background signals in the visible and infra-red as are commonly experienced in space based applications.  They also don't have gain capability necessary for small signal detection.  PMTs have limitations for operation in high temperature environments, and do not function in typical NASA or DoD required environments where vibration and shock specifications must be met.  These applications present opportunities for GaN/AlGaN solar blind detectors to displace the current technology because of fundamental physical limitations with the existing technology.  Compound semiconductor based detectors also open up the potential for multi-wavelength detection capability on a single pixel adding increased discrimination and detection capability.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Non-NASA and commercial applications for UV detectors include air quality monitoring, analysis instruments, missile defense, bioagent sensing, flame/combustion detection and jet aircraft engine flame-out detection.  Depending on the application and the requirement for spatial discrimination, it is believed that there are commercial markets for both stand-alone UV detectors and for UV focal plane arrays that are integrated with a silicon readout integrated circuit.  GaN/AlGaN based UV detectors are envisioned to replace UV enhance silicon photodiodes and PMTs in applications where these devices are limited by environmental operating conditions (high temperature, shock, etc.).

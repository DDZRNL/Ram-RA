<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
MesoScribe Technologies, a high tech start-up from SUNY-Stony Brook, proposes to apply a breakthrough new direct writing technology to meet the objectives set-forth in the NASA SBIR topic S2.06 Advanced Flexible Electronics.  This technology is based on revolutionary advances to modern day thermal spray materials processing enables deposition of wide range of electronic materials onto large areas at low processing temperatures and, for most part, requires no post-processing.  MesoScribe will develop large area patterning capability to demonstrate electronically steerable L-band, phased array antennas to meet NASA's goals.  During phase I the maximum dimensions for considerations will be ? x ? m.  This is based on the capabilities of our current motion system and not a limitation of the process itself.  The antennas will be designed, modeled, fabricated and characterized for performance attributes.  The flexibility of the system will also be assessed through appropriate bending experiments.  In parallel, conceptual strategies for large area fabrication will also discussed for future consideration.  Finally, MesoScribe will also demonstrate our unique ability in terms of direct fabrication of antenna elements on large space based objects that would provide a robust means for multi-functional integration of electromagnetics with space structures.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The development of a large area, flexible phased array antenna will provide enhanced capabilities for NASA's Earth science remote sensing applications and future missions to the Moon, Mars, Titan and Venus.  Electronically steerable L-band antennas will enable detection of surface and subsurface topology and the increased aperture will enable repeat-pass interfermetric Synthetic Aperture Radar missions to be conducted at higher altitudes.  Antenna fabrication on flexible membrane structures is critical to reduce mass, launch vehicle stowage volume, and overall cost in comparison to rigid radar systems.  A variety of potential applications may result from this technology, if developed to fruition.  Applications include: space-based radar systems, unfurlable antennas to minimize volume on space flights, very large area antennas (10?100+ m2) for long-distance and low-signal detection, conformal antennas on space craft and space structures, rectifying antennas (rectennas) for microwave power transmission, power harvesting and sensors, and harsh environment (space) sensors.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Applications for flexible electronics have wide-spread appeal within the Department of Defense and consumer electronics industry.  Successful project development and implementation will enable significant breakthroughs in distributed sensors and distributed electromagnetics fabricated on flexible polymer substrates.  Applications include antennas, communication modules, health monitoring sensors, RFID's, and integrated sensor arrays.

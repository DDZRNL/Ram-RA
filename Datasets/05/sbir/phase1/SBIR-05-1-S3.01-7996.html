<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A methodology is to be developed that will allow the development and implementation of fault-tolerant control system for distributed collaborative spacecraft.  The objective is to ensure that the cluster of spacecraft continue to meet high precision performance objectives in the presence of system faults and uncertainty.  The proposed innovation is the development of a fault-tolerant control system for distributed spacecraft.  The development process begins with fault-tolerant control system architecture and then the analysis of its performance.   The essential elements of this proposed fault-tolerant control system architecture are: 
<br>    The fault detection filters and parity equations that generate residuals (the difference between the actual measurement and the estimated value)  with      important geometrical properties that enhance fault detection and identification. 
<br>    The residual processor that takes these corrupted residuals and announces a fault with a given probability of false and miss alarm in minimal time. 
<br>    A fault reconstruction system that estimates the fault magnitude once the fault has been identified. 
<br>    A distributed control system that reconfigures based on the particular fault and the fault magnitude.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The methodologies presented here are applicable to a broad range of navigation, and control systems.  In particular, autonomous systems operating in clusters or groups in a high precision, high accuracy, or safety of life operation.  
<br>
<br>In addition to satellites or deep space probes, this technology is directly applicable to other areas of autonomous systems including Autonomous Formation Flight for drag reduction in which multiple vehicles fly in formation to reduce total drag.  Another example is the development of autonomous control systems for UAV's operating in the National Air Space. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Fault tolerant autonomous systems have a wide range of applications.  The designs presented and developed could be utilized to implement real time, fault tolerant control systems for a variety of vehicles including automated farming, autonomous flight of UAV's, and automated landing systems.  Real time formation control, autonomous aircraft operating in the national air space are all potential applications that would benefit from this technology.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Computer codes such as MCNPX now have the capability to transport most high energy particle types (34 particle types now supported in MCNPX) with energies extending into the teravolt energy range.  The efficient use of these types of Monte Carlo tools is very important for modeling the effects of space radiation on humans, spacecraft and equipment.  This proposal would develop a graphical user interface for high energy multi-particle transport.  With this innovation, users of the MCNPX code would have access to a powerful graphical user interface for efficient creation and interrogation of their input files, which would significantly reduce the amount of time required to create and debug input files. 
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This will benefit users within NASA who need to do high energy physics calculations. The improvements proposed in this document can substantially reduce the amount of time to create a computer model.  Inside NASA, this will benefit anyone doing high energy radiation physics calculations including radiation-hard/resistant electronics, radiation shielding materials, particle and fields, shielding for manned space missions, nuclear propulsion, and medical physics analysis.
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
MCNPX is available to users around the world; any enhancements to the graphical user interface will make all users of the code more effective in creating their geometries and performing their calculations.  Visual Editor Consultants does not sell the Visual Editor; it instead releases this code to the Department of Energy code center (RSICC) to make the code available to interested users.  It is believed that this provides the maximum benefit to the user community and enhances the international reputation of both Visual Editor Consultants and Carter Monte Carlo Analysis, Inc.
<br>
<br>Outside NASA, this will benefit the fusion research, accelerator research and general high energy physics research.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NanoSonic has fabricated revolutionary nanostructured, yet macroscale, multifunctional Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> films via layer-by-layer, molecular self-assembly, which enables thickness and placement control over multiple constituents for true nanostructured multifunctionality and homogeneity (surface roughness +/- 5 nm).  NanoSonic has recently transitioned this innovative approach into a method to produce flexible, super lightweight, conductive fabrics for inflatable spacecraft.  In support of NASA's Vision for Space Exploration, low cost Metal Rubber Fabric<SUP>TM</SUP> would be optimized as high performance textiles and sensors for the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate.  Specifically, nanostructured fabrics with ultra-low mass density (0.0011 g/cc), offer electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and the elastomeric variants exhibit a novel approach to large area sensors.    Metal Rubber Fabric<SUP>TM</SUP> is not fabricated from conducting polymers or sputter coated fibers.  NanoSonic's in situ approach involves chemically reacting monolayers of nanosized components, eliminating residual stress between each constituent.  Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> technology has led to advanced electrically conductive (as low as 10-5 &#937;&#8729;cm) inorganic/organic hybrid nanocomposites that can be strained to > 1000% elongation that return to the original shape and nominal conductivity when released, even at cryogenic temperatures (-80&#61616;C).  Metal Rubber Fabric<SUP>TM</SUP> requires less than 1 vol% of metal, allowing the manufacturing a cost effective, advanced textiles.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA applications for Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> Fabrics include ultra-lightweight textiles for NASA inflatables (ballutes, habitats, airbags, parachutes and suits), protective coatings against electrostatic charging, EMI, radiation, and abrasion.  Low modulus Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> Fabrics and films can also function as conducting electrodes for high strain mechanical actuator and sensor devices, and as low-weight, electrically conductive and mechanically flexible coatings for systems requiring physically-robust electromagnetic shielding, ground planes or electrical interconnection.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> can be used as replacements for conventional tin-lead solder for the mechanical, electrical and thermal interconnection of electronic and mechanical components.  Such materials may also be used in high performance, highly flexible and mechanically robust electronic flex circuits, flexible displays and smart electronic fabrics.

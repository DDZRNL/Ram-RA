<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA's future Earth-Sun System missions require the rapid development of small, low-cost remote sensing instruments for the analysis of chemical and  physical properties of planetary atmospheres. The objective of the proposed project (Phases I and II) is to research, develop, and demonstrate the first space-qualifiable digital correlation spectrometer on a single chip which, if successful, will reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of microwave spectrometers and will enable space-science observations measurements that were not previously possible. The innovative approach proposed for achieving the objective consists of a synergistic combination of the following: (a) a unique parallel architecture that will reduce the operating clock frequency,  relative to a single-stream architecture, by a factor of 2 and consequently will lower significantly the power consumption,  (b) novel differential analog and digital circuits that will improve robustness while operating in the presence of total dose natural radiation found in the space environment, and (c) an advanced 0.13 um CMOS fabrication process  with cooper interconnect, available at relatively low-cost through the MOSIS fabrication facility from IBM, for  manufacturing high-performance, low-power, reliable,  and robust (total dose radiation and latch-up resistant) space-qualifiable chips.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed space-qualifiable digital correlation spectrometer chip is intended for use in NASA's passive microwave remote sensing spaceborne instruments for radioastronomy and planetary atmospheric research. The competitive advantage of the proposed space-qualifiable digital spectrometer is a factor of 80 times higher bandwidths and 30 times greater spectral resolution relative to the space-qualified digital spectrometer developed by this proposing firm on contract from NASA/JPL for the EOS/MLS instrument operational on the Aura spacecraft.    <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The commercial markets for the proposed digital correlation spectrometer are ground-based radioastronomy, atmospheric research performed from aircraft and balloons, imaging arrays for detection of weapons and explosives, radio spectrum surveillance, telecommunications, and medical imaging. In the commercial markets, the competitive advantage of the proposed digital spectrometer is a factor of 20 times lower cost relative to existing digital correlation spectrometers of similar performance.

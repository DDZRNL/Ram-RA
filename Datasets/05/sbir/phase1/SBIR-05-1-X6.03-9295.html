<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal discloses an innovative, economically feasible technique to capture and re-liquefy the hydrogen boil-off by using carbon nanotube adsorption prior to liquefaction.  The hydrogen boil- off involves an average of 10,300 SCFM of hydrogen vapor at pressures below 17 psia for a period of an hour.  The configuration disclosed in the proposal significantly reduces the size of the liquefaction equipment and this translates into a substantial reduction in cost for the system.  Preliminary calculations have indicated that a payback period of less than 12 months (based on the current cost of hydrogen and the use rate at KSC when shuttles return to flight).
<br>The Phase I effort will also experimentally demonstrate the performance of a carbon nanotube coated (CNC) adsorption bed in Phase I.  This proposal discloses a patent-pending approach which makes this technology feasible, safe and affordable.
<br>The Phase I effort is significant, in that an extensive demonstration of the performance, cost, durability, and simplicity of the CNC adsorption bed as well as a demonstration of the  economic benefits of the hydrogen capture system for NASA/KSC will both be achieved before proceeding to Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Our marketing studies have clearly identified that in addition to the obvious NASA/KSC application for recovering 1.5 million gallons of hydrogen per year[1] with an annual savings of about two million dollars, there is a tremendous market potential for a high-capacity, safe, hydrogen storage method which can be combined with fuel cells.  There are also other NASA and DoD spaceflight applications where the safe, and possibly long-term, storage of hazardous gasses or propellants is desired.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Manufacturers of liquefied hydrogen and other commercial users of hydrogen would have recovery needs similar to NASA, however the much bigger commercial market is using the increased hydrogen storage capacity of the carbon nanotube coated adsorption bed for hydrogen fuel cells, such as those proposed for future new vehicles.  The nanotube coated adsorption technique would have other commercial applications as the U.S. tends more toward clean-burning hydrogen as a fuel source.

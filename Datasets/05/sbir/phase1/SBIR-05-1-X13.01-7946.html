<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We will leverage our prior work on Adaptive Information Management (AIM) to provide a core reasoning capability usable in a diverse set of tools to aid and assist in the review, design, evaluation and management of user interfaces (UIs).  We have a task-linked information representation and associated algorithms for reasoning about the information needs of a set of user tasks, the information presentation capabilities of a set of devices and formats, and the degree of match between the two.  These have served as the basis of multiple, successful AIM systems in the past, but within highly restricted domains.  The proposed project will explore methods and required modifications for moving our core representation in innovative direction-?making it more interactive and subject to user guidance, applicable to a set of contexts of use rather than a current usage "slice", and capable of providing aiding across a broader set of domains.  Substantial modifications to our core task representation and several new critiquing modules will likely be needed.  Their design will open the doors for a variety of types of Multi-modal Aids for Interface Design (MAIDs).  In particular, the proposed project will focus on designing a tool to evaluate human-designed procedure execution displays against users' tasks needs, and provide design feedback and advice.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The NASA market for a tool for the evaluation of procedure execution interface designs includes manned mission contexts, such as Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) missions; ground operations; maintenance; and space station operations.  The tool will enhance crew effectiveness, efficiency, autonomy, and safety by improving procedure execution support through the use of well-formed supporting displays generated under user control but with substantial knowledge and expertise applied to review, support and critiquing.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Our MAID tool will facilitate the design and integration of procedure execution displays in a wide variety of military and commercial applications, including aviation, power generation, refinery operations, manufacturing operations, and medical domains.  It will greatly reduce the costs of creating such displays, and will improve their usability.  We have current contacts with multiple larger commercial organizations who could make use of such tools-- most notably the Abnormal Situation Management consortium of companies collaborating in oil and gas refinery safety research.

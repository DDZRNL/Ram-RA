<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
nLight proposes to develop high-power, high-efficiency laser diodes emitting at 1907nm. Performance is expected to improve from the current state-of-the-art technology at 15C of 20% electrical-to-optical (E/O) conversion efficiency and 11.5W continuous-wave power (CW) to 25% E/O efficiency and 18W of CW power at the conclusion of Phase I.  At the conclusion of Phase II, these values are expected to improve to 38% E/O efficiency and greater than 35W CW power.  Quasi-CW power will be >>100W per laser bar. Such lasers meet the brightness and power requirements for the direct pumping of the quasi 4-level 5I7 to 5I8 transition in singly-doped Ho:YAG lasers.  Compared to the diode-pumping of Thulium-sensitized Ho:YAG, direct diode pumping of Ho:YAG takes advantage of Holmium's much larger emission cross section, the absence of Ho:Tm up conversion, and Ho:YAG's large energy storage lifetime.  Direct diode pumping of Ho:YAG also results in decreased system size, weight and complexity and an improvement in overall system efficiency when compared to pumping with a diode-pumped Th:YAG laser, all critical metrics for space and airborne platforms.   This work could be extended to 18xxnm and 20xxnm quite readily with comparable power and efficiency performance.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This device has application in pumping a broad range of solid-state lasers of interest to the NASA community.  The laser can easily be redesigned to operate at wavelengths from 18xxnm to 20xxnm without performance degradation, making it suitable for pumping other YAG, LuAG and YLF-based lasers. These lasers have application in LIDAR, atmospheric sensing and metrology.  The improved efficiency and peak output power broadens their appeal into air and space born applications that where previously inaccessible due to the compromised size, cost and reliability of other pump configurations.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Medical applications abound for the high-power lasers pumped by the 19xxnm lasers proposed.  They are widely used in surgical and dental procedures.  The diode laser's improved power, efficiency and reliability permit proliferation of these systems to more remote areas that would otherwise be inaccessible due to the size, cost, weight and reliability of the laser system.

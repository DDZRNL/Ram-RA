<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
International Electronic Machines Corporation, a leader in the design of precision imaging systems, will develop an innovative multispectral, panoramic imaging system for use on exploratory landing craft. During Phase I, IEM will build upon and advance alternative strategies, including our patent pending Synthetic Field of View (SynthFOV) technology and our Pan/Tilt Mirror System (PTMS), initially conceived by IEM for the USMC Gladiator UGV. These two technologies will eliminate or significantly reduce the use of conventional moving parts, will decrease power demand, will reduce launch weight, and will require less space than current imaging systems. SynthFOV incorporates an array of Off-Axis Telescopes to focus light to a sensor via a series of optically precise mirrors. The PTMS uses a centrally configured mirror that rotates and tilts along both horizontal and vertical axes thereby directing the reflected light to a sensor. Alternative configurations include use of two imagers for stereo panoramic imaging; incorporating filter wheels for multispectral imaging on a single sensor; use of multiple sensors for imaging visible, near IR, and other wavelengths, and use of multispectral lenses to further reduce weight. IEM will evaluate these and other alternatives and will demonstrate the applicability of the selected approach through pre-prototype testing.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Multi-Spectral Panoramic Imaging System will advance future planetary exploration. The smaller size, lighter weight, fewer conventional moving parts, and adjustable fields of view will improve imaging capability over current mechanically based pan/tilt camera systems. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The markets for a successful implementation of this panoramic imaging system are very large and diverse. Security systems which do not require constant monitoring by human operators, which are adaptable and customizable, and which can automatically detect security risks and notify the appropriate personnel would be of vast interest to all branches of the military, to all law-enforcement organizations at Federal, State, and local levels, and to industry in a wide variety of settings. In the current security-minded political climate, security is a multibillion-dollar market which is only likely to expand in the next decade.  Multispectral components of this imaging system would also have wide application in security, safety, industrial maintenance, and scientific roles.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
	Various Earth Science fields require well-calibrated field radiometers whose calibrations must be tracked and verified in the field.  NASA has long recognized the need to monitor and maintain calibrations of in-situ radiometric instruments.  However, the light sources that have been developed for calibration monitoring typically require high power, are bulky and difficult to use in the field, and do not work with all types of radiometers.
<br>	We propose a next-generation portable, ultra-stable, lightweight and highly versatile light source based on light-emitting diodes (LEDs).  Recent advances in LEDs include higher power, efficiency, and a wider range of wavelengths (from UV to IR).  These advances, coupled with LEDs' inherent suitability for electronic feedback stabilization, make them excellent candidates for more compact and power-efficient calibration sources.
<br>	During Phase I we will identify and test LED devices, measurement and stabilization techniques, and physical configurations for use in one or more calibration sources.  In Phase II we will build prototypes and implement a program for test and evaluation in cooperation with recognized calibration laboratories.  At the conclusion of Phase II we will be ready to produce and sell a commercial version.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
	NASA applications include monitoring in support of MODIS and other ocean color satellites, and other radiometric sensor networks such as AERONET and SolRad-Net.  Because of its smaller size and weight and lower cost, the proposed system could replace existing devices from these applications.  These attributes will also make it attractive to a wider pool of radiometry users inside and outside of NASA.  The approach and technology developed in this project could also potentially be applied to airborne and satellite radiometers for performing on-board self-calibration checks.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
	A portable radiometric calibration monitor, especially one that is moderately priced and easy to use, will be useful in any of the numerous applications requiring field radiometers.  These include ocean-color remote sensing and its related disciplines, marine and terrestrial environmental monitoring, global climate change studies, and agriculture?both for research and commercial production.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Valcor Engineering Corporation proposes to develop an advanced On Board Inert Gas Generation System, OBIGGS, for aircraft fuel tank inerting to prevent hazardous in-flight conditions and to mitigate their effect when they do occur. Aircraft fires represent a small number of actual accident causes, but the number of fatalities due to in-flight, post-crash, and on-ground fires is large.  The novel OBIGGS system will inert aircraft fuel tanks with nitrogen generated by a hollow fiber membrane module.  The system will provide a cost effective method for fuel tank inerting, will be robust and resistant to chemical contamination.  An OBIGGS system that is based on nitrogen generation is environmentally friendly and does not require hazardous chemicals for fire suppression.  In addition to improving aircraft safety by mitigating hazardous in-flight and on the ground conditions the OBIGGS systems will also contribute to aircraft security and will mitigate aircraft damage from hostile attacks.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Advanced OBIGGS systems will be used to inert center fuel tank on new commercial aircraft such as; Boeing 7E7, and to retrofit the existing commercial aircraft fleet including the Boeing 747, and 737, as well as for fuel tank inerting of military aircraft including C-17.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The novel advanced OBIGGS technology will generate spin of applications in nitrogen generation and in membrane based gas separation in general.  The technology will advance membrane gas separation system design for commercial and military applications.  Both stationary and mobile membrane gas separation systems are used commercially to generate nitrogen for blanketing, inerting, purgin and other applications.  In particular, the technology will bring major advances to currently employed mobile nitrogen generation system: ship-board inerting (cargo and tanker), mobile nitrogen generating ground carts, SIGNAS, (Navy and Air Force) and mobile container inerting (trucks and ships).

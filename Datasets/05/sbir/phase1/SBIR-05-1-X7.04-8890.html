<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This SBIR Phase I project develops a unified computational algorithm
<br>for simulation of hypersonic flows in both continuum and transitional
<br>regimes based on a gas-kinetic BGK-Burnett solver. Different from the
<br>macroscopic Burnett approach, the proposed gas-kinetic BGK-Burnett
<br>solver is unconditionally stable for all Knudsen numbers. Whereas it
<br>is almost impossible to correctly set up boundary condition for the
<br>Burnett equations, this can be easily done in the proposed BGK-Burnett
<br>solver with the Maxwell boundary condition, re-emitting the particles
<br>from the boundary according to the accommodation coefficient. More
<br>importantly, this BGK-Burnett solver not only allows a single algorithm
<br>for both continuum and transitional flow regimes but also is more
<br>suitable for integration with either DSMC or direct Boltzmann solver
<br>in the rarefied flow regime. This is because in current hybrid CFD/DSMC
<br>approach, the inconsistency from the fluxes estimated from CFD and DSMC
<br>may cause an artificial flow across the interface between CFD/gas-kinetic
<br>zones.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA current mission focuses on human lunar and martian exploration.
<br>The design of crew exploration vehicles requires the proposed
<br>computational tool, which is able to handle the flows beyond
<br>the continuum regime and thereby accurately predict wake heating,
<br>single/multiple rocket plume effects on the vehicle aerodynamics
<br>and heating.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed gas-kinetic computational algorithm can significantly
<br>enhance the capability of aerospace industry to predict the aerothermal
<br>loads on a space vehicle. It can also be used to analyze aerobrake
<br>systems and to predict leakage flows past seal teeth in gas turbine
<br>engines, etc. Such a computational tool is lacking in the market.

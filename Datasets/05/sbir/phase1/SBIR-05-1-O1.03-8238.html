<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose a tactical grade MEMS IMU for spin-stabilized rockets for metric tracking and autonomous systems. The enabling instrument is a gyroscope designed for very low cross-axis sensitivity. The IMU is formed by integrating all the gyroscopes and accelerometers on a single, planar chip. An advantage of integration is the well-defined alignment of all instruments with respect to the spin axis. During Phase I we propose to design and fabricate a complete IMU and conduct a proof-of-concept test of the enabling gyroscope under high, cross-axis spin rate.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
While the proposed work is to address NASA's specific need for tactical grade IMUs which can function on spin stabilized rockets for GPS/IMU Metric Tracking and Autonomous Systems, MSSA's Integrated MEMS IMU technology described within this proposal can provide guidance sensors, gyroscopes, accelerometers, inertial measurement units to satisfy a range of NASA's Guidance, Navigation and Control sensor requirements.  MSSA's inertial instrument technology has the potential to satisfy NASA's performance requirements with significantly reduced mass, power, volume and cost.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The targeted applications for MSSA's MEMS inertial instruments are for guidance & navigation of autonomous air and land vehicles, for short-range and long-range missiles, for general aviation and private aircraft, for homeland security and disaster relief applications, and for selected applications in military, scientific and commercial satellites.

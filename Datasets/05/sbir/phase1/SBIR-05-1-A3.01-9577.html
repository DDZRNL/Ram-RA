<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA's Future Air traffic management Concepts Evaluation Tool (FACET) is a simulation tool to evaluate next generation air traffic management (ATM) systems.  FACET has been gaining popularity with ATM researchers in research years due to its well-designed user interface and robust capabilities for simulating the interaction between the National Airspace System (NAS) and new ATM concepts. Since controller task load and performance is a critical aspect of any future ATM concept, we propose to integrate human performance metrics into FACET.  Currently, the only representation of human performance in FACET is through calculation of dynamic density, which estimates controller task load at the sector level through regression analysis of subjective controller ratings for current operations.  However, the applicability of dynamic density in its current form for predicting controller task load of future ATM operations is unknown.  By integrating human performance metrics directly into FACET, preliminary task load implications and predictions of workload-constrained sector capacity of any future ATM concept would be immediately available to researchers.  This would be particularly useful to future ATM tradeoff studies and could be used in lieu of subjective controller ratings for preliminary recalibration of dynamic density for future ATM operations.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
FACET is widely used by ATM researchers at NASA and other government agencies.  Since controller workload and performance is a critical aspect of any future ATM concept, integrating human performance modeling into FACET will expand the robustness of the tool for performing system tradeoffs and focusing expensive human-in-the-loop experiments.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The commercial potential of FACET integrated with human performance modeling is growing as more countries privatize or consider privatizing their air traffic services.  Companies providing air traffic services can evaluate controller workload issues using FACET to determine if investments in controller tools and technologies are worthwhile.

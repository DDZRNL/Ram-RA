<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Wide bandgap SiC power devices have the potential for reliable operations at higher junction temperatures, higher voltages, higher frequencies and thus higher power densities than what can be achieved with Si devices. These advantages enable the SiC technology-based power conversion systems (PCM) to be made smaller, lightweight, more efficient and robust. Recent studies predicted that the volume of a power converter system could be reduced five times through the utilization of SiC power devices.   Despite this potential promise and encouraging results, more studies are needed to address the design and fabrication of SiC-based PCMs before their full potential can be realized. This project will develop an ultrahigh-efficiency, light and compact power converter system based on emerging SiC semiconductor technologies, quantifying the system benefits and addressing the related technical issues. The Phase I work include: (1) Circuit design of an SiC-based converter and modeling to evaluate the converter performance (power loss, efficiency, temperature rise, and weight/size heatsink etc.), and (2) High temperature packaging and high power density thermal management to support the SiC converter.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
It can be used for deep space power systems to provide the advantages long life capability, high radiation tolerance, reliability, and low overall costs which can operate over wide temperature ranges, and with high radiation tolerance, reliability. It can provide significant improvements in mass, size, power quality, reliability, or efficiency in electrical power conversion, motor drives, and protective switchgear components, with  possible applications including solar array regulars, battery charge and discharge regulators, power conversion, power distribution, fault protection, high-speed motors/generators, magnetic bearing drivers, and integrated flywheel energy storage  and attitude control electronics.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Non-NASA applications include Defense, Energy and private sector.  Particularly, it will play a huge role in next-generation tanks, ships, and planes in which the replacement of hydraulic drives by electric drives can offer significant cost, size, weight, fuel consumption, and reliability advantages. SiC-based inverter technology will penetrate in these areas to replace Si-based converter because of its superior advantages such as ultrahigh efficiency, superior reliability, compact dimension and light weight.

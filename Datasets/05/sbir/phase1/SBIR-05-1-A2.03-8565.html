<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This SBIR Phase I proposal addresses the need for explosion proof, sensitive and reliable hydrogen sensors for NASA and commercial hydrogen fuel systems.  It also addresses the need for multiple sensing points with minimum tank or bulkhead feedthroughs. The proposed innovations will increase the response speed of reported hydrogen sensors by a factor of 5 and the sensitivity by a factor of 10. In the Phase I feasibility work, it is proposed to demonstrate these attributes for single sensors.  In Phase II, the multiplexing, detection reliability and special packaging necessary to make the sensors practical for NASA and other applications will be demonstrated in preparation for commercialization in Phase III.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The use of hydrogen as a fuel in many air and space vehicles that will be subjected to severe and unknown stresses over long lifetimes, and its storage and transfer on the ground, exposes personnel and facilities to potential fire and explosion hazards, making hydrogen leak detection necessary. These sensors will find applications wherever there is a compartment, tank or other environment where the lower explosive limit of 4% hydrogen in air might occur. These include cryostats, launch tanks, ground tanks, piping, near engines, and others.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The early adoption of these hydrogen detection systems by NASA will lead to applications experience, production enhancements and cost reductions.  Applications will then appear as the hydrogen economy grows.  The advanced, explosion proof hydrogen detectors will be adapted for fuelling stations, ground vehicles and potentially in every hydrogen fuel cell.  The same systems as used in NASA aerospace will also be utilized in civilian and military aircraft powered by hydrogen.

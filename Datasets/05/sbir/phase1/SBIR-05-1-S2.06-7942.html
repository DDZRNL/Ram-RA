<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
AMBP Tech will implement Zinc Oxide high mobility material technology it has developed specifically for flexible electronics into a direct write process onto large area polymer membranes.  The implementation of this technology will form the core components of transmit/receive components of a synthethic aperture radar flexible antenna that can operate in the L-band and enable imaging of the earth from GEO and MEO orbits.  The core issues that will be addressed in the Phase I program will include the demonstration that the high mobility material translates to high frequency response transistors suitable for power and signal amplification in transmit/receive modules, development of a low temperature ohmic contact forming process, exploration of advance FET ZnO device layer architectures, and most importantly the demonstration of the direct write capability of the LAMBD technology.  In Phase II, AMPB Tech will integrate these process modules with other metal and dielectric direct write technologies to realized monolithic transmit/receive modules directly on a polyimide substrate and demonstrate a small 2D Synthethic Aperture Radar Antenna Array.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The clear goal of the proposed SBIR effort is to develop a direct write process of high performance semiconductors onto flexible substrates over very large areas so that the monolithic cost effective fabrication of large area SAR for earth sensing remote applications.  AMBP Tech will also integrate the high performance semiconductor writing process with other direct write technologies to realized the actual Transmit/Receive modules directly on the polymer flexible substrates.  In addition to keying the realization of the SAR antenna arrays, the technology developed will also have direct applications in peripheral SAR functions such as using the TFTs for Aperture health monitoring and monitoring the deployment of the flexible structure.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The non-NASA applications of the proposed research will include manufacturing tools and offering services that enable the direct writing of high carrier mobility ZnO based transistors.  This will service compound semiconductor manufacturers as well as enable us to work with fabless houses to implement novel device designs for a variety of applications.  The end customer applications that this technology will clearly serve will be flexible electronics backplanes for flexible displays.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA requires advanced high power primary lithium batteries for ultra low temperature applications.  The key component that limits the performance at low temperature is the battery electrolyte.  Proof-of-concept experiments have shown that Covalent's new non-aqueous electrolyte formulations greatly enhance low temperature primary battery performance while preserving its long shelf life. At temperatures as low as -100<SUP>o</SUP>C, our new electrolyte demonstrates superior transport properties due to minimal triple ion formation.  Accelerated storage tests revealed no voltage delay indicative of a stable passive film formed on the lithium anode. When coupled with a high energy density cathode material such as carbon monofluoride (CFx), our new electrolyte formulations will enable primary lithium primary performance over a broad spectrum of ultra low temperature applications.  Specifically, Li/CFx batteries incorporating the new Covalent electrolytes will deliver more than 30% of their room temperature capacity at temperatures as low as -100<SUP>o</SUP>C at practical discharge rates.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Future NASA manned and unmanned missions to the moon and Mars require a new generation of primary lithium batteries designed to function at temperatures as low as -120<SUP>o</SUP>C.  Such temperatures will be encountered on the moon where the night time lows reach -110<SUP>o</SUP>C, and on Mars where temperatures recorded by the Viking probes were as low as -107<SUP>o</SUP>C.  At present, no battery exists that can provide practical discharge rates at such ultra low temperatures.  Advanced Li/CFx batteries incorporating Covalent's novel low temperature electrolyte formulations will find use in astronaut equipment (lighting and power tools), communication devices, in situ resource utilization systems and sensor networks.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are a number of terrestrial applications where good low temperature performance is required. For example, the average night time temperature in the high Khumbu Himal (Mt. Everest region) is -36<SUP>o</SUP>C and often drops as low as -60<SUP>o</SUP>C.  On the South Pole the average annual temperature is approximately -50<SUP>o</SUP>C, while the lowest temperatures recorded are below -90<SUP>o</SUP>C. The external temperature of an aircraft at 30,000 feet can reach -40<SUP>o</SUP>C and below. Portable lighting, electronic equipment, sensors and weapons systems that must function in those environments will greatly benefit from the proposed innovation. Covalent's new electrolyte formulations will also increase the battery rate capability in the temperature range of 22<SUP>o</SUP>C 
<br>to -40<SUP>o</SUP>C.  The unsurpassed room temperature conductivity of the new electrolytes will enable high power pulses required in a wide range of consumer applications, while high discharge rate capability at -40<SUP>o</SUP>C is of particular interest to the U.S. military.

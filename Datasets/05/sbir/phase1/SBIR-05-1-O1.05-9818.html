<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA needs a cryogenic refrigerator for the 15-25K range for receiving arrays of ground-based antennas that will serve the telecommunications needs of future space exploration.  We propose to develop a 15-25K Static-Helium Regenerator/Double Pulse Tube Cooler for receiving arrays.  Our SHR/DPTC combines two of our technologies that have potential to enable pulse-tube coolers to operate efficiently in the 15-25K range: (1) our Static-Helium Regenerator (SHR) technology, which uses static helium for the regenerator's thermal mass; and (2) our Double Pulse Tube Cooler (DPTC) technology, which uses a recuperator (instead of regenerators) to transfer heat between two pulse-tube sub-cycles that operate in parallel and out-of-phase.  In Phase I, we will perform system trades and generate a preliminary design of a 15-25K SHR/DPTC that minimizes life-cycle costs for receiving arrays.  In Phase II, we will: develop and test SHR/DPTC components; integrate the SHR/DPTC components with cooler components we have already developed; and test the integrated cooler.  In Phase III, we will build and sell SHR/DPTCs to the government and private sector.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA needs cryocoolers to reliably cool detectors and associated components to temperatures as low as 5K for the Astronomical Search for the Origins and Planetary Systems theme [e.g. Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) and the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) missions] and the Structure and Evolution of the Universe theme in the Space Science Enterprise.  Our SHR/DPTCs will cool detectors and associated components to temperatures as low as 5K for NASA space observatories.  NASA needs coolers to liquefy and/or store cryogens for human and robotic missions to Mars.  Our SHR/DPTCs will efficiently cool liquid hydrogen and other low-temperature cryogens to minimize system size and weight.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Air Force needs coolers for cryogenic storage of reactants for space-based High Energy Laser (HEL) systems.  Projected cooling requirements include 2-20 W of cooling at 20 K.  An SHR/DPTC would efficiently cool the reactants to minimize system size and weight.  The Air Force needs compact, lightweight coolers that provide 0.1 W of cooling at 10 K with greater than seven years lifetime and less than 100 W/W of input power to cool VLWIR focal planes.  Our SHR/DPTCs will efficiently cool at 10 K to minimize system size and weight.  Other commercial applications include cooling for: filters for cellular telephones; instrumentation for medical monitoring; and cryoelectronics.

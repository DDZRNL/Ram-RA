<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Superconducting electric propulsion systems will yield improvements in total ownership costs due to the simplicity of electric drive when compared with gas turbine engines, and due to greater power densities and efficiencies of electromechanical energy conversion processes. Two principal types have been considered in Naval propulsion studies that have promise for all electric aircraft. Both of these classes of motor, however, have technical risk attributes that are less than ideal with respect to reliability and efficiency: complex rotating cryocoolers for the AC synchronous machine, and low voltage (hence high current) brushed armatures for the DC acyclic (homopolar) machine. SatCon proposes a 'stationary field synchronous motor', which combines the benefits of both synchronous and acyclic motors by combining the ability to use COTS cryocoolers inherent to the acyclic motor with power transfer to the armature at reasonable voltage and current levels. This will be traded off against an AC synchronous machine using a rotating cryocooler with a novel flow management design to reduce the complexity and losses. The result of the two-phase effort will be the design, prototyping, and testing of an improved power density superconducting propulsion motor suitable for aircraft propulsion applications.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Today fuel prices are increasing with cost roughly 1/3 higher than at the same time in 2004.  Simultaneously, the issue of Global Warming and the impact of greenhouse gases, and depletion of the ozone layer has increased the emphasis on reduced or "zero" emission from combustion processes.  As the lead government agency developing future aviation technologies, NASA has a critical role to play in this area.  This work is directly relevant to NASA long-term goals for all electric aircraft for zero emissions and fuel independence. This will enable long endurance military missions and cost effective civilian transport with beneficial environmental and sustainability impacts.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Once fully developed by SatCon, this technology while designed for NASA applications can also be used to leverage development costs for zero emission, civilian aviation transport propulsion systems.  Also, a high power density electric propulsion system will have far reaching effects in the area of Hybrid Electric Vehicles.

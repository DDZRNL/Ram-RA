<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A majority of millimeter wave based systems used for space exploration, communications and research, require a millimeter wave oscillator.  These oscillators have been typically based on the Gunn Diode.  Due to reliability issues and high DC power requirements, they are prone to  failures.  These failures could result in an unsuccessful space mission, a life-threatening situation and/or loss of invaluable data.  An alternative to this technology is highly desirable.  MMW Design Services is proposing to develop an alternative oscillator to the Gunn Diode using a Dielectric Puck operating in the Whispering Gallery Mode.  This innovation has the potential to produce compact, low noise oscillators operating with a frequency from 20GHZ to 120GHz.  Traditional Dielectric Resonating Oscillators operating in a fundamental mode are limited to 30GHz.  A Whispering Gallery Mode DRO uses a similar puck but in a much higher order mode, thus extending the resonant frequency.  The significance of this innovation is the improved performance of the oscillation at millimeter wave frequencies.  Space exploration will reach new heights. Satellites will operate longer and more efficiently resulting in cost effective missions that extends beyond our current mission life capability.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Developing a technology that is extremely reliable in order to replace a technology that is unreliable, results in endless economic and technical possibilities.  NASA applications include replacement of the traditional, (but less than ideal) Gunn Diode Oscillators currently used in spacecraft, radiometers and data links.  These oscillators could be fabricated with higher reliability by using the less expensive, technologically superior Whispering Gallery Mode DROs, thus extending the mission life, reducing power consumption and producing a higher  system performance.  NASA missions of earth studies and interplanetary exploration could receive very significant benefits from the development of this technology.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Non-NASA applications would greatly benefit from the lower costs and higher performance of the Whispering Gallery Mode oscillators.  Examples include 77 GHz Auto Radars, the developing 60 GHz point-to-point radios and the emerging 93GHz communications band.  WGM Oscillators can be used to research and instrumentation in the generation of electrical energy from fusion and plasma stabilization, a possible substitute for fossil and nuclear-based  energy sources.  Benefits to the military include higher precision radar systems for armed force surveillance, weapon guidance and safeguarding American soldiers.  The state of the art of these arenas could be pushed to allow system operation at higher frequencies with superior performance. A Whispering Gallery Mode DRO has the potential to revolutionize these industries

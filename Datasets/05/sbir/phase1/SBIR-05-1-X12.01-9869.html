<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Paragon Space Development Corporation proposes an innovative, efficient and practical concept that utilizes Solid Oxide Electrolysis for regenerative air revitalization.  The concept is innovative because it safely eliminates handling of hydrogen, and works irrespective of gravity and pressure environments with no moving parts and no multi-phase flows.  The innovation is efficient because it requires no expendables while being compact with minimal impact on mass.  The innovation is practical because it evolves from the well-established, current state of the art in oxygen production for the regenerative air revitalization system slated for the International Space Station.  The approach proposed addresses the crux of the innovation in Phase I through modeling and experimentation to immediately identify the most feasible approach to its implementation.  Phase II will encompass more detailed experimentation to optimize the subsystem design resulting in a fully functioning regenerative oxygen subsystem for advanced life support.  The consequence is significant because solid oxide electrolysis is an inherently suitable technology (and possibly the only technology) for enabling 100% oxygen regeneration from carbon dioxide and water vapor, two byproducts of crew activity that must be managed regardless.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The capability of solid oxide electrolysis to electrolyze carbon dioxide, oxygen, water or a combination of any of these enables the technology to be applied across several in situ resource utilization and life support applications on both the Moon and Mars, making this a truly cross-cutting technology investment.  Additional applications include:
<br>-	Oxygen generation for life support and propellant consumables using carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of Mars and water vapor from lunar regolith reduction processes.
<br>-	Portable oxygen generation and/or regeneration for advanced extravehicular activities in space, on the moon or Mars.
<br>-	Regenerative fuel cell applications such as making fuel cell reagents during the Martian day with solar power and switching to fuel cell mode to supply power at night.
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Solid Oxide Electrolysis innovation proposed for advanced life support systems will enable more efficient, compact systems to be used in terrestrial applications.  Examples include:
<br>-	Oxygen regeneration subsystems for the DoD and Home Land defense life support systems in chemical warfare agent shelters.
<br>-	Oxygen regeneration systems for the Navy and ocean research institutions developing submersibles or underwater research stations.
<br>-	Emergency fuel cell systems for both applications stated above since solid oxide electrolysis cells can be operated as a fuel cells.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Leveraging extensive experience from Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) environmental analysis, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Airspace Re-design projects, as well as National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) environmental modeling and decision-aid projects, Metron Aviation develops a software system to enable balanced noise and emissions reductions by integrated Air Traffic Management (ATM)/aircraft systems.  The proposed capability, Emissions and Noise Total Impact REduction (ENTIRE) is innovative in the follow ways:
<br>1.	It spans the spectrum of environmental impacts, encompassing both noise and local air-quality; 
<br>2.	It conjoins both ATM and aircraft-based activities for the management of these impact; and
<br>3.	It provides a tractable algorithmic approach to achieving specific noise and emissions impact reduction goals.
<br>The proposed capability directly supports the next-generation capabilities and environmentally friendly ATM capability sought under Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Subtopic A3.01 ? Next Generation ATM Systems, directly addressing integrated ATM/aircraft systems that reduce noise and emissions.  This software system enables NASA to provide quantitative techniques for finding ATM/aircraft operations that achieve specific combined noise and emissions impact reductions using methods that identify relative contributions of each aspect of ATM and aircraft operations to these reductions. At its core the system will utilize greedy/breedy algorithms with variance in degrees of freedom and comparison of subsequent solutions towards meeting specific impact reduction goals.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The goals of the JPDO mandate that environmental impact be a part of almost all changes in the future systems and procedures being designed and integrated into the NAS.  This indicates that there is a strong need and a growing market for a system like ENTIRE.  This need may lead to commercial opportunities for NASA in the following ways:
<br>1.	The ENTIRE effort will allow NASA to design and develop robust and adaptable mixtures of ATM/aircraft operations reducing combined noise and emissions impacts. This capability will potentially allow NASA to develop tools and solutions that may be of commercial value to other firms and other government agencies such as the FAA. 
<br>2.	With the development of these capabilities, and related expertise in developing solutions to aviation-related environmental impact, NASA may win research opportunities from commercial firms and airlines seeking to mitigate environmental impacts.
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Phase I and Phase II non-NASA commercial potential for the ENTIRE method and supporting algorithms is significant in the following ways:
<br>?	Aviation-related commercial firms of all types (airlines, aerospace companies, consultants, etc.) need access to a methodology and algorithms that will help them plan and execute optimal mixtures of ATM and aircraft operational activities to reduce environmental impacts associated with aviation noise and emissions; and
<br>?	The long-term nature of the JPDO development of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) implies that the changing nature of the business strategies of NAS users will require continued adjustment in the ATM/aircraft operational activities, perhaps in a tactical fashion.  This will provide commercial opportunities for firms able to rapidly ingest large amounts of complex demand, capacity, and weather information, analyze this information, and produce optimal operational-activity plans.

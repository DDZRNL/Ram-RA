<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
All electronic systems are prone to wear-out and eventual failure and this has direct implications for Vehicle Health Management for NASA with its long space missions.  The accurate prediction of an impending failure can provide significant savings in functionality and mission success.[1]  Accurate and timely failure prediction can support the mitigation of catastrophic faults in spacecraft systems as well as autonomous control and dynamic repairs to faults.  Electronic prognostics provide advanced warnings of impending electronic module failures.  
<br> 
<br>The specific innovation proposed will provide tools for setting and determining the advanced warning time for prognostic-enabled electronic systems, also referred to as defining the remaining useful life (RUL).  The testbed will be a high efficiency, DC-to-DC Power Converter commonly found in advanced power systems. Such power converters are commonly found in a wide range of electronic systems to adjust power levels, yet are subject to failures.  
<br> 
<br>The innovation would help prevent data loss and support uninterrupted operation.  The reason for funding is that NASA has a stated requirement for autonomous and automated solutions to systems health management systems and electronic prognostics are required to support this objective.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There is large potential for prognostics in the commercial sector, expected to exceed $200M by 2010.  Ridgetop has segmented the market to focus on high reliability applications, such as automotive, banking systems, industrial process control and commercial aerospace applications.
<br>
<br>Through work on this SBIR, Ridgetop will improve its market position for Electronic Prognostics and be able to capitalize on a large market.  Ridgetop has initiated commercialization activities stemming from its prior work in Prognostics with the introduction of the Sentinel Silicon<SUP>TM</SUP> Library and Sentinel PHMPro<SUP>TM</SUP> products. 
<br>
<br>Prognostics, to the extent that it can leverage existing diagnostic backbones such as JTAG, I2C[2] and CAN buses, supports Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and Prognostics/Health Management (PHM) strategies for critical industrial applications.  For CBM and PHM applications, the value to preserving operational readiness is paramoun,t and these applications are not expected to be cost-sensitive.
<br>
<br>In addition, prognostics can support remote diagnostics/prognostics.  The value proposition to customers is that early detection of impending failures can be made remotely, via the web, and corrective actions can be quickly employed to preserve overall system integrity.  
<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Ridgetop has had detailed discussions with customers in the Automotive Industry, including Daimler Chrysler, Delphi, and Bosch, who have expressed a strong interest in adopting advanced prognostics as part of their automotive product offerings.
<br>
<br>To the extent that Ridgetop configures the solution to meet the needs of the NASA program, it will provide ample opportunity to refine and adjust product featuers and additional steps in product development that may be necessary to make it more widely saleable to mil/aero customers (and later to commercial customers).   Ridgetop's Prognostics products presently consist of the following elements:
<br>
<br>Ridgetop PHMPro<SUP>TM</SUP> Development System, 
<br>Prognostics Physics-of-Failure Library ? Some Library items already available 
<br>Ridgetop Prognostics Development Software ? From NAVAIR Project 
<br>Precursor Event to Module Failure Calculation (To be developed in this SBIR) 
<br>Ridgetop PHMPro<SUP>TM</SUP> Implementation Toolkit 
<br>Sensor Array Hardware ? Sensors already available for current, voltage, and temperature 
<br>Prognostics Processing Unit with improved False Alarm Algorithms (using Bayesian Network processor from HRL Laboratories) 
<br>Interfacing software to system

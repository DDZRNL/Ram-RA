<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The objective of the research proposed herein is to define the coupled (combined) effect of critical environments on the structural performance of composite overwrap pressure vessels (COPV).  The three environments that will be coupled are cryogenic temperature, space irradiation, and hypervelocity (micrometeoroid/space debris) impact.  HyPerComp Engineering (HEI) have previously conducted research that studied  the independent effects of the three environments on COPV structural performance.  Prior research determined that COPV structural performance and capabilities were significantly degraded by each of the environments.  Clearly, a space-based cryogenic fuel storage vessel would be exposed to all three environments simultaneously.  Therefore, it is of interest to study the coupled effects of the environments, determine the coupled effect, and define design allowables that consider the simultaneous effect.  The result will be a safer and more reliable COPV design.  Note, the research proposed herein is applicable any space-based composite structure and earth-based COPV

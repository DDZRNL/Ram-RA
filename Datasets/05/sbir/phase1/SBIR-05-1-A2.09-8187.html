<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Micron-thin surface hot-film signatures will be used to simultaneously obtain airspeed and flow direction. The flow-angle and airspeed sensor system  (FASS) will provide airspeed with practically zero-lag and to less than one knot accuracy and flow angularity to a fraction of a degree, with natural immunity to EMI and RFI. Unlike Pitot-static and other conventional techniques, which experience serious limitations in accuracy, pneumatic lags, and frequency response in thin upper atmospheres, FASS will measure airspeed all the way to zero knots and perform equally well at sea level as well at high altitudes and even in the thin Martian atmosphere. The FASS addresses important flight-operation and flight research problems with crucial impact on vehicle performance, stability & control, structural loads, and pilot action. FASS will permit easy integration with aircraft avionics systems including conventional instruments used for pressure, temperature, and density measurements. Sensor elements will be coated to withstand harsh environment and waterproofed for underwater applications. FASS will be developed and marketed both as a stand-alone device and as an embedded, non-intrusive system. Commercial applications include aerospace vehicles, submarines, ships, boats, atmospheric wind sensing, oceanographic measurements, and tall structures.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
? High-Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) platform, including solar-powered vehicles and remotely operated aircraft (ROA) program. 
<br>? High-altitude and high-endurance UAVs such as Global Hawk
<br>? Mars exploration plane.
<br>? Reusable Launch Vehicles.
<br>? All NASA flight-testing R&D applications, from low speeds to  supersonic speeds. 
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
? Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLV). There is now a strong spurt in developing RLV. FASS will be a valuable component of such vehicles and will provide accurate and reliable information for the flight-critical reentry phase of the flight envelope
<br>? FASS will be useful for UAV and UCAV, particularly because of its desirable features like low power consumption, small size, and weight
<br>? FASS will be used by high altitude airship (HAA) used for long endurance vehicles that require to be accurately controlled and maintained in fixed positions for long duration
<br>? FASS can be retrofitted on all existing small and large, civilian and military aircraft and helicopters. The low speed and accurate angle of attack and side-slip angle features will contribute significantly to their safety, performance and control.
<br>? FASS will also be useful for underwater applications. For example, FASS can be used with waterproofed sensors to operate on submarines.
<br>? FASS will find use in atmospheric and oceanographic engineering applications.

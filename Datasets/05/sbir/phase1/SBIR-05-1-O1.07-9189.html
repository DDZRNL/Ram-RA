<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
AeroAstro proposes to develop a low-power, low-volume and lightweight, state-of-the-art digital radio capable of operating in a wide variety of bands, from VHF through Ka microwave, with data transceive capabilities of voice, telemetry, and high-resolution video.  This device is intended for use in manned extra-vehicular activities (EVAs) in deep-space environments, on lunar and planetary surfaces, and in the links and networks involved in end-to-end data flow.  This radio is innovative in several aspects: in its size and power, in its modularity that allows the ability to handle different bands, in its use of software radio technologies, in its automatic adaptability to varying transmission environments, and in its reliability and fault-tolerant performance.  This technology is paramount to the safety and success of manned missions in space, where unpredictable environments are present and where reliability is absolutely critical.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Any of the NASA's planned manned space missions would benefit from the advantages offered by the radio AeroAstro is proposing to design, whether it's an orbiting space station, a short-range mission, a lunar or planetary mission, or any number of EVA applications for which it is ultimately intended.  In particular, EVA spacesuits require a radio that is small, lightweight, and requires minimal power.  AeroAstro's design offers a solution that will allow astronauts to safely and easily maneuver during EVA activities and maintain reliable communications with other EVA astronauts and those on the planetary surface even in harsh and unpredictable environments.
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This radio is very universal and applicable almost anywhere that radio communications are needed, although it is particularly targeted to those applications where ultra-high reliability is required.  Any emergency service where on-the-fly reconfigurability would allow them to interoperate amongst themselves would be good candidates.  In addition, any military or government organization requiring a high-level communications network could benefit from this radio.  It will easily handle encrypted data, and its wide bandwidth would allow it to handle real-time video.  Its frequency agility might be useful in wide frequency hopping systems for low-probability-of-intercept (LPI) communications or anti-jam systems.

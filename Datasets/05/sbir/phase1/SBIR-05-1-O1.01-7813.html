<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Images from space satellites, whether deep space or planetary, are often compressed in a lossy manner to ease transmission requirements such as power, error-rate, and data stream size. These requirements differ from standard computer image processing requirements since storage space, processing speed, and power constraints differ between PCs and satellites. To facilitate use of satellite images in other applications such as data dissemination, image analysis, image storage and retrieval, etc., a method is needed to convert satellite images to a more widely supported format. However, since many formats lose information ("lossy" compression), too many transcodings, poorly performed transcodings, or transcodings between poorly chosen formats will degrade image quality, sometimes making them useless. Images such as military photos and deep space objects require high quality, so it is desirable to avoid or minimize loss during transcodings. NASA has requested software transcoding from the CSSDS Image Data Compression recommendation to JPEG2000 with minimal image degradation. This proposal shows how Cybernet will approach this conversion, obtaining a minimal or zero loss in image fidelity, through mathematical analysis and careful software construction. This will be shown to be possible due to the specific wavelet compression techniques used in the two formats.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The technology developed, a CCSDS Image Data Compression to JPEG2000 conversion tool, would be useful throughout NASA for converting space images to a more widely supported format, while still retaining as much of the image quality as possible. This PC based tool could be incorporated into any ground location that needs to receive satellite and probe images in the CCSDS and send them to other agencies, news outlets, and scientists in a format more suitable for use. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Cybernet has a range of image based products, from gesture guided weather software used on television networks to graphics toolkits for terrain visualization, and the competency we gain from work on the JPEG2000 format would benefit our core products. Furthermore, given time to develop a comprehensive JPEG2000 code base, we would market this library to other developers without the people or resources to develop it on their own.

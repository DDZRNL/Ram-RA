<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Lightweight composite structures are required to provide space vehicles with increased thrust-to-weight ratio and durability.  New methods for toughening composites that also add functionality, such as making high temperature structural composites more thermally and electrically conductive, can increase spacecraft performance.  Infoscitex proposes to enhance toughness of a thermal-oxidatively stable structural composite by more than 50 percent (measured by G1C) by depositing dispersed carbon nanofibers within insulating, resin-rich, interlaminar regions. Our approach also increases z-direction thermal and electrical conductivity, enabling dissipation of heat and electrical charge from hot spacecraft power supply and propulsion enclosures.  In Phase I, we will process commercial carbon nanofibers and high temperature composite prepreg into nanofiber-toughened and control composite test panels using an autoclave.  Cured composite test panels will be tested for G1C, open hole tensile and short beam shear strength, thermal and electrical conductivity and failure analysis to demonstrate feasibility.  In Phase II, we will refine the composite toughening process and materials, conduct compression-after-impact tests, scale-up and produce a prototype multifunctional composite spacecraft structure for testing.  Our team includes commercial prepreg and carbon nanofiber suppliers, a space vehicle structure manufacturer and experts in high temperature composite processing.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed biomimetic enhanced damage tolerance high temperature system will find use in ultralightweight, multifuctional, structural applications for future space vehicle platforms.  The high temperature performance of the composite will make it particularly attractive for hot zones of the space vehicles approaching 700F.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In addition to NASA applications, the composite technology will be attractive for terrestrial aircraft (i.e. advanced military aircraft).  Additional applications include body and vehicle armor with enhanced ballistic performance.

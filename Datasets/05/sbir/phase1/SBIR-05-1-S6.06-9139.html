<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Our objective is to develop a compact scanning Fabry-Perot spectrometer, for satellite far-infrared astronomy and Earth remote sensing, that operates at wavelengths of 100 ?m and longer, with a resolving power of 10,000 and free spectral range of ~50 cm-1.  The novelty of this innovation lies in obtaining this very large free spectral range simultaneously with a resolution equivalent to the state of the art for laboratory far-infrared spectrophotometers in a volume less than a liter and directly suitable for airborne and satellite instrumentation. The critical innovation lies in providing far-infrared Fabry-Perot mirrors of >99.99% reflectance to enable unprecedented system finesse.  This mirror development and proof testing, and a systems analysis of an F-P spectrometer subsystem for satellite and aerial imaging are the subject of Phase I;  Phase II includes design, fabrication and testing of the miniature spectrometer.

Far-infrared Fabry-Perot (F-P) spectrometers are widely used in satellite-based astronomy [1-3], in atmospheric monitoring [4], and as filters to suppress sidebands of heterodyne receivers [5, 6].  The far-infrared spectra of galactic sources are used to determine atomic and molecular abundances, temperatures and electron densities [7], and high resolution is needed in the study of molecular line shapes, which are important for kinematic studies.  Far-infrared spectra are useful to measure abundancies of atmospheric gases such as H20, O3, CO, and N2O [4, 8].  Even non-polar atmospheric molecules such as N2, O2, and CO2 can be detected at submillimeter wavelengths due to weak transient dipole moments induced by collisions [4].  Other minor atmospheric constituents such as HNO3, NO2, HCl, HF, and OH may be detected also [4].   Applications include spectrophotometric instrumentation and scanning-narrow-band filters for imaging, in a very small, lightweigh, low power module.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
THz imaging and spectral analysis is rapidly becoming important in defense and security applications for identifying concealed threats and contraband (13, 14).  New detector and source technology is permitting increasing productization of this part of the spectrum (15).  THz radiation readily passes through packaging, envelopes, and clothing.  Aside from permitting concealed weapon imaging without ionizing radiation, spectral/imaging analysis has been shown to be useful for rapid imaging of concealed drugs (16) and bioagents, and for dental (17) and medical (18, 19) challenges.

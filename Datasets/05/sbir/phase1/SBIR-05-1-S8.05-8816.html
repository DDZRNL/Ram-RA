<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
ITN Energy Systems, Inc., in collaboration with the Center for Composite Materials (CCM) at the University of Delaware, proposes to design and develop multifunctional structure-battery panels for next generation space structures than can be integrated into exploration vehicles or space habitats. The multifunctional panels significantly reduce parasitic mass and volume thereby significantly increasing mission capability for future space missions.
<br>
<br>In its on-going pursuit of lightweight, low-cost systems, the space industry has made significant investments in "high payoff" technologies such as composite structures and high energy-density batteries.  These individual technologies are now "mature", and are "standard" for most new space designs.  Additional investment in these areas would yield only a few percent improvements over current performance.  Faced with these "diminishing returns", it is clear that future progress demands revolutionary new concepts for space subsystems.
<br>
<br>ITN believes that this challenge can best be met using Multifunctional Structures (MFS). Structure and electrical power are the two heaviest subsystems on space platforms.  In addition, batteries often represent the most voluminous component of the spacecraft bus.  Therefore, structure and batteries have been the subject of intense R&D in efforts to reduce mass and improve performance.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The need for mass/volume efficient energy storage materials is prevalent throughout NASA missions including space exploration, space habitats, earth observing satellites, etc. As power and structure are two of the largest components of most space systems, significant savings can be realized with multifunctional panels. The cost and logistics of providing current heavy energy/power and structural components into space are a major limitation for current mission capabilities.  Mission capabilities could be significantly extended with the proposed multifunctional panels. The proposed structure-energy panels have several attractive features for space systems
<br>&#9679; High cycle life (>10,000 cycles with minimal loss of capacity?less than 5%)that allows battery life commensurate with structural lifetimes
<br>&#9679; One hundred percent depth of discharge that eliminates oversizing of battery packs 
<br>&#9679; Very long shelf-life with limited self-discharge to make it attractive for emergency back-up power systems
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A significant advantage of the proposed approach is that it employs mass and volume efficient energy storage systems that are needed for wide ranging applications from consumer electronics to military space systems. Increased capacity and lifetime are drivers for computer and cell phone batteries, remote battery charging systems for commercial and military customers, etc. These complementary markets offer the potential of leveraging low-cost commercial products.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In response to NASA Topic S7.01, Visual Learning Systems, Inc. (VLS) will develop a novel hyperspectral plug-in toolkit for its award winning Feature Analyst<SUP>REG</SUP> software that will (a) leverage VLS' proven algorithms to provide a new, simple, and long-awaited approach to materials classification from hyperspectral imagery (HSI), and (b) improve state-of-the-art Feature Analyst's automated feature extraction (AFE) capabilities by effectively incorporating detailed spectral information into its extraction process.  HSI techniques, such as spectral end-member classification, can provide effective materials classification; however, current methods are slow (or manual), cumbersome, complex for analysts, and are limited to materials classification only. Feature Analyst, on the other hand has a simple workflow of (a) an analyst providing a few examples (e.g., pixels of a certain material) and (b) an advanced software agent classifying the rest of the imagery based on the examples.  This simple yet powerful approach will be used as a new paradigm for materials classification.  In addition, Feature Analyst uses, along with spectral information, feature characteristics such as spatial association, size, shape, texture, pattern, and shadow in its generic AFE process.   Incorporating the best spectral classifier techniques with the best AFE approach promises to greatly increase the usefulness and applicability of HSI

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed technology will greatly simplify the application of hyperspectral image processing and feature extraction for a wide variety of NASA related earth imagery applications including:
<br>
<br>1.  Forestry and Environmental solutions to support timber management applications, wildfire modeling, and land-use analysis. The US Forest Service has already purchased a site license of Feature Analyst and their use of hyperspectral data increases. 
<br>
<br>2.  Civil Government applications for such activities as pervious-impervious surface mapping, creation and maintenance of GIS data layers for roads and structures, identification of urban green space.
<br>
<br>3.  Homeland Security solutions for the creation and maintenance of GIS data layers. The newly created Department of Homeland Security has a budget of over $30 billion. Identification and mapping of high-value assets (pipelines, power plants, etc), monitoring of borders, and development of 3D urban models for preparing disaster and emergency services.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In addition to NASA based mapping applications from imagery the proposed technology will also potentially support the following non-NASA uses:
<br>
<br>1. Medical imaging where hyperspectral imaging is used to detect tumors.
<br>
<br>2. Manufacturing processes where hyperspectral imaging is used for product quality assurance and quality control.

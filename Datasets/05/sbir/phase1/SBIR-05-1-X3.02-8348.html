<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are attractive candidates for use as power sources in aerospace applications because they have high specific energy ( up to 200 Wh/kg) and energy density (~ 500 Wh/L) and long cycle life (1,000 ? 30,000 cycles currently depending on the depth of cycling). However, at temperatures below about ?10<SUP>o</SUP>C, their charge/discharge performance is severely degraded which hinders their use in deep space and planetary missions. This decrease in performance may be due to the precipitation of ethylene carbonate (EC) at low temperatures, which may prevent the migration of Li+ ions between the electrodes during charge and discharge. We propose to determine the cause of the EC precipitation. Appropriate electrolyte systems will be designed to prevent phase separation of the electrolyte at low temperatures during charge and discharge.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
High-energy, rechargeable batteries capable of operating over a wide temperature range are of interest for a number of NASA applications such as orbiters, rovers, space vehicles, satellites, and astronaut equipment. Li-ion batteries are good candidates for many of these applications. The proposed work will extend the low temperature range of these batteries allowing their use on a wider variety of missions.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Li-ion batteries capable of operating over a wide temperature range are needed for a wide variety of civilian and military applications. These applications include electric and hybrid vehicles, satellites, aircraft, portable power tools, portable medical equipment, and other similar applications where the battery is operated outdoors and an external device may not be available to control the temperature of the battery.

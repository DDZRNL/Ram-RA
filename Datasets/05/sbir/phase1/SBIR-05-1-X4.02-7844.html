<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
It is proposed to develop and implement a simulation of spacecraft rendezvous and docking guidance, navigation, and control in elliptical orbit. The foundation of the simulation will be an extension of an existing tool for optimal rendezvous and docking simulations for spacecraft in circular orbit. The existing tool architecture functions in two phases. In the first phase, optimal trajectories are obtained for the point mass model of the docking vehicle subject to path constraints, with the assumption that the target vehicle is in a known, circular orbit. In the second phase of the simulation, the vehicle is considered as a rigid body whose attitude and trajectory is controlled such that the docking port is aligned with the target vehicle at the time of docking, and the flight path follows the optimal trajectory. It is proposed to extend the first phase trajectory optimization capability of this tool to the case when the target vehicle is in an elliptical orbit, and to also add the capability to model rendezvous navigation sensors in order to make use of estimated state feedback rather than true state feedback during the second phase of the simulation.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Potential NASA applications are in the area of generating requirements and for performing analysis of potential vehicle designs for missions requiring a rendezvous and docking capability, such as CEV missions to the ISS.  The rendezvous and docking simulation capability is expected to aid the mission design process for both robotic and human exploration missions to the moon and beyond.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Applications outside of NASA are expected to be in the area of sales of software and services to large aerospace corporations that are designing the CEV. The rendezvous and docking simulation capability is expected to aid the vehicle design process in the area of thruster and docking port layout. The enhanced sensor modeling capability proposed would also aid the design of avionics packages for these vehicles.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Precision membrane optical shell (PMOS) technology is an innovative combination of 1) ultra lightweight optically smooth membrane thin films, 2) advanced mold based fabrication techniques that transform the films into single surface load bearing structures through the introduction of optically relevant permanent curvature, and 3) discrete active boundary control that enables rigid body alignment and maintainment of optical prescriptions in face of environmental disturbances.  Reflector areal densities of better than 2 kg/m2 (including alignment and figure control actuators) are projected.  Current, measured surface figure is better than 1 to 3 microns rms at the 0.2m size, and we are poised for further improvements.  Basic demonstrated manufacturing techniques are scaleable to 1.4m+ diameter single surface apertures.  Materials are space proven, and stowage and deployment techniques exist that support eventual transition to space flight application. Mevicon Inc. and its team members, UAT, thus proposes the required further improvements of basic technology and the demonstration of applicability of Precision Membrane Optical Shell (PMOS) technology for ground and space based LIDAR receivers.  The key resulting innovation is implementation of improved formation approaches to realize very low mass, low cost LIDAR apertures.  Other NASA and DOD applications are expected as precision and aperture size increase.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The potential pay off of the proposed research can be summarized at the highest level as, "Less Mass, Less Cost".  It is directly applicable to the needs of ground, air and space based LIDAR applications, as it could lead to significant cost reductions for optical primary mass, especially as aperture size grows to support increased standoff ranges.   Farther term, we see potential synergistic applications in the area of 1) very large diameter stowable/deployable apertures to enable RF, mm, IR (Far, Middle, and Near (With suitable cooling), science, and 2) increasing larger diameter precision apertures to enable Laser Comm Transmitter apertures, visible wavelength spectroscopy, and potentially imaging astronomy.  Potential uses as components in solar concentrators for orbital power generation and solar thermal propulsion, and as sun shields and telescope aperture opening shields are also envisaged.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed technology is dual use.  Many of the same applications of interest to NASA are of interest to DoD for space and terrestrial applicaitons.  Similar interest is expected from other national organizations and science community.  Potential use in amateur astronomy is also possible.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Large scale numerical simulations, as typified by climate models, space weather models, and the like, typically involve non-linear governing equations in discretized form, subject to initial and/or boundary conditions. Large scale simulations may be employed in a coupled manner, with the output of one simulation providing input data to another. Simulation execution may require significant 'wall clock' time to complete, resources such as memory and CPU, and may involve components that are networked and the need for resources such as input data files or temporary local storage of intermediate data products. With collaboratories and the increase in interdisciplinary and multi-investigator scientific projects, there is an increase in distributed, networked, and coupled scientific simulations. Moreover, problem complexity may require that multiple sets of parameters in the problem space be investigated, thus necessitating multiple simulation runs. With simulation runs extending in time, involving networked components, and networked resource usage, setting-up and monitoring these runs is non-trivial and increasingly time intensive. Such activity can waste a researcher's time; yet the simulation runs must be set-up and then monitored, as crashes, missing components, permission problems, network problems, etc., do occur. Our innovation is a self-regulating, autonomic, agent-based framework that can manage simulation runs.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary result from this SBIR project will be the Autonomic, Agent-based Simulation Management System,  'A2SM'. Autonomic qualities involve behaviors that are self-healing, self-configuring, self-optimizing, and self-protecting. Software systems with these qualities are more robust and reliable. Our efforts will result in a full design for A2SM, with identification of the strategies for developing autonomic components and mechanisms,  including policy. A working prototype for A2SM, built on IAI's Cybele agent platform, will also be developed under this Phase I SBIR.  The A2SM system will support management of all NASA simulations types; saving time for scientists and engineers.  The simulation will be particular helpful in large scale simulations for space weather, earth sciences modeling, as well as other areas such as management of V&V simulations.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
While the A2SM application is developed for managing large scale simulations, resulting design elements are re-usable. The resulting autonomic type systems are useful for any organizational needs that involve distributed, de-centralized software applications that may have dependencies. The A2SM framework, suitable for integrating applications, can be geared to commercial enterprise areas, such as banks, etc. The k is also suitable for managing Semantic Web or Grid applications.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Solar sails are an attractive means for propulsion of future spacecraft. One potential device for deploying and supporting very large solar sails is the CoilAble boom made by ATK Space Systems - Goleta (formally AEC-Able Engineering). CoilAble's have a long and reliable track record in space. KaZaK Composites is a major developer and supplier of pultruded composite structural members used in CoilAble booms. For solar sail applications, it is important to develop advanced technologies that create the lightest possible booms. KaZaK is already pultruding advanced solar sail test hardware made with IM-9 carbon fiber as a first step toward improving solar sails. This SBIR proposal will identify a replacement for the recently out-of-production IM-9 baseline carbon fiber, and pursue three additional lines of investigation aimed at creating significant improvements in next generation solar sail structures. Specifically, we will investigate methods for making 1) near-zero CTE pultruded members of unlimited length via materials hybridization, 2) very lightweight tubular structures, with and without cores, to reduce the weight of solar sail longerons, and 3) passively damped structures achieved by additives to the matrix of pultruded composite sail materials. Mast structural elements made with least one and possibly several of these technologies will be prototyped and tested in Phase I.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Because of KaZaK's close working relationship with a major spacecraft boom manufacturer, the proposed technology will be immediately applicable, once demonstrated and perfected, for improving the performance of spacecraft coilable booms in conventional space systems as well as solar sails. Passive damping of the type proposed could be applied to all vibration and noise sensitive space systems, such as payload shrouds. The same technology could be used to reduce aircraft and train cabin interior noise. The pultruded tubes with internal fins could be used as solar panel and other spacecraft component heat pipes for thermal control.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The low-cost, low density, and simplicity of the proposed passive damping technology, one component of the proposed work, will make it attractive to the automobile and commercial aircraft markets, where noise control in vehicle interiors is a major concern.  A significant, proprietary sporting goods application for the damper is discussed in the proposal body. The proposed tube making technology has application in heat pipes of the type used in portable computers. Materials hybridized for zero-CTE has application in the electronics industry, scientific instruments and medical devices.

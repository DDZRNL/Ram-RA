<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
An important consideration of the use of superconducting magnets in ADR applications is shielding of the other instruments in the vicinity of the superconducting magnets. For example in a telescope application the magnetic field at about 1m away from the magnet may need to be in milli-gauss range. Shielding without proper technology and optimization can add unnecessary weight to the magnet system that can amount to a few times the weight of the superconducting magnet itself. This proposal discusses various approaches in shielding of Nb3Sn ADR magnets and suggests a program to develop the capability required to achieve effective shielding schemes that provide required shielding with minimum weight, and maximum reliability.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This program is designed to achieve high operational efficiency for superconducting ADR magnets in space, and to meet space launch requirements. The program will develop technologies for manufacturing of lightweight well-shielded superconducting magnets operating at 10K and low currents. In addition to direct benefits to cooling efficiency of space cryogenic systems, these technologies will have a positive impact on efficiency of superconducting magnets used in motors, actuator, imaging devices, high-power electric propulsion, and detectors with potential use in space applications.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The program will develop technologies for manufacturing of lightweight well-shielded superconducting Nb3Sn magnets operating at 10K. Currently many commercial superconducting magnets use NbTi wires and are cryogen-free. These magnets use commercial cryocoolers that can achieve cooling capacity of 0.5-1W at 4K. The input power requirement of these cryocoolers range between 3-5 KW. Operations at 10K can allow the input power to be reduced by a factor of 2-3. With the continuous rise in price of fuel, reduction in input power has a high potential to drive the cryogen-free superconducting market towards Nb3Sn magnets operating at 10K.

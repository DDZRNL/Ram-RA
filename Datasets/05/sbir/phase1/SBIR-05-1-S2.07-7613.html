<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Most major accidents do not result simply from proximal, physical events, but from the gradual drift of an organization to a state of heightened risk.  Risk often increases so gradually that no one notices, as safeguards and constraints are relaxed due to conflicting goals.  When a mishap occurs, it is almost inevitable that some event will trigger an accident.  A comprehensive risk analysis method must include organizational decision-making, system complexity, technical innovation, evolution over time, and non-linear, indirect, and feedback relationships.  A new risk analysis approach addressing these issues has been developed at MIT.  This approach asserts that organizational structure and behavior can be modeled, analyzed, and engineered.  It is based on the STAMP (System-Theoretic Accident Modeling and Processes), STAMP-based hazard analysis (STPA), and system dynamics modeling.  When it was applied to a risk analysis of the NASA independent technical authority (for the NASA Chief Engineer's Office), it became apparent a simplified methodology and tool support could benefit such a risk analysis effort.  Safeware Engineering Corporation proposes to develop an innovative modeling methodology and software tool support for the application of this rigorous new risk analysis approach as the next step toward development of an organizational risk management tool.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The techniques upon which this proposed research is based have already been used with success in a risk analysis of the NASA Independent Technical Authority.  Safeware Engineering's proposed research would simplify the method of conducting the analysis and provide software tool support, allowing for broader use within NASA.  The risk analysis methodology produced by the proposed research, as well as the tool to be developed in phase II, could potentially apply to any NASA project with a need to identify and mitigate the risks associated with complex technical management and decision-making.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
If successful through Phase 2, the project will result in a commercial quality risk analysis software tool based on an innovative new risk analysis approach.  Rather than relying on the experience and ad hoc observations of risk analysis experts, analysts and managers will be able to produce a concrete model of their organization and its behavior.  Experiments to evaluate new policies and organizational structures will be carried out using simulation and analysis tools, where it is impractical or impossible to experiment on a real organization.

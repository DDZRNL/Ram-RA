<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Precise location information is critical for crewmembers for safe EVA Moon and Mars exploration.  Current inertial navigation systems are too bulky, fragile, and expensive for this purpose and therefore cannot meet NASA requirements.  To address these requirements, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes a novel Time and Relative Distance Inertial Navigation System (TARDIS), a compact, cost-effective solution providing EVA crewmembers and monitoring personnel with location and orientation to home base. With this information, TARDIS will generate a 3D navigation track of the astronaut's movement, which the astronaut can compare to a preplanned path, as well as key reference points, such as the base camp, rover, and destination.  TARDIS builds on POC's smart inertial sensor cluster technology, integrating compact dedicated microprocessors with inertial microelectromechanical systems in a purely digital six-degree-of-freedom inertial navigation system in an extremely small volume.  This is coupled with a Kalman filter for optimal position estimation.  Spatial operator analysis (SOA) derives the relative orientation of an EVA crewmember's arms and legs to specify current activity (bending, walking, sitting, climbing). In Phase I POC will prove the concept by demonstrating a scaled-down working model with a limited number of sensors.  In Phase II POC will demonstrate a complete working prototype.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Not only is TARDIS ideal for monitoring the overall position and orientation of EVA crewmembers during Moon and Mars exploration, it could also be adapted for use within low Earth orbit to provide specific real-time kinematic information to ground controllers over the existing RTDS.  This would greatly enhance the efficiency and after-action review data of EVA repair and deployment missions and be a major advancement in EVA safety technology.  Furthermore, since TARDIS would be integrated into the existing spacesuit, it could also be used during water tank training missions to provide optimal ergonomic data.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The small size and low cost of the TARDIS system make it an ideal navigation module for the automotive and general aviation markets.  The self-contained inertial system will provide location data without GPS coverage, which is essential when cars travel outside of GPS coverage zones such as in mountainous areas, forests, and tunnels.  The small size and low cost of TARDIS mean that it could also be integrated into firefighter or search-and-rescue uniforms to provide precise overall location and arm and leg kinematic models under hazardous conditions, which could then be transmitted to monitoring personnel outside the hazard zone.

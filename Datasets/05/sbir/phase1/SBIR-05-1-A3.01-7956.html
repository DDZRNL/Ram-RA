<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Aerotonomy, Incorporated, and subcontractors Georgia Tech and the AAI Corporation will combine state-of-the-art adaptive UAV control, optimized sensor suites, innovative strategic and tactical maneuvering systems, and a wealth of experience in manufacturing and operating Tactical UAVs (including the Shadow 200) to create a practical and autonomous See-and-Avoid System (SAAS) for safe UAV operations within the National Airspace System (NAS) and outside of Special Use Airspace.  The SAAS will enable UAVs to autonomously perform both strategic maneuvering to follow the same predictable "right-of-way rules" followed by manned aircraft, as well as tactical maneuvering to perform close quarter collision avoidance.  The primary innovation in this project is the Strategic Maneuvering System (SMS), a rule-based "maneuver executive" that will enable a UAV to interact with manned aircraft or other UAVs in a manner that is predictable and consonant with NAS operating procedures.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The most immediate and obvious synergy with an existing NASA program is the Access 5 program.  Although some specifics of the Access 5 program differ from this project (Access 5 focuses on UAV operations above 18,000 ft. while we focus on operations below 18,000 ft.; also our SAAS considers UAVs and manned aircraft that may not be equipped with transponders), many of the conclusions and lessons learned during Access 5 will greatly benefit the proposed program.  The deliverables of the proposed program will also directly benefit Access 5.  
<br>The SAAS developed in this program will also have potential applications to several other NASA programs including work on modernizing the Air Traffic Management System taking place at the NASA Ames Research Center, as well as the work on Intelligent Flight Controls being done by the Adaptive Controls Group in the Intelligent Systems Division of NASA Ames Research Center.
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
AAI Corporation, the manufacturer of the Shadow family of UAV systems, recognizes the potential benefits of the proposed technology and has endorsed our proposal.  AAI's wide range of UAV products and advanced development activities provide numerous opportunities for NASA, military, and commercial application of the technologies developed here.  
<br>In addition to opportunities with AAI, Aerotonomy will pursue commercialization of these technologies with other major UAV systems developers, such as Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Atomics, Aerovironment, Lockheed Martin, and Aurora Flight Sciences.  We will also seek synergistic funding from the DoD and other government agencies including the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Army, and DARPA for additional research, systems development, and testing.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Scheduling the daily activities of the crew on a human space mission is currently a cumbersome job performed by a large team of operations experts on the ground.  This process is expensive, inflexible, and inconvenient for the crew in the spacecraft.  As mission durations increase, it will become vital to give the crew more autonomy and reduce operations costs.  We propose an Onboard Automated Scheduling Intelligence System (OASIS) that will automate scheduling work, giving the crew more autonomy and drastically reducing operations costs.  
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
OASIS has immediate application in human space flight crew scheduling. The tool will improve crew autonomy and productivity, and cut costs, while preserving the safety and flexibility of current scheduling techniques.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Stottler Henke will market OASIS to the commercial space flight community.  Also, in the process of implementing the proposed system we will be upgrading our generalized scheduling engine, Aurora, furthering our efforts to market Aurora to the manufacturing and supply-chain community.

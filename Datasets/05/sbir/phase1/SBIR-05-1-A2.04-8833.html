<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose an innovative pulsed laser vibrometer technology for the monitoring of interior noise inside an aircraft. The optical speckle-tolerant nature of the pulsed laser vibrometer, coupled with its high sensitivity and bandwidth in surface vibration monitoring, makes the proposed technology ideal for the monitoring of aircraft interior vibrations from surfaces with widely varying colors and degrees of optical speckle inducing power. The highly sensitive pulsed laser vibrometer allows handheld, portable operation, even in places difficult to access, thanks to its remote and non-contact nature for surface vibration monitoring. Other advantages enabled by the proposed technology include the compactness and low optical power requirement, which make it ideal for deployment in situations where the availability of space and power can be significantly restricted, for example, spaceborne applications. The feasibility of using the proposed photo-EMF pulsed laser vibrometer to monitoring surface vibrations of samples with widely varying surface characteristics will be demonstrated during the Phase I program. A working prototype pulsed laser vibrometer system for aircraft interior noise monitoring will be developed during the Phase II research program.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Successful execution of this proposed program will lead to a compact, highly sensitive, and low power-consumption pulsed laser vibrometer capable of detecting surface vibrations with high sensitivity and bandwidth. The optical speckle-tolerant nature of the proposed technology makes it ideal for applications including the inspection of structural integrity of turbine engine blades, the integrity of insulation foams on the space shuttles. Further NASA applications include the monitoring of operational characteristics of mechanical apparatus through vibration sensing.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Potential non-NASA commercial applications include the quality control on industrial assembly lines, for example, household appliances and automotive windshield wiper motors, as well as the monitoring of the performance and maintenance of machines, for example, locomotive engines.

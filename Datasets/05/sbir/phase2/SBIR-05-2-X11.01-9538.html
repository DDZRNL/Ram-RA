<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Computer codes such as MCNPX now have the capability to transport most high energy particle types (34 particle types now supported in MCNPX) with energies extending into the teravolt energy range. The efficient use of these types of Monte Carlo tools is very important for modeling the effects of space radiation on humans, spacecraft and equipment. This proposal would develop a graphical user interface for high energy multi-particle transport. With this innovation, users of the MCNPX code would have access to a powerful graphical user interface for efficient creation and interrogation of their input files, which would significantly reduce the amount of time required to create and debug input files.<br><br>Specific enhancements that are proposed include the implementation of the Los Alamos Quark-Gluon String Model Module in MCNPX;  adding the source creation capability to the graphical user interface; improvements to data visualization and 3D geometry plotting; and the investigation of implementing spline surfaces in MCNPX.

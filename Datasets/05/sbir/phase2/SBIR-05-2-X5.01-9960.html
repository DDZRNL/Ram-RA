<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
This proposal is for the creation of a system-level software specification and verification tool. This proposal suggests a major leap-forward in usability of modeling, code generation, Runtime Verification (RV), and Automatic Test Generation (ATG) from the component-level to the system-level. <br>1.	We will create a specification and run-time verification environment for system-level specifications using J-MSC assertions and distributed assertions. J-MSC assertions are a UML-based system-level formal specification language. In phase-I we demonstrated J-MSC assertion and distributed assertion specification and monitoring. In phase-II we will construct an editor, code-generator, and run-time monitor for J-MSC assertions and for distributed assertions. <br>2.	We will create  system-level verification environment, compliant with the de-facto JUnit testing framework, including: <br>?	RV of J-MSC assertions for system verification combined with statechart-assertions for the component level. <br>?	RV of distributed assertions.<br>?	System-level  white-box ATG of UML controller models and assertions: white-box ATG for a plurality controller modules and for a plurality of controller instances.<br>?	Combined black-box/Matlab and white-box ATG, with support for both open-loop and closed loop techniques.<br>?	White-box ATG based on real-time contracts of system components. <br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA/JPL relies heavily on Matlab for system modeling. On the other hand, existing tools and techniques for robust and scalable software verification are primarily component-level. In fact, the prevailing NASA organizational approach separates Matlab modeling from embedded-software development and verification, with separate teams working on those respective issues. Robust system-level verification that is also combined with Matlab environment data will provide significant improvement to the level of NASA's system and software safety in two respects: (i) raising the level of specification and verification from the component-level to the verification-level, and (ii) real-life Matlab environment models created by the Matlab modeling team will be usable in conjunction with robust formal methods for the verification of embedded software.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Time Rover's component-level, UML-based, modeling, specification, RV, and WBATG, are already commercially successful. For example, the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) project is using our tools instead of their initial plans to use IBM/Rational Rose Real-time. Time Rover's tools are the only such tools that have been successful on a commercial basis. The BMD is distributed in nature and therefore deserves system-level specification and verification techniques that rise above the component level, as suggested by this proposal. <br>In addition, we see an emerging market of V&V of safety critical applications, which include: DoD related projects (automated army and navy safety critical embedded software control), civilian aerospace avionics and air-traffic control, railway control, and power generation and distribution control.<br>

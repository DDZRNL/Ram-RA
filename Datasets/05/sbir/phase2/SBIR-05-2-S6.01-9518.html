<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
MetroLaser proposes to design and develop an innovative narrowband tunable IR filter based on the properties of a one-dimensional photonic crystal structure with a resonant cavity. Such structure would exhibit an ultra-narrow, high-throughput band in the middle of a wide, low-transmission stop-band. During Phase I, through an extensive and detailed analysis, we performed a feasibility study to establish the operational characteristics and performance of the proposed tunable filter. Following this, we assembled and tested a breadboard and demonstrated filter tunability over 4 cm 1 with bandpass close to 0.25 cm-1, rejection level better than 23 dB, and acceptance angle of about 1 degree at 10.6 microns. The acquired data demonstrated our optimal approach for designing and constructing an ultra-narrow tunable optical bandpass filter. During Phase II, we will design, build, deliver to NASA, and perform field testing of a compact and robust prototype module of a 1" diameter narrowband filter with a tunability range of 10 cm-1, a bandpass range of 0.1 cm-1, background rejection of 30 dB, and transmittance better than 50%. A rugged and monolithic filter design will allow this instrument to be incorporated in air- or space-based platforms providing stable performance in harsh operating environments.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed narrowband tunable IR bandpass filter will expand the capabilities of NASA's Earth-Sun System Division for high spectral resolution and high accuracy measurements of tropospheric, atmospheric, and surface parameters from space and airborne platforms. These include remote sensing capabilities, measurements of climate and meteorological parameters, and terrain mapping.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed narrowband tunable bandpass filter will find commercial applications in space-based and airborne multi-spectral imaging and remote sensing systems, including tropospheric chemistry studies and atmospheric science. It will expand capabilities for high accuracy spectral measurements within the tunable narrow spectral regions necessary for resolving individual spectral features. Due to its high spectral resolution, wide tunability range, compactness, ruggedness and stability, the proposed filter will allow for innovative solutions in high-resolution spectroscopic instrumentation, especially when portable devices are of interest.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Large-scale agent systems have become a key part of in modeling and simulation tools such as NASA's Airspace Concept Evaluation System (ACES), an agent-based simulation of the National Airspace System (NAS).  As distributed real-world systems comprised of many autonomous decision-making entities become more complex, so do their corresponding individual models and simulation systems.   However, existing tools for low-level single host debugging, data and event collection and local analysis do not adequately address the problem of understanding large distributed systems consisting of thousands of autonomously executing agents. In this Phase II effort, we propose to create a comprehensive semantic debugging and knowledge discovery and analysis system for agent-based simulations called IntelliTrace.  The key innovation behind semantic and model driven system analysis is that it will bridge the gap between the semantics of model execution and the resultant implementation behavior realized within a software system.  We will use theses tools and capabilities to develop and demonstrate a methodology and approach for application-level analysis, knowledge and discovery and data mining and analysis.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Ongoing ACES development, ACES concept development, and the related Aces with Communications Navigation and Surveillance (AwCNS) project and follow on will both immediate benefit from the IntelliTrace tool. The proposed capability and tools have immediate usefulness to the ACES and AwCNS development teams.   It can be deployed concept developers within NASA, the ACES development team headed by Raytheon, and concept developers outside NASA.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
IAI is actively and currently using agent-based applications on development efforts in the following areas:<br>?	Modeling and simulation for ad-hoc mobile networks (Army)<br>?	Teams of underwater autonomous vehicles(Navy)<br>?	Scheduling and planning for logistics and space operations (Air Force)<br>?	Cognitive architectures simulation and modeling framework (DARPA) and ACIP Program<br>A generalized debugging and visualization approach is considered to be of key interest of all of these Cybele agent infrastructure users as agent-based development and software engineering becomes integrated into their deployed and/or modeling and simulation efforts.<br>

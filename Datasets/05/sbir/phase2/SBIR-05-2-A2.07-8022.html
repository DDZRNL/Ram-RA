<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
A novel and robust flow control technique for the virtual shaping of extended run Natural Laminar Flow (NLF) sections has been developed.  The virtual shaping and separation control technology can be used to control the size and extent of extremely large separation bubbles to virtually shape the aft recovery region of the airfoil.  The system uses a novel pressure porting technique that requires no external air source to produce a pulsed tangential jet in the separated region capable of partially or fully eliminating the presence of the separation bubble.  The novel pulsed jet system was shown to produce equivalent results to continuous blowing using approximately a 42% lower jet velocity and 87% lower momentum coefficient.  The virtual shaping of an extended run NLF section could offer radical performance enhancement in the form of increased lift-to-drag and maximum lift.  Additionally, the system will produce a wing design enabling a hinge-less, full-span virtual shaping capability, which can be used for pilot reactive roll control, span load tailoring, and gust load alleviation.  The system will provide significantly enhanced performance for the air vehicle throughout the entire flight envelope.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed virtual shaping and separation control technology has significant potential application in several NASA programs. The virtual shaping and flow control system could be fielded in several NASA unmanned aircraft systems, including m-UAVs, high-altitude long-endurance remotely operated aircraft (HALE-ROA) for reconnaissance, and Mars exploratory aircraft.  NASA designers will be eager to exploit the advantages of the current virtual shaping technology in airfoil designs and flow control systems.  The technology will deliver significantly enhanced performance as compared to traditional designs in a robust package. The system will be applicable throughout NASA's high altitude unmanned and m-UAV aviation community.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The commercialization potential is excellent for a robust and reliable low Reynolds number transition control system.  Potential customers include the U.S. Military and UAV manufacturers.  The U.S. military has begun to dramatically increase its use of unmanned aircraft.  With electronic payloads becoming larger and the requirement for longer endurance sensor platforms, the opportunity for the application of virtually shaped extended NLF sections will increase.  The aero performance and flight dynamics benefits of the novel technology will make the system appealing for current and future platforms.  Much like the U.S. Military, private UAV aircraft manufacturers will also find the technology very appealing.  With the number of manufacturers and the market for UAVs growing rapidly, UAV airframers will be eager to incorporate enhanced performance into their current and future designs in order to provide a competitive edge and make their product more appealing.

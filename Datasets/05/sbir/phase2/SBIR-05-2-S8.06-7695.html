<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Wide-bandgap SiC semiconductors have been recently investigated for use in power devices, because of their potential capabilities of operating at high power densities, high temperatures and at high frequencies and thus offering advantages such as high efficiency, small size and light weight.  Currently a few power devices based on SiC technology have been demonstrated and commercialized. Therefore, an opportunity exists to develop and demonstrate a SiC power inverter, showing the system-level impacts of using commercially available SiC power devices compared with an Si-based inverter, and addressing the related technical issues/risks of implementing SiC technology. Following a successful demonstration of the concept feasibility in Phase I, Phase II research will fully develop, demonstrate, model, and characterize a three-phase all SiC inverter. The inverter will be constructed through the integration of several supporting technologies including circuit design and device paralleling, high temperature packaging and thermal management, high temperature gate based on SOI technology, and other passive components. In the Phase II, the underlying technical issues that govern the fabrication and performance of this SiC inverter will be addressed, and its technical/economical benefits will be analyzed.  By implementing technology developed, a high-efficiency, compact SiC inverter technology can be anticipated for potential NASA and other applications.<br><br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA applications will include energy storage, renewable energy, nuclear power, electrical drives. The use of the high temperature packaging and operation of SiC power modules for its power electronics equipment will bring about the benefits of increase in power density, reduction in heat sink requirements (thus smaller size and mass), and higher frequency operation that also results in lower mass for the filters and transformers. In addition, the capabilities of handling higher voltage and current requirements yet with smaller die sizes is also appealing to reduce NASA's missions operation and launch costs. This high temperature, radiation hardened SiC-based power conversion system will find extensive applications in space explorations for various power management and distributions.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The development, demonstration, and integration of high-performance, lightweight, compact SiC-based inverter will be directly applicable to the military, transportation, energy, aerospace and other commercial sectors for various power management and distribution. Targeted applications include electric drive, distributed energy resources, and energy storages.   Commercial inverters in a variety of industries (defense, energy, automobile, aircraft etc.) will greatly benefit from this technology.

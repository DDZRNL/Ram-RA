<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The main purpose of this NASA SBIR Phase II proposal is development of a novel type of high resolving power diffraction gratings based on volume Bragg gratings technology. The key innovation, which was used for creation of these gratings, is based on patented technology of production of high efficiency volume diffractive elements in photo-thermo-refractive (PTR) glass on which OptiGrate has an exclusive license from the University of Central Florida. The significance of the innovation is that volume diffractive gratings in PTR glass have diffraction efficiency more than 95% and resolving power up to 20,000 in spectral range from 400 to 2700 nm. These gratings have 25 mm-long standard aperture with possibility to increase it up to 50 mm with the spectral resolution less than 50 pm. This, to the best of our knowledge, exceeds parameters of all comparable gratings worldwide. Moreover, as a result of Phase I project performance, a combination of high resolution Bragg grating with Fabri-Perot etalon provides additional increasing of spectral selectivity and enables the further increasing of spectral resolution power. This approach will be used for development of narrow band filters for detection of O2 (766 nm), H2O (935 nm), CO2 (1571 nm) and CH4 (1650 nm) with spectral width well below 1 nm (100 ? 200 pm), aperture 25 mm, throughput exceeding 90% in both reflecting and transmitting geometries. An additional task in Phase II would be a development of a scanning technology within a narrow line about 100 pm with resolution in the range from 1 to 10 pm. Aperture 25 mm, selected radiation should be focused to a photoreceiver of about 200 um.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Besides the direct goal of the development of High Resolving Power Volume Diffractive Gratings for 400-2700 nm Spectral Range in PTR glass, Phase II of this project will emphasize commercial potential of diffractive optical elements recorded in PTR glass. Potential NASA commercial applications are in the fields of high-resolution spectroscopy, narrow-band filtering for detection of different chemical agents, spectral scanning with sub-Angstrom resolution, remote sensing and targeting, range finding, spectral sensing and other NASA based applications where diffractive optical components are the key elements. In general words, those narrow-band holographic elements will provide dramatic increase of signal-to-noise ratio for almost any types of transmitters and receivers which work in visible and near IR spectral regions. Moreover, such devises will enable a breakthrough in multiplexing/demultiplexing processing for dense multichannel systems of optical communication and monitoring.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The main area of interest of DoD government agencies and private laser and semiconductor companies is focused on spectrally and angularly controlled diffractive beam deflectors, beam steering elements, mode selectors, incoherent and coherent beam combiners for both solid-state and semiconductor lasers, adjustable attenuators and beam splitters for laser beams. It is clear that the range of PTR technology applications is significantly wider that those mentioned above. OptiGrate is committed to develop these various applications and successfully bringing them to the commercial markets in a cost effective manner. It is important that wide applications of PTR Bragg gratings with high spectral resolution power and their combination with Fabry-Perot etalons will dramatically decrease their manufacturing cost and make their application more feasible.

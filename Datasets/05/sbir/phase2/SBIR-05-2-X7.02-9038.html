<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The objective of this project is to develop a physics-based pneumatic hammer instability model that accurately predicts the stability of hydrostatic bearings operating in a turbulent, compressible fluid.  In phase 2, the rig will be fabricated and assembled, design of experiment will be executed.  The empirical data will be used to determine if a particular variable, or input parameter, was a contributor to pneumatic hammer instability.  If not, the variable is eliminated.  If the variable is determined to be a contributor, it is non-dimensionalized and included in the equations of motion to develop a physics-based stability criteria.  The resulting criteria will then be validated using test data.  If the criteria is not validated, a gap assessment will be completed and the process is repeated.  Once the criteria is validated, it is implemented.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The resulting PHIT tool will improve bearing performance which directly translates into improved turbopump and system-level performance improvements due to increased load capacity, stiffness, and damping along with reduced leakage and seal clearances.<P>

FTT50 Small Engine Development ? The scope of this project includes design of a high efficiency small turbofan engine (50 lbf) for the NLOS-LAM (Non Line of Sight, Loitering Attack Munition).  The FTT50 is the first turbofan of this thrust class and is targeted at decreased fuel burn which will allow greater munitions capacity and loiter time (3-5X).  Specific engine targets include: 50% less fuel consumption, 30% greater thrust to weight, and 15% less cost than comparable turbojets.<br>Upper Stage Engine Technology (USET) ? The scope of this project includes turbine and rotor module responsibility in support of the Aerojet team development of a liquid hydrogen fuel turbopump assembly (TPA) demonstrator for USET.  Goals for this distributed collaborative team include development of advanced TPA tools and methodologies, and test of a demonstrator TPA that validates the tools and supports the IHPRPT Phase I goals.<br>Aerojet has placed a purchase order with FTT to develop and validate the PHIT tool in a non-rotating environment.  As well as part of the USET tool development effort, Aerojet is also developing a Commercial Multi-Physics Analysis Tool for Turbopumps (CoMAT).  The PHIT stability criteria resulting from this effort will be incorporated as part of the CoMAT tool.<br>

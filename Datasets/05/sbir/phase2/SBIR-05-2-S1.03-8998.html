<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
ATA has demonstrated the primary innovation of combining a precision MEMS gyro (BAE SiRRS01) with a high bandwidth angular rate sensor, ATA's ARS-14 resulting in a low-noise, high bandwidth hybrid sensor, or HYSENS in a Phase I SBIR.  The primary emphasis in Phase I development was the implementation and real-time demonstration of the sensor fusion algorithms that combined the output from a MEMS gyro and the ARS-14 resulting in a HYSENS that exhibits a bandwidth of DC to 2000 Hz and NEA of less than 0.1 &#61549;rad rms (0.5-2000 Hz integration bandwidth), thus meeting the requirement specified in the SBIR SOW.<br><br>	The HYSENS has first applicability in optical Inertial Reference units for used in Free Space Laser Communication. The HYSENS-based IRU, or HIRU, that is proposed for the Phase II effort will result in the state of the art in compact optical IRUs.  The significance of the HIRU innovation is that the HIRU will escalate the state-of-the-art in small, precision optical IRUs by virtue of minimal mechanical envelope, low mass, high performance, both in jitter mitigation and Inertial Attitude Knowledge (IAK), and power dissipation. In addition, the HYSENS was designed from the onset to be highly modular and flexible by virtue of the sensor fusion algorithms and computational architecture to allow rapid integration of higher performance MEMS gyros into future versions of the HYSENS.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The primary NASA application for HYSENS/HIRU is in Free Space Laser Communication Systems, e.g. the Mars Laser Communication Demonstrator and its follow-on.  The HIRU has the potential of becoming the baseline optical IRU to aid in virtually all satellite-based laser communication terminals.  Because of the DC response of the HYSENS, the HIRU could also become a common component in NASA spacecraft attitude control systems (ACS).  <br><br>NASA earth and space observation satellites, and high altitude sensor aircraft that require jitter mitigation for LOS stabilization, and precision pointing would also directly benefit from HYSENS/HIRU as will large telescopes.  All of NASA's remote sensing applications requiring sub-microradian LOS stabilization would benefit from HYSENS/HIRU.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Potential non-NASA applications for the HYSENS/HIRU include DoD space-based applications such as TSAT and MAWFEA.  Both of these systems require precision LOS stabilization and pointing as will systems incorporating laser communications between aircraft, ships and moving ground platforms.   UAV surveillance systems and high energy laser defense systems such as the Advanced Tactical Laser (ATL), Relay Mirror Program, and Airborne Laser (ABL) are also potential applications.  Aside from the LOS stabilization function , Non-NASA applications for HYSENS/HIRU would include DoD and commercial spacecraft Attitude Control Systems (ACS) because of the Inertial Attitude Knowledge (IAK) capability of HIRU.  Components also offer the capability of high performance IMUs with very low vibration and linear motion sensitivity.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Formation flying enables new capabilities in distributed sensing, surveillance in Earth orbit and for interferometer imaging in deep space as envisioned by the Terrestrial Plant Finder-Interferometer (TPF-I) mission.  Specifically, formation flying spacecraft refer to a set of spatially distributed spacecraft interacting and cooperating with one another. Our objective in Phase II is to develop and implement highly reliable fault detection, identification, and reconstruction algorithms that take into account the high analytic redundancy of the spacecraft and the distributed spacecraft system. In the Phase I our analytic redundancy management methodology was developed and demonstrated on a small distributed and collaborative set of simulated spacecraft. These results are to be generalized and applied to realistic spacecraft systems in Phase II.   Faults in spacecraft sensors and actuators of a cluster of spacecraft are to be detected, identified, and reconstructed using abstractions from high-fidelity models such as found in FAST (Formation Algorithms and Simulation Testbed). From these analytical redundancy algorithms a fault-tolerant state estimator is constructed which is not corrupted by system faults. These techniques will be implemented and tested in FAST. These algorithms will be transferred to the Formation Control Testbed (FCT) robots and tested and verified in FCT.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The anticipated product of this proposal in Phase II is distributed fault-tolerant estimation system that will meet the performance specifications for TPF-I and will be evaluated on FAST and FCT. Furthermore, our analytical redundancy or health monitoring systems can be implemented on NASA's test flight airplanes, space shuttles, launch vehicles, the Next Generation Air Transportation System and other aerospace vehicle systems to enhance the safe operation of these vehicles in a more affordable and<br>efficient manner.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Development of our distributed analytical redundancy or health monitoring systems will be important for societal acceptance of automated system, especially those that involve manned systems, such as automated cars on automated highways and personal mobile system that would allow personal flying vehicles.

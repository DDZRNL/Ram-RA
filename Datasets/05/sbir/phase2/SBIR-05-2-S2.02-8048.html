<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
In this SBIR program, TRS Technologies has developed several new dielectrics for high temperature applications including signal conditioning, filtering and energy storage, and high-power RF.  Feasibility was demonstrated by constructing prototype multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) with capacitance values in the 80 to 100nF range @ 450<SUP>o</SUP>C and voltage handling capability of at least 250V.  In particular, high dielectric constant (5,000 to 30,000), moderate loss (2-6%) capacitors were demonstrated with voltage handling capabilities of over 250V; and low dielectric constant (30-100), low loss (<<1%) capacitors were demonstrated with voltage handling capabilities of over 1000V that were capable of working from <30K to over 500<SUP>o</SUP>C while maintaining ca. ±14% of the room temperature capacitance.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The focus of this program is to develop high volumetric efficiency, high temperature (>450<SUP>o</SUP>C) capacitors for NASA's planned missions to the surface of Venus and interior of Jupiter.  These include the Venus In-Situ Explorer (VISE) tentatively planned for 2013, the Venus Surface Explorer in 2020, the Venus Surface Sample Return (VSSR) in 2035, and the Jupiter Flyby with Deep Entry Probes in 2020.  In particular TRS is developing high capacitance moderate voltage components for sensor signal processing electronics; moderate capacitance, high voltage components for power system electronics; and low capacitance, low loss, high power components for RF communication electronics.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
High temperature power electronics have become a vital aspect of future designs for power converters in spacecraft, advanced electric aircraft (Joint Strike Fighter and More Electric Aircraft), Navy ships (DD(X)), battle zone electric power, satellite power conditioning, electric/hybrid vehicles.  The current market for high temperature capacitors is primarily limited to well logging tools for the oil, natural gas, and geothermal well drilling industries.  Specific applications include motor/actuator controls, radiation detector systems (including high voltage electronics), acoustic imaging systems, seismic pulsing systems, signal conditioning, etc.

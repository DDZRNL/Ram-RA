<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) foresee extension of exploratory space missions to the Moon, Mars, Venus and beyond.  To reach these outer locations will require development of a range of advanced technologies including life support systems.  Food represents one of the most crucial components of life support, as the ability to supply safe, nutritious and organoleptically pleasing meals to space flight personnel for the duration of their mission will be of paramount importance in maintaining crew functionality and morale.  In this Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, Infoscitex Corporation will further develop an advanced barrier film, ElastiGlass, which will enable 3-to-5 year shelf life.  This technology will also provide the added benefit of reducing the logistic burdens associated with waste handling, and minimizing package weight and storage space requirements.  During this proposed program Infoscitex will modify the Phase I proof of feasibility barrier coating formulations to achieve the best combination of minimal oxygen and water vapor permeation, and maximized elongation properties to obtain the best of product durability.  Prototype barrier films and subsequent food storage pouches will be fabricated, filled with thermostabilizable foods and tested for shelf life capabilities. <br><br> <br>

The impact that ElastiglassTM may have on the market is profound and our team will work to identify commercialization opportunities throughout the Phase 2 program. The NASA Food Technology Commercial Space Center (NASA FTCSC) is leading a national effort to develop foods and food-processing technologies that will enable space station and planetary space missions. Infoscitex and it's partners are well positioned to help NASA FTCSC achieve it's objectives through the continued development and commercialization of ElastiglassTM. <br><br>The Medical packaging film market is said to be growing at 5% per year, roughly the same rate as the food packaging market. Requirements for medical packaging are very different from those for food wraps as they must provide a microbial barrier and survive unique sterilization processes. While the requirements for the material to be stored are different, space bound medical supplies will also benefit from enhanced shelf life, reduced weight, and reduced size.<br><br>

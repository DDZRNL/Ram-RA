<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
TRS Technologies proposes innovative hybrid electrostatic/flextensional membrane deformable mirror capable of large amplitude aberration correction for large aperture and light weight space telescopes, and proposes to investigate the performances of single crystal piezoelectric actuators in space environment. The innovative hybrid deformable mirror concept is expected  to eliminate  actuator cross talk in electrostatic membrane mirror, while the large stroke (> 300 um) flextensional actuators provide large dynamic range by more than an order of magnitude over the current state of the art. The proposed membrane DM retains the characteristics of membrane mirrors such as light weight, adaptable to large aperture and low cost. Flextensional actuator arrays with stroke of > 300 um will be developed and a hybrid electrostatic/flextensional membrane deformable mirror will be prototyped and characterized. The single crystal piezoelectric actuators produced at TRS offer large stroke, low hysteresis, and an excellent cryogenic strain response. Further investigation on using single crystal piezoelectric actuators in space environment will explore the possibility of using low profile, lightweight, and high performance piezoelectric actuations for positioning, alignment and shape control in space applications.<br><br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Large aperture, light weight, hybrid electrostatic/piezoelectric flextensional membrane deformable mirror technology offers capability of greater dynamic wavefront correction at broader temperature range, which is desired for many future NASA missions such as JWST, SIM, TDP, SAFIR, Con-X and others. Apart from the adaptive optics applications, single crystal piezoelectric actuators could be used in various positioning, alignment, vibration control and smart structures in space applications.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Large aperture, light weight, hybrid electrostatic/piezoelectric flextensional membrane deformable mirror technology are also attractive to DOD adaptive optics programs such as directed energy applications. Apart from adaptive optics applications, large stroke, high precision single crystal piezoelectric actuators are also good candidates for fibre optic steering, microfluidics, MEMS switch, micro/nanopisitioning for hard disk drives as well as biological manipulations, vibration and noise control, energy harvesting, etc.

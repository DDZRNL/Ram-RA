<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
nLight developed high-power, high-efficiency laser diodes emitting at 1907nm for the pumping of solid-state lasers during the Phase I. The innovation brought to bear at 19-xxnm wavelengths nLight's design knowledge and experience from its highly successful 9xx-nm and 14xx-nm, high-efficiency and high-power laser diode programs.  The expected performance for the laser at the conclusion of the phase I was 25% electrical-to-optical (E/O) conversion efficiency and 18 W continuous-wave power (CW) - both measured at 15C.  The program was highly successful in achieving performance of 25W and 23% efficiency at 20C (5C warmer than projection). Such lasers meet the brightness and power requirements for the direct pumping of the quasi 4-level 5I7 to 5I8 transition in singly-doped Ho:YAG lasers.  This work can readily be extended to 18xx-nm and 20xx-nm with comparable performance for application to the pumping of other solid-state lasers.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The primary application of this technology is in the pumping of Ho:YAG solid state lasers. These lasers, emitting at 2.1-mm have broad ranging application for NASA in 3-D lidar and telemetry applications.<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
1907nm diode laser technology has application in any area requiring high absorption by water. Most of the potential customers identified by nLight thus far are medical companies. There is broad application to the defense community who would also use these lasers for 3-D lidar systems.<br>

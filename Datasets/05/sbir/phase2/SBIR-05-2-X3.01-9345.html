<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Significant improvements in photovoltaic materials and systems are required to enable NASA future exploration missions. In this project, CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC) with University of California Riverside (UCR), Rochester Institute of Technology, and International Photonics  will: 1) develop and provide reliable, validated computational tools for assessment, design, and optimization of novel nanostructures based on Quantum Dots (QD) for future nano-devices for space applications; 2) investigate, design, and demonstrate new photovoltaic (PV) structures based on QD nanotechnology, with improved efficiency and radiation hardness. The inherently radiation tolerant quantum dots of variable sizes maximize absorption of different light wavelengths ("multicolor" cell), which dramatically improves photovoltaic efficiency and diminishes the radiation-induced degradation. <br>Phase 1 included development of numerical tools for modeling electron-phonon transport in quantum-dot for photovoltaic applications, using experimental data from UCR Nano-Device Laboratory for validation and calibration of the models, computational and experimental proof-of-concept.  In Phase 2, the new QD models will be integrated into CFDRC's advanced photonic-electronic device simulator and used for further optimization of QD superlattices. Novel QD photovoltaic nano-engineered materials and designs will be down-selected for further development to the point of testable prototypes. They will be fabricated and demonstrated by detailed electrical characterization and radiation testing.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA future exploration missions require improvements in solar cell efficiency and radiation hardness. Novel nano-engineered materials and  multi-quantum-dot photovoltaic devices promise to deliver more efficient, lightweight solar cells and arrays which will be of extreme value to NASA space missions.  The new modeling and simulation tools for quantum-dot-based nanostructures  will help NASA to:<br>- better understand and predict behavior of nano-devices and novel materials in space environment;<br>- assess technologies, devices, and materials of new electronic systems;<br>- better evaluate the performance and radiation response at early design stage; <br>- set requirements for hardening and testing;  reduce the amount of testing cost and time.<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
All satellites, military and commercial, suffer from solar cell degradation due to the effects of radiation. The higher efficiency of the novel quantum-dot solar cells will increase capacity of the solar array at the beginning of life (BOL) to compensate for the degradation at the end of life (EOL), to maintain the minimal requirements of the spacecraft. Retarding the degradation will have substantive impact on the size and weight of the solar arrays for both military as well as civilian commercial space systems. The inherently radiation tolerant quantum dots will lead to more robust space defense systems. The new, more accurate modeling and simulation tools for Quantum-Dots based photonic devices will enable better understanding, analysis, and design of novel materials and nano-devices for aerospace systems and their radiation-response. The modeling and design tools will provide reduction in cost and time-to-market through significantly reduced experimental R&D, design cycle, and laboratory testing time and cost.

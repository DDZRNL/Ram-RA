<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
This project extends Probability Bounds Analysis to model epistemic and aleatory uncertainty during early design of engineered systems in an Integrated Concurrent Engineering environment.  This method uses efficient analytic and semi-analytic calculations, is more rigorous than probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation, and provides comprehensive and (often) best possible bounds on mission-level risk as a function of uncertainty in each parameter.  Phase 1 demonstrated the capability to robustly model uncertainty during early design.  Phase 2 will build on the Phase 1 work by 1) Implementing the PBA technology in Excel-mediated computing tools, 2) Fashioning an interface for these tools that enables fast and robust elicitation of expert knowledge, 3) Initiating the development of a library of such elicitations, 4) Demonstrating the application of the tools, interface and library in an interactive, distributed-computing environment, 5) Developing case studies, and 6) Creating tutorial documentation.  Important applications of these new tools include the ability to rapidly and rigorously explore uncertainty regarding alternate designs, determine risk-based margins that are robust to surprise, and incorporate qualitatively described risks in quantitative analyses.  This suite of capabilities is not currently available to systems engineers and cannot be provided by more traditional probabilistic risk assessment methods.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The primary application envisioned for the extended PBA technology at NASA is the analysis of uncertainty and risk in subsystem, system, and mission design in an Integrated Concurrent Engineering environment like the IDC at LaRC.  The methods, algorithms, libraries, and software developed will be of use in a wide variety of commercial activities that involve physics- or non-physics-based systems design, reliability assessment, or risk analysis.  Applications where NASA may use the technology while serving as a vendor include: (1) Uncertainty and risk analysis during commercial spacecraft subsystem component, subsystem, system, and/or mission early design, (2) Integrated analysis of qualitative and quantitative uncertainty during commercial operations and organization design, restructuring and/or risk and reliability analysis, (3) Commercial organizational and/or mission risk reduction modeling, and (4) Incorporation of quantitative uncertainty and risk analysis in quantitative system-wide, mission-wide, and/or organization-wide probabilistic risk-based margin determination metrics and management procedures.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The successful completion of Phase 2 research and development will result in a library of functions for performing PBA in Microsoft Excel, a software add-on implementing those functions, a software application that guides engineers in constructing uncertain input parameters using available information, and methods for applying these technologies in an ICE early design environment.  Potential commercial applications include: (1) A Microsoft Excel application for analyzing risk using PBA and uncertain numbers.  Successful commercial Excel-based risk analysis applications exist (e.g., Crystal Ball), but all rely on Monte Carlo simulation and are thus limited in comprehensiveness and applicability to near real time design environments; (2) A commercial software application implementing PBA technology using quantitative and qualitative uncertainty information to perform system optimization, constraint satisfaction, and organizational risk reduction modeling; and (3) Methods and software for developing system- or organization-wide probabilistic risk-based margin determination metrics and management procedures.  This product could be implemented as a book with accompanying software, or as a training workshop.

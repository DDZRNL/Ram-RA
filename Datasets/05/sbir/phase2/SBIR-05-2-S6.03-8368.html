<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
     Various Earth Science fields require well-calibrated field radiometers whose calibrations must be tracked and verified in the field.  NASA has long recognized requirement.  However, these activities require specialized light sources that typically require high power, are bulky and difficult to use in the field, and do not work with all types of radiometers.<br>     We propose a next-generation portable, ultra-stable, lightweight and highly versatile light source based on light-emitting diodes (LEDs).  Recent advances in LEDs include higher power, efficiency, and a wider range of wavelengths (from UV to IR).  These advances, coupled with LEDs' inherent suitability for electronic feedback stabilization, make them excellent candidates for more compact and power-efficient calibration sources.<br>     During Phase I we showed that we can implement light sources with the desired characteristics, using current technology.  We identified and tested LED devices, measurement and stabilization techniques, and physical configurations.  In Phase II we will build prototypes and implement a program for test and evaluation, and refine the design based on test results.  At the conclusion of Phase II we will be ready to produce and sell a commercial version.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
     Potential NASA customers include virtually all earth remote sensing missions currently on-orbit and those planned for future launch. These include the EOS project and its established field validation efforts and NPP whose field validation program is being defined.  Specific satellite sensors include SeaWiFS, MODIS Aqua and Terra, and VIIRS.<br>     Among terrestrial applications, the extensive AERONET and SolRad-Net networks would also benefit.<br>     The approach and technology developed in this project could also potentially be applied to airborne and satellite radiometers for performing on-board self-calibration checks.<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
     All the potential NASA customers have counterparts in other countries.  Examples include field validation related to satellites launched by the European Space Agency, France, Korea, Japan, India and Argentina, and aerosol/flux networks associated with AERONET in Canada, France, Australia and elsewhere.<br>     Other US Government agencies with related applications include the Navy, Army Corps of Engineers, National Science Foundation and NOAA.<br>     Our innovation would benefit almost any governmental and non-governmental users of field radiometers, for example in agriculture and aquaculture, both for research and for commercial production.<br>

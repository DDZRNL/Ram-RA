<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The scope of this project is to provide a digital auto-correlation spectrometer fabricated on a single integrated circuit for NASA's future Earth-Sun System missions in order to enable the rapid development of small, ultra low-power, low-cost microwave remote sensing instruments for the analysis of chemical and  physical properties of planetary atmospheres. The  technical risk associated with the proposed Phase II project is low because all Phase I technical objectives were achieved using an innovative approach that consists of a synergistic combination of parallel architecture and differential circuits; based on the results obtained in Phase I,  it is anticipated that the power consumption of  a 4096-lag, 1 GHz bandwidth, 2-bit/4-level  digital auto-correlation spectrometer chip fabricated with IBM's 90 nm will be less than 4 W. The overall benefits of the proposed project, if successful, consist of the availability of a new class of high-bandwidth and ultra-low power digital auto-correlation spectrometer chip that will facilitate the construction of NASA's spaceborne microwave remote sensing instruments with substantially lower life-cycle costs,  power consumption,  and mass relative to that of existing filter-bank and acousto-optical spectrometers.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed space-qualifiable digital correlation spectrometer chip is intended for use in NASA's passive microwave remote sensing spaceborne instruments for radioastronomy and planetary atmospheric research. The competitive advantage of the proposed space-qualifiable digital spectrometer is a factor of 80 times higher bandwidths and 30 times greater spectral resolution relative to the space-qualified digital spectrometer developed by this proposing firm on contract from NASA/JPL for the EOS/MLS instrument operational on the Aura spacecraft.   <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The commercial markets for the proposed digital correlation spectrometer are ground-based radioastronomy, atmospheric research performed from aircraft and balloons, imaging arrays for detection of weapons and explosives, radio spectrum surveillance, telecommunications, and medical imaging. In the commercial markets, the competitive advantage of the proposed digital spectrometer is a factor of 20 times lower cost relative to existing digital correlation spectrometers of similar performance.

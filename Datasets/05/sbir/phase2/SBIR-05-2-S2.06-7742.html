<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Flexible, foldable, and/or inflatable antenna systems open up a wealth of opportunities.  Integrating antenna elements and related electronics onto flexible substrates, however, poses significant challenges.  To our knowledge, there exists no technology that can incorporate a variety of electronic/sensor materials onto large-area flexible substrates to create flexible and conformable circuits in an economical and reliable way.  The majority of the limitations stem from processing techniques.  Mesoscribe Technologies, a high tech start-up from SUNY-Stony Brook, proposes to apply a breakthrough new direct writing technology to meet the objectives set-forth in the NASA SBIR topic S2.06 Advanced Flexible Electronics.  This technology is based on revolutionary advances to modern day thermal spray materials processing enables deposition of wide range of electronic materials onto large areas at low processing temperatures and, for most part, requires no post-processing.  The Phase I effort focused on demonstrating proof-of-concept to deposit conducting microstrip lines and sensors on flexible substrates.  The Phase II program will be focused exclusively on developing a Direct-Write-Thermal-Spray based large-area patterning capability that is based on roll-to-roll processing to fabricate large-area antennas on flexible substrates, focusing, in particular, on JPL's L-band membrane-based active phased array radar.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The development of a large area, flexible phased array antenna will provide enhanced capabilities for NASA's Earth science remote sensing applications and future missions to the Moon, Mars, Titan and Venus.  Electronically steerable L-band antennas will enable detection of surface and subsurface topology and the increased aperture will enable repeat-pass interfermetric Synthetic Aperture Radar missions to be conducted at higher altitudes.  Antenna fabrication on flexible membrane structures is critical to reduce mass, launch vehicle stowage volume, and overall cost in comparison to rigid radar systems.  A variety of potential applications may result from this technology, if developed to fruition.  Applications include: space-based radar systems, unfurlable antennas to minimize volume on space flights, very large area antennas (10?100+ m2) for long-distance and low-signal detection, conformal antennas on space craft and space structures, rectifying antennas (rectennas) for microwave power transmission, power harvesting and sensors, and harsh environment (space) sensors.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Applications for flexible electronics have wide-spread appeal within the Department of Defense and consumer electronics industry.  Successful project development and implementation will enable significant breakthroughs in distributed sensors and distributed electromagnetics fabricated on flexible polymer substrates.  Applications include antennas, communication modules, health monitoring sensors, RFID's, integrated sensor arrays, and large aperture antennas for the communications and surveillance of airships.

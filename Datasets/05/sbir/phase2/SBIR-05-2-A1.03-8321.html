<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
SSCI proposes to further develop, implement and test the damage-adaptive control algorithms developed in Phase I within the framework of an Integrated Damage Modeling & Adaptive Control (IDMAC) system. The proposed IDMAC system design will be based on the following: (i) Development of a coupled structural and aerodynamic model of aircraft dynamics under structural damage, (ii) Generation of a set of models describing different damage cases; (iii) Model set reduction to arrive at a reduced set of control design models; and (iv) Use of the reduced model set to design<br>multiple-model stochastic damage estimators and corresponding reconfigurable controllers to stabilize the aircraft and achieve acceptable performance of the closed-loop flight control system. The proposed IDMAC system will be tested on transport aircraft models selected in consultation with NASA Langley.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Due to increasing terrorist threats, in the recent years there has been a lot of interest in the development of effective adaptive reconfigurable control systems that can compensate for the damage in commercial aircraft caused by  man-portable  air  defense systems  (ManPADS), and NASA added this aspect of the fault-tolerant control problem to the existing Aviation <br>Safety program. The proposed IDMAC system will be an important contribution to addressing the goals of this program. Technology that will be developed in Phase II has direct applications in the NASA Space Exploration programs<br>where higher level of autonomy, including autonomous damage accommodation, will be required due to limited ground support.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Potential non-NASA applications of the IDMAC system are in the area of commercial and military aircraft. Autonomous IDMAC will also find wide applications in other programs such as spacecraft control and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).

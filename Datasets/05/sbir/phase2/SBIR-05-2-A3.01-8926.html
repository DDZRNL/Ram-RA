<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
This effort undertakes the creation of an Airport Ground Resource Planning (AGRP) tool.  Little or no automation is currently available to support airport ground resource allocation decisions.  The AGRP tool provides visualization both of the resource assignments as well as other information relevant to making resource assignment decision.  In addition, AGRP automates or advises resource assignments, improving efficiency while reducing workload.  In Phase 2, we propose to continue development of the AGRP tool through four work areas.  First, we will complete the map and Resource Allocation displays.  We will also complete the algorithm to automate resource allocation decisions and integrate it with the displays.  The resulting AGRP prototype will be evaluated operationally.  We will also extend the Phase 1 work to develop a block out time predictor, which would have tremendous application and benefit in other traffic management systems.  In Phase 1, we proposed an architecture in which applications such as AGRP can subscribe to receive SMS data via a standardized interface.  In Phase 2 we will complete the specifications for and implementation of this interface, which will replace the existing SMS client-server communication.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The outcome of this project may be divided into two parts ? enabling infrastructure and the AGRP tool.  These two outcomes have different potential applications.  The enabling infrastructure consists of a documented and published interface standard for receiving data from and providing data to an SMS server, along with the modifications to the SMS server to support this service.  This outcome is applicable to the FAA's vision for SMS in the NAS and includes research into predicting aircraft block out times.  This aspect of the AGRP work would be an outcome that NASA could sucessfully complete a technology transfer to the FAA.  NASA may be interested in the research to develop robust and efficient planning algorithms as well as the human factors research of designing the AGRP user interface.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The AGRP tool consists of the displays, methods for manual entry, and algorithms for automated advisories to help manage airport ground resources.  Non-NASA applications include use of AGRP outcomes by the FAA, air carriers, airport authorities, and airport ground service providers.  The principal FAA application of the AGRP work will be to adopt the re-designed interface between the SMS server and SMS client as a standard.  In doing so, the FAA will facilitate receiving air carrier information which benefit the FAA's goal of providing safe and efficient traffic flow.  Several air carriers currently use information from the Surface Management System (SMS) to improve the efficiency of their ground operations without any automation explicitly designed for this purpose.  The AGRP tool directly addresses this need.  Airport authorities or ground service providers may also use AGRP where they are responsible for managing particular ground resources.<br><br>

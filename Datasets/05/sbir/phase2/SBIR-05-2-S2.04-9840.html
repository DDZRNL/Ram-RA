<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
In Phase Sunpower looked at Thermoacoustic Stirling Heat Engines (TASHEs).  These ranged from a TASHE which was sized for the heat from a single General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS), to a larger unit sized for a Venus mission.  We also looked at different types of cooler to produce both electrical power and sensor cooling for the Venus application.  Computer projected performance and layout drawing were created for all the machines investigated.   In Phase II we plan to fabricate, test, and develop the single-GPHS sized coaxial. TASHE designed in Phase I.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The NASA application for the TASHE would appear limited to convertors which require very high head temperatures ( >1100 C), such as the Venus mission because of the high ambient temperature.  In the high temperature applications the benefit of eliminating the high temperature displacer must be considered in light of the lower TASHE thermodynamic performance. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
It appears that commercial applications of the TASHE would be limited to situations where efficiency is not important.  Such applications include autonomous devices such as a furnace that does not require an external source of electricity for fans and blowers.  Another such application would be a backup power system.

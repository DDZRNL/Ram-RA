<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Current and future programs of near-Earth and deep space exploration require the development of faster and more reliable electronics with open system architectures that are reconfigurable, fault-tolerant, and can operate effectively for long periods of time in harsh environments. Existing data transfer systems based on passive backplanes are slow, power hungry, hardly reconfigurable, and feature high latency, limited expandability, and low radiation tolerance. During Phase I, our company has proven in computer simulations the basic concept of a radiation tolerant switching fabric backplane with reconfigurable serial interfaces. During Phase II, the company proposes to develop a functional prototype of a novel, radiation-tolerant, switching fabric with user-programmable interfaces that support either Space Wire or the company's proprietary multi-level interconnect solution. The patent-pending multi-level interconnect technique provides improved serial point-to-point link functionality including lower latency, higher speed and lower power consumption. It eliminates the requirement of the second information channel utilized in Space Wire's data-strobe encoding scheme, which can be instead used as a redundant channel to improve the system's fault tolerance. The unprecedented reliability of the developed system-on-chip is guaranteed by utilization of inherently radiation-tolerant SiGe hetero-junction bipolar transistors in proprietary circuit structures that are specifically hardened to single-event effects.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The successful accomplishment of this project will result in the development of a compact radiation tolerant ASIC or MCM, which will revolutionize intra-spacecraft system development for near-Earth and deep space exploration. Only a high bandwidth, radiation-hardened, Space Wire protocol utilizing switching fabrics allows for high performance computing in space vehicles. The switching fabric's software-reconfigurable interfaces will not only speed-up the system's design and assembly process, but will open the way for the implementation of a true Plug-and-Play architecture and in-situ hardware adaptation. This is extremely important for the realization of future innovative concepts for space exploration over the next decade. The immediate application areas in NASA of the developed technology include: CEV, CLV, Lunar Lender and Lunar Outposts.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The developed technology will be critical to all space programs under the US Air Force and will have a great impact on TacSat's development. Our solution provides a scaled-down simple design that can be used and reused, which will save DOD the project development time and resources while giving system engineers plenty of flexibility in spacecraft development. The commercial version of the switching fabric will be a critical component in the upgrading of private/enterprise networks by reducing latency while transferring data from memory storage to individual users in such applications as production of motion pictures, intra-hospital networks, inventory management, the last-mile fiber-to-home concept, the oil industry, and others.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Recycling of water using biological processes is a primary goal of NASA's advanced life support programs. This proposal concerns a technology to simultaneously reduce the microbial count (MC) and total organic carbon (TOC) content of biological water processor (BWP) effluent. This technology is based on an advanced oxidation process using an on-demand oxidizer generator, which does not require consumable chemicals. Phase I feasibility studies successfully demonstrated the efficacy of the process for the reduction of both TOC and MC of the BWP processed water. Independent evaluation of the technology at a well known technological university successfully demonstrated the efficacy of the process for minimizing the RO membrane fouling. The residual disinfectant and reduced TOC in the treated effluent minimize fouling the RO membrane and water lines. In addition, reduced TOC lowers the load on equipment downstream to the BWP, enabling a reduction in the equivalent system mass. In the Phase II project, a prototype will be fabricated and evaluated for its ability to reduce TOC, MC and extend RO membrane life in a technological university having a small scale water reclamation system similar to that at NASA-JSC. The GEN I unit developed will be delivered to NASA-JSC.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
One of the highest priorities of a regenerative life support system is to recover and process spacecraft wastewater to provide clean water, which is essential for the crew well being. The proposed compact TOC and MC reduction module can be integrated into the water reclamation systems on board the International Space Station, spacecrafts, and future planetary and lunar habitats, to make water reclamation  more effective. Lynntech's technology will lower secondary processing system (SPS) load and biofouling of various surfaces in contact with the residual oxidant remaining with the waste water treated using the TOC and MC reduction module, enable scaled down SPS size, increase RO membrane lifetimes, reduce SPS consumables, and lower the equivalent system mass. In addition to treating bioreactor effluent, hydrogen peroxide generated in-situ can be used for a variety of disinfection applications within spacecraft, space stations and future planetary habitats. Other NASA applications include providing a portion of the processed water from the TOC reduction module (containing minerals and residual nutrients while microorganisms are controlled by residual H2O2) to hydroponic crop systems for improved food self-sufficiency in future planetary or lunar habitats. A third application is for production of disinfecting water for surfaces within the other extra terrestrial environment.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Non-NASA commercial applications include incorporation into water treatment and supply plants, portable field water treatment units for use during camping, hiking, fishing and outdoor activities, and in-home water treatment units.  The proposed system can be used in a range of wastewater treatment applications. These include the destruction of organic contaminants in wastewater from: textile industry, tanneries, municipal water treatment plants, chemical processing industries, pesticides manufacturers, and any other industry that uses organic chemicals that require disposal. Another important market segment is as a point-of-use (POU) application for water treatment in the residential, commercial, and medical sectors, where Lynntech's device will provide comprehensive protection against disinfection byproducts (DBPs, organic material partially oxidized and chlorinated by a chlorine-based oxidation) and disease causing microorganisms. A third market segment for this technology is in the production of pyrogen-free water in the medical industry for use in hemodialysis units, irrigation of operating rooms, pharmaceutical industry (intravenous drug delivery), and hydroponics industry.

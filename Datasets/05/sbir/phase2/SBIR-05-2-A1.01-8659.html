<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
IAI proposes an innovative collision avoidance radar and communication technology to detect and track both cooperative and non-cooperative targets. The system includes an L-band RF transceiver-sensor package, which continuously transmits Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) compatible beacons to alert other cooperative aircraft and ATC (Air Traffic Control) ground stations regarding the aircraft's position and intent.  In addition, it uses the reflected beacon signal as a radar signal to detect and track any non-cooperative targets within its effective range.  A multifunctional RF transceiver serves as both the primary radar and secondary surveillance radar (SSR).  The phase I effort has successfully demonstrated the concept of this technology in three areas: (1) Adding phase modulation to the 1090 ES carrier and proving it still complies with ADS-B waveform standard, (2) Coherent pulse compression for ranging (3) 3D angular estimation using TCAS-like circular antenna array and using innovative digital beamforming and spatial spectrum processing.  In the phase II effort, we will work with commercial partners to build a 'brassboard' system and perform a series of system evaluation tests.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The proposed technology will directly serve NASA's Integrated Intelligent Flight Deck Technologies (IIFDT) program, especially for external hazard detection, as the proposed system provides see-and-avoid functionalities to handle non-cooperative air-traffic.<br>Another NASA related application for this sensor system is UAV collision avoidance. The proposed research will add the ability to see and avoid both cooperative (transponding) and non-cooperative aircraft to UAVs.  Such capability is crucial to providing military services and industry with sustainable, flexible UAV operations, sufficiently robust to safely deploy whenever and wherever needed. <br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed collision avoidance radar is a novel approach to achieve a low cost modification to existing aircraft avionics which will enhance safety and promote the JPDO NGATS initiative for adoption of ADS-B in the NAS.  We estimate the commercial market for airborne collision avoidance radar to be potentially worth tens of millions of dollars as several manufacturers produce ADS-B avionics over the next 15 to 20 years. If the GA community and AOPA succeed in the removal of Mode C transponders after ADS-B implementation is mandated along with the installation of UAT avionics in GA aircraft, then it would be reasonable to expect that the FAA and commercial market will look to modify Mode S/TCAS equipped aircraft for collision avoidance radar capability such as we have proposed.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
NASA has numerous requirements for in-space repair capabilities to aid future missions beyond earth orbit.  A subset of these requirements is adhesive patch materials that provide permanent or temporary repair of a wide variety of surfaces with minimal surface preparation and that can operate in the space environment.  This work will result in the production of a repair kit for in-space applications that forms structural composite patches rapidly and safely with low power.  The proposed kit will consist of glass fabric impregnated with a UV light-curing resin stored in a protective dispenser.  Cure will be accomplished using a portable, robust light-emitting diode (LED) array.  Surface cleaning materials may also be included in the kit.  The proposed material will adhere to a variety of surfaces and cure under a variety of environmental conditions including vacuum.  Such a repair kit will provide a versatile repair technology for a wide variety of applications, which eliminates having redundant repair approaches in many cases.  This work will extend the knowledge base previously attained with the development of similar light-curing materials for rigidization of inflatable spacecraft.  That prior work will greatly benefit the development of the proposed repair kit and reduce programmatic risk.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
The structural tape repair kit to be developed in the Phase II program will provide NASA with a versatile technology for in-space repair applications.  Potential uses include repair onboard spacecraft, the international space station, habitats, rovers, etc.  The recent leak that occurred on the space shuttle in a pressurized hose shows the need for this technology.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The eventual commercial markets for the "structural duct tape" technology are vast and virtually unlimited for any type of structural repair.  Examples of sectors that could benefit from this technology include the home repair, automotive, sporting goods, pipelines, marine, construction, landscaping, and aviation industries.  We expect to market the tape through home improvement stores and various specialized distribution networks for the other industries.

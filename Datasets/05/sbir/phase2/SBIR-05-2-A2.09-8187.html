<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Micron-thin surface hot-film gages are used to develop flow-angle and airspeed sensor system (FASS). Unlike Pitot-static and other pressure-based devices, which experience serious limitations in accuracy, pneumatic lags, and frequency response in thin upper atmospheres and at low speeds, FASS will measure airspeed all the way to zero knots and flow angularity to a fraction of a degree with practically zero-lag. It will perform equally well at sea level as well at high altitudes and even in the thin Martian atmosphere with relative immunity to EMI and RFI. Calibrated hot-film gages could also be used to simultaneously obtain total temperature. FASS addresses important flight-operation and flight research problems that have crucial impact on vehicle performance, stability & control, structural loads, and pilot action. FASS will permit direct integration with aircraft avionics systems including conventional instruments used for pressure, temperature, and density measurements. Hot-film gages are coated to withstand harsh environment and for protection from rain and ice. FASS is developed both as a stand-alone probe and as an embedded, non-intrusive system. Applications include aerospace and ground vehicles, submarines, ships, and measurements in the atmosphere, ocean, and in internal flows.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
All NASA flight-testing R&D applications, from low speeds to supersonic speeds. FASS can also used for flight in Martian environment. The hardware and software methodologies developed in the project will also allow NASA to use the technology to determine the leading-edge stagnation point location at a number of span stations of rigid and flexible wings. Such an approach could be used  for in-flight determination of unsteady aerodynamic forces and moments generated by lifting surfaces, to develop advanced methods for the determination of stability and control parameters, and to develop advanced closed-loop active flow control systems for improved vehicle performance, safety, and ride quality.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
FASS has many military in aerospace applications similar to NASA. In addition, FASS could be incorporated in missiles and weapons to monitor and control their trajectory. Ground vehicles like tanks require real-time data on local flow conditions (speed and angularity) to apply proper corrections before the release of ammunition. FASS could be extended to underwater applications for submarines, ships, and boats using waterproofed hot-film gages. The underlying technology could be used to develop mass flow meters for fluid transport, semi-conductor, and food processing industries.<br>

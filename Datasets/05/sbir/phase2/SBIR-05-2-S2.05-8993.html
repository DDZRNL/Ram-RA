<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Los Gatos Research, Inc. proposes to develop a lightweight, compact, rugged, near and mid-infrared gas-sensing spectroscopy instrument to accurately measure the abundance of various gases on Mars and other extra-terrestrial bodies.  These gases include methane, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ammonia.  This instrument will be a fully autonomous, stand-alone, remotely operable all fiber-based spectroscopy sensor capable of measuring gases in a Martian environment.  The proposed prototype sensor includes the novel use of hollow photonic crystal fibers, which further enables accurate measurement of even small samples of gas.  The project will also leverage Los Gatos Research's prior work developing rugged, autonomous gas sensors for extreme environments that NASA is currently using.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
This SBIR effort addresses key objectives and goals outlined in NASA's Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group's 2006 report.  The proposed photonic crystal fiber-based gas analyzer will address these objectives by being able to measure carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, and ammonia.  These gas measurements will help to understand atmospheric and planetary dynamics, history, and processes, help prepare for human exploration, and help identify indicators of life.  The highly compact, robust, light-weight, and fully stand-alone, autonomous instrument makes it ideal for initial, potentially planet-wide characterization studies<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
A compact, sensitive, real-time gas analyzer also has significant commercial application.  Through a series of strategic partnerships, LGR is developing a suite of analytical instrumentation to measure gas concentrations for medical, pollution monitoring, and petrochemical applications.  The proposed work is essential in making these instruments more rugged (no moving parts) and more compact (all fiber-based), and will thus significantly enlarge the potential for expanding into this greater than $100 million market.

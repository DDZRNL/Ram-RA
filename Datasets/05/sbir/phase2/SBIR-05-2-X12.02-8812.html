<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The overall objective of the Phase II effort is to demonstrate prototype multifunctional EVA system power patches that integrate energy storage into advanced space suit systems' components (suit and pack) to increase functionality and decrease weight and volume. The program will optimize materials and plasma processes to bridge the performance gap between current fiber and planar batteries. Optimized fiber batteries will be integrated into prototypes relevant to anticipated NASA missions. Successful completion of the Phase II will lead to an engineering demonstration unit that powers a distributed sensor under conditions that are compatible with anticipated missions. Additional integrated power pack designs such as composites based on fiber batteries will be also evaluated. The lessons learned in this effort will establish guidelines for effective development and transition of future generations of MFF into EVA systems and other applications.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA's mission demands systems that provide advanced functions within extremely small volumes and with very little mass. This is the nature of space flight in general, and is especially true for EVA systems where everything required to sustain and protect an astronaut and to enable productive work in challenging space environments must be combined in an easily-stored, multiple-use, man-portable assembly. The challenge has been intensified by the Vision for Space Exploration's commitment to human missions to Mars which will demand drastic reductions in the mass of EVA systems and in their demand for expendable resupply materials.<br><br>MFF offer an attractive path to meeting this challenge in several ways. By making structural fibers functional, they offer the opportunity to combine functional components and the structures that enclose, and support them, making the mass do double duty. In addition, they allow the creation of flexible functional components making them easier to integrate and store within tight system and vehicle constraints. <br><br>Although the demand for and relevance of MFF are immediately evident in EVA applications, they offer similar benefits in many other space systems as well. Their potential flexibility makes them an especially attractive means of adding function to systems like the inflatable antennas, habitats, rovers, etc. considered in many advanced mission concepts.  <br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The desire to create clothing that increases the user's ability to interact with the environment without sacrificing comfort, style, or functionality also has many applications in commercial markets. The growth of wearable electronics for health monitoring, communications, or entertainment functions also require power and comfort control that could benefit from the proposed technologies. One can imagine similar integration of functions for military markets where MFF are integrated into tents, micro air vehicles, high altitude air ships, tactical satellites and other remote sites that require power for communications and data management.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The Phase II program will concentrate on manufacturing of qualified low-current, light-weight, 10K ADR magnets for space application. Shielded ADR solenoidal magnets will be compared with self-shielding toriodal magnets in terms of overall weight, volume, and cooling capacity. Models of both toroidal and shielded solenoidal magnet systems will be built and tested to compare the two options at practical as well as technical levels.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Currently many commercial superconducting magnets use NbTi wires and are cryogen-free. These magnets use commercial cryocoolers that can achieve cooling capacity of 0.5-1W at 4K. The input power requirement of these cryocoolers range between 3-5 KW. Operations at 10K can allow the input power to be reduced by a factor of 2-3. With the continuous rise in price of fuel, reduction in input power has a high potential to drive the cryogen-free superconducting market towards Nb3Sn magnets operating at 10K. Additionally, execution of this program will facilitated the commercialization of Formvar insulated reinforced Nb3Sn wires that can be wound to form coils. This approach to manufacturing of Nb3Sn coils, often refered to as react-and-wind, has been a much sought after technology by the international superconductivity community as it offers both economy and precision to Nb3Sn magnet fabrication.

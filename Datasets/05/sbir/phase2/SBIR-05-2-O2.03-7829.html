<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The proposed innovation will utilize a small network of remote sensors (Figure 2.1) to perform Radio Interferometry (RI) and Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) techniques to survey, identify and locate Radio Frequency (RF) energy signatures within a given geographic area such as a launch range or other strategic area.  The survey mission will use radio interferometry techniques to create RF "images" of the surveyed area.  These images will show the locations of all RF activity within an area.  While an area is secure, a set of images will be captured and averaged to establish the nominal RF baseline for that area.  Once the baseline is established, real-time RF surveys will be instantly compared to the nominal baseline to detect the existence of RF spectral anomalies.  The TDOA and RI techniques used to establish the RF images will determine the precise location of any spectral anomaly source so that it can be quickly and cost effectively identified and mitigated.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
There are a number of potential NASA applications for Soneticom, Inc.'s RI and TDOA system: <br>Range Surveillance would be a primary use for the RI/TDOA system.  An RI enhanced TDOA system will greatly increase the speed and efficiency of insuring a clear and safe range by quickly identifying and locating any sources of radio emissions.  The system will identify inadvertent emissions such as a boater who has wondered into a secure area as well as intentional hostile threats like someone attempting to jam or intercept communications.<br>Interference Mitigation is a problem that the RI/TDOA system will help resolve by locating sources of interference that are a potential threat to launch operations. <br>Personnel Tracking RI/TDOA system could potentially be adapted to locate or identify NASA personnel during operations.  Personnel could wear a small RF beacon that the RI/TDOA system could use to track their whereabouts during critical operations or improve security by identifying people in areas who do not have proper access.<br>Asset Tracking- the RI/TDOA system could potentially be adapted to track certain assets as described above or it could be used as a pseudo passive radar to track and locate objects (equipped with a small RF beacon). For instance, the space shuttle solid rocket boosters could be tracked during reentry and recovery. <br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Interference mitigation around commercial airports is a problem that the RI/TDOA system could help resolve by locating sources of interference that are a potential threat. Uninterrupted communications between flight crews and ground operations is critical to the FAA's mission of safe flight operations. Personnel tracking in prisons and correction institutions can be accomplished with the RI/TDOA system by placing RF beacons on inmates and tracking individuals' movements and whereabouts.<br>RF Surveillance along US Border could significantly improving the border patrols responsiveness to potential illegal border crossings.<br>Survey ? Due to the unique ability of the RI technique to identify multiple targets on the air concurrently, this technique could be utilized to identify subscriber density in areas where people tend to congregate, leading to  more optimal deployment of consumer communications infrastructures like cellular and WiMax.   Knowledge of this information in real-time could also lead to improved traffic management.<br>RF Emitter enforcement ? Current federal laws which regulate the use of RF emitters on board aircraft, around high explosives, etc. are very difficult to enforce given current techniques. These are very similar to the goals of NASA.  The RI approach could be used to verify that all cellular phones are turned off prior to departure or that there are no intentional or unintentional emitters sharing the frequency with an explosives detonator.  <br>

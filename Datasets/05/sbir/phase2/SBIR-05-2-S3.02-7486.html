<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
One of the critical issues for NASA missions requiring high contrast astrophysical imaging such as Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) is wavefront control.  Without use of appropriate adaptive optics technology, it is impossible to obtain high quality imaging.  Normal adaptive optics systems utilize a series of discreet components to satisfy the correction requirements.  These consist of tip/tilt mirror and deformable mirrors.  Xinetics has engaged in developing series of deformable mirrors and integrated adaptive optical components that will improve the optical quality of traditional wavefront control systems while simultaneously reducing system volume, weight and cost.  Our innovative integrated wavefront corrector will combine new types of deformable mirror, Photonex Meniscus, with tip/tilt stage with Xinetics co-fired ceramic actuators.  The proposed effort is the result of a strategic vision to develop small robust wavefront corrector designed to be employed in space based optical systems.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
This technology will apply to many NASA mission such as TPF, SIM, SAFAIR, and others where compact lightweight adaptive optics system will be necessary.  The ground based telescope will also benefit from this technology with it potential cost and foot print reduction capability.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Potential non-NASA commercial applications include microlithogrpahy, ophthalmology, optical communications and astronomy, all of which will benefit from improved adaptive optics system that will provide volume, weight and cost reduction.

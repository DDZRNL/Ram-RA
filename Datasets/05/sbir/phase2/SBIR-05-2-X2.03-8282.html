<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The completed Phase I work was directed at the application of nanotechnology to graphite/epoxy composites.  A novel approach to the application of the nanotubes onto the carbon fiber surface was investigated.  As a result, a very significant increase in compressive strength of 120% was attained, compared with 20% reported in the literature.<br><br>The Phase II builds on the success of the Phase I.  It will address the key issues of scale-up, reproducibility and component fabrication.  The batch fiber coating process employed in the Phase I will be replaced with a continuous fiber coating process.  Manual pre-pregging of the Phase I will be replaced with a continuous pre-pregging process.  Specific CEV type composite applications will be identified.  Subsequently, a cost/benefit ratio for CEV will be provided.<br>

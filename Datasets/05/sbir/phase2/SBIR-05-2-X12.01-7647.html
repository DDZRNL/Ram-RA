<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
An electrochemical reactor is proposed by MicroCell Technologies, LLC to electrochemically reduce carbon dioxide to oxygen. In support of NASA's advanced life support processes and human exploration missions, recovering oxygen from carbon dioxide is important since oxygen resupply is not a viable option. During a Phase I program, we demonstrated a process that uses a low temperature molten salt to selectively adsorb carbon dioxide and reduce it to separated streams of oxygen and carbon monoxide.  This carbon dioxide removal and oxygen generator may be used by NASA to provide oxygen for cabin crew life support or for propellant generation on the moon or Mars as a part of the In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) process. During the Phase II project, we will develop this technology into a compact and lightweight reactor to efficiently produce oxygen from carbon dioxide. <br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Potential NASA applications of the demonstrated technology include carbon dioxide reduction on board International Space Station and long duration exploration missions to the moon and Mars. Elements of the proposed technology may be used in other electrochemical reactor schemes for generating propellants as a part of NASA's In Situ Resource Utilization program.<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Commercial applications of the demonstrated technology may be found in processing or sequestering carbon dioxide from the ambient environment. Additional commercial applications may be found in sensors for carbon dioxide in air detection using components of the base technology developed here.

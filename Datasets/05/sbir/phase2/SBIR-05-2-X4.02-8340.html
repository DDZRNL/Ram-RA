<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
The innovation of the proposed effort is a unique automated process for the analysis, design, and sizing of CLV/CEV composite and metallic structures. This developed process will permit hundreds of conceptual and preliminary design trade studies to be performed in a matter of only a few days rather than several months. This shorter time is made possible by replacing or reducing currently required experienced analyst interaction (man in the loop) with predefined knowledge based sizing templates for laminate strength and producibility optimization. Innovative virtual structural component definitions that 'float' between automatic HyperSizer to FEA iteration cycles redefine acreage surfaces areas while simultaneously including connecting bonded/bolted joints. The resulting capability will be an open architecture built within the HyperSizer<SUP>REG</SUP> commercial software suitable for internally integrating NASA or industry developed specialty discipline analysis codes and externally integrating HyperSizer with NASA larger design systems. This new capability will be unique in that no other commercial or non-commercial tool will have the same level of depth, breadth, accuracy, speed, verification & validation, and software robustness for performing weight prediction and reduction, structural integrity margins-of-safety reporting, and reliability prediction and improvement.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
NASA Research and Flight Centers: Active CEV (Orion) and CLV 2nd stage (Ares) NASA users include at Langley primarily the Vehicle Analysis Branch, Structural Mechanics Branch, Computational Structures and Materials Branch, Structural & Thermal Systems Branch; at Marshall a large group of branches that include both the analysis and design groups, at Glenn the Life Prediction Branch, and at Johnson the Structures and Mechanics division. <br><br>Industry: HyperSizer has and is currently being used by both Boeing/Northrop Grumman and the Lockheed Martin teams for their CEV designs and by ATK for their CLV 1st stage solid rocket booster skirts and frustum.<br><br>The listed innovative new capabilities proposed in the work plan are direct requests from these companies and from our existing NASA users for application to their CLV/CEV trade studies that include cryogenic tanks, intertanks, interstages, skirts, frustums, service module, crew module, and launch abort system, etc.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Non-NASA applications: Boeing's commercial transport 787, pylon integration, and vertical fin and 737RS wing box; Goodrich's 787 and A350 complete engine nacelles and thrust reversers, Northrop Grumman's UAVs such as J-UCAS, and composite ship superstructures, space launch structures; Lockheed Martin's F-22, C-130J, and space launch vehicles; Gulfstream's general aviation and new supersonic aircraft, Pratt Whitney's Hypersonic engines, and Scaled Composite's experimental planes and spacecraft, and the Air Force new Hybrid Launch Vehicle flight demonstrator.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
During the Phase I effort, OPTRA developed object detection, tracking, and identification algorithms and successfully tested these algorithms on computer-generated objects of various shapes and sizes and on sample real-world image sequences of a DeltaII booster separation.  The algorithms currently identify six basic shapes (sphere, disk, cone, thin rectangle, tube, and cube) with better than 90% accuracy and estimate their size in three dimensions.  Object shape and three dimensional size information can be determine using images from a single digital camera while two cameras are needed to provide three-dimensional trajectory and ground impact position information.  While the Phase I showed the feasibility of the approach, work still needs to be done during the Phase II effort refining and expanding the detection, tracking, and identification algorithms to take into account the effect of noise, obscuration (smoke, clouds, etc), and viewing angle.  Also during the Phase II, we plan develop a robust optical system using all commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment and then test the system with several live outdoor tests.<br><br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
This program has a clear and immediate NASA applications: the development of (1) a capability to automatically track up to 100 objects in the vicinity of a large rocket after a launch (2) a capability to use the digital image data from multiple tracking and imaging stations to establish 3D trajectories of such objects, and (3) to identify such objects in terms of their sizes and shapes. This will provide NASA with an enhanced capability to document rocket launches.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The proposed Advanced 3D Object Identification system should be very attractive to the DoD in weapons testing applications, and to the DoD and commercial aircraft manufacturers for monitoring test flights of manned and un-manned aircraft. It would also be interesting to consider the use of such cameras & software in UAVs whose data could be combined to provide 3D trajectories of remotely observed object fields.<br><br>

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
High peak power, high efficiency, high reliability lightweight, low cost QCW laser diode pump modules with up to 1000W of QCW output become possible with nLight's new laser diode package methodology.  Following the design principles from our Phase I results, we propose an innovative packaging architecture to provide NASA with highly reliable 808nm laser diode pump sources for space based LADAR systems or other uses. nLight proposes a package development program to demonstrate up to 1000W of QCW pump power, with greater than 100E8 laser shot reliability.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
We anticipate that a 1000W class QCW laser pump package can be used for space based LADAR systems. The output can be either fiber coupled, or a hermetically sealed window can be incorporated.  The package format will be compatible with flight reliability requirements.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
The package type can be readily used for commercial and military applications.  Commercial applications include direct material processing, laser drilling and cutting, laser marking, medical applications, laser soldering, and fiber laser pumping applications.  With 1000W of available pump power, high efficiency, and the ability to mix and match wavelengths, this package architecture is expected to displace more traditional laser bar packages for military use in infra-red counter measure systems, target illumination and range finding, or for directed energy weaponry.

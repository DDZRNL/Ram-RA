<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT </B>(Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)<BR>
Silicon carbide matrix composites can produce turbomachinery structures with 1500<SUP>o</SUP>C service temperature capability at less than one-half the weight of metallic structures.  This would translate into substantial improvement in rocket (or aircraft) system performance.  However, SiC composites do not have adequate long term stability under hot, humid turbine engine conditions.  Thus, reliable environmental barrier coating (EBC) technology needs to be developed for SiC composites for long duration or reusable turbomachinery applications.  <br><br>The preceding SBIR Phase I program proved feasibility of our technology to improve environmentally durability of silicon carbide CMCs.  The Phase II program will refine coating materials and processes. A comprehensive test matrix is included to assess repeatability in environmental barrier performance.  Next, this technology will be used to produce representative turbine engine test articles.  Surmet has teamed with a major prime contractor, so as to develop technology that is useful towards near-term NASA systems.  Key environmental barrier testing work will be conducted at specialized test facility that simulates turbine engine environment.  Thus, the Phase II program will provide a strong foundation for a follow-on Phase III program which will start implementation into specific NASA system(s).<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) <BR>
Preceramic polymer based SiC CMC's provide affordability and potential for scale-up in size.  Together with the EBC technology, it will provide cost effective and durable SiC composite structures for long duration and reusable rocket, scramjet and turbine engines systems.  Specifically, components such as nozzles, turbine blades and vanes, and thrust chambers resulting from this technology will produce substantial improvement in propulsion system cost and performance.  The technology also has applications in: structural thermal protection systems for reentry vehicles, radiators for projects like JIMO, plasma confinement for in-space propulsion, and dimensionally stable satellite optics structures.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS </B>(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)<BR>
Environmentally durable SiC composites will initially be demonstrated in government aerospace applications.  Once developed and scaled up, the technology will find a number of commercial and industrial applications.  These include: a) military/commercial rocket engine/motor components such as nozzles and thrust chambers, b) military/commercial aircraft engine components such as combustion chamber, turbine and recuperator, c) automotive/diesel engine components such as turbocharger rotors, rocker arms, etc., d) industrial applications such as slurry pump vanes and turbine components, e) tribological applications such as aircraft, racing cars, and motorcycle brakes, and f) precision optics structures for satellites and missile interceptors.

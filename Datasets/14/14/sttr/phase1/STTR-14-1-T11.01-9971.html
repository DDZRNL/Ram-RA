		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to apply to planetary terrain mapping an alternative, multiresolution method, subdivision surfaces (subdivs), in place of conventional digital elevation maps (DEMs) and fixed-resolution meshes. The proposed research is innovative in that it presents a new setting for subdivs that demands novel extensions to subdivision algorithms, techniques and theory. The primary objectives of this work are to: (1) demonstrate suitability of subdivs as a representation for terrain data with highly varied spatial resolution and 3-D features; (2) demonstrate their ability to encode, and later re-register, local detail non-destructively through hierarchical edits; and (3) prototype a software user interface introducing new capabilities enabled by the subdiv representation. The expected benefits are: (a) higher-fidelity terrain visualization with reduced infrastructure requirements; (b) ability to visualize 3-D features, such as overhangs, missed in DEM's; (c) compact encoding with natural level-of-detail control for interactive viewing even on mobile devices; (d) greater algorithmic efficiency for non-visualization scientific computation; and (e) enablement of new software-tool capabilities for dynamic mapping of alternative local-terrain datasets, non-destructive experimentation, collaboration, and data traceability. The innovation also promises capability and reliability benefits to a surface robot by unifying terrain representations and enabling minimal upload of only incremental terrain details from the ground.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We believe present and near-future applications for this innovation within NASA include:<BR>- Planetary and lunar terrain mapping in support of science and mission planners<BR>- Mars terrain mapping in support of future high-tempo missions<BR>- Regolith mapping<BR>- Representation of rover and tool geometry in a common format with terrain for unified planning and immersive visualization<BR>- Representation of structured (man-made) environments for robot operations<BR>- Earth terrain mapping in support of field scientists using mobile devices<BR>- Earth terrain mapping in support of changing-landscape studies, e.g., involving polar-ice remodeling due to climate change or representing erosion progression in coastal studies
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We foresee broad and compelling applications for this innovation in commercial and military settings:<BR>- New terrain methods for military or commercial mapping, including for mobile use by soldiers and field workers<BR>- New methods for bathymetry representation and visualization for naval and commercial-marine applications<BR>- New methods for offline terrain rendering, for example for film production<BR>- New methods for real-time terrain rendering, for example for commercial and military flight simulation and for immersive 3-D computer games

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NanoSonic has recently developed multifunctional shielding and self-healing HybridSil&#63720; (HS) smart composites via the inclusion of innovative nanoshell inclusions.  These lightweight yet high-strength rapidly self-healing materials combined with NanoSonic's Metal Rubber&#153; (MR) shielding nano-additives and are offered herein as protection systems for NASA vehicles, habitat modules, and pressure vessel structures.  The conductive aspect of Metal Rubber also enables damage detection.  This technology may overcome the current bottleneck of damage tolerance for current composites that form nearly undetectable cracks upon impact that impart drastic effects on the structural survivability.  HS-MR self-healing composites offer both self-healing and damage detection, as well as the added functionality of very high levels of electromagnetic shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) without the need for additional heavy layers.  MR exhibits EMI SE of greater than -100 dB upon exposure to a blow torch, repeated cold flexing at -50 ?C, and irradiation under a 60Co source.  During Phase I, TRL 5 shall be reached upon demonstration of damage tolerant, self-healing structural composites with assistance from our radiation expert STTR partner, CSU, and commercial space partner.  During Phase II, TRL 7 shall be achieved upon demonstrated damage detection and self-healing in a representative flight environment with our defense prime partner.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NanoSonic's HybridSil&#63720; Metal Rubber&#153; (HS-MR) materials will be primarily transitioned as smart, lightweight, multifunctional, self-healing composites for spacecraft to further NASA Space Exploration Program.  The materials shall be engineered for both primary and secondary structures, including vehicle, habitat module, and pressure vessel structures.  The multifunctional MR nano-additive component of the self-healing materials formed via NanoSonic's ESA process offer EMI and radiation shielding for enhanced long-term high altitude and space durability.  Such higher specific strength self-healing composites will result in drastic reductions in uptake mass and increased reliability for more cost effective and efficient space exploration.  Specifically, the composites shall monitor the extent of damage and repair such destruction throughout the lifecycle from manufacturing, to a tool drop, and in service due to micrometeoroid and orbital debris impacts on orbit.  Both coupons and a targeted space demonstrator shall be produced during this program with our space partners.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications for the self-healing composites include long-term protective storage liners for food or other sensitive materials, self-sealing tires, anti-ballistic fuel tanks and life critical personnel protective equipment (PPE).  The EMI and radiation shielding protective constituent offer utility as cost effective protection against electrostatic charging, radiation, and abrasion.  Aerospace, biomedical and microelectronic markets would benefit from the EMI SE under repeated and severe reconfigurations.  Such EMI shielding skins can be envisioned for use on aircraft, morphing unmanned aerial vehicles, antennas and space structures.  Structural, high temperature, composite materials having unique dielectric and multiple controlled electromagnetic properties are possible via NanoSonic's layer-by-layer approach.  Spray ESA is envisioned as a cost-effective, environmentally friendly technology to displace sputtering and traditional dense filled composites.  Metal Rubber&#153; fabrics and films can also function as conducting electrodes for high strain mechanical actuator and sensor devices, or as electrically conductive mechanically flexible ground planes or electrical interconnection.

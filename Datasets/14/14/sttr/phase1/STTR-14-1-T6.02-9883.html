		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Busek and University of Utah propose to develop novel metal organic framework (MOF) material to efficiently capture oxygen in spacecraft cabin environment. The proposed novel MOF is postulated to be capable of separating oxygen from ambient air with high efficiency, and at the same time, be stable to moisture and resistant to decomposition. In Phase I, our team shall synthesize the proposed MOF and a MOF of known oxygen capture capability as the benchmark. The MOFs will be tested for their oxygen capture capability, gas selectivity, and reversibility.  The effects of water on capture capability will also be examined. The physical measurements will guide the syntheses.  At the end of Phase I, a preliminary sub-scale proof of concept will be explored for configuration optimization with relevant air flows.  In Phase II, we shall validate the subscale proof-of-concept device and further scale up toward a prototype MOF-based O2 capture system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed synthesis scheme could potentially yield a new MOF capable of capturing oxygen effectively and of withstanding moistures.  Such MOF-based system will not only improve the control of oxygen level in spacecraft during medical oxygen application, but also provide means to concentrate oxygen in the confined environment.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		MOF-based oxygen concentrators could be adapted effortlessly in the medical and health industries.  The reduction of weight and power feature would further benefit portable oxygen concentrators.

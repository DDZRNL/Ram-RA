		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Deep-ultraviolet (UV) Raman spectroscopy is a powerful method to collect chemically specific information about complex samples because deep-UV (?? < 250 nm) excitation shows an over 200-fold greater efficiency compared to commonly used 785 nm excitation and has the ability to avoid fluorescence background in the Raman spectra.  The availability of compact, robust, and reliable deep-UV laser sources has been always considered a major bottleneck problem on implementing this spectroscopic technique for NASA's space-borne applications. TIPD proposes to develop an ultrastable, compact, and long-lived deep-UV laser source for Raman spectroscopy based on our substantial experiences and facilities in developing single-frequency fiber lasers and solid-state deep-UV laser sources. Cooperating with the University of Arizona, we will develop an ultrastable and compact high power single-frequency single-polarization fiber laser system at 976 nm. The deep-UV laser source at 244 nm will be generated through two successive frequency doubling systems. In this phase I program, we will demonstrate deep-UV generation though frequency quadrupling of a 976 nm single-frequency fiber laser.  In phase II, a deep-UV laser prototype meeting all the criteria of NASA's applications will be developed.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Deep-UV Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool to identify a variety of gas, liquid, and solid materials in the universe. Compact and ultrastable deep-UV laser sources can be used for planetary compositional, geological, and mineralogical analyses, planetary sample acquisition and habitability assessment, the search for past life on Mars, and human protection in aerospace.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Deep UV sources can be broadly used for Raman spectroscopy, laser cooling and trapping, laser inspection, optical data storage, metrology, biomedical applications, and laser lithography. Besides as ultra-stable narrow-linewidth laser sources for nonlinear wavelength converter, the single-frequency fiber lasers at 976 nm can also be used for low noise laser pumps for a variety of lasers at 1 ??m and 1.5 ??m. The 488 nm blue lasers have potential applications in submarine imaging, sensing, communications, data storage, undersea oil exploration, full color displays, and medicine.

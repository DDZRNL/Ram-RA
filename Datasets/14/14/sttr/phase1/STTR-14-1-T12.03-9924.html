		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A novel method for fabricating electronics containing both metals and polymers can be adapted to quickly and effectively produce micro-well sensors. The process revolves around creating a polymeric part through additive manufacturing, leaving voids and trace capillaries. Once the polymer structures are completed, molten metal is injected into these trace capillaries, which create a path to the voids in the printed parts. Capillary forces cause the liquid metal to wick into the capillary channels, filling the voids before solidifying. Unlike competing metal additive manufacturing techniques, the parts can be created with 100% dense metal elements that have low surface roughness and are completely compatible with the surrounding polymer. <BR><BR>The proposed objective is to adapt the process specifically for the fabrication of the micro-well detectors required by the AdEPT mission.<BR><BR>The overall objective of this proposal is to develop the liquid metal injection process for use with the high-resolution additive manufacturing methods made available through the UCF team, in order to allow for the creation of metal/polymer parts with sub-mm features. A further goal of the program will be to generalize the process in order to expand into other NASA projects, as well as enable a variety of commercial products.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The medium-energy gamma ray polarimeter for the Advance Energetic Pair Telescope (AdEPT) mission is the primary application for the micro-well detectors. Other applications include future space telescopes, circuit boards, waveguides, charged particle trackers, and sensors for biological testing. With plans for Made In Space's 3D printer and casting systems to be integrated into the ISS in the near future, in-space fabrication of micro-electronics could provide unique new applications for NASA.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The hybrid additive manufacturing process will lead to products and abilities that traditional manufacturing are incapable of achieving. Such techniques could lead to customized microscale electronics including electronics that can be integrated around structures. Microscale manufacturing techniques could also be used for customized medical applications, like for small sutures or prosthetic parts.

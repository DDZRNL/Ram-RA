		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In Phase 2 we will develop a fully integrated, autonomous free-flying robotic system based on a commercial SkyJib quadcopter, and demonstrate flying straight and level to a target location, acquisition of rock and regolith samples, and return to the point of origin.<BR><BR>The work plan for Phase 2 is as follows:<BR>1. Completion of the Guidance, Navigation, Control, Vision, and Sample Acquisition subsystems.<BR>2. Integration of all the payload elements at ERAU and system level check out <BR>3. Demonstration of the entire system at NASA KSC  <BR>4. Field deployment at analog location

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In 2010, President Obama called for a new approach to space exploration, which would include human and robotic exploration of asteroids. The first step in this program would be Asteroid Retrieval Mission (ARM) currently under study at NASA. Characterization of these objects would require novel approaches akin to what is here proposed. <BR>In the latest Decadal Survey, the committee recommended selecting a Comet Surface Sample Return mission as one of the NF4 missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Sampling of contaminated soils and liquid from hazardous environments (nuclear reactors, chemical spills etc.). <BR>Geologists could use it to capture samples from hard to reach areas, such as for example lava-tubes in Hawaii. Cameras and sensors could map the area and give the geological context. <BR>Commercial companies such as Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries, who are interested in asteroid mining for economic gains, could also use this technology.

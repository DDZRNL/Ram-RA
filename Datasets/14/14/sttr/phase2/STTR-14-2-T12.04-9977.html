		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Despite the rapid commercialization of additive manufacturing technology such as selective laser melting, SLM, there are gaps in process modeling and material property prediction that contribute to slow and costly process development, process qualification and product certification. To address these gaps, CFDRC and our partner Dr. Kevin Chou, University of Alabama, will develop multiple computationally efficient, high-fidelity simulation tools for the SLM process.  During Phase I the team demonstrated efficient thermomechanical simulations for centimeter size test coupon builds, the feasibility of applying multiphase flow models to analyze particle scale effects on material variations, application of phase field models to predict microstructure evolution, and experimental characterization for model verification and refinement.  During Phase II, the modeling tools will be extended to improve computational efficiency and scalability to aerospace component dimensions by further leveraging parallel computing and other acceleration techniques.  The fidelity of the models will be enhanced to better predict distortion, residual stress, microstructure and defects from process conditions; and additional process data will be used to validate the resulting codes.  The high-fidelity, physics based nature of the codes will allow straightforward application to new materials, and to guiding development of and verifying analytical physics models for process control.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has demonstrated the potential for cost and time savings via additive manufacturing, successfully building and testing a complex rocket injector.  The build took 3 weeks, at half the cost of traditional methods that require 6 months.  The technology also offers the potential for design flexibility, weight savings, and increased reliability from monolithic parts with reduced joining.  The proposed models will allow for a deeper understanding of the resulting material properties and increase the confidence in, and use of, additive manufactured parts.  Furthermore the tools will enable process control and reduced time to optimize the recipe for a given part, thereby enabling the proliferation of additive manufacturing as a rapid prototyping and production tool for components in critical NASA systems.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Mature AM technologies will benefit designers and producers of aerospace components for military and civilian aircraft with low 'buy-to-fly' costs and increased functionality similar to the NASA benefits.  Beyond the aerospace industry, there are opportunities for this technology in other high-value engineering applications such as production of patient-specific biocompatible implants.

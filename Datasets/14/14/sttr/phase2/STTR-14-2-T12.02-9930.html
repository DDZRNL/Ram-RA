		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The technical objectives of this program are: (1) to develop a set of physics-based modeling tools to predict the initiation of hot corrosion and to address pit and fatigue crack formation in Ni-based alloys subjected to corrosive environments, (2) to implement this set of physics-based modeling tools into the DARWIN probabilistic life-prediction code, and (3) to demonstrate corrosion fatigue crack initiation and growth life prediction for turbine disks subjected to low-cycle and high-cycle fatigue loading in extreme environments. This technology will significantly improve the current ability to simulate and avoid corrosion fatigue failure of engine disks or metallic structural components due to prolonged exposure to extreme environments at elevated temperatures. Completion of the proposed program will provide probabilistic corrosion fatigue crack growth life assessment software tools for structural components subjected to aggressive hot corrosion environments. Such a suite of software tools is unique<BR>and is urgently needed for designing and improving the performance of critical structures used in the space structure and propulsion systems in commercial and military gas turbine engines, and oil and gas industries. This generic technology can also be used to provide guidance for developing new alloys or improving current Ni-based alloy<BR>designs for hot-section applications.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In Phase III, ERI will work with SwRI and the OEM team member(s) to commercialize the hot corrosion prediction software package either as parts or a stand-alone software tool for designing, lifing and risk assessment of structural components subjected to hot corrosion environments. Such a suite of software tools is unique and is<BR>urgently needed for designing and improving the performance of critical structures used in extreme environments.<BR>We see a potential market for such a software tool both in the commercial aerospace gas turbine engine sector and in the space structure, rocket and propulsion sectors. The software packages can be used to develop new Ni-based alloys or improve current Ni-based alloys for services in extreme corrosive atmospheres such as in Venus. In<BR>addition, the software package can be utilized to provide accurate life prediction and reliability assessment of Ni-based superalloy components used in hot corrosion environments.

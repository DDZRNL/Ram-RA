		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Proposed is an architecture for large (>200 m2 surface area) photovoltaic (PV) arrays, deployable from compact stowage with one single, continuously smooth sweep of motion and directly scalable to sizes at least an order of magnitude larger to provide surface areas beyond 4000 m2 -- the area associated with 1 MW power production, the upper limit of projected solar electric propulsion (SEP) needs in 10-20 years.  In particular, examined is the integration of a version of the "spiral fold" (an origami-like surface mechanism to wrap without stretching a tessellated sheet on a hub) and wrap rib technology (supporting ribs that also wrap around the hub when stowed) with some additional concept elements to increase stiffness when deployed and the robustness of deployment.  Kinematic conflicts between components with geometric mismatch in a real-life hardware context re resolved, metrics for stowage and structural performance are assessed, and a streadmlined concept design is defined to satisfy all targeted specifications.  TRL level is advanced from 1 to 3.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has been spearheading the strategy to develop a robust and advanced space infrastructure that, in the foreseeable future, could support the extensive exploration of the solar system and render human presence in space sustainable and affordable.  One of the key technologies in this drive is solar electric propulsion (SEP), a technology with a mass efficiency an order of magnitude higher than conventional chemical engines.  SEP which has already supported some missions (e.g., Deep Space 1 in 1998 and Dawn in 2007) will revolutionize navigation (i.e., velocity change, orbit revision) capabilities for spacecraft of traditional architectures.  <BR><BR>However, to be powerful enough to support equipment on a scale necessary for the infrastructure behind human presence is space, SEP has to be scaled up which directly requires solar arrays capable of producing up to 1~MW of power, the long term goal targeted by this NASA solicitation.  <BR><BR>It is this future market (currently) driven by NASA for large solar arrays that the product developed by the presently proposed effort targets.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		For the large solar array structure here proposed, markets other than what has just been outlined will also arise.  Some non-scientific space applications such as defense (the military use of space) and planetary defense (defending Earth against impact by space objects such as asteroids) have traditionally time and again entertained power-hungry mission scenarios.  With the actual availability of a light weight, reliable, and easily scalable truly large solar array such as the one herein proposed, actual needs for this product in these additional markets will certainly arise.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		An on-board oxygen concentrator is required during long duration manned space missions to supply medical oxygen.  The commercial medical oxygen generators based on pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are large and highly power intensive.  TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes to develop a small, lightweight, portable oxygen generator based on a vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) to produce concentrated medical oxygen.  The unit uses ambient vehicle cabin air as the feed and delivers high purity oxygen while meeting NASA's requirements for high flow capacity, closed-loop tissue oxygen control and operation in microgravity/partial gravity.  TDA's VSA system uses a modified version of the lithium exchanged low silica X zeolite (Li-LSX), a state-of-the-art air separation sorbent extensively used in commercial Portable Oxygen Concentrators (POCs) to enhance the N2 adsorption capacity.  <BR><BR>In Phase I, we will demonstrate the scientific, technical, and commercial feasibility of the oxygen concentrator module (OCM).  The concentrator will have an adjustable pressure output to produce 2-15 lpm of O2 at 50 percent to more than 90 percent purity from ambient cabin air.  The OCM will be capable of self-regulating the oxygenation of the patient using a closed loop feedback system that senses tissue oxygenation level. We will evaluate the sorbent performance in a breadboard bench-scale prototype under simulated microgravity/partial gravity exploration atmospheres and carry out a 10,000 cycle test (at a minimum) to determine its long-term performance and mechanical durability.  Based on the experimental results, we will carry design the demonstration unit, optimize its power draw over the range of flows and oxygen levels, and determine its weight, volume and heat rejection requirements. This design will also include an inlet filter designed to remove potential smoke or toxic gases.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		An on-board oxygen concentrator will find application in long duration manned space missions and in International Space Station (ISS) to supply medical oxygen by recovering the excess oxygen from the cabin air.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The portable medical oxygen generator will also find immediate use in the medical evacuation platforms used in the military and civilian applications. The sorbent used in the system would also be applicable to bulk production of oxygen.  Oxygen is a strategically important chemical, with a $2.0 billion market value.

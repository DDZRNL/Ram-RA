		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The ultimate goal of the SOAR program is to develop robust hardware and algorithms for low light, passive terrain sensing.  The SOAR system will provide NASA with a solution for real-time obstacle avoidance for large and small unmanned air platforms.<BR>During Phase-I, we will collect images with all of the leading low-light camera technologies.  The image data will be used to derive, test, and enhance a passive terrain sensing algorithm based-on state-of-the-art, visual odometry and dense stereo algorithms.  At the end of Phase-I, we will recommend the optimal hardware, algorithm, and computing platform for full prototype development during Phase-II.  The factors used to make the recommendation include cost, range accuracy, size, power consumption, algorithm execution time, etc.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA applications include tracking wildfires, weather monitoring, terrain mapping, cargo transportation, communication relays, emergency disaster relief, search and rescue, climate research, and crop surveying.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications:  Once the proper FAA regulations are in place, commercial companies can use the technology develop during this program for low cost delivery of goods.<BR><BR>Defense applications: Any missions that require low altitude unmanned aircraft CONOPS including: surveillance, weapons delivery, communication relays, asset placement, and asset extraction.

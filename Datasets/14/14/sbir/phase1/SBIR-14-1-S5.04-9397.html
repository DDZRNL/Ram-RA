		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This project will further MBSE technology in fundamental ways by strengthening the link between SysML tools and framework engineering execution environments. Phoenix Integration has produced a commercial tool (MBSE Pak) which allows engineers to link SysML diagrams (in MagicDraw and Rhapsody) to ModelCenter, a general-purpose engineering integration framework. As a result, from SysML parametric diagrams, engineers can execute actual engineering analysis tools for the purpose of systems architectural design, requirements compliance, trade studies, etc. This proposal would extend this MBSE product in several specific ways. First, it would develop a systems analysis capability for improved management decisions including the ability to perform what-if studies of technology options, simulation of schedule and cost, and probabilistic discrete event simulation for risk analysis. Second, it would improve verification and validation of models through improved requirements compliance analysis, handling of time series data, and traceability of data pedigree for modeling artifacts. Third, it would connect SysML models to executable model libraries in which components can be executed in an ad-hoc manner (on any capable computer) from the library itself and include rich support for multi-fidelity modeling tools on  the backend. A representative system model would be developed as an example problem to illustrate the developed features and would be demonstrated to NASA throughout the course of the work.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A major benefit of the proposed software toolset is that it can be applied at the conceptual and preliminary design stage for complex projects across the entire spectrum of NASA Science, Human Exploration and Operation, and Aeronautics Research Mission Directorates. The proposed technology will provide for management decision support, verification and validation, and the use of standardized model libraries in MBSE. It is likely that these improvements will be most significant early in the design process where impacts on lifecycle costs are the greatest. Initial applications will be in the Science mission area dealing with advanced telescope systems, satellites, or robotic exploration. Additional applications will be pursued within the NASA directorates as case studies and models are developed.  NASA's Fundamental Aeronautics program has been a strong user of Phoenix technology and would benefit from the development work advocated here. JPL is also heavily investing in MBSE technology (e.g. the Europa Clipper program) and is a strong candidate for the deliverables described here. In general, satellite programs, space transportation, and air vehicle technologies can benefit from this technology. Government agencies that partner with NASA on joint programs such as DOE, NSF, and FAA would be natural extensions for commercialization.  In addition, prime NASA contractors in support of the ISS such as Boeing, Space X, Orbital Sciences, and Sierra Nevada are strong possibilities.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Beyond NASA, Phoenix Integration's commercialization efforts will be focused primarily on the aerospace and defense sector where companies such as Lockheed Martin are already actively using the base level MBSE technology discussed in this proposal. Phoenix Integration is well positioned to introduce this technology to leading organizations in this business sector such as BAE, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Pratt and Whitney, and Raytheon since they already utilize the company's products.  Phoenix Integration software tools are widely used by domain level engineers to analyze, design, and optimize the subsystems, components, and processes that make up complex aerospace systems. By leveraging this existing installed base, it will be possible to quickly achieve initial sales and establish a core user base for the new technology. After establishing penetration in aerospace and defense, Phoenix Integration will build upon these successes to pursue secondary markets such as automotive, heavy equipment, green energy, shipbuilding, transportation, and process industries. Some of these industries have begun using Phoenix products and MBSE tools in general. The growing market and interest in this technology has been robust and bodes well for future development.

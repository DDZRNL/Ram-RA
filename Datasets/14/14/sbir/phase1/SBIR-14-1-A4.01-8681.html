		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal addresses development of techniques that support experimental modeling, simulations, ground testing, wind tunnel tests, and flight experiments, with primary emphasis on ground testing requirements. Advanced System and Technologies Inc. proposes to develop a dual-function, non-contact sensor designed to support simultaneous dynamic Doppler imaging of flow-induced structural vibration (FISV) and flow-field visualization (FFV). The ability to capture full-field non-stationary structural dynamics and correlate these data with the unsteady flow fields which drive them could elucidate, for the first time, the complex mechanisms involved in limit cycle oscillation and transition to flutter in the transonic regime. The comprehensive spatio-temporal content of data captured by the dynamic Doppler imaging system (DDIS) will be compared with predictions from computational models in the transonic regime in support of efforts to more fully address the complex interdependent relationship between structural, aero-dynamic and aero-acoustic phenomenon. <BR><BR>We describe the core technology behind the DDIS, provide a detailed description of a practical design for deployment and show experimental data which conclusively demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. A structured work plan is presented leading to practical implementation of a demonstrator prototype in a robust and compact instrument architecture suited to ground testing, wind-tunnel and ultimately flight-test deployment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The fusion of FISV and FFV offers a new tool for application in fundamental aeronautic studies related to ground testing, wind tunnel tests, and flight experiments. The data provided by the DDIS could provide new insights related to unsteady aero-elastic phenomena, flutter boundary prediction, computational model refinement and thus rapid evaluation of new design concepts. These empirical data are required to aid development of more accurate models for transonic aero-elasticity and flutter clearance prediction. In addition to fundamental aeronautics, the DDIS offers a diagnostic tool which would aid identification of vehicle specific aero-elastic instabilities by elucidating the spatial dynamics under operational conditions, highlighting the flow of energy between vehicle sub-structures. The computation of dynamic structural intensity (DSI) supported by the DDIS architecture permits identification of transient sources and sinks by mapping the structural energy flow in real-time.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Many wind tunnel test facilities as well as all branches of military aerospace organizations concerned with aircraft flight stability, stores deployment, and fleet airworthiness are expected to benefit from the DDIS dual functionality described in the current proposal. However, the separate functional components of the proposed system could be successfully developed as stand-alone instruments for unsteady flow-field visualization or non-linear and transient full-field vibration measurement. By adding a parallel imaging modality to laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV), the core DDIS is anticipated to find applications across a broad spectrum of industries where existing commercial LDV's are currently employed. Numerous industries (automotive, aerospace, medical, computer electronics and industrial plants) employ LDV for modal vibration analyses. In addition to modal analysis, the DDIS would target the market represented by non-destructive testing in the marine, aviation and space industries and, in particular, the non-destructive inspection in manufacture and maintenance of deployed military systems.

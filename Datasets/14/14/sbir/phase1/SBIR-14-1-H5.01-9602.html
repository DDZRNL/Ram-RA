		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed innovation is a methodology for advanced process control and deposition analysis built around using signals generated by beam-component interactions in the Electron Beam Free Form Fabrication (EBF3) system. These signals have the potential to be used for many forms of both metrology and process control. While many material properties might be studied by using this interaction, our initial focus is an investigation into beam and sensor characteristics for geometric analysis of the deposition.    Signals derived from the electron beam-component interaction could offer spatially resolved dimensional information about the deposited material, as it is being deposited. This is important, as the ability to monitor a parameter during deposition creates the possibility of controlling that parameter during the deposition process.    As a further refinement, the ability to collect and store a spatially resolved pass-by-pass map of the deposition path geometry may have value in on-the-fly adjustments to subsequent build passes. Such mapping would allow working with the layer-by-layer nature of the deposition process to fine tune the deposition geometry. Such spatially resolved, layer-by-layer deposition mapping could also be stored, giving a three dimensional mapping of the as-built deposition path geometry. This could prove valuable for component quality assurance.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The commercial application for NASA will require the successful follow on development of the concepts proposed in this submission. That development would result in a standalone metrology sub-system package that would be made available to upgrade the EBF3 systems at Langley Research Center for further evaluation on the systems currently in use on program development work.    This in situ metrology package would have the ability to collect and process signals derived from the electron beam-component interaction that could offer spatially resolved dimensional information about the deposited material and the possibility of a second tier of control over the fabrication process wherein process parameters are adjusted to achieve target deposition dimensions.    The functional deliverable package would consist of detector(s) to be place in the EBF3 chamber, a set of detection electronics, power supplies, hardware controls interface, cables and module and system level software necessary for integration to the EBF3.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Non-NASA commercial applications for this submission will also require the successful follow on development of the concepts proposed. That development would result in these and potential other metrology capabilities being fully designed and integrated into a ground up purpose built next generation Electron Beam Direct Wire Feed fabrication system. The results of the electron beam modeling and experimental work that will fold into an optics design specific to the AM task. These systems will be made available as a commercial turnkey product for a broad range of markets and applications.  We envision these systems, as a result in part of this submission topic, to yield significantly improved and quantifiable results compared to those of the state of art today allowing them to begin more mainstream applications.

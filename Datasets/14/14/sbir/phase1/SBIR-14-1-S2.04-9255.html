		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has unique non-contact precision metrology requirements for dimensionally inspecting the global position and orientation of large and highly-polished multi-segmented mirrors (in an as-installed configuration), such as those used on the James Webb Space Telescope.  SURVICE Metrology has assembled a world-class team of metrologists and optical physicists to identify and develop innovative approaches to accurately inspect the positional accuracy of mirror segments using non-contact methods.  In addition to our in-house staff of experts in metrology and optics, our team includes industry-recognized academic experts in metrology.  What is needed is the ability to accurately measure the global position and orientation of mirror segments in an as-installed configuration using non-contact means from a safe distance to allow measurements to be made with minimal risk to the asset.  SURVICE proposes to research and evaluate technologies under the Phase I effort with respect to feasibility, cost, and risk and downselect to the best candidate technology for development in a Phase II effort.<BR><BR>SURVICE brings demonstrated metrology systems integration success that we will apply to the subject NASA challenge.  We have multiple Phase II and Phase III success stories, have delivered custom metrology solutions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		With segmented mirrors being the likely or preferred type of construction for most future large optical telescopes, there will be many opportunities to employ the SURVICE metrology solution on NASA and European telescope programs, to include the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), the Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST), and the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This NASA SBIR will provide opportunities to advance the state-of-the-art in metrology solutions applicable to large, segmented mirrors.  This includes high-precision optics used by the Department of Defense, which is a key market SURVICE will explore and exploit in Phase III commercialization efforts.

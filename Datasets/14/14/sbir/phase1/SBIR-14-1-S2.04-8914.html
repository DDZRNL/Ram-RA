		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The "piston errors" and aberrations of the mirror segments used in large telescopes, are typically measured with on-board optical instruments, usually a dispersed Hartman sensor (DHS) and/or dispersed fringe sensor (DFS). Calibrating and testing of the wavefront sensors are typically performed using custom-built fused silica phase plate arrays. The manufacture and assembly of each custom phase plate array is time-intensive and expensive.<BR><BR>Proposed is a gradient index (GI) phase plate array (PPA), which integrates the corrections of the DHS, an intermediate smoothing phase plate, and the DFS. This reduces the number of phase plates required, from three to one, and allows for the PPA t be used in the pupil plane, allowing for more precise calibration. The monolithic construction of the innovation significantly reduces development time and cost.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Spatial filter arrays (SFAs) have attracted great interest because of its wide applications, including coronagraph imaging, nulling interferometer, wavefront controls, wavefront compensation, free-space laser communications, adaptive optics, atmospheric compensation, and synthetic aperture imaging.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The military applications are similar to NASAs. The commercial applications, of this general technology, include low-profile cell phone camera lenses, smart glasses, solar concentrators, eye glasses & ophthalmic goods, night vision goggle lenses, 3D led films, microlens arrays, 3D imaging, CMOS photonics & optical backplanes, endoscopy & medical optical instrumentation, and military optics.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Plasma Controls will manufacture and test a set of ion optics for electric propulsion ion thrusters using additive manufacturing technology, also known as 3D printing. Additive manufacturing can potentially produce optics with novel or complex geometry that have better performance compared to those made traditionally, while also giving cost and mass savings.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High performance optics can be utilized on both high power, nuclear-scale or multi-thruster spacecraft for instance, and on low power small/micro/nano-scale spacecraft and satellites of current interest to the Science Mission Directorate. Ion thrusters, utilizing optics, are attractive for deep-space use due to their high specific impulse. Miniaturized ion thrusters can provide nontrivial delta-V capability to CubeSats for orbit raising, orbit plane changes, and potentially allow CubeSats to leave Earth-orbit or perform ambitious deep-space maneuvers.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Gridded ion sources are used extensively in the semiconductor and electro-optical manufacturing industry in etching (sputtering and reactive ion) and physical vapor deposition processes. Optics made using additive manufacturing can potentially meet custom beam-shape or target-profile needs with less-constrained physical shape requirements.

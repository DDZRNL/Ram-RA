		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Innovative, low cost high performance technologies are critical to the affordability of future space missions.  Carbon/carbon (C/C) composites have significant advantages over metallic solutions. However, C/C composites are generally known to have high costs and protracted lead times. Recent efforts by ATK Aerospace Group and Plasma Processes have focused on increasing capability of 2D C/C, while reducing cost and lead-time. Optimization studies by ATK have reduced manufacturing schedule by up to 60% and improved mechanical performance. Plasma Processes has developed protective coatings for C/C deposited via additive manufacturing techniques that have performed well in flight tests. These recent advances can reduce the cost and inert mass of future hypersonic and launch vehicles.  However, additional efforts are needed to optimize economical oxidative protective solutions for C/C.  The objective of a proposed Phase I is to merge advancements in C/C composite manufacturing with additive manufacturing coating application techniques to yield economical hot structures for future hypersonic vehicles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed work promises to improve performance and reduce cost of hot structures for future hypersonic vehicles. Specifically, the proposed technology can provide a structural, re-usable thermal protection system.  A partial list of existing and future NASA programs that could also benefit from this enhanced capability include robotic Moon or Mars missions; human Lunar accent/decent; and the nozzle extension liquid engines.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA applications that could benefit from the proposed technology include nozzle extensions of upper stage engines for nanosatellite launch or ISS resupply; nosetips, leading edges and control surfaces for DoD hypersonic vehicles; and exit cones and control vanes for tactical missiles.

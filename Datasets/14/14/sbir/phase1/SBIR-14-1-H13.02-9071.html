		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Reliable monitoring of the microcrack formation in the complex composite structure components in NASA spacecraft and launch vehicles is critical for vehicle operations. Early diagnosing and reporting vehicle capability has tremendous impact on mission readiness, safety, and life cycle cost. Microcrack formation in complex composite structure components can be challenging from a monitoring and evaluation point of view by traditional non-destructive evaluation methods, especially in the early stage. FBS, Inc proposes to develop a nonlinear guided wave circular array system for the SHM of microcrack formation in complex composite structure components of spacecraft and launch vehicles. The innovation here is the combination of guided wave circular array with nonlinear characteristics for microcrack SHM. Guided wave circular array has the capability of inspecting large areas with a small number of sensors and minimum wire connections. Magnetostrictive sensors will be used to build the array as they are flexible, sustainable to environmental temperature changes, and inexpensive. Nonlinear higher order harmonic guided waves will be emitted when fundamental guided waves impinge onto a microcrack. The nonlinear receiver will be built at the center of the circular array. The transition between fundamental to higher order nonlinear guided waves can be used to quantify the microcrack formation in complex composite structures.

		<BR>
		FBS proposes a novel hybrid ultrasonic guided wave technique that combines guided wave circular array technology with the nonlinear characteristics of guided waves for the SHM of microcracks in complex composite structure components in spacecraft and launch vehicles. The technique is aimed at providing a reliable, robust, rapid, flexible as well as cost effective SHM solution for spacecraft structures. The applications of the proposed technique, if successful, can lead to remarkable contributions to the inspection and maintenance of NASA spacecraft and launch vehicles. As compared to other currently in-use spacecraft inspection methods, our product can save a large amount of spacecraft maintenance time and cost due to the fact that our technique has the capability of monitoring large areas and hidden structures from limited accessible positions and characterizing microcracks in the mean time.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technique not only fits the needs of the on inspecting spacecraft structures, but also has the potential to be applied to almost any industrial or mechanical engineering system containing plate-like structures. The proposed technology is applicable for both metal and composite materials. It is sensitive to micro-damages in these materials and is capable of inspecting a large area from very limited accessible positions. The proposed technology can be slightly modified to be used on large tanks, ship hulls, as well as aircraft structures.

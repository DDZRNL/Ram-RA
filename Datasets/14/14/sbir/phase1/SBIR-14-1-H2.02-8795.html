		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Exquadrum proposes a high-performance liquid bi-propellant rocket engine that uses propellants that are non-toxic, self-pressurizing, and low cost.  The proposed engine and propellants provide the same performance as state-of-the-art storable propellants.  The propellants are storable for long durations without decomposition or degradation.  Because the propellants are self-pressurizing, they offer the potential for overall system weight savings by eliminating the pressurization system.<BR><BR>In Phase I, Exquadrum will develop this engine concept through trade studies and analyses and conclude with a proof-of-concept hot fire demonstration of a full-scale laboratory engine.  In Phase II, Exquadrum will mature the engine design to detail design, and deliver a full-scale engine to NASA for functional and environmental testing under simulated mission conditions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA consistently strives to reduce the cost of space missions and to reduce the use of toxic chemicals.  The proposed technology significantly reduces the cost of space missions by reducing the cost of the propellants, and by eliminating the cost of handling and processing toxic propellants.  A low-cost non-toxic in-space propulsion system with state-of-the-art performance has NASA applications including main spacecraft propulsion, orbital maneuvering systems, reaction control systems, and auxiliary power units.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A low-cost, non-toxic storable propulsion system has many non-NASA commercial applications.  The propulsion system could be used as a Rocket Assisted Take-Off (RATO) systems for Un-crewed Aircraft Systems (UAS) to increase gross takeoff weight while maintaining safe ground operations, or as a self-contained Auxiliary Power Unit (APU).  Additionally, it offers safe, high-performance in-space propulsion for the growing commercial space industry.

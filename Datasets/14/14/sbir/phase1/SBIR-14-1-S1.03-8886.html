		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose the fabrication of large format, long wave infrared (LWIR) mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe or MCT) detector arrays where the cutoff wavelength is extended to 12 micron at cryogenic temperatures for use in missions to near earth objects, comets, and the outer planets.  The MCT detector arrays will be a high performance improvement to meet the detector needs for future NASA missions.  The MCT material for these detector arrays will be grown by molecular beam epitaxy on cadmium zinc telluride (CdZnTe or CZT) substrates to produce high quality semiconductor material with low defect densities. In this Phase I proposed effort EPIR, Inc. (EPIR) will fabricate a prototype focal plane array (FPA) where a 12 micron cutoff LWIR MCT detector array on a CZT substrate will be hybridized to a small format readout integrated circuit (ROIC) for capability demonstration purposes.  EPIR will deliver this prototype FPA to the government for further evaluation.  Should this effort progress to Phase II, then LWIR MCT detector arrays will be fabricated for hybridization to large format 1k x 1k ROICs for implementation into future planetary science space missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Large format LWIR MCT FPAs will be a valuable asset for a variety of earth science and astrophysics experiments which require IR imaging.  The fabrication of large format LWIR MCT FPAs with high quantum efficiency and broad spectral response out to 12 microns will greatly increase the imaging capability of Discovery 13/14, New Frontiers 4, Europa Jupiter System, Mars 2018 and other space exploration missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A single detector and small-array product line would have a range of commercial applications, such as spectrometry, thermometry, high-end industrial manufacturing and hotspot detection.  Additionally, larger arrays will have applications in geophysics, geology, law enforcement, medical imaging systems, commercial airline landing aids, ground transportation safety. remote environmental sensing, search and rescue, and emergency response including firefighting.

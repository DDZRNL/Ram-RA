		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to demonstrate an eye-safe laser source for a DIAL CO2 sensor that meets or exceeds all topic requirements for a high-pulse-energy laser with good beam quality, transform-limited spectrum, and efficiency >25%. Our approach will use a cavity-dumped resonator to directly generate Nd 1.4-micron pulsed output, and injection seeding for spectral narrowing. This approach, while based on established technology, is innovative in finding an optimal solution from uncommon elements. Our design allows us to start with a well-behaved four-level laser instead of the problematic quasi-three-level lasers like Er:YAG and Er:glass (fiber). Moreover, it avoids the loss in efficiency that comes from using an OPO pumped by the common 1-micron Nd or Yb laser to generate eye-safe near-IR output. We also propose to demonstrate that our laser performance is tolerant of high-temperature operation, making passive cooling possible with major advantages in overall size, weight, wall plug efficiency, and power scalability.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA applications are in lidar systems for atmospheric remote sensing of chemical species with absorption characteristics around 1.4 microns. In particular, this region is ideal for CO2 sensing because it otherwise is a good atmospheric transmission window, and it is within the spectral region considered eye-safe. Additionally it can be used for water vapor sensing and free-space laser communications. Both CO2 and water vapor are important for climate studies and environmental science.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This laser can be frequency tripled to generate blue light that has good transparency in water. Therefore, it is of interest for underwater remote sensing and communications analogous to its atmospheric applications. Moreover, the short-pulse, high-energy configuration we are developing is necessary for long range and high sensitivity (high signal-to-noise ratio) in both underwater and atmospheric lidar. The 1.4-micron wavelength also has medical applications including treatment of skin conditions and removal of human body fat via laser-assisted lipolysis.

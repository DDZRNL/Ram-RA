		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Future Venus or Comet mission architectures may feature robotic sampling systems comprised of a Sampling Tool and Deployment Mechanism.  Since 2005, Honeybee has been developing extreme-temperature motors, position sensors, brakes, and gearboxes, resulting in multiple successful demonstrations of component-level technologies under Venus-like environmental conditions.<BR><BR>An important next step toward a viable Venus or Comet surface mission architecture is to combine these components and raise the TRL of the total sampling system including the Deployment Mechanism.  The proposed work will leverage component development to date by integrating extreme temperature actuators with functional elements to demonstrate a complete multi-DOF Deployment Mechanism suitable for candidate surface missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Extreme environment actuator technology allows for creation of sampling systems, robot arms and mobility systems that operate outside of an environment-controlled platform on the surface of Venus, the Moon, Comets and small bodies. Robotic exploration of high temperature terrestrial volcanoes and hydrothermal vents is also of interest to the science community.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Other potential applications include gas turbine starter/generators for aircraft engines, actuators for turbine fuel and steam control, inlet guide vane positioning, bleed heat valve control and remote subsea system actuation, expendable launch vehicle thrust vector control and gimbaling of engines and adaptable aerodynamic surfaces, and furnace tending for glass/ceramic manufacturing.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We have all seen people carrying portable oxygen tanks or concentrators to provide critical life support respiratory oxygen. Heavy, bulky, and for O2 concentrators, noisy, there clearly is an opportunity to improve the delivery of oxygen to the millions of users requiring oxygen therapy. This program affords us an opportunity to develop and demonstrate a noiseless, portable medical oxygen concentrator that can serve a large terrestrial market as well as future NASA exploration missions that need emergency oxygen for various medical scenarios. This product aims to improve the three largest user complaints with existing portable O2 concentrators, namely, that the systems are too heavy, too noisy, and they are too bulky restricting mobility. Reactive's medical oxygen concentrator will provide improved mobility for people that require O2 respiratory therapy enhancing the quality of their life.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA exploration mission planners have identified a need for an emergency medical oxygen system for various medical scenarios. It is desired to concentrate oxygen from the cabin air to directly provide an oxygen rate of 2-15 lpm at an oxygen concentration level ranging from 50 to 90%.  In this manner, the cabin atmosphere can maintain a relatively lower oxygen level minimizing fire hazards. An ideal system will operate off of spacecraft power and provide a closed-loop oxygen line for the crewmember where the blood oxygenation level is monitored and used as a feedback control signal to regulate the oxygen rate. It is also desired to have a portable lower-output version of this medical oxygen concentrator that can be for EVA pre-breathing and vehicle transfer operations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There is a growing need for ambulatory oxygen respiratory systems to enable patients to lead normal and productive lives. Supplemental oxygen is necessary for patients suffering from lung diseases including pulmonary fibrosis and sarcoidosis, as well as other ailments that weaken the respiratory system such as heart disease. The US market for pulse and continuous oxygen concentrators for portable medical oxygen systems was over $100M in 2010. With over six million people requiring oxygen therapy at present and the expectation that this will grow due to the aging Baby Boomer market, this is a potential $15B market opportunity. Applications for our system include portable oxygen delivery, home oxygen generation, and emergency oxygen generators. There is also a secondary market for athletes, recreational hikers and outdoor enthusiasts at high altitudes and high aerobic activity. A smaller version of this oxygen generator will provide supplemental oxygen to these users for enhancing performance giving them a competitive advantage in their activity.

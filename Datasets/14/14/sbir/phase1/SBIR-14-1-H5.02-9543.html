		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		High power solar arrays with capabilities of >100kW are needed for projected NASA missions.  Photovoltaic arrays using deployable membranes with thin cells have trended to higher efficiency cells to minimize deployed area and deployment structure mass and complexity, however, the cost of high efficiency cells make these arrays prohibitively expensive.  Amorphous cells that are in production for terrestrial application have $/Watt cost less than 10% of space cells, at about the half the efficiency.   This SBIR develops the Photovoltaic Assembly with Reconfigurable Array Structure - PARASol - a centripetal force deployment and tensioning approach that enables affordability of multi-100kW arrays with commercially available thin film CIGS cells, which can be adapted for space environment compatibility.  PARASol implements CIGS cell modules using Vanguard's THINS solar cell encapsulation technology to achieve high mass and stowed volume metrics (>500W/kg, >200kW/m3), and mount the CIGS-THINS modules onto a Membrane Solar Array (MSA) that can be rolled and folded into a compact envelope and deployed without cumbersome external deployment structure.  In phase I we will develop the design and structural analysis of a 250kW PARASol MSA, selecting from flower-, umbrella-, or origami-like deployments, and evaluate figures of merit for the array when implemented with a combination of centripetal force and elastic or shape-memory integral ribs to deploy and tension the array. We will evaluate the alternative gore sizes and shapes to determine the maximum PV packing factor we can achieve.  We will develop a plan for scaling up the technology and qualifying for space, addressing the key challenge of demonstrating and characterizing such a large array in ground-test with gravity off-loader.  The Phase I completes with a subscale demonstration using a scalable version of the test fixture, leading to a plan forward towards flight experiment in Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The available of affordable high power can extend NASA's reach in achieving its missions.  A variety of NASA missions being considered, including missions to asteroids, Mars, the Lagrange points, lunar surface, or outer planets need very high power to enable space mission capabilities, and for electric population, for manned spaceflight needs, and for sufficient aperture to collect sunlight in low illumination outer planet environments.  A reduction in solar array cost from $100's/Watt to $10's/Watt will make more missions affordable, and enhance their capability and reliability.  Very high power levels available affordably with such solar arrays could also enable improved space habitats, better In-Situ Resource Utilization, power beaming for terrestrial and extra-terrestrial applications, and reduced dependence on energy storage batteries.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Solar array power availability drives the capabilities and costs of many commercial spacecraft.  New "all-electric" spacecraft using electric propulsion to enhance mission life while reducing launch mass are driving prime power requirements to ever higher levels.  Additional power provides more transponders and improved signal strength, and allows for longer life because of the affordability of oversizing and redundancy.  The trend on commercial spacecraft being developed by Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Loral, and Orbital Sciences, among others, is for larger, higher power GEO spacecraft growing beyond 20kW.   A significant market also exists worldwide for more low to medium-power arrays, and as the CIGS technology is demonstrated in PARASol, scaled down version of the design will be marketed for applications in the 5-20kW range typical of commercial GEO spacecraft, and even smaller arrays for Smallsats and deployable Cubesats. Long duration, High altitude airships could also use deployed, towed arrays to enhance their capabilities and time aloft.

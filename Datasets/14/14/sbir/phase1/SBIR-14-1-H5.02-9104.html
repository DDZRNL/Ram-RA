		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To support NASA's vital interest in developing much larger solar array structures over the next 20 years, MotionPort LLC's Phase I SBIR project will strengthen validated modeling analysis and simulation techniques by developing a vertical application to simulate the nonlinear dynamics of the various stages of deployable space structures.  This application which will support RecurDyn Multi-Body Dynamics (MBD) software, acquired by NASA in 2013, will increase efficiency and reduce errors, time and the need for advanced knowledge.  Currently, modeling complex flexible body non-linear structures can be time consuming and prone to error. Existing nonlinear structural analysis simulation software does not effectively simulate structural assemblies with significant motion. Creation of a custom vertical application for the simulation of deployable space structures would provide a large reduction in the specialized knowledge needed to develop models and would automate tedious tasks. <BR>  The proposed innovations of this Phase I SBIR project are:<BR>  1. A focused vertical software application for the dynamic simulation of the rollup, deployment and maneuvering operation of large solar array structures consisting of a set of functions that are layered on commercial Multi-Body Dynamics (MBD) simulation software that also has the capability of the nonlinear simulation of flexible (Finite-Element [FE] or mesh-based) bodies; and<BR>  2. Development of an active, nonlinear controller that will reduce the deflection of a roll-out solar array (ROSA) during spacecraft maneuvers. This development includes the creation and use of a unique simulation environment that couples the controller simulation with the nonlinear structural response of the ROSA.<BR>  The Phase II project will add capabilities and improve integration of functions, including new support of the simulation of lanyards and tape springs. Additional type of deployable space structures can be simulated, including antennas.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA commercialization will follow a logical progression. The initial application will be a loose set of functions to simulate the nonlinear dynamics of ROSA structures. The initial target market would be appropriate NASA centers (NASA LaRC and NASA GRC) and their contractors. User experience from the Phase I applications will help guide the Phase II work.<BR><BR>The addition of the Phase II capabilities (simulation of lanyards and tape springs) and the improved integration of functions will result in a set of software applications that will be appropriate to the broader market of deployable space structures. Other solar array configurations can be addressed as well as deployable antennas. Most NASA Centers could be approached with these Phase II applications, as well as their contractors. The addition of the Phase II capabilities will allow the software to be used more widely in each NASA Center.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A market investigation for the ROSA application would be done at selected international space agencies in order to understand their needs. The addition of the Phase II capabilities will produce a software application that can be sold to an international market of agencies and contractors who work with deployable space structures. MotionPort LLC has working relationships with distributors of MBD software in Europe, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and Taiwan. These organizations have advanced technical skills and customer relationships that can bring this vertical application to the international market.

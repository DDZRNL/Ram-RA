		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Systima Technologies, Inc. is developing a non-catalytic ignition technology for advanced green ionic salt monopropellants such as HAN-based monopropellant AF-M315E.  Green (non-hazardous, low toxicity) monopropellants such as AF-M315E offer significant advantages in performance and reduced handling infrastructure for vehicles and payloads compared to traditional hydrazine systems.  Systima's innovative ignition technology does not require a catalyst bed, thus avoiding the need to pre-heat the thruster chamber, is light weight, and operates with very low power.  This approach is well suited for applications that require a lower system weight, less power consumption and increased thruster lifetime, and is also well suited for auxiliary power units (APU's).  The Phase I program will establish parameters for non-catalytic ignition of AF-M315E.  In Phase II we will conduct extended life hot-fire testing, evaluate system performance, and identify paths to flight demonstration in collaboration with Aerojet Rocketdyne.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Green monopropellant thrusters utilizing Systima's non-catalytic ignition technique will find applications in NASA in-space propulsion systems such as axial propulsion, trajectory correction maneuvers (TCM), orbit insertion, Mars sample return missions, as well as launch propulsion systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Green monopropellant thrusters utilizing Systima's non-catalytic ignition technique will find use in applications requiring low power and high &#8710;V, and safer propellant handling for personnel.  These applications include launch propulsion systems, missile system divert and attitude control systems, commercial launch vehicles, and auxiliary power units.  Applications for rapid access to space will benefit from use of green monopropellants to reduce launch costs and provide safe handling.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Reactive Innovations, LLC, proposes a Phase I SBIR program to develop a compact and lightweight electrochemical reactor to separate and pressurize carbon dioxide  from the Martian atmosphere.  Our approach builds on recently developed technology in our laboratory and others in selective separation based on electrochemically modulated facilitated transport. This process electrochemically pumps the bound CO2 across a membrane separator effectively concentrating and pressurizing it in a separate process stream.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology addresses NASA's need for ISRU technologies to support a sustained human presence on the Moon and Mars. The Martian atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide representing a valuable in situ resource.  The proposed technology will collect and pressurize carbon dioxide for use in  ISRU technologies to generate fuel and oxygen.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology will have significant terrestrial-based applications. The market for separating carbon dioxide from other gases is expected to grow with continued interest and emphasis on reducing CO2 emissions. A compact electrochemical reactor that efficiently separates and concentrates CO2 can be used in sequestration scenario, alternative fuels production, as well at mitigating CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants.

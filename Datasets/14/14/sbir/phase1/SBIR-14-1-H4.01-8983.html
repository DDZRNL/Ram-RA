		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Dexterous performance degradation resulting from donning an extra-vehicular activity (EVA) glove limits the capability of astronauts to perform certain tasks in space.  This measurable performance loss has led to a number of design revisions, but barehanded performance with an EVA glove on is still far from achievable.  Exoskeleton concepts have also been considered to add some of the lost dexterous capability, but technology and design challenges have limited their practical utility.  As such, InnoVital Systems, Inc., in collaboration with the Space Systems Laboratory of the Aerospace Engineering Department at the University of Maryland, proposes to develop an innovative EVA glove exoskeleton for increased performance capability.  The proposed concept will employ the team's novel, miniature pneumatic artificial muscles to drive the multiple degrees of freedom of the hand to restore the functionality lost by wearing the EVA glove.  Building upon our experience in actuation, control, and space suit systems, as well as biomimetic applications, we will perform design, analysis, and fabrication in Phase I of the project, which will end with preliminary prototype testing and feasibility demonstrations.  Phase II will focus on further design refinements, controls system development, and full-scale prototype development and testing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Throughout the Phase I effort, InnoVital Systems, Inc. will work in concert with NASA sponsors to ensure that the proposed exoskeleton glove technology can be seamlessly integrated with existing and future EVA systems.  With the current EVA gloves, each astronaut has a custom-fit pair, so it is reasonable to assume that the accompanying exoskeleton device would also be custom-fit to each astronaut.  To facilitate technology transfer, we will work in Phase I to address top-level hardware and software integration issues from a systems engineering perspective.  Issues such as control electronics, software architectures, hardware interfaces, ruggedness, manufacturability, and reliability will be considered in the Phase I design concepts and implemented in Phase II of the program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		For non-NASA applications, InnoVital Systems will adapt and re-purpose the exoskeleton glove technology as an assistive orthotic device for the hand.  This variant of the proposed technology can reach several markets including patients recovering from musculoskeletal injuries, those experiencing permanent loss of functional capabilities in the hand, and sufferers of stroke and other neuromuscular diseases.  Given the scalability of pneumatic artificial muscles, successful transition of the technology to hand orthoses would also naturally lead to exploring applicability to other multiple degree of freedom joints.  The device(s) can be manufactured and assembled in-house or licensed for manufacture to one or more prominent medical or orthotic device companies as an integrated hardware/software product.

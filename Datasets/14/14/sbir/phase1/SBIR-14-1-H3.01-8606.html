		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this Phase I SBIR, Terves will develop processing routes to produce high thermal conductivity magnesium composites for use in heat transfer applications such as radiator materials. Terves will use and refine ultrasonic casting processes developed over the past three years and move into a magnesium based material using high aspect ratio carbon fibers and diamond particles by dispersing in a liquid state. The cast material will be rolled into sheet and tested for thermal and structural properties and compared to currently available materials. A successful program will result in a new, high thermal conductivity material that is lighter than current aluminum composites with the same or similar strengths. This composite will be applied in spacecraft for fast and effective heat transfer, enabling lighter thermal transfer systems by removing previous design constraints.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Radiators often exceed 40% of the total thermal component mass. Estimating the fraction of joints and mechanism components to be approximately 35% of radiator weight, it is expected that the total weigh of the joints and fittings will be approximately 770 lbs.  The materials that are proposed for this project promise thermal conductivities in the range of state of the art aluminum composite at a 33% weight savings Based upon this comparison, at least a 50% weight savings should be achievable.  Specific trade studies will be conducted to determine actual component designs and weight savings.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Terves has identified both near-term high value niche markets for the composite materials technology to be developed under the proposed program, as well as longer term, high volume growth markets for the technology to sustain continued market expansion.  The following markets are driven by the need for high conductivity, low CTE materials.  Near-term high value niche markets include:<BR>?	Aerospace/electronics Industry (radiator, heat sink, chip carrier, heat pipe)<BR>?	Combustion Engine Component (pistons, cylinder liners)<BR>?	Chemical Industry (heat exchanger, chemical process equipment)<BR>?	Structural Application (truss fittings)<BR> <BR>Longer-term larger markets identified include:<BR>?	Automobile Components (hydraulics/brake systems)<BR>?	Abrasives Industries (drill bits, tool holders, mining equipment)<BR>?	Low Friction Corrosion Resistant Coatings<BR>?	Friction and Wear Material Applications

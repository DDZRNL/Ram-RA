		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The National Research Council (NRC) has identified the need for motors and actuators that can operate in extreme temperature environments as a technical gap to exploring deeper into our solar systems. Bear Technologies has been exploring motor design for more than 5 years. A number of designs are blended to create the basis of the proposed innovation. The research focuses on a fundamentally different motor design that explores the use of flexures to amplify the forces created by the electro-magnets.   In this way, the design can be much simplified, eliminates wear, free play and the need for lubricants.   Bear will focus on investigating low stress flexure designs and relatively high force electro-magnetic drives that can produce the forces needed for a high torque motor.   If proven this flexure component will be an enabling technology for the extreme environment high torque motor.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has a need for extreme environment actuators and motors to enable and increase capabilities of future missions. Advancing this technology has an impact on a majority of future missions. The "flexure" research will be an enabling electromagnetic design concept for extreme temperature motors.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The electro-magnetic technology will be an enabling component for extreme environment motors. The resulting motors have uses for the oil and gas industry in downhole drilling and enhanced oil recovery system (steam flood or injection), precision munitions and weapons control, glass and metal work in extreme temperature furnaces, and arctic research.

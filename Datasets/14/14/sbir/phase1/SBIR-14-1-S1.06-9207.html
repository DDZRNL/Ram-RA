		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Leiden Measurement Technology (LMT) will design and develop a low volume analyte separation, concentration, and transfer system (ConTech), that couples a Subcritical Water (SCW) Extractor with Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) technology to extract analytes from complex host matrixes (e.g., soil, regolith, ice) and transfers them to a broad range of analytical instruments in situ. The use of SCW eliminates the need for organic solvents while allowing polarity-based separation of trace levels (ppb or below) of a broad range of inorganic and organic species. The technology will be developed to minimize mass, volume and power-usage and for compatibility with state-of-art in situ instruments currently under development by NASA including: microfluidic based systems, bioarrays, gas chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, UV fluorescence spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and mass spectroscopy.<BR><BR>The specific objectives of the Phase I R&D effort are:<BR><BR>1) Assemble a compact prototype SCW-SPE system capable of extracting, separating, trapping, concentrating, and transferring/delivering soluble<BR>inorganic ions, polar organics, and non-polar organics.<BR><BR>2) Determine the system requirements (solid phase extraction materials,<BR>volume, geometry, temperature, flow) needed for processing Mars relevant<BR>organics in complex matrices. <BR><BR>3)Optimize analyte recoveries and perform an end-to-end proof-of-concept with laboratory prototype. <BR><BR>4)Determine power, mass and volume requirements needed to meet analytical requirements.<BR><BR>5) Develop a design for a Phase II system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology satisfies important needs described in SBIR subtopic S1.06, In Situ Sensors and Sensor Systems for Lunar and Planetary exploration, by providing a low risk technology for in situ sample extraction, manipulation, storage and transfer. The technology will be developed to support state-of-art instruments currently under development by NASA and suitable for in situ analysis of regolith (e.g., Mars, Lunar) and ice (e.g., Mars, Lunar, Comets, Europa).
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		ConTech chemical extraction, concentration, storage and transfer technology will have many commercial uses. The technology has numerous potential pharmaceutical, chemical, environmental, and medical applications. LMT envisions a product line of application specific replaceable ConTech cartridges that interface with commercial analytical instruments.

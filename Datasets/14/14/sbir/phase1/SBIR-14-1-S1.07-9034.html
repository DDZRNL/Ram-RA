		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Systems & Processes Engineering Corporation (SPEC) proposes a Wind Measurement LIDAR whose sensor assembly is composed of SPEC Gen IV LIDAR seeker, with 12.8 Mpps imaging rate, modified with a laser with ultra-narrow band seed, AOM and modulator, to allow air current Doppler detection beyond 3km.  The sensor output is Doppler shift in 3D pixels (voxels) in a 90 degree cone. The specifications were sized to detect energy sources are vertical uplifts, wind direction, wind gradients and transient gusts for optimal path determination for energy conservation in UAVs with less than 1mps accuracy at 10Hz sampling.  <BR>The Gen IV LIDAR is the latest member of SPEC's family of LIDARs and features 2 inch aperture, 10km range in clear air, range accuracy of 3mm at close range 30mm at acquisition range, and deep waveform capture capability.  The LIDAR can use scanner with fields of view from 30 to 90 degrees, and features pipeline processing for real time image output.  In the fully miniaturized version the unit is 3.5 inches diameter by 8.5 inches long.  The Doppler modifications would increase this length by 1 inch.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		3D wind measurements LIDAR can be used for measurement systems on a variety of unmanned aircraft.  It can be used in programs like 3D-WINDS.  The system is small enough so that with radiation hardening, it can be used in various planetary missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications include air turbulence sensing for commercial aircraft.  Other applications, studied in past programs, are using the wind LIDAR to determine an optimal path for maximum fuel economy and/or station keeping for UAVs and aircraft.

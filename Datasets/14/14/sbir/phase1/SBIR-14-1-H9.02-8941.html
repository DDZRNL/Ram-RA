		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this program, Freedom Photonics will design an innovative compact, diode laser pumped solid state laser to achieve specifications listed by the program. High efficiency will be achieved by simultaneously optimizing the pump laser and the solid state active region and cavity for high performance.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The first planned product for the PPM optical transmitter technology to be developed in this program is a long-range FSO link for Interplanetary Optical Telecommunications supporting robotic explorers.<BR><BR>The second planned products will be FSO links for NASA satellite-to-ground applications as well as inter-satellite communications.<BR><BR>Subsequent products will be for air-to-ground, air-to-air, air-to-space and ground-to-ground applications to complement existing Freedom Photonics technology.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Freedom Photonics will work closely with several system integrators in this effort to obtain their guidance on possible paths to transition this product to other markets. Freedom Photonics has existing relationships with several  space system manufacturers, such as Boeing, Lockheed, Ball Aerospace and Northrop Grumman. The goal is to identify in Phase II a Prime systems supplier that will incorporate into their satellite systems the first planned product of an FSO link for commercial inter-satellite communications. <BR><BR>Subsequent products for air-to-ground and air-to-air applications would be of high interest to UAV manufacturers and additional probable customers in this industry will be included, companies such as: AeroVironment, AeroMech, Bell Helicopter and General Atomics.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Traditional hydraulic actuation and control surface layout both limit span wise control of lift distribution, and require large volume within wing cross-section, ultimately reducing efficiency. Mounting and support structures for traditional actuators, also necessitate drag-inducing protrusions in otherwise ideally smooth airfoils. Consequently, hydraulic systems are heavy and energy intensive as compared to electromechanical counterparts. Coupling distributed EMAs with novel controls optimizing lift distribution in real-time during flight allows lighter, thinner, and more flexible wing structure. Multidisciplinary Design Optimization used to couple control formulation for any point in flight with aeroelastic model of the wing. Parametric distribution of EMAs will guide actuator placement and aid design and sizing of flexible wing system that maximizes L/D. Aurora has used both distributed local flow sensors and on-board fiber-optic strain sensors, which along with novel control algorithms allow for on-board, near real-time control calculations to be completed, creating adaptive wing shapes, and optimize L/D within the flight envelope.

		<BR>
		The proposed effort has direct applications to NASA's next gen commercial aviation efforts. Specifically The coupling of distributed EMAs with a novel control system that attempts to optimize the lift distribution real-time during flight will allow lighter, thinner, and more flexible wing structures to be developed. These wings will in turn be more efficient both structurally as well as aerodynamically. Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) will be used to couple the control law formulation for any point in the flight with an aeroelastic model of the wing.  Parametric distribution of the EMAs will guide actuator placement and aid in the design and sizing of a flexible wing system that will maximize L/D. Aurora has previously used both distributed local flow sensors and on-board fiber-optic strain sensors, which along with novel control algorithms allow for on-board, near real-time control calculations to be completed.  This  is employed to increase total system efficiency, create adaptive wing shapes, and optimize L/D within the flight envelope. Wing redesign using the innovation described here could be implemented directly on the NASA N+3 D8 Concept, on which Aurora is a subcontractor to MIT, or the Common Research Model (CRM) wing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA commercial applications for the distributed EMA technology span from commercial aviation to the military UAS markets. After the actuation system has been thoroughly vetted through integration into Aurora products, Aurora and Moog will aim to sell the EMA to outside customers as a stand-alone product as well as an integrated system. Moog will be the primary actuator manufacturer while Aurora will act as a value added reseller, customizing integration and installation methods and developing actuator control laws as appropriate for the intended use of the EMA. Depending on configuration selection, this system could be packaged as an actuator and casing to replace actuation systems in existing aircraft, a structural panel to be incorporated into newly designed aircraft, or a custom designed system where Aurora and Moog partner closely with a customer to tailor the EMA to specific aircraft needs.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The ISTAR Group ( IG) and team mate Thin Red Line Aerospace (TRLA) propose a Venus altitude cycling balloon (Venus ACB), an innovative superpressure balloon architecture that is ideally suited to cloud level mission parameters and to incorporation of a variety of buoyancy control mechanisms that will enable significant altitude cycling capability.  The 5.5 meter diameter vessel is similar to the dimensions contemplated for higher altitude Venus missions. The pro posse Venus ACB balloon platform is based on TRLA's proprietary Ultra High Performance Vessel ( UHPV). The attributes that set UHPV apart in its unique ability to address the fundamental challenges confronting a cloud level Venus balloon mission capable of significant altitude cycling are described in detail for these seven innovative design elements:   1. Strongest, lightest weight balloon option  2. Balloon fabrication is easier, less expensive, more accurate and highly reproducible  3. Greater performance predictability reduces FOS, which reduces mass  4. Standardized fabric and scalability to size  5. Lighter weight fabric  6. Strongest balloon/polar bulkhead integration  7. Potential for balloon-parachute hybrid vehicle

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Employing the TRLA design for use as a stand alone balloon platform, the Ultra High Performance Vessel ( UHPV) can be put to service as a pressure vessel for current Long Duration Ballooning and in conventional balloons for terrestrial applications.  Additionally the TRLA balloon may be able to replace small to medium sized stratospheric ballooning applications in NASA's ballooning program. The durability of the film used in the TRLA UHPV may lend itself as a reusable balloon material which would greatly reduce the overall cost of multiple balloon campaign by reusing a recovered TRLA balloon.  With the reduced weight and increased strength, the balloon carcass can be reliably transported in and out of the field to be relaunched in the event it be necessary in a multi launch balloon campaign.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Recent interest in private entities entertaining space research utilizing balloons continually increases by evidence of the number of presentations at symposiums and conferences world wide.  The ISTAR Group has provided numerous stratospheric balloon launch applications for the increase in interest by the numbers of applications in upcoming and established programs that include scientific, technological, and space tourism . The demand for cost effective, rapidly deployed balloons has been the interest of the US Department of Defense, private companies in the communication segment, US and international border security, and science applications looking for stratospheric balloons that can be recovered and relaunched reducing the overall cost of a program. The introduction of a durable Altitude Cycling Balloon platform answers the needs of many end user disciplines.

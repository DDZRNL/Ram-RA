		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Prime Photonics proposes design and development of a surface acoustic wave (SAW) based temperature gradient sensor for instrumentation of thermal protection systems (TPS).  This device will utilize a passive, wireless interrogation approach to produce a robust measurement platform compatible with high temperature environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary NASA commercial application of surface acoustic wave (SAW) based temperature gradient sensors will be instrumentation of new thermal protection system (TPS).  This technology with assist in the development of new materials and heat shield designs by providing improved data feedback for refinement of TPS models for use on future space missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Wireless, passive SAW-based sensors offer a flexible detection platform that is readily adapted to measurement of parameters beyond temperature (e.g. strain, chemical species, magnetic fields, etc.).  Prime Photonics plans to utilize the high-temperature platform compatibility to provide new sensing options for aerospace manufactures and end-users.  Potential applications include engine management, structural health monitoring, and manufacturing process control.

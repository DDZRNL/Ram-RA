		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		High peak power short pulsed lasers have been considered to be an enabling technology to build high power transmitters for future deep space high rate space communications. However, to achieve a high peak power at a high repetition rate over 100 MHz and with a short pulse width and >25% wall plug efficiency still remains an issue unsolved. PolarOnyx proposes a novel approach targeting to make 10 MHz to over 100 MHz high repetition rate high power fiber laser at 1550 nm and resolve the issues of modulation induced chirp, pulse distortion and nonlinear effects by using COTS components and employing our proprietary technologies in specialty fibers, spectral shaping and pulse shaping techniques. Space qualification will also be addressed in laying out the pathway towards space deployment. A tabletop demonstration will be carried out at the end of Phase 1. A prototype will be delivered at the end of Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to NASA's deep space communications, the proposed short pulse high power fiber laser approach can also be used in other applications, such as space, aircraft, and satellite applications of LADAR systems and communications. PolarOnyx will develop a series of products to meet various requirements for NASA/military deployments.

		<BR>
		High power fiber lasers represent the next generation of critical optical components needed to build the coherent optical communications of the future and cable TVs that will deliver increased communication bandwidth and improved Quality of Service (QoS) end users. The market for the application is growing and will be of great potential of hundreds of millions market. <BR>Other commercial applications include<BR>?	Material processing. This includes (1) all types of metal processing such as welding, cutting, annealing, and drilling; (2)semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturing such as lithography, inspection, control, defect analysis and repair, and via drilling; (3) marking of all materials including plastic, metals, and silicon; (4) other materials processing such as rapid prototyping, desk top manufacturing, micromachining, photofinishing, embossed holograms, and grating manufacturing.<BR>?	Medical equipment and biomedical instrumentation. The high power laser can be applied to ophthalmology, refractive surgery, photocoagulation, general surgery, therapeutic, imaging, and cosmetic applications. Biomedical instruments include those involved in cells or proteins, cytometry, and DNA sequencing; laser Raman spectroscopy, spectrofluorimetry, and ablation; and laser based microscopes.

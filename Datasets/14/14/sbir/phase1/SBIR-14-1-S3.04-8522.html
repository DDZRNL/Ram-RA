		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		There exists a programmatic need across several government agencies for both UAV and manned aircraft to be able to deploy in-situ observation sensors within areas of scientific interest. These missions include sampling ice at high resolution over the arctic, investigating plumes near active volcanos, measuring ionizing radiation within denied HAZMAT or nuclear emergency areas, and sampling the thermal and momentum fluxes within eyewall of an active hurricane. This latter capability is crucial for the success of future UAS missions such as NASA's Hurricane Severe Storm Sentinel (HS-3). Guidesonde will enable the Global Hawk to loiter at a safe stand off distance, well away from highly turbulent storm areas.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The main application is the NASA Airborne Science Program. The proposed PI attended the May 2012 HS-3 science team meeting as instrument PI for the High Definition Sounding System/Automated Dropsonde Dispenser (ADD). Our team has a deep understanding of the engineering challenge before us. As HS-3 is an experiment it cannot fund new instrument development directly, it was suggested we submit a proposal to SBIR to support Guidesonde R&D.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Most UAV applications are US government due to airspace restrictions.

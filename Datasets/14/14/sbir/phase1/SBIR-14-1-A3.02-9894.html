		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Thorough understanding of aircraft airframe and engine noise mechanisms and the subsequent acoustic propagation to the farfield is necessary to develop and evaluate noise mitigation concepts. Therefore, continued assessment and development of advanced prediction methodologies and tools is essential. Despite significant progress made in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in past several decades, some production unstructured CFD codes used at NASA for noise prediction are only 2nd order accurate at best. In this SBIR study, we propose to develop a modular high-order scheme with low dissipation flux difference splitting that can be integrated into existing CFD codes for use in improving the solution accuracy and to enable better prediction of complex physics and noise mechanisms and propagation.  The salient features of our proposed approach include: (1) high-resolution schemes with physics-based low-dissipation flux-difference splitting; (2) very low memory requirements; and (3) modular structure for easy integration into existing CFD codes. During Phase I, a module providing 3rd order accurate schemes will be developed and integrated into FUN3D code. Verification and validation studies will be conducted to demonstrate the improved solution accuracy. During Phase II, 4th order accurate schemes will be developed and implemented with FUN3D, and the performance of improved schemes will be assessed for realistic aeroacoustic problems. Adaptive use of high-order schemes near solution discontinuities (such as shocks) will be investigated. Phase II plans will also consider integration of the high-order module with other unstructured CFD codes such as USM3D and Loci/CHEM.

		The work proposed in this effort will advance the state-of-the-art of unstructured CFD technology not only for aeroacoustics problems but also in other areas such as high-lifting surfaces, airframe design and propulsion. The developed high-order and low dissipation unstructured CFD technology for noise source prediction can also be directly applied to several of NASA's multidisciplinary noise and vibration programs such as the prediction of noise mechanisms and propagation for engine, fan, duct, propellers, and airframes, and for the analysis of wake/frame interaction induced noise and vibrations. It can be used for the design of revolutionary aircraft with innovative configurations and technologies for minimum noise signature, and for the improvement of current aircraft noise performance.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The FAA spends millions of dollars a year buying out homes, or making acoustic improvements to homes in accordance with FFA regulations. There is a huge market for efficient aeroacoustic analysis tools, which is driven by new aircraft, missile, and reusable launch vehicle design and by the need for multiple aeroacoustic analyses over time as a consequence of aircraft modifications and expanded/changing missions. These are important areas for defense contractors. The proposed technology provides a viable tool for several commercial applications such as wing-trailing vortex dynamics of large civil aircraft, analysis of noise generated by landing gear of civil aircraft, and others. The present high-order low-dissipation CFD technology is also applicable to a wide range of applications that involve embedded flow features requiring high resolution with limited grid size. Such applications include turbomachinery, cavitation, biomedical, electronic cooling, and many others.

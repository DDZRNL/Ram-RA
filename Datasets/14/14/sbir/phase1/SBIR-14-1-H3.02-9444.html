		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Microwave regenerative sorption media gas storage/delivery techniques are proposed to address both compressed gas management and hydrogen purification requirements in support of crewed deep space exploration missions.  By reducing or eliminating the need for a conventional gas compressor, both the crew habitat noise level and required storage pressure for important Air Revitalization (AR) gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, are reduced by using this technology.  In addition, with slight modifications, the same concept can be used to serve as a regenerable hydrogen gas purifier.  In either application, the penetrative nature of microwave heating is utilized to efficiently drive gas desorption from physical sorbents.  For the compressorless gas storage application, the microwave desorption step supplies pressurized gas to downstream processes.  Similarly, for application as a hydrogen purifier, microwave heating drives off captured contaminants from the sorbent bed (which is held at relative vacuum) during regeneration.  Potential contaminants present in the hydrogen stream include water vapor, carbon monoxide and various hydrocarbons (including methane, acetylene, ethane, and ethylene).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA application will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future manned missions.  The safe purification, delivery and storage of Air Revitalization life support gasses are critical unit processes within closed habitats.  Ideally the fully developed technology will be acquired as Flight Hardware by NASA, or by an aerospace contracting firm on behalf of NASA, resulting in enhanced capability during crewed deep space exploration missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Gas purification and storage are two common requirements that span a host of practical applications ranging in scale from laboratory systems to industrial processes.  While less applicable for small scale terrestrial systems, the proposed technology promises to greatly reduce operational costs for gas purification and storage when used at either petrochemical plants or by commercial gas suppliers.

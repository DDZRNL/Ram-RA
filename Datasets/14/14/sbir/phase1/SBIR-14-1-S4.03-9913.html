		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To-date, the realization of high-performance liquid bipropellant rocket engines for ascent vehicle and sample return applications has largely been hindered by the inability to obtain "on-board" pressurization through a light-weight and low-complexity pump. Ventions seeks to fulfill this critical need by designing, fabricating and testing an electric pump for a Mars Ascent Vehicle compatible with LOX / propane produced via in-situ resource utilization to achieve significant performance improvements over the current baseline.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		While the proposed pump-fed propulsion system has direct applications for Mars Ascent Vehicles and sample return missions, the enabling technology proposed herein overcomes a key challenge of providing on-board pressurization at the small-scale, thereby enabling a new generation liquid bipropellant rocket engines in the 100-5,000lbf thrust class, with a T/W ratio in excess of 100, and a vacuum Isp >300sec.  Other NASA applications for such high-performance propulsion systems are therefore also likely to include lunar ascent / descent missions (precursor rovers, cargo, etc.), Near-Earth-Object (NEO) missions and outer planet orbit capture and insertion.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Beyond NASA applications, the proposed high-performance pumps are expected to have wide relevance to upper stage propulsion technology for small commercial launch vehicles, advanced Department of Defense vehicles such as XS-1, commercial lander missions, orbit insertion engines for commercial satellites, and apogee kick motors for orbit circularization of commercial satellites.

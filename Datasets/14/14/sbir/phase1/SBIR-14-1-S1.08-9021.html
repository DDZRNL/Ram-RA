		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of developing a tunable, high-power, narrowband seed laser source integrated with a broadband, waveguide-based second harmonic generation (SHG) module to allow in situ alignment, component testing and calibration across the tuning range of fiber-based lidar systems for measuring atmospheric oxygen concentrations. The lidar is being developed as part of a dual-wavelength remote sensing system for high precision CO2 measurements.  Active laser-based spectroscopic remote sensing can map changes in CO2 concentration over the entire globe.  However, the measurement of CO2 concentration varies depending on properties such as humidity, temperature, and pressure.  To remove these variables, measurement of a stable, well-mixed gas such as oxygen is required as well.  Generation of a broadly tunable SHG source with integrated laser for downstream seeding will further this approach.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Several NASA applications include the use of a frequency doubling module to generate fixed or tunable radiation from the visible to near IR.  The primary beneficiary of the proposed module is NASA's GSFC team working on O2 sensing for ASCENDS and other missions.  Poled materials offer a wider array of functionality including robust, multi-element platforms for combining tasks like frequency conversion and modulation without adding insertion loss due to additional components.  Remote sensing missions like ACE that require such platforms will also benefit.  Atom-based inertial sensing and free space communications are other exciting new technologies that could benefit from highly efficient frequency conversion devices in this wavelength range.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Nonlinear poled materials play an increasingly important role in photonics applications that may be in non-standard wavelength regions, some of which include microwave photonics, up conversion, infrared detection, IR generation, and bio-photonics. In addition to its use with NASA's nonlinear optical material based photonic applications, the technology will be of use for military applications, sensing and environmental monitoring, and basic research.  Additional markets that can utilize compact, rugged, highly efficient, wavelength conversion modules are free space telecommunications, remote sensing, precision spectroscopy, interferometry and frequency metrology.

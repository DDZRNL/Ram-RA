		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Analytical Services & Materials, Inc. (AS&M) is proposing to develop and validate the procedures and modeling necessary to simulate, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), an entire wind tunnel circuit.  The application of CFD in wind tunnel circuit analysis is in its infancy and its use would allow for the design of better facilities and the development of better modifications of existing facilities to improve their efficiency and expand their capability.  A better understanding of the facility flow characteristics obtained by the simulation would improve wall correction methodology and data accuracy from the facility.  The proposed Phase I program will validate the methods against calibration data from the NASA Langley 14 x 22-ft Low-Speed Tunnel.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed concept directly addresses areas of NASA's subtopic A4.01 Ground Test Techniques and Measurement Technologies: (1) " &#133; demonstrate and articulate novel ground to flight extrapolation methodologies &#133;", (2) " &#133; cutting-edge enhancements that significantly improve existing test and measurement capabilities, and enabling tools that provide new opportunities &#133;".  By implementing the techniques and capabilities developed in this proposal NASA will be able to design newer and more efficient facilities, and expand the capabilities of existing facilities.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed concept and the capabilities that will be developed have direct applications to both military and industry aerodynamic wind tunnel facilities.

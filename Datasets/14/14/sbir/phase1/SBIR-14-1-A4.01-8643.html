		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Numerous ground test and wind tunnel facilities are used extensively to generate forces and moments as well as surface measurements of test articles required to validate computational tools used to extrapolate wind tunnel data to realistic flight conditions and hardware.  Accurately mapping velocity flow fields remains a significant challenge in these facilities.  In addition, spatially and temporally resolved measurements of flow parameters such as density, pressure, and temperature are of paramount importance.  Intrusive probe type devices disturb the flow field while traditional particle-seeded techniques are not feasible in shock layers or stagnation regions.  Seeded molecular tagging approaches can not only alter the mean flow, but also introduce unsteady disturbances and requires sufficient upstream seeding in order to diffuse into the boundary layer.  Additionally, seeding can contaminate the tunnels, can become expensive, and reduce the effective run time.  This proposal offers an integrated package of truly cutting-edge, multidimensional, seedless velocimetry and flow diagnostics for ground test facilities.  The concepts and ideas proposed are ranging from proof-of-principles demonstration of novel methodologies using kHz-rate femtosecond (10-15 sec) duration laser sources to measurements in realistic tunnel conditions expected in the current solicitation.  In addition, the technologies and tools developed will be packages into robust and user-friendly testing platforms enabling dual use capability in both ground and inflight-test environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed research program will develop an advanced laser-based, high-data-rate, multi-dimensional, multi-parameter, noninvasive optical diagnostic platform for NASA ground test facilities.  Such diagnostic capabilities will be a major step forward in design and model validation efforts in supersonic and hypersonic ground test facilities developing next generation space vehicles and air-breathing propulsion systems.  During the proposed program, we will develop these measurement tools into compact, user-friendly and mobile platforms enabling widespread implementation in ground test facilities as well as extended use in inflight test conditions.  The expertise within this research team in state-of-the-art laser technologies, physics and chemistry-based diagnostic techniques, and extensive product development and implementation background in defense, propulsion and energy applications will be a critical factor in realizing the proposed diagnostic platform and toolkit.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The advanced diagnostic toolkit proposed under the current program will be a significant step forward in utilizing cutting edge laser technology and spectroscopic approaches to address variety of diagnostics challenges in multiple government and industrial applications.  A major beneficiary besides NASA would be DoD test facilities developing advanced weapons systems such as supersonic fighter aircrafts, hypersonic vehicles, rockets and high-Mach number reentry vehicles.  In addition, fast developing commercial space industries as well as conventional aircraft manufacture's test facilities will significantly benefit by having access to such advanced diagnostic toolkits.  Therefore, a wide market potential is expected in defense, industrial and commercial sectors for the proposed technologies.

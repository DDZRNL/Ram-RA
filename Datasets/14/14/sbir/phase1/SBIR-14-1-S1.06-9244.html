		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of developing a fully packaged, efficient, short pulse, high repetition rate frequency doubled micro-chip laser for use in  NASA-JPL's Time Resolved Raman Spectrometer (TRRS) to analyze elemental and mineral compositions in remote planetary environments.  Time Resolved Raman Spectroscopy can identify mineral content in natural geological context with enhanced discrimination from impurity-based interfering fluorescence making it a leading candidate for in situ exploration of planetary bodies.  The combination of a high repetition rate, short pulse width laser with commercially available single photon avalanche detector (SPAD) arrays will enable the development of a robust, compact, electrically efficient TRRS instrument that is well suited for space-based use.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary beneficiary of the proposed module is NASA's JPL planetary science team working on the Time Resolved Raman Spectrometry (TRRS).  TRRS can identify mineral content in natural geological context with enhanced discrimination from impurity-based interfering fluorescence making it a leading candidate for in situ exploration of planetary bodies. Other NASA uses include characterization of Raman and fluorescent noise in single photon sources and nonlinear optical systems for quantum frequency conversion.  Applications that include the use of frequency doubling elements for remote sensing will benefit as well.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed advance in Time Resolved Raman Spectrometry will enable low cost pulsed laser systems to analyze samples in geology labs.  Similarly, low cost pulsed green sources are needed in Bio-photonics laboratories as illumination sources for various photosensitive dyes.  Quantum Information is another future front where the proposed integration of a picosecond pulse laser with a single photon avalanche detector array could be configured as a quantum storage device.  Pulsed green lasers also are finding a niche in underwater communications and proximity sensing due to the high transmission of green in turbid waters.  A low Size Weight and Power (SWaP) pulsed green source would enable advances in all of these fields.

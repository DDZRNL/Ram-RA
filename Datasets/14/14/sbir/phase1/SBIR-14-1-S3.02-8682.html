		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Over the last decade, the CubeSat platform has emerged as a viable alternative for both innovative technology development and scientific investigation. However, to fully realize the platform's potential, propulsion capability is required. For low-cost spacecraft developers, this capability remains among the most resource intensive to successfully implement. Planetary Resources Development Corporation (PRDC) proposes to significantly reduce required resources by seamlessly integrating propulsion with another critical resource-intensive subsystem: the spacecraft's primary structure. PRDC will integrate high-reliability COTS components from the medical consumer products industries into an additively-manufactured primary structural element that includes integrated tank, plenum, and manifold geometries for a hybrid green monopropellant / cold-gas propulsion implementation in addition to the spacecraft's launch interface. The resulting module provides a standard interface, serving as the strongback for simple integration of other Cubesat subsystems and payloads within the 6U and 12U size regimes. During Phase I, PRDC will design, develop, and prototype a proof-of-concept configuration of the proposed integrated module and perform initial performance characterization of the system. Follow-on Phase 2 development would include fabrication, assembly, performance evaluation, and environmental test of a full- scale 12U module with integrated RCS and maneuvering thruster capability, resulting in a TRL 6 readiness level.

		The development of an low-cost, integrated propulsion and structure module for small satellites has the potential to assist in the progress towards the achievement of NASA near-term and long-term scientific and technical goals. Specifically, the proposed innovation is related to the following NASA Grand Challenges as specified by the Office of the Chief Technologist: 1. Economical access to space 2. Space debris hazard mitigation 3. New tools of discovery The proposed innovation is also relevant to the following NASA Strategic Goals: 1. Goal 1.2: Develop competitive opportunities for the commercial community to provide best value products and services to low Earth orbit and beyond. 2. Goal 2: Expand scientific understanding of the Earth and the universe in which we live. 3. Goal 3: Create the innovative new space technologies for our exploration, science, and economic future. 4. Goal 6.1: Improve retention of students in STEM disciplines by providing opportunities and activities along the full length of the education pipeline. The proposed innovation is also relevant to the following current NASA programs: 1. ELaNA 2. NASA CubeSat Launch Initiative 3. Future small satellite missions for deep space or Earth observation

		<BR>
		IPPSM module enables small, agile and dexterous space systems, addressing needs in: 1. Space situational awareness and hazard mitigation (Military) 2. Reactive asset deployment for tactical coverage (Military) 3. On-orbit asset-servicing (Commercial & Military) 4. Long-life standardized 6U and 12U bus (Commercial & Scientific) 5. Low-cost earth imaging, remote sensing, and telecommunications (Commercial) Potential customers include: 1. Current university and non-profit nanosatellite and Cubesat programs 2. Commercial nano-satellite developers 3. Low-cost commercial telecommunications and Earth observation companies. Examples include APrizeSat, Quake Global, Skybox Imaging 4. Private space exploration companies 5. Developing countries that need low-cost LEO assets to provide critical services not currently provided to their region Arkyd Astronautics' parent company, Planetary Resources, Inc., also intends to use the developed technology as part of its private spacecraft development for near-Earth asteroid exploration and prospecting.

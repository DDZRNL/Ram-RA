		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		High power electric propulsion systems have the potential to revolutionize space propulsion due to their extremely high performance.  This can result in significant propellant savings on space vehicles, allowing the overall mass to shrink for launch on a less expensive vehicle or to allow the space vehicle to carry more payload at the same weight.  Many of the electrical propulsion systems operate in pulse mode, pulsing hundreds or even thousands of times per second.  Creating reliable valves that can operate in pulse mode for extremely long life and at low power are critical in these applications.<BR>WASK Engineering will develop a normally closed, piezo electric operated valve for application to pulsing electrical thrusters.  The benefits of such a valve includes 1) demonstrated ability to operate at frequencies from 0 Hz to 4,000 Hz, 2) ability to throttle continuously from 0-100% open, 3) extremely fast response, 4) low power usage, 5) infinitely variable valve operating waveforms, sine wave, square wave, saw tooth, custom wave form, etc., 6) no EMI generated, 7) very small size provides options when locating valve, 8) demonstrated ability to operate at pressures exceeding 1,000 psi, and 9) very low part count for reliability.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is actively engaged in electric propulsion research research. Many of the electric thrusters operate in a pulse mode. The proposed valves provide extremely long life while operating in a pulsing mode.  They have the additional benefits of requiring very little power for operation while being able to operate at frequencies exceeding 1,000 Hz.  The valves have the additional benefit in that they can infinitely throttled across their range permitting the elimination of pressure regulators.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Long life valves have potential to operate as highly reliable cold gas thrusters for space applications.  The very low part count aids in reliability and the throttling capability simplifies controlling spacecraft.  Other applications for small valve that can operate at high frequencies is in modulating fuel flow in gas turbine lean flow combustors.

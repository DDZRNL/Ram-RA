		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Interdisciplinary Consulting Corporation proposes a technological advancement of current state-of-the-art acoustic energy harvester for harsh environment applications.  Due to the advancement of propulsion systems and increasing power requirements, the development of a renewable energy source is ideal to overcome the related issues seen in systems powered by batteries (limited lifespan, recharge issues, accessibility and replacement).<BR>We propose the innovation of a mesoscale, acoustic energy harvester with a Helmholtz resonator and a piezoelectric composite backplate using high temperature materials.  Additionally, a high temperature power rectifying circuitry will be developed to convert the output of the time-varying output of the energy harvester into a useable form.  The target application is to power feedback or embedded sensor systems to enable self-sustaining functionality to the devices.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed power reclamation technology has the potential to be transportable across multiple NASA facility classes as well as implemented across government-owned, industry and academic institution test facilities.  The target market is acoustic energy harvesters for the aerospace industry and the AEH device can be adapted towards multiple aircraft or flight applications with minimal redesign required.<BR><BR>Given the capability of the proposed device's ability to withstand harsh environments, the technology would support multiple NASA GRC facilities such as Aero-Acoustics Propulsion Laboratory, Small Hot Jet Acoustic Rig, Nozzle Acoustic Test Rig, Advanced Noise Control Fan Rig and NASA LaRC facilities such as the Curved Duct Test Rig (CDTR), and the Grazing Flow Impedance Duct (GFID).
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Beyond aerospace applications and customers, other potential markets include commercial aircraft, automotive and array-based feedback/embedded sensor systems for structural health monitoring.  The investigators have an established relationship with Boeing and have identified other target customers such as Northrop Grumman, GE Transportation, Rolls Royce, Airbus, Honeywell, and Pratt & Whitney.

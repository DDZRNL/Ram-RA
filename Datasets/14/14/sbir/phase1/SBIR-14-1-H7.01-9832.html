		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Cornerstone Research Group Inc. (CRG) proposes to advance fundamental material development of a high-temperature resistant, multifunctional polymer system conceived and demonstrated previously by CRG, which will provide NASA with an innovative, low-cost material for thermal protection systems. The proposed material technology results in a polymer system that transitions from a thermoplastic at temperatures below 230F, to a thermoset at temperatures above 230F, and finally to a graphite-like material at higher temperatures.   CRG has demonstrated the concept and feasibility of this material, trademarked as Metagraphite, during a previous research effort. In that effort, CRG confirmed that bulk thermo-mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of the polymer could be altered through the application of varying amounts of heat. The described polymer can be combined with fabric reinforcement to create a system that presents NASA with the potential for low-cost, adaptive structural materials with properties ranging from those of thermoplastics to carbon matrix composites. Such materials would find wide use in thermal protection systems and high-temperature components for launch propulsion system rocket nozzles.  The extremely low-cost raw materials and the range of material properties available will enable innovative processing methods and reduced component manufacturing costs when compared with state-of-the-art materials.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Supporting NASA's Ames Research Center, this project's technologies directly address requirements for low-cost, thermal protection materials and manufacturing techniques.  This project's technologies offer dramatically reduced material cost with appreciable thermal stability and environmental durability. These properties make Metagraphite a promising material for thermal protection systems and insulators especially in applications where the high strength-to-weight ratio of a polymer is desired. CRG's Metagraphite material has broad applicability for NASA in launch vehicles, aircraft and spacecraft applications where thermal stability, processability, low weight and cost are of concern.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology's attributes for launch vehicle propulsion system nozzle components should yield a high potential for private sector commercialization for the following areas:<BR>-Performance brake pads for high-end automotive manufacturers such as Bentley, Bugatti, Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Porsche. Carbon matrix composites are already used in this high-temperature, high-abrasion application. Metagraphite would offer an affordable alternative to currently used materials<BR>-Racing and performance automotive engine components where thermal stability and light weight are absolute necessities. Formula 1 racing, where CRG has performed in past commercial programs, may have significant potential from an R&D perspective<BR>-CRG's partners, may aid in transition of this technology into the rail industry for flame-resistant insulation.<BR>-Nozzle components and insulators for Commercial Access to Space propulsion systems, such as the rocket engines powering SpaceX Falcon and Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo vehicles.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This program will develop low friction hard coatings for lubricating mechanical and tribological components used for exploring Mars, the Moon, asteroids, comets and other small bodies. This proposed SBIR program will build on MesoCoat's extensive prior experience in developing dense, hard friction-free coatings.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Rovers, motor and pump shaft and seals, deployable structures, latching mechanisms, etc.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial aircraft engines, and run-dry industrial linkage component applications, as well as on diesel engines, turbine engines, metal cutting and forming tools and dies, mining and excavation equipment, oilfield service equipment, automotive components, and agricultural equipment market segments as well.  Machine gun components, and unlubricated small, potentially disposable direct fired engines are major developing market segments where a robust, durable hard solid lubricant could be an enabling technology to eliminate fouling and soot emissions.

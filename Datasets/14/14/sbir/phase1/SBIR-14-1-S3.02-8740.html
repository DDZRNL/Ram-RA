		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The development of an advanced green monopropellant propulsion system could have significant benefits to a wide range of NASA space missions, from deep space satellites to manned space vehicles.  However, the state-of-the-art thruster materials, refractory metals, cannot withstand AF-M315E combustion environment at temperatures of >2000?C without loosing their mechanical integrity. <BR>Sienna Technologies, Inc, in collaboration with Moog-ISP, proposes to develop a revolutionary refractory metal-ceramic FGM material and an AF-M315E advanced green monopropellant thruster.  In Phase I we will demonstrate a refractory metal-ceramic FGM through materials design and microstructural control that meets the requirements for thrust chamber for AF-M315E monopropellant.  In Phase II we will fine-tune the FGM material properties to maximize the mechanical strength and thermochemical stability; and design, fabricate, and test a working FGM thruster in collaboration with Moog-ISP.

		<BR>
		The development of AF-M315E advanced green monopropellant propulsion system could have significant benefits to a wide range of NASA space missions, from deep space satellites to manned space vehicles.  Availability of reliable, high performance green thrusters will enable new NASA missions using existing launch vehicles or existing missions for space exploration programs including interplanetary journeys, interplanetary probes, sample return missions, and geostationary satellites. <BR>Space lift (especially crewed launches) and target RCS applications would benefit from simpler volume packaging as well as cost savings and greater safety margins due to the non-toxic nature of the propellant.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The new FGM AF-M315E thrusters could be used as replacements for hydrazine in kinetic kill vehicles, theater high altitude antiballistic missile defense, and other strategic missile defense systems.  Applications of FGM thruster technology will include a third stage rocket motor on a launch program like ALASA or even as a liquid DACS system for missile defense where the nontoxic and relatively benign burning characteristics of the propellant might enable ship-board deployment of intercept systems using AF-M315E propellant for the intercept stage.  <BR>Commercial applications include communications and imaging satellites, companions to large satellites to provide surveillance and close-up inspection capabilities such as to monitor and assure proper deployment of solar panels, antennae and other appendages or to monitor the inflation of inflatable structures.

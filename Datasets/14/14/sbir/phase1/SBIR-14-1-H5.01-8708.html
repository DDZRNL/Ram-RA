		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Additive manufacturing is a modern fabrication process by which three dimensional components are built up layer-by-layer.   Each layer corresponds to a cross-section of a 3D CAD model of the product.  LPT proposes an active machine vision, based on a monitoring system to improve Electron Beam Freeform Fabrication (EBF3) processes, by measuring spatial, spectral, thermal and temporal information of the melt pool and element compositions of materials.  The proposed technology will provide clear and accurate information of the melting pool during the metal deposition processes in order to control operation and correct defects.  LPT has extensive expertise in monitoring laser machining processes using various optical sensing technologies.   These sensing technologies have shown significant promise for developing a sensing system to monitor EBF3 processes.  During Phase I, LPT will complete the theoretical design of the active machine vision system.  The proof-of-concept tests will be performed in lab conditions to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.  The research and development efforts in Phase I will provide a solid base for implementing a prototype during Phase II and commercializing this technology during Phase III.

		<BR>
		In the aerospace industry, the "buy-to-fly" ratio is routinely used to describe the cost associated with the amount of raw materials required to produce a finished part.  EBF3 based additive manufacturing has advantages of significantly shortening machining time and reducing material cost.  The proposed technology offers potential to improve EBF3 performance by further shortening machining time and reducing material cost as well as improving quality.  It also can be used to monitor other additive manufacturing processes such as laser based additive manufacturing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Monitoring additive manufacturing processes is important for improving product quality and reliability.  Additive manufacturing has a number of applications including fabricating models, prototypes, small production runs and parts where the complexity prohibits cost effective production by other techniques.  Additive manufacturing market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.5% from 1.8 billion in 2012 to reach $3.5 billion by 2017.  In addition to monitoring additive manufacturing processes, the proposed system can be used to inspect laser processing, which is an important industrial application.  Laser processing can be used for all types of metal processes (e.g. welding, cutting, annealing and drilling) and semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturing (e.g. lithography, scribing, defect repair, and surface cleaning).

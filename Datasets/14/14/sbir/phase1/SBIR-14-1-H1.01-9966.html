		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Plasma techniques are proposed for the extraction of oxygen from the abundant carbon dioxide contained in the Martian atmosphere (96 % CO2).  In this process, CO2 is directly decomposed in an energetic plasma forming O2 and CO, which are immediately separated.  The Phase I project will clearly demonstrate the feasibility of achieving these goals by focusing on key aspects of the technology, such as efficient microwave plasma conversion at relevant pressures and processing rates as well as effective techniques for O2 separation from product gases.  System mass and energy efficiency of this novel technology will be compared to those for SOA processes.  The Phase II program will advance the technology through a more in depth development effort to the point where a fully functional prototype will be assembled and tested.  Successful culmination of this effort will result in a self-contained, energy efficient technique that can be utilized by robotic precursor missions to Mars to stockpile oxygen in support of future manned missions to the planet.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA application will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future missions to Mars.  Extraction of oxygen from the Martian atmosphere may well be an enabling technology for future manned missions.  Ideally this technology will be acquired as Flight Hardware by NASA, or by an aerospace contracting firm on behalf of NASA, resulting in enhanced capability during both robotic precursor and manned missions on Mars, where low power usage and high reliability are vital.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Conversion of carbon dioxide to oxygen and carbon monoxide yields a key component for synthesis gas (a mixture of CO and H2), used for industrial-scale processes, such as in the synthesis of methanol and synthetic gasoline.  An efficient, cost-effective technique that removes CO2 and creates an important industrial feedstock will be both environmentally friendly and commercially attractive.

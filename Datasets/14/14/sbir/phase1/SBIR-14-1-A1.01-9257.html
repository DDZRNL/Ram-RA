		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This project aims to improve conventional lightning strike protection in composite aircraft and proposes a novel method to monitor structures for damage upon lightning strike.   Metallic fasteners joining composite parts must be properly grounded to reduce lightning damage and fire risk. Composite panels in the most critical areas e.g., near fuel tanks, incorporate lightning strike protection (LSP), an outer ply of conductive foil to handle large currents in the event of a lightning strike. Direct Write conductor traces deposited along fastener lines will connect fasteners together, via coated countersinks.   The proposed improvement will be demonstrated through Direct Effect Lightning Testing.  In addition, the Company's Direct Write process will be used to print SansEC sensors onto composite materials, demonstrating an effective method of sensor integration.  Open circuit resonator patterns will be used to detect cracking through shifts in resonant frequency.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Support Aviation Safety Program mission of atmospheric hazard mitigation, through improved lightning strike protection of composite aircraft.  Contribute to Atmospheric Environment Safety Technologies to ensure safe flight in atmospheric hazards, by fortifying lightning protection of fasteners in critical flight structures. The SansEC sensor traces will also provide a new damage detection capability to assess the structural integrity of aircraft structures and improve upon the methods of evaluation and monitoring of future NASA platforms.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Improved lightning strike protection will also benefit private aircraft, military air vehicles, composite launch vehicles, and ground based wind turbines.   Direct Write printed SansEC sensors will provide a damage detection capability benefiting the Air Force Structural Integrity Program (ASIP), optimizing manual inspection cycles, decreasing maintenance costs, and increasing asset availability.

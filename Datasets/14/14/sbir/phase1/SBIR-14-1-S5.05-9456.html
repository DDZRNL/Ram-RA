		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Given that SysML is becoming a standard for model-based systems engineering and Integration (SE&I), system health management (SHM)-related models will either be done in SysML, or be done outside of SysML but enabled by conversion, mapping, and traceability of information across SysML and SHM models. Given that current implementations of SysML are not particularly useful to perform analyses, and that SHM analyses are not identical to typical SE&I-related analyses, there will need to be connectivity between SysML representations and SHM models that perform SHM-related analyses.<BR><BR>Qualtech Systems, Inc. (QSI), with Dr. Stephen Johnson as a consultant intends to explore and develop the integration of model-based systems engineering and Integration (SE&I) using SysML with system health management (SHM) modeling and analysis using QSI's Testability Engineering and Maintenance System (TEAMS). An overarching objective of this proposal is to reduce the duplicative and disjoint effort by NASA's subject matter experts in the development of systems engineering and design models as well as systems health management/fault management models. The intent is to leverage the success space or intent based system design models and transform them for developing fault management models and ensuring changes in design have a natural flow-through to the FM domain, thereby keeping FM models in sync with the design through a semi-automated process. This is one step in the larger set of issues that will need to be addressed in the development of the model-based Discipline of Systems Engineering and its concurrent integration with SHM to achieve higher-quality designs while reducing the costs of SE&I.

		NASA's system design and engineering community especially those who are involved with Systems Health and Fault Management have a vision of ensuring that Fault Management design is an established rigorous discipline with well thought of consistent processes and methodologies that can be applied across all NASA platforms. The proposed effort is a small step in that direction and hence we believe have significant range of applications across various NASA multi-disciplinary engineering centers that are in charge of System Design where Fault Management is an integral part of the System Design process. Clearly establishing the relationships between the design goals/intents and the consequent sub-goals, and derived state variables all of which are in the goal or success space, with their complements in the Failure-space domain as practiced in the TEAMS set of tools that are widely used across NASA will be of tremendous value to the Systems Engineering and Systems Health Management (SHM) community of NASA. One potential application is for the Space Launch System (SLS) being primarily developed out of the NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Other immediate applications of this technology will be with the Orion Multi-purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) Program, managed by NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, and the Ground Systems Development and Operations Program, the operations and launch facilities at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Among the other agencies who follow a strict system engineering and design process somewhat similar to NASA's such as the DoD including Air-force and Navy are the most potential customers for the resulting technologies. Design verification and validation of Complex military systems (systems of systems) such as NORAD, Space Command ground segments, the Joint Strike Fighter fleet, the Navy shipboard platforms, Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), etc. for the purpose of reliable and cost effective system and fault management design can be ensured by using the targeted capabilities implemented in TEAMS. In addition, UAVs, UMGs and other unmanned submersible vehicle markets where the fault management aspects of system design is required to be highly efficient and cost-effective because of the natural budgetary pressures, could also be potential targets for the proposed technology. The product is also expected to be of commercial value to the manufacturers of DoD and military's remotely guided weapons and reconnaissance systems where the vendors supply health management systems/schemes for them.

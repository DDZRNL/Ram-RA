		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In response to NASA SBIR solicitation H3.01 "Thermal Control for Future Human Exploration", Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) is proposing a novel Phase Change Material (PCM) vapor chamber to ameliorate the temperature fluctuations encountered during planetary (or lunar) orbit.  The PCM vapor chamber will consist of a packed bed of micro-encapsulated PCM beads surrounded by a two-phase working fluid.  The PCM beads will act as both a highly efficient thermal storage medium, as well as a wick structure for capillary pumping of the two-phase working fluid.  The two-phase heat transfer by the working fluid increases the effective thermal conductivity of the PCM by a factor of 1000 or more.  This approach eliminates the need for embedding thermally conductive metal fins or carbon foam, which typically consume at least 50% of the system mass in traditional PCM heat exchangers.  The PCM vapor chamber not only has the potential to exceed a 2/3 PCM mass ratio using paraffin wax, but also provides several advantages over the state-of-the-art, water-based PCM heat exchangers.  The concept proposed by ACT will eliminate the need for metal fins and foams, and significantly reduce the mass of non-PCM materials.  In addition, the PCM vapor chamber can serve as either a stand-alone thermal capacitor or a dual thermal capacitor/heat exchanger.

		<BR>
		The proposed PCM vapor chamber can operate as both a thermal capacitor and as a two-phase heat exchanger.  For NASA applications that have a need for a thermal capacitor, the PCM vapor chamber can provide mass savings to the system by swapping out the existing thermal capacitor with the PCM vapor chamber.  For thermal control systems having both a thermal capacitor and a liquid/liquid heat exchanger, the PCM vapor chamber can be used as an all-in-one solution.  This approach has the potential to provide significant mass savings.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		MDA's Airborne Laser (ABL) program has significant cooling requirements that can only be addressed by mechanical refrigeration systems. These include cooling of the various high powered solid state lasers currently used on the ABL for tracking and ranging as well as standby cooling for the basic hydrogen peroxide (BHP) loops on the Chemical Oxygen Iodine Laser (COIL).  To reduce size, weight and power consumption, the PCM vapor chamber could be integrated into the refrigeration system to reduce the temperature lift requirement during peak heat load conditions.  By using the PCM vapor chamber as a load-leveling device, the power requirement of the compressor can be significantly reduced.

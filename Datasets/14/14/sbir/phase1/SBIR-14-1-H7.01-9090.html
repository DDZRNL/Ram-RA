		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Through the proposed NASA SBIR program, NanoSonic will optimize its HybridSil&#174; derived yttrium silicates to serve as next-generation reinforcement for carbon and ceramic felt ablative TPS materials. This effort will leverage NanoSonic's rapidly evolving polymer derived ceramic technology, which has demonstrated thermomechanical durability in excess of 1900 oC, thermal conductivity as low as 30 mW/mK, erosion resistance to high velocity sand, and facile spray depositability under ambient conditions.  NanoSonic's yttrium silicate TPS reinforcing matrices will be molecularly engineered to drastically outperform current char-forming carbon / phenolic materials during planetary entry while weighing and costing less by providing nanocomposite matrices with substantially enhanced 1) thermo-oxidative durability, 2) impact resilience, and 3) readily tailorable high temperature ablative recession rates . The driving optimization factors for phase I TPS materials will include interfacial covalent coupling to surface functionalized carbon and ceramic felts, bulk morphology of the host matrix, and composition of the yttrium silicate polymorph. Thermal loading on promising TPS materials simulating current and future Exploration missions will be completed by the University of Washington's high enthalpy test facility. In support of a phase III transition, NanoSonic has generated significant defense prime interest and has an established pilot scale HybridSil&#174; manufacturing infrastructure.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		By providing unprecedented combinations of thermal insulation, substrate protection, and ease of application in a lightweight TPS material technology that has drastically enhanced ablative performance over carbon / phenolics, NanoSonic envisions considerable post applications of the NASA sponsored technology during Phase II and III efforts with its development partners. Initial applications will include entry, descent and landing ablative thermal protection systems for future planetary entry vehicles while immediate secondary applications will include spacecraft aerocapture systems.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Broad secondary non-NASA applications exist for NanoSonic's yttrium silicate ablative TPS materials. Immediate Phase III transition potential will exist within an array of planetary entry heatshield systems, as well as fire protective materials within the aerospace, marine, and automotive industries.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Adsys Controls' Razor UAS Test System is a high fidelity simulation and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) test system.  Razor provides extensive existing capability for high fidelity real world modeling, extensive I/O capability, real-time execution, system fault simulation, full test automation, and extensive diagnostics.  Razor was developed not just as a 6DOF simulator, but as a whole vehicle simulator for testing of state of the art UAS for all avionics and software.  Razor has a proven track record within the UAS market where it has been used to support development and testing of various vehicles by Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin.  Northrop Grumman used Razor for their Firebird prototype development program.  Lockheed Martin used Razor for various programs including the development of their Fury UAS.  <BR>Under this program, Adsys Controls will enhance the Razor UAS Test System such that it provides a platform for testing and evaluation of UAS in support of Safety Analysis and Autonomous Operations.  The objective system will result in a comprehensive tool for modular UAS simulation, HIL testing, extensible scenario generation, and fault testing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Razor flight simulator will enable accurate and efficient validation of UAV vehicle performance across the spectrum of operational scenarios.  This will allow developers to focus on system improvements needed to achieve performance margins required for safe operation within the National Airspace System (NAS), as well as the operating constraints under which the class of UAV may operate.  Further, Razor will be a valuable tool for government authorities to track the development and eventual certification and testing of individual UAV designs.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Razor flight simulator will provide commercial developers of UAVs a tools for modeling the design of their UAV systems and provide analysis to support trades of configuration, performance, components, and control software options.  Thus, the system can be optimized for a particular license of operation and function.  The Razor flight simulator is extensible to address growing fleet requirements, purpose analysis (e.g., fire fighter or crop management) and mixed fleet performance.

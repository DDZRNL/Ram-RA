		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In response to the need for higher performance, Fibertek has developed a new generation of solid-state lasers capable of meeting the requirements for higher efficiency and scalability to output powers over 100 W.  The first examples of higher-performance lasers for space-based lidar are the ATLAS transmitters now being manufactured for the NASA ICESat-2 mission.  Under the present SBIR opportunity we propose to begin development of a laser transmitter designed to address requirements for second-generation lidar  missions but with advanced capability including:<BR>*	Average output power of 50-100 W at repetition rates of 500-1000 Hz<BR>*	Electrical efficiency 10% from satellite bus power<BR>*	Multiline single-frequency output capability at 1064 nm, 532 nm, and 355 nm<BR>*	Narrow linewidth output in the blue-green region selectable between 450 and 490 nm.<BR><BR>The last feature will allow the transmitter to be used for measurements of deep subsurface ocean scattering, providing unprecedented capability for direct depth-resolved measurements of the ocean ecosystem.

		<BR>
		The laser technology to be developed under this SBIR program serves the need of several planned NASA earth-observing lidar missions.  Fibertek's goal is to participate in upcoming lidar missions such as ACE, ASCENDS and LIST as the laser manufacturer.  This strategy has led to the successful transition of SBIR laser technology into NASA programs including CALIPSO, ICESat-2 and ISS/CATS.  In addition to planned satellite missions, NASA and the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have a continuing interest in fielding airborne active remote-sensing systems for atmospheric and oceanographic measurements (on both piloted and unmanned aircraft).  Lidar instruments using the technology of this SBIR provide new capability for depth-resolved measurement of biological content, turbidity, temperature and salinity of the ocean-water column.  All of these measurements are needed on a global scale for the understanding of the role of the oceans in climate change.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The U.S. Navy has a longstanding need for advanced lidar systems requiring narrow-band high-peak-power, pulsed blue laser output for underwater detection  systems designed for ocean-type water, where blue wavelengths provide significantly greater penetration.  The proposed laser system also produces green output at 532 nm, which is suited to applications in shallower coastal waters (for example shallow-water mine detection and bottom mapping).  The high efficiency and low SWaP of the new laser design makes it a candidate for replacing heavier, less efficient laser transmitters on underwater lidar systems based on UAV platforms.

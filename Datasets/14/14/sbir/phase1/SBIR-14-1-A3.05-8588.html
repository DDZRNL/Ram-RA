		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In the current proposal, M4 Engineering will develop and evaluate the feasibility of an innovative concept aimed at enhancing previously developed databases with physics-based weight and load estimation relationships (via stochastic response surfaces) for unconventional (and conventional!) conceptual wing and fuselage designs.  The main goal for this effort will be to develop a software tool capable of generating weight and load responses for unconventional designs from physics-based simulations.  In an effort to minimize risk and expedite development, the proposed software tool will utilize two previously developed in-house robust toolsets for rapidly generating finite element models and constructing stochastic response surfaces.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA applications will include the use of the developed technology for estimation of weight and loads for any new generation aircraft system including the blended wing body (BWB), truss-based high lift wing, and any other unconventional configuration.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed development has the potential to dramatically improve the weight and loads predictions capabilities within NASA for unconventional applications.  Phase II development will result in a commercial software package including a user friendly interface.  In addition to being offered as a commercial software package, this software tool will strengthen M4's engineering services offering. The current demographics in the engineering workforce make this a very attractive market. Due to the aging workforce and the relative shortage of excellent talent, the engineering services/consulting market is very active, and is expected to remain so for years to come. This is readily apparent by simply looking at the current hourly rate for contract engineers, which can easily top $130/hour for experts in the LA area. The technology developed in the proposed work will give M4 a technical edge over the competition in terms of tools and processes, and will also enhance our team's experience base and marketability for performing engineering services work. While there are many competitors in the engineering services area, we are confident that our team can continue to thrive and grow this business element given the current market conditions.  Potential applications will include the use of the developed software within any complex integrated system needing weight and loading predictions. The software could be utilized by companies such as Lockheed, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman.

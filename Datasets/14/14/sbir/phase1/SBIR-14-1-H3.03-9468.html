		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Spacecraft cabin is noisy and uncomfortable. Sometimes, the noise level can exceed 80 dBA. There are 2 challenges to meet the above needs. One is to generate an anti-phase (180 deg out of phase) signal in real-time to reduce the loud cabin noise in a small area. Another one is to minimize the spillover of the anti-phase signal to other places. We propose a novel and high performance approach to suppressing background noise in noisy cabins. Our system utilizes a patent pending adaptive algorithm that can generate anti-phase signals in real-time to suppress background noise. Our system is portable and easy to set up. Most importantly, our system can suppress background noise in a small area and will not spill the anti-noise signal to other places.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Our proposed technology can be extremely useful for spacecraft and, ISS where noise levels can exceed 80 dBA. A quiet environment will allow astronaut to rest well. Our approach creates a quiet environment while still allows astronauts to communicate among themselves.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Our proposed active noise reduction systems can be used for pilots and maintainers working in aircraft carriers, naval ships, tanks, and aircraft.  The military market size will be 5 million dollars based on a 10,000 units with a unit price of 500 dollars.

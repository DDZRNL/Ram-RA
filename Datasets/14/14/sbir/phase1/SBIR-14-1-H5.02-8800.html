		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		TRUSS is a structurally efficient solar array concept that utilizes a TRAC rollable boom and tension-stiffened structure to exceed the program requirements for very large solar arrays.  TRAC provides simple strain-energy deployment with a constant cross section and constant strength along its length, improving the reliability and simplicity of array deployment.  The tensioning cables allow the structure to achieve mass efficiency much improved over the government reference array (GRA).  The roll-out deployment of the TRAC booms also simplifies the ground support structure needed for testing and qualification of full-size arrays, which will be animated to illustrate in-space and ground-based  deployments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The inherent extensibility of TRUSS enables the growing power demands of space systems.  A few of these systems include Deep Space Habitat, ISS, human exploration systems, and robotic missions for NASA.  The performance enhancements of TRUSS in reducing structural mass and increasing system reliability are essential for enabling successful NASA programs at power levels up to 1 MW +.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications include solar array systems for satellite servicing and space situational awareness for DoD and efficient orbit maneuvering with electric propulsion and increased power for telecommunication bandwidth for commercial entities.  The TRUSS concept could also be applied to such ground-based applications as rapidly deployable power generation for DoD and research outpost.

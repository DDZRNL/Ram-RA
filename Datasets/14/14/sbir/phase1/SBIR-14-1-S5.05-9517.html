		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Architecture Framework for Fault Management Assessment And Design (AFFMAD) is a constraint-checking system for FM trade space exploration that provides rigorous performance guarantees for FM strategies for complex cyber-physical systems. AFFMAD will aid FM engineers in the early evaluation of FM strategies and improve the efficiency of implementing and testing those strategies. Using existing multi-mode cyber-physical reasoning systems, recent advances in Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers, hierarchical scheduling theory, and system-level modeling frameworks, AFFMAD will assist users in identifying FM conflicts and inconsistencies in FM approaches and mission requirements as they are developed.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The initial target application for this work is to support NASA missions that involve Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking (ARD), and specifically the systems engineers who design the FM aspects of the system. However AFFMAD is a FM design tool, and as such, it can be adapted to address any whole system (aircraft, spacecraft, or surface exploration vehicle) or sub-system thereof.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		FM is a key strategy used by many industries to increase system dependability, and FM failures are concerns for any organization designing or building life- or mission-critical systems. In addition to NASA, potential government customers include the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Department of Energy. Likely customers from the commercial sector include those in the aviation, process control and medical device industries.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address these critical needs associated with the integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the airspace, we propose to conduct research on the application of Dynamic Airspace Configuration (DAC) concepts and algorithms to the challenge of accommodation and integration of UAS into the NAS. The resulting algorithms and capabilities will provide real-time recommendations to Traffic Management Coordinators (TMCs) in the ATC system regarding the airspace boundaries that should be adopted, when the airspace boundaries should be changed and how long they should remain in place, and the necessary flight routes and other procedures that should be assigned to flights (both manned and unmanned) to ensure the safety and efficiency of all operations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Significant opportunities exist for the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems in the NAS, particularly for commercial applications. In this proposed effort, we will develop a set of optimization/simulation models to support the accommodation and integration of UAS into the NAS. These optimization/simulation models will be based on previously-developed DAC algorithms which we will adapt to accommodate UAS. At the end of each Phase of the effort, these concepts and algorithms will be transferred to NASA.  These models are expected to support evaluation of NextGen concepts and consequently expedite the NAS transformation, and can be used by NASA within other NASA simulation environments and technology to handle airspace management functions related to UAS.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		If proven successful, the concepts and algorithms to be developed through this research effort for the integration of UAS into the NAS via DAC could be used to support the FAA strategic and tactical traffic flow management. We also anticipate that the coordination of UAS operations in the NAS will require additional infrastructure and procedures to handle route coordination, airspace segregation, communication and surveillance. Thus, the work to be conducted in this effort will also provide a structure for develop of commercial tools to support UAS operators in their effort to operate in the NAS.

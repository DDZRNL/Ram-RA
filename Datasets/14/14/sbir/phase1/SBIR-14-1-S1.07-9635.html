		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Mesa Photonics proposes to develop an Airborne Multi-Gas Sensor (AMUGS) based upon two-tone, frequency modulation spectroscopy (TT-FMS). Mesa Photonics has developed a fiber-coupled implementation of TT-FMS that leverages telecommunications lasers as sources and WiFi electronics for signal processing. With this approach, sensitive trace gas detection in a robust, compact and low-power package has been achieved. In work to-date, we have demonstrated the capability of this TT-FMS concept in a single channel. In the proposed project, we aim to demonstrate multiplexing of TT-FMS to provide simultaneous, real-time measurement of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). In addition to demonstrating the extensibility of TT-FMS, the Phase I project would address key performance limitations encountered in early feasibility work. <BR><BR>The objectives of Phase I are to:<BR> - Implement and test polarization management during phase modulation to reduce baseline variation induced by observed in previous work,<BR> - Build a two-channel TT-FMS with breadboard components,<BR> - Establish baseline (single-channel) performance of TT-FMS when polarization maintaining phase modulation is included,<BR> - Calibrate and evaluate the full AMGUS (two-channel, TT-FMS) apparatus.<BR><BR>Accomplishment of Phase I objectives would yield a benchtop technology ready for transition to a UAV-compatible AMUGS prototype in Phase II.

		<BR>
		AMUGS will meet NASA's needs for airborne measurements of carbon dioxide and methane. Pre-project sensitivities are approximately one order of magnitude away from program needs. Work proposed in Phase I is anticipated to improve performance and achieve detection requirements. Anticipated work for Phase II would focus on design and engineering to produce a field-testable, UAV-compatible prototype. The AMUGS concept builds upon existing high-performance spectroscopy and proposes expansion of the technique to multiple, simultaneous channels. The common optical path and detector of the system not only reduce sources of noise and error but also decrease device complexity, mass and footprint. The AMUGS design is based upon fiber-coupled diode lasers and provides a sensitive gas sensor in a compact, light and low power package that is directly compatible with unattended, remote sensing upon a UAV platform.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Numerous investigators are conducting research on anthropogenic methane and other gases. AMUGS could provide a valuable tool to groups seeking to gather high-resolution spatial and temporal data of gas densities aloft. AMUGS size, power and performance characteristics would make airborne gas measurements accessible to a wide variety of non-NASA research groups and agencies.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) is a new technology which can be used for developing high performance laser components for atom-based sensors technology. The narrow linewidth of VCSEL emission combined with good polarization extinction ratio and large spacing between the longitudinal modes, which makes them relatively immune to mode hopping, and their high reliability make them uniquely suited for this application. NASA requires high power (1W) diode lasers at certain alkali atomic lines. <BR>Princeton Optronics proposes an approach to develop such lasers for NASA in this SBIR using the VCSEL technology. In phase I, we would develop the specifications for the lasers and design and fabricate the devices for one wavelength and demonstrate feasibility for developing high power lasers in phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA needs new types of highly accurate clocks and navigation systems for future spacecrafts and air vehicles. Such systems will need high performance lasers for their development and production. We expect a significant market to develop for NASA. Initially, there would be development contracts for specific applications from which we can generate revenues and there would be limited production orders to follow. The details are not clear about NASA needs but we expect the revenue to reach several hundreds of thousands of dollars per year in a few years.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to NASA, there are requirements for VCSEL devices for atom-based sensors and clocks for many other military and commercial programs. There is need for the high performance diode lasers for atomic clock devices for a new generation of navigation systems for GPS denied environments and high accuracy clock devices. There is high volume commercial need for very accurate atomic clocks for telecommunications and data center applications. The total market for VCSELs for atomic clock is developing to be of several millions of dollars per year. Princeton Optronics has strong marketing, sales as well as manufacturing organization to take advantage of the market once the device development is done.

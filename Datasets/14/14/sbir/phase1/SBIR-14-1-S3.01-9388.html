		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Flexible photovoltaic array technologies require very thin and precisely controlled deposition of the polymeric films used to fabricate them. In most flexible blanket architectures, optically transparent silicones are utilized in the fabrication of the arrays, however due to their rheology and processing conditions there are limitations to how thin they can be applied. In this proposal, Vanguard proposes Thin and Automated Blanket Lamination and Encapsulation Systems (TABLES) that utilize automated drawdown methods and rheology control to render flexible blankets approaching 700 W/kg and only 13 mils thick (including cells). Further, the TABLES concept is easily adapted to a number of substrates and superstrates, rendering "LEO to GEO" packaging and automation simply through appropriate substrate choice.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The availability of very high power photovoltaic arrays can extend NASA's reach in achieving its missions. A variety of missions being considered, including travel to asteroids, Mars, the Lagrange points, lunar surface, or outer planets need very high power to enable space mission capabilities, including electric propulsion and manned spaceflight needs. Flexibility may also provide means for sufficient aperture to collect sunlight in low illumination outer planet environments. The incorporation of IMM solar cells into flexible blankets offers an opportunity to increase conversion efficiency while drastically increasing the effective specific power, rendering the proposed concept useful for a wide variety of NASA applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Solar array power availability drives the capabilities and costs of many commercial spacecraft. New "all-electric" spacecraft using electric propulsion to enhance mission life while reducing launch mass are driving prime power requirements to ever higher levels. Additional power provides more transponders and improved signal strength, and allows for longer life because of the affordability of oversizing and redundancy. The trend on commercial spacecraft being developed by Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Loral, and Orbital Sciences, among others, is for larger, higher power GEO spacecraft growing beyond 20kW. A significant market also exists worldwide for more low to medium-power arrays, and as the CIGS technology is demonstrated in PARASol, scaled down version of the design will be marketed for applications in the 5-20kW range typical of commercial GEO spacecraft, and even smaller arrays for Smallsats and deployable Cubesats. Long duration, High altitude airships could also use deployed, towed arrays to enhance their capabilities and time aloft.

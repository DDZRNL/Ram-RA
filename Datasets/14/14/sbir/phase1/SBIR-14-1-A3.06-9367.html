		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		During this Phase I effort ESAero will draw upon its knowledge of hybrid-electric propulsion system design and analysis for fixed wing aircraft to investigate the potential benefits of incorporating such systems into rotorcraft designs. Past rotorcraft studies have been conducted in conjunction with Electricore, Inc. and an industry prime, to develop hybrid propulsion system trade studies and develop databases for hybrid propulsion system worthy components. This knowledge will be leveraged to investigate potential areas of improvement including energy consumption, weight, overall efficiency, and safety. Implementing hybrid-electric systems could potentially remove redundant systems, reduce turbine size and allow for electrically powered emergency decent. In addition, decoupled energy management has shown potential benefits for fixed wing aircraft, allowing propulsors to be placed virtually anywhere around the aircraft. The potential benefit specific to rotorcraft may mean a broadening of configuration possibilities.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase I effort adds breadth to the body of knowledge for hybrid-electric propulsion considerations specific to rotorcraft designs. These designs may have potential in benefitting NRA projects and direct NASA efforts, both internal and external. The nuances of adopting hybrid-electric propulsion have already been somewhat identified, and this efforts seeks to gain some ground in developing the same sensitivity for rotorcraft. With the development of the processes that enable the hybrid-electric rotorcraft to be analyzed and compared to baseline configurations, the potential direction of future design tools will be narrowed. Once the basics of hybrid-electric rotorcraft design and analysis are better understood, a wider variety of propulsion architectures can also be investigated. Once the analysis is better understood, more ground can be broken for investigating sizing methods, structural analysis and health monitoring considerations that have already been initiated for fixed wing designs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The knowledge gained from this Phase I effort can help to support other companies in their hybrid-electric designs studies. As the industry pushes towards investigating hybrid-electric and all-electric designs, with the development of new technologies for electric components and batteries, an understanding of how these technologies are to be integrated and analyzed is required. The results of this effort may also guide aerospace primes and AFRL toward the identification of feasible hybrid-electric and all-electric rotorcraft architectures. The trade studies can serve to inform component manufacturers on how their technology would affect the leading edge of hybrid-electric and all-electric rotorcraft designs to guide future development.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To reduce the cost of space travel, NASA is developing In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) methods to collect and convert local resources into products that can be used during the mission. Towards this objective, BlazeTech is proposing the development of an innovative system to filter Mars dust from gas streams. Our system combines the cyclone concept with a spinning and cylinder that acts as a self cleaning filter. The main advantages of the proposed device over conventional systems are the self-cleaning aspect of the filter surface a reduction in pressure drop and volume requirements.  This makes the concept particularly suitable for NASA's requirements which include a modest throughput but a high capture efficiency of the fine particles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary intended application of the proposed technology is in the filtration of Mars dust under the NASA In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) program.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology can also be extended to other applications where filtration without significant use of manpower is a priority.  Examples include filtration of sand from gas streams that enter the engine compartments in helicopters and aircraft extending their life, and separation of fine particulate contaminants from emissions from chemical process industry and smoke stacks in power plants.

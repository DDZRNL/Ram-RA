		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This project is directed to the development of low-loss, high power-density Aluminum Nitride (AlN)/Gallium Nitride (GaN) heterostructure based transistors for enabling high-efficiency solid state power amplifiers (SSPA) needed for advancing capabilities of future robotic and human exploration spacecraft. The AlN/GaN heterostructure is a particularly attractive system for switch-mode applications due to the extremely high charge density, high electron mobility, high intrinsic breakdown field, and physical thinness achievable and has seen widespread investigation toward solid-state amplifiers in the recent years. However, very few innovations have been proposed with this heterostructure despite its expansive capacity for various creative device concepts. A new patent-pending multichannel AlN/GaN Field Screening High Electron Mobility Transistor (FS-HEMT) design is described. Preliminary experimental results are presented validating design principles that will eliminate current collapse phenomenon at X- and Ka-band frequencies that has plagues traditional HEMT designs and will ultimately deliver a low-loss switch-mode device.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The intrinsic field screening properties of the FS-HEMT structure provide for superiors radiation hard and reliability properties over other GaN HEMT using passivation techniques to overcome current collapse. The proposed approach has strong potential to be integrated into high efficiency SSPAs for all microwave communication and radar applications including active phased array antennas and satellite communication.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA commercial applications include civilian aerospace radar and communication applications.

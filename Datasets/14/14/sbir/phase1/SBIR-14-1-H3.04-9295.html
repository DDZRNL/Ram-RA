		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Based on the excellent results obtained in house, Fractal Systems, Inc. proposes to optimize and prototype an innovative, energy-efficient wastewater recovery system to enable humans to live and work for extended periods in space. Water recovery in space is essential to produce potable and hygienic water from wastewater generated onboard spacecraft. We will investigate efficient photo-catalysts and optimize the design of our photo-catalytic reactor towards a compact, lightweight portable non-venting remediation system for generating potable water free from chemical by-products in a short period of time, and which will use a solid state light source in the visible range. Based on the development efforts of the photo-catalysts, reactor design and remediation results, Phase 2 will focus on the fabrication scale up of the needed materials and components and fabrication of prototypes that will be characterized with respect to their remediation efficiency. This effort will be conducted in collaboration with academia and industry partners to achieve a viable technology for use by NASA where the design will be developed by our team with input from NASA, and which would result in a complete system that will be used by our industrial partner, a water purification company, for commercialization purposes.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed wastewater recovery system will be the most ecological way of generating drinking water from wastewater generated by spacecraft crew. Our compact and portable water purification system will be simple, inexpensive and creates no by-products. Such a system will be ideal for recycling wastewater generated by humans in space.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications for the proposed wastewater recovery system includes purification in the military, private wells, camp grounds, hotels, bottlers, aquaculture, hospitals, food, cottages, restaurants, breweries, water systems, laboratories, marine, pharmaceutical, dairies and many other applications.

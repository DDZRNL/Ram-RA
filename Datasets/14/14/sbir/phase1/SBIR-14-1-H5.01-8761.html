		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR Phase I program proposes to develop a bulk processing technology for producing ultra fine grain (UFG) aluminum alloy structures. The goal is to demonstrate a practical, production level manufacturing approach for producing bulk-sized aluminum alloy structures and eventually near-net shape components with nano-scale microstructures. Ultra fine grain aluminum alloys could be particularly advantageous for higher performance, lighter weight spacecraft structures, airframes, and space-frames and structural components needed for next generation commercial and military systems. The effect of different thermo-mechanical conditions to achieve the requisite microstructure-properties also needs to be understood, and will be developed in this project.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA commercial applications for higher strength, lighter weight aluminum alloy forgings, plates, and sheets with ultra fine grained microstructures include higher performance spacecraft and launch vehicles, civil fixed-wing and rotary aircraft systems requiring lightweight yet high strength and durable structures and components.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA commercial applications for higher strength, lighter weight aluminum alloy forgings, plates, and sheets with ultra fine grained microstructures include higher performance military spacecraft and launch vehicles, fixed-wing and rotary aircraft systems, combat vehicles, and land vehicles including automobiles and heavy duty trucks.

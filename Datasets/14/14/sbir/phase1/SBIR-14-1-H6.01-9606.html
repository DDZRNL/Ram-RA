		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Saber Astronautics proposes spacecraft subsystem control software which can autonomously reconfigure avionics for best performance during various mission conditions.  The approach is to construct performance metrics from spacecraft health and welfare telemetry and learn their relationships in a probabilistic, multi-modal model called a "System Map". In this way the relationships between consumables, mission performance, and spacecraft subsystems can be learned in the same data driven model. <BR><BR>The significance of the innovation is the ability for immediate, accurate real time assessment of the spacecraft systems-of-systems performance. Immediate assessment leads to immediate action, so the System Map is useful for any spacecraft reconfiguration task, spacecraft repair task, or mission decision assessment.  It can be used in a fully autonomous, decentralized fashion by implanting on an FPGA as investigated in this proposal, or as a decision aid for a human crew.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Responsive spacecraft:  Spacecraft will benefit from subsystems which can modify its own survivability based on environmental conditions and mission needs.  This can have a high impact on the resilience and survivability of Deep Space missions.  A generic controller board can work with nearly any subsystem.<BR><BR>Earth based satellite ground stations:  Spacecraft controllers will benefit from the intuitive handling of telemetry and the assistance of statistics based predictions.  Models will assist controllers in troubleshooting and sometimes preventing problems.<BR><BR>Deep space missions:  Spacecraft with long duration missions at long distance from Earth require a high degree of autonomy.  Autonomous subsystems which are reactive to its local environment will greatly reduce mission risk while optimizing science return.<BR><BR>Habitation modules:  Dormant habitation modules also require a high degree of autonomy for long periods of time, to ensure proper health in preparation of human occupation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial spaceport ground stations:  All of the product's benefits are equally useful in assisting the commercial space satellite market conduct safer and cheaper operations.<BR><BR>Resilient commercial spacecraft: Commercial spacecraft will have greater ability to support multiple missions and dynamic space environments.<BR><BR>Manufacturing Sector:  Many of the methods in this proposal are finding use in "BigData" complex systems problems.  <BR><BR>Cleantech: Smart grids, water utilities, smart homes, and any other complex-dynamic consumables driven industries will be able to reduce waste and recover from system-level anomalies.<BR><BR>US Space Command:  The product is useful to Army Space Support Teams (ARSST) and Joint Space Support Teams (JSST), who have a need to monitor and report the status of spacecraft in use to their supported military command.  The scalability of information is especially useful in mitigating differences in the information requirements across services.

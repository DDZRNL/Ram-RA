		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR program will investigate high energy density novel nanofuels combined with high density binders for use with an N2O oxidizer.  Terves has developed processes for stabilizing advanced high Isp fuels, such as LiBH4 to make them stable in thermoplastic binders such as PE.  If they combust efficiently and have suitable regression rates and stability, These materials can provide hybrid Isp's above 300 and density Isp's above 450 seconds with self-pressurizing N2O oxidizers, enabling very low cost propulsion systems to be designed.  This program will fabricate ultrafine- and nano- metal boride and hydride fuels, disperse them into high density binders, and evaluate their combustion efficiency in a hybrid test motor

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Hybrid rocket motors offer potential for reducing the cost and weight of propulsion systems.  Higher efficiency, and higher regression rate solid fuels can be leveraged into revolutionary system performance for a variety of missions from mars sample return to upper stage and micro-satellite propulsion.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications are rapidly increasing with a reduction in the cost of access to space.  N2O self-pressurizing Hybrid motors are viable low cost alternatives, as evidenced by their selection and use in spaceship one.

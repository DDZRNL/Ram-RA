		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		KalScott Engineering, and the subcontractor, Princeton University propose the development and demonstration of compact and robust methane sensor for small Unmanned Aerial Systems (s-UAS) by synthesizing state-of-the-art, laser-based detection methods with the rapidly increasing s-UAS market. The overall goal of this project is to develop and demonstrate (via flight test) laser-based flight-weight methane sensors. In Phase I, the sensor will be built and lab-tested, followed by initial flight tests on KalScott's Cessna 210. In Phase II, a refined version of the sensor will be built, and flight tested, first on the Cessna, and then on a small UAS.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed research of the Phase I/II project will result in robust, flightweight laser-based sensors for small UASs, which can be used for greenhouse gas measurements associated with climate change research.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed research of the Phase I/II project will result in robust, flightweight laser-based sensors for small UASs, which can be used for methane emission monitoring in gas/oil extraction industry.

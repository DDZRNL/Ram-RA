		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This project will develop advanced DC link capacitors using flexible ultrathin glass dielectric materials. The glass capacitor will be able to be operated in a broad temperature range (-150 degree C to 500 degree C), frequency (1 kHz to 1 MHz), and high voltage (>1,000 volts). This SBIR project will be focused on examining the technical performance of the glass dielectrics at very high (>200 deg C) and very low (<-100 deg C) temperature for NASA space missions with harsh and extreme environment. The performance under high radiation will also be evaluated as required by NASA. The effects of these extreme conditions on the glass dielectric and high voltage performance will be systematically examined in terms of dielectric constant, dielectric loss, dielectric breakdown strength, and leakage current.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The advanced glass capacitors can be used in the power management systems for future NASA science and exploration missions such as: missions using electric propulsion, robotic missions, lunar exploration missions to NEO and MARS, crewed habitats, astronaut equipment, robotic surface missions to Venus and Europa, polar Mars missions and Moon missions, and distributed constellations of micro-spacecraft. The constant and dependable performance of the glass capacitor will ensure high reliability of the NASA aerospace power management systems. The high dielectric constant and breakdown strength and low dielectric loss will enable the miniaturization of the power management systems in aerospace applications.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The advanced glass capacitors have broad applications in renewable energy industry including DC link capacitors in hybrid and plug-in electrical vehicles, grid-tie photovoltaics, wind turbine generators, down-hole drilling and exploration of oil, gas, and geothermal. With its high dielectric constant and breakdown strength, the glass capacitor also has high energy density and can be used in various pulsed power systems.

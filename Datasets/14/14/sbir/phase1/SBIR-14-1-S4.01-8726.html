		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced Scientific Concepts, Inc. (ASC) has developed a number of 3D Flash LIDAR systems.  Flash LIDAR sensors are 3D video systems that return range and intensity for each pixel in real time.  ASC's Flash LIDAR has been used for autonomous berthing with the International Space Station and is currently under development for the OSIRIS-REx asteroid rendezvous mission.  Flash LIDAR is also being evaluated by JPL and NASA for Entry Decent and Landing for ALHAT and Mars. All of these applications use avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays in the camera focal plane array. APDs are complex epitaxially grown structures and biased at relatively high voltages (50-70V).  These arrays have a poor fill factor that is compensated by micro-lenses. These micro-lenses are restricted to F/#s greater than about 3.3 which in turn limits the effective receive aperture. If micro-lenses were unnecessary, an F/1 receive aperture could increase the collection area by a factor of 10 with no increase in noise.  This should result in an increased SNR of approximately 40% but, because of the simplicity of PINs compared to APDs, an increase in reliability as well.  PINs are more radiation hard than APDs, are more operationally stable (therefore do not require individual fuses to protect against the development of high dark current pixels), inherently have lower dark current (lower noise), and are inherently more uniform. In addition low-voltage FPA drive electronics is easier to design than high voltage circuitry.  These improvements will result in a more reliable higher performance array.<BR>&#8195;

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This development will increase the readiness and effectiveness of 3D Flash LIDAR for NASA Commercial Applications requiring 3D navigation and situational awareness.  Some of the commercial applications that are being developed currently include ISS resupply missions.  ASC is working with the Boeing Corporation to develop a space qualified eye safe 3D Flash LIDAR for ISS rendezvous and docking.  The same technology platform being developed for OSIRIS-REx and ISS docking is being considered for satellite servicing  and can be used for the Lunar Cargo Transportation and Landing by Soft Touchdown (Lunar CATALYST) program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications include collision avoidance to save pedestrians and prevent vehicle damage,  Mid-Air Refueling, Surveillance, Terrain Mapping, Autonomous Navigation for unmanned ground, air and surface vehicles.  The 3D maps created by the system will be useful to avoid automobile accidents and guide robots for Hazard Material Detection and Handling.

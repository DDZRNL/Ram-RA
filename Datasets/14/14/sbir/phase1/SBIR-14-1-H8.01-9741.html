		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		As NASA space missions become longer in duration the need for high efficiency power generator sets that can operate on NASA logistical fuel become critical. Historically NASA has used fuel cells as part of the energy solution.  Space bound energy and power systems require rapid start and stop cycle times as well as high power densities. The high operational efficiency, coupled with the use of logistical fuel options make fuel cells vital to the extended future missions of NASA. Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) have been demonstrated on a variety of gaseous and liquid hydrocarbon fuels.  Our team has developed tubular SOFC systems capable of cycling from room temperature to 700C and full power in less than 15 minutes. The system has been cycled more than 250 times and demonstrated life times greater than 2000hrs. Coupling the freeze cast microstructure with the rapid cycling and portability of the tubular systems will lead to a high power density robust SOFC system operating on methane and oxygen capable of space missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Specifically, cells developed during this program can be further used in the following systems:<BR>-Energy storage and maintenance for the international space station<BR>-High altitude balloons<BR>-High altitude aircraft<BR>-Energy storage for future missions and settlement on the moon and Mars
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This unique fuel cell microstructure can be leveraged across all SOFC developments, improving both system power density and reducing cost and used for electrolysis of water and or carbon dioxide leading to a host of applications such as: CO2 conversion, Hydrogen or Oxygen production, and the production of metals from oxide salt mixtures.

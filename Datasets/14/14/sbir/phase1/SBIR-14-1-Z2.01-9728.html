		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Liquidmetal Technologies (LMT) and the University of Southern California (USC)'s M.C. Gill Composites Center team up to develop manufacturing processes for large-scale bulk metallic glass (BMG) and fiber laminate systems for aerospace applications. The proposed innovation consists of the development of a process to manufacture thin BMG sheets (150mm x 300mm x 0.1-1mm) by tube casting and hot rolling along with a process to fabricate fiber metal laminates (FMLs) utilizing the BMG sheets thereof and carbon fiber prepregs. While Phase I would focus on development of a small-scale prototype, the completed Phase I work would also give insight into the feasibility of large-scale manufacturing processes, such as vertical continuous casting, flash processing, autoclave moulding, out-of-autoclave moulding, and press moulding, many of which would be explored in a potential Phase II effort. Thus, in Phase I the technology readiness level (TRL) of the proposed innovation would increase from 2 to 3, and in Phase II the TRL would increase from 3 to 5.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary NASA application for the proposed innovation would be for protection from micro-meteroid and orbital debris (MMOD). The high strength-to-weight ratio and high impact resistance of the bulk metallic glass-fiber metal laminate composite would provide hypervelocity impact protection of space vehicles and satellites in the form of an outer wall bumper shield.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The development of methods to manufacture thin BMG sheets on a large scale as well as methods to fabricate FMLs in complex geometries and at large scales would not only greatly enhance aerospace vehicle protection but also appeal to a wide range of applications, such as consumer electronics, armor, aircrafts, and automobiles.

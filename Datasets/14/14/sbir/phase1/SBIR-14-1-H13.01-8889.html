		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		An ideal NDE data acquisition and analysis tool would be a versatile and precise device capable of providing support for a large number of inspections using numerous inspection methods such as JENTEK's Meandering Winding Magnetometer (MWM) inspection, Standard Eddy Current Testing (ET), Ultrasonic Testing (UT), and other digitized NDT methodologies. Such a "super" instrument could address NASA's need for improved nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of complex built up structural components for space flight hardware, as well as provide new capability for other challenging material constructs. A leap in capability will be demonstrated that is suitable for applications including multi-layered coatings, composites, thin metal layers, thermal protection systems, tiles, felts, micrometeoroid shielding, composite overwrapped pressure vessels, and difficult to inspect locations.<BR>For this proposal a "super" instrument is defined as an instrument that has (1) many parallel channels with high data rate capabilities, that (2) each perform at the highest signal to noise and bandwidth performance made possible by the latest generation digital and analog electronics components, and (3) digital structured waveform generation and deconvolution capability. This proposed Phase I SBIR will demonstrate the capability of JENTEK's new 8200 instrument for two selected NASA needs; one for rapid imaging of complex built up structures, and a second for an inspection that cannot be addressed by conventional NDE methods. This Phase I will also lay the foundation for modifications in Phase II that address specific identified technology gaps needed to provide a leap in NDE capabilities, and will demonstrate an integrated prototype to TRL 5 that specifically addresses the need for "astronaut crews to make important assessments quickly" while also reducing their inspection related burdens. The final system will not only support JENTEK MWM arrays, but also other NDE methods such as UT.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase I SBIR will lay the foundation for the Phase II by clearly demonstrating that the first NDE super instrument, the JENTEK 8200, can deliver a leap in capability and solve high priority NASA NDE problems that cannot be addressed adequately by available conventional and advanced NDE methods. This will specifically include demonstration of capability on a high priority NASA built up structure and demonstration of the value provided by the hyper-sensitive phase measurement capability offered for the first time by the 8200. For the built up structure the Phase I demonstration will include at least 4-unknowns and a clear demonstration of the advantages of the improved super NDE instrument over previous JENTEK and other available instruments for the selected application. This Phase I will also lay the foundation for development in Phase II of a general purpose super NDE instrument suitable for multiple methods including at least ET and UT. Phase I will demonstrate capability using either the JENTEK MQS or EQS sensing methods; while also evaluating the requirements for the super instrument to support UT and other conventional and advanced NDE methods. This will include description of the Phase II prototype and selection of a Phase II target application that is a high priority for NASA. Finally, Phase I will also identify the technology gaps that must be addressed in Phase II to address the target NASA application requirements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There is substantial demand in commercial markets for the capabilities that will be developed under this Phase I. Target applications for an NDE super instrument include commercial airlines (e.g. 787 and A380) and for military aircraft (e.g. F/A-18 and F-35 and V-22). JENTEK is also pursuing many other markets for this technology. The most rapidly growing of these markets is imaging of corrosion in oil and gas piping, pipelines and vessels. <BR>JENTEK has had commercial success with the DOD including deployed systems for C-130 and P-3 propeller blade inspections and AV-8B (F402 Rolls-Royce) engine blade repair weld and disk slot inspections. JENTEK has also delivered systems for commercial turbine inspections, oil and gas pipelines, and are an FAA-approved NDT provider for specific Rolls-Royce engine knife seal inspections. Because of previous commercial success with the DOD, JENTEK is confident this program can and will successfully transition solutions for an SHM/IVHM solution to Government and commercial platforms.

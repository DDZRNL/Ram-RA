		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NanoSonic proposes to design and develop light-weight, low-modulus, and durable Metal Rubber sensors for aeroelastic analysis of inflatable/flexible entry, descent, and landing (EDL) systems, which would in effect increase the systems aerodynamic stability by contributing to optimize its design.  More specifically, a network of small Metal Rubber strain sensors would provide a non-invasive mechanism to monitor loading of the inflatable deceleration and landing systems.  The in-situ Metal Rubber strain sensors would be utilized to monitor drag and instability of the system at varying Mach flow regimes by analyzing dynamic structure forces and also billowing effects (or similar shape-change / inflation effects) of the inflatable system as it goes through EDL operations.  The novel Metal Rubber sensors have proven the ability to monitor aerodynamic events, particularly shear and normal forces, based on their response to applied strain. These previous sensor technological advancements will be modified to develop the proposed sensor system for monitoring dynamic loading of the inflatable structure.  Lightweight Metal Rubber sensor appliques can be attached onto the inflatable base material or integrated in/under the system coating matrix for in-situ non-invasive monitoring.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed NASA SBIR program would develop an innovative, light-weight, low-modulus, and rugged Metal Rubber sensor system for inflatable/flexible entry, descent, and landing (EDL) systems.  Some possible other applications for similar Metal Rubber materials for NASA platforms (particularly aerospace systems) include: low-modulus strain & skin friction sensors for adaptive / morphing aircraft systems, low-modulus materials or conformal coatings for EMI/RF shielding, and flexible electrically-conductive wires.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There is a large market for low-weight high strain sensors for scientific balloons, high altitude morphing systems, and similar re-entry inflatable systems, specifically for NASA and the aircraft industry.  NanoSonic's low modulus Metal Rubber sensors and multi-element sensor arrays have unique applications in systems where strain is large and conventional stress and strain sensors mechanically fail.  Because Metal Rubber is extremely durable, low modulus, and can have high electrical conductivity; it can also be used in high performance, highly flexible and mechanically robust electronic flex circuits, flexible displays, and smart electronic fabrics.

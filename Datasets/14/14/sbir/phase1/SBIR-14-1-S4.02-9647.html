		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Based on the sampling requirements, we propose an Inverted Pyramid sampling system. Each face of the pyramid includes a cutting blade which is independently actuated by redundant pyrotechnic actuators. Such sampler shape has a number of advantages. The pyramidal V shape acts as an arrow piercing into the comet surface at a steep angle. The 4 opposing blades offset tangential forces, meaning that only vertical forces would need to be reacted during impact. These forces could be minimized by making the pyramid height low (and in turn the pyramid would be more flat). <BR>In the latest Decadal Survey, the committee recommended selecting a Comet Surface Sample Return mission as one of the five New Frontiers 4 (NF4) missions, solidifying the importance of studying returned physical samples from a comet. Lunar South Pole-Aitken Basin Sample Return could also benefit from the development of this sampling approach.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The acquisition of surface samples from small interplanetary bodies, such as comets and asteroids, as well as small moons like Mars' Phobos and Deimos, holds great scientific interest. Under the NASA Authorization Act, Congress instructed NASA to "plan, develop, and implement a Near-Earth Object (NEO) Survey program to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize the physical characteristics of NEOs equal to or greater than 140 meters in diameter, in order to assess the threat of such near-Earth objects to the Earth." In 2010, President Obama called for a new approach to space exploration, which would include human and robotic exploration of asteroids. <BR>In the latest Decadal Survey, the committee recommended selecting a Comet Surface Sample Return mission as one of the five New Frontiers 4 (NF4) missions, solidifying the importance of studying returned physical samples from a comet. Lunar South Pole-Aitken Basin Sample Return could also benefit from the development of this sampling approach. <BR>Another mission that the Decadal Survey considered to be strategic for the planetary exploration was Cryogenic Comet Nucleus Sample Return (CCSNR ) Mission. However, the committee agreed that that mission (mainly due to lack of matured technologies) should be left for the 2020+ decade, while in this decade the required technologies (incl. sampling system) should be developed to TRL 6.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications for this technology include sampling of contaminated soils and liquid from hazardous environments (near nuclear reactors, oil spills, chemical spills etc.). Key subsystems, such as the sampling probes, would reduce the risk of sending personnel into these environments.<BR>In addition, commercial companies, such as Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries, who are interested in asteroid mining for economic gains, would use this technology. It would be extremely useful to conduct reconnaissance of target bodies in order to determine their composition (e.g. fraction of water-ice, Platinum Group Metals, Rare Earth Elements etc.), and in turn evaluate economic potential for mining the bodies. The spacecraft would also be useful on the Moon for another company, wanting to process lunar regolith and water for economic gain: Shackleton Energy.

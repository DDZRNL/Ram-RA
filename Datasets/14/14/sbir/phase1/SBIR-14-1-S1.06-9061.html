		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has an interest in the development of advanced instruments and components for Lunar and planetary science missions.  Instrumentation is needed for the exploration of inner and outer planets and their moons, comets, asteroids, etc.  As a consequence, instrumentation systems must withstand the extreme environments experienced in space and planetary environments; radiation, temperature, pressure, launch/landing stresses, etc.  <BR><BR>Specific areas related to instrument deployment for in situ sensors and sensor systems on a variety of space platforms including orbiters, flyby spacecraft, landers, rovers, balloon, other aerial vehicles, sub-surface penetrators, and impactors.   <BR><BR>The envisioned Phase I program will develop an innovative digital readout integrated circuit architecture that will increase resolution and provide improved sensitivity.  The low power design will incorporate provisions that mitigate effects of radiation and extreme temperatures.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		It is anticipated that the DROIC technology developed under the SBIR could be applied to a variety of Flagship missions including EJSM, Mars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher (MAX-C), Venus Climate Mission, and the Uranus Orbiter/probe. <BR><BR>Specific applications include 1) advanced array readouts for Mars missions, 2) highly radiation hardened readout electronics for Europa and IO, 3) low temperature IR spectrometers and imagers for Titan, 4) high temperature  sensors for Venus, and 5) imagers/spectrometers for small bodies.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA commercialization avenues include persistent surveillance applications for the military.  Commercial applications may exist in thermal imaging, hyperspectral imaging, or compressive sensing.

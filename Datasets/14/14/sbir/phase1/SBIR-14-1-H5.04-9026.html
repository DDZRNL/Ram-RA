		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Environmentally durable material systems capable of operating at temperatures from 1500 to 3000?C while maintaining structural integrity are enabling for future hot structure hypersonic vehicles.  State-of-the-art ceramic matrix composite CMC's and other established refractories lack stability at these high temperatures.  The plasma transferred arc (PTA) additive manufacturing (AM) process has demonstrated over 4000?C melt synthesis of select eutectic materials which have exhibited cyclic oxidation protection at 2600?C.  These novel materials will be further investigated as possible monoliths, graphite fiber reinforced and as a conformal coating on C-C components.  The PTA AM synthesized materials will be fully characterized to 3000?C for hypersonic vehicle applications with coupons delivered to NASA.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A material which maintains structural integrity to 3000?C enables hypersonic vehicles, some missile systems and any very high temperature application.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Hypersonic vehicles for DoD, civilian rocketry and space vehicles, some energy conversion application, and some niche industrial application.

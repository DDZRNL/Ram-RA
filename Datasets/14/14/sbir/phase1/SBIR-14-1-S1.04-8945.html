		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Instruments employing X-ray, gamma ray and particle detection are utilized in different sectors from medicine to industry and from basic to applied science. The solid-state detector array with detection ASIC is the primary technology of space-based high-energy astronomy missions that are managed by NASA in partnership with the international community1,2. A readout integrated circuitry (ROIC) specifically designed for photon resolving X-ray detection has been developed by Black Forest Engineering on prior NASA SBIR funding3. The BFE322 ROIC, bump bonded to a CdZnTe (CZT) 16x32 detector array, demonstrated single photon sensitivity, accurate X-ray energy determination, X-ray event time stamping, and low power dissipation (< 10 &#956;W per pixel) at ambient temperature operation; this represents a significant advancement in detection capability. The proposed Phase I improves ROIC performance by using low 1/f noise 250 nm CMOS, in-pixel amplifier tuning to match detector capacitance and rad-hard-by-design (RHBD) to provide >500 kRad radiation tolerance. The Phase I design will be a 32x32 pixel format with 600 ?m pixel pitch compatible with CZT and silicon detector arrays. The ROIC will be fabricated and hybridized to CZT on Phase II and demonstrated using a PocketQube or CubeSat mini-satellite test flight to establish a TRL> 6.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Direct detection  of x-rays from 0.5-600 keV and gamma ray/particles <BR>in a radiation environment is required in future NASA missions. A radiation hard ASIC readout bump bonded to CZT/Si-PIN detectors will provide low noise and low power detection in space base missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Rad hard direct detection sensor arrays are needed in medical X-ray imaging and non destructive material analysis. Very low noise readout is required in many photon sensing technologies.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose the potential to develop significant improvements to size, weight, and prime power requirements of front-end cw lasers and associated frequency stabilization and offset-locking photonics and electronics that are utilized in laser-based remote sensing systems for the measurement of atmospheric CO2 concentrations and wind velocity.  The emphasis in the proposed program is to develop stable front-end sources for 2-micron wavelength systems, but it is anticipated that much of the design will be readily applicable to a broad array of short-wave IR wavelengths, e.g. 1.57 micron, by the use of alternative laser gain media.  Although the Phase I design and Phase II implementation will be aimed at airborne platforms, only designs that have a clear and practical path to future space-based implementation will be considered.  The Beyond Photonics team is uniquely qualified to explore the state-of-the-art in relevant lasers and frequency stabilization techniques and develop improved front-end systems that have a demonstrable path to robust, compact airborne and space-based applications.  Our team's deep experience with such systems lends a perspective that will yield significant gains in system compactness, efficiency, and autonomous reliability for a wide array of applications relevant to NASA's missions, and improve the viability for other commercial and military applications in eye-safe remote sensing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA commercial applications for the innovations in frequency-stable 2-um lasers and associated atmospheric spectroscopic remote sensing control technologies include the NASA ASCENDS program, as well as space-based coherent winds (3D Winds), atmospheric pollution monitoring and mitigation systems, chemical and biohazard detection and avoidance, and airborne meteorological instrumentation requiring very environmentally-robust, compact, high-performance cw single-frequency lasers and associated spectral control instrumentation.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA commercial applications include airborne and ground-based atmospheric CO2 measurement systems, military applications involving high-velocity target tracking and ranging and long-range (10's-100's of km)imaging of hard targets, wind energy management and site optimization, commercial airport environmental management and wake vortex detection and avoidance.

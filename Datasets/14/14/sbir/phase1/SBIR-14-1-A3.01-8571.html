		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced wing configurations where traditional control surfaces are replaced by dynamically controlled distribution of wing twist and/or camber can provide significant benefits to aircraft performance, such as reduced vibration and noise, increased fuel efficiency. Elimination of traditional control surfaces such as flaps can lead to smoother wing surfaces which are especially important in reducing electromagnetic signature of the wings in military aircraft. In this research and development program, Materials Technologies Corporation (MTC) and its team members propose a three-dimensional warping concept in which the typically closed airfoil section is cut open to create a torsionally compliant mechanism that acts as its own amplification device without needing additional mechanisms whatsoever. Deformation of the airfoil is entirely controlled by out-of-plane warping, a purely geometric effect.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed 3D warping actuation concept has potential application to all fixed wing and vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft. Applications of 3D warping include both civilian and military aircraft. 3D warping can reduce the empty weight of aircraft by lessening the weight dedicated to vibration suppression, thus allowing more payload and/or flight range. Additionally, to the extent that variable airfoil twist can improve L/De, the proposed warping concept will result in further improvements in payload/ flight range.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed concept will have applications in the Worldwide Wind Turbine industry for power generation. An effective camber/twist change is needed to benefit most from the dynamic airflow through wind turbines.  The potential for this rapidly growing "green" power generation industry is enormous.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Heat shield technology is a critical component for both re-entry and<BR>hypersonic vehicles. The traditional manufacturing approach for<BR>designing heat shields consists of joining TPS tiles together with an<BR>adhesive that fills any gaps between them. This approach has significant<BR>challenges, including the reduction in thermal-mechanical performance as<BR>compared to that of acreage woven material. Nhung's Notions proposes to<BR>address this problem by modifying existing equipment to mechanically<BR>join these materials prior to infusion. In Phase I, we will determine<BR>the material and pattern parameters required to use with equipment to<BR>prepare the joins while minimizing damage to the pristine woven material<BR>while maintaining consistent thickness between pre- and post- joined<BR>material keeping pattern consistency throughout the process.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The completion of the project will result in a method for joining and<BR>repairing mid-to-high density ablative TPS materials of at least 1"<BR>thickness. This project will provide new ways of adequately designing<BR>large and/or complex shapes for heat shields to protect the spacecraft,<BR>enabling operation under harsher conditions with a reduction in both<BR>weight and cost.<BR>The next generation of crew reentry vehicles being designed by NASA will<BR>require more advanced Thermal Protection System (TPS) designs than the<BR>conservative approaches currently used. While new TPS materials are<BR>under development, a key difficulty is the ability to create the joining<BR>seam TPS material which is not reduce the thermal-mechanical performance<BR>compared TPS woven material. This project helps address that difficulty.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		As our society becomes more dependent upon satellites for worldwide<BR>communications, weather prediction, global positioning, and countless<BR>other applications, the need to be able to add, service, replace, and<BR>remove satellites grows, and with it the need for more efficient<BR>commercial re-entry vehicles capable of performing these tasks. This<BR>project helps enable these vehicles as well as the more exotic<BR>exploration vehicles.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Laser Sensing Company proposes to develop an ultra-miniature, low-power, robust gas analyzer for measuring methane and water aboard small UAVs. Compared with alternative UAV-deployable greenhouse gas sensors, the proposed instrument offers a 1-2 order of magnitude reduction in mass, size, and power consumption, while still maintaining sensitivity and time resolution needed for scientific missions. This drastic miniaturization is enabled by TLSC's recently patented miniature multipass gas cell and patented, proprietary low-power-consumption control, acquisition, and processing electronics for tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS).   <BR><BR>The analyzer will feature a robust, simple design optimized to provide high stability. The instrument will be designed for deployment in the 0.1-2 km altitude region, where it can probe the planetary boundary layer and remotely investigate point sources of methane in-situ with high accuracy.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's Earth Science Division leads major research efforts to understand the earth's atmosphere and its relationship with the changing climate.  These efforts include in-situ sub-orbital airborne missions to benchmark satellite measurements, provide data for modeling, and to investigate point sources of emission.  The proposed miniature CH4/H2O analyzer can be deployed on NASA UAVs such as the SIERRA and Dragon Eye to investigate point sources of methane emission.  Low altitude, high spatial resolution measurements can be used to benchmark satellite data.  Thanks to its size and low power usage, large area wireless networks of the sensor can be set up to complement coordinated NASA monitoring programs such as DISCOVER-AQ campaigns and the Los Angeles Megacities Carbon Project.  <BR><BR>Technology developed for the instrument, such as the ultra-compact multipass cell, can also be valuable for planetary exploration.  For example the next generation Mars rover could incorporate the cell design in TDLAS gas analyzers to reduce instrument footprint.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed sensor has numerous promising non-NASA commercial applications. In the oil & gas sector, the sensor can be used for UAV-based pipeline monitoring and monitoring fugitive methane emissions from drilling sites. The environmental monitoring sector is also a promising commercial avenue for the proposed product.

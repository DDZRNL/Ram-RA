		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes to develop a post-fire air purification system that consists of a particulate removal assembly, a sorbent bed to remove the combustion by-products generated by low intensity fires (such as HCN, HCl, SO2 and NH3) and an ambient temperature oxidation catalyst to eliminate any carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  The unit will be designed to rapidly restore the cabin air to a safe condition.<BR><BR>In Phase I, we will first evaluate the performance of individual components in flow experiments to identify the optimum bed geometry.  We will then design a breadboard prototype unit and evaluate its performance in an environmental chamber under representative conditions.  We will carry out detailed design of the purification system, integrating the particulate removal assembly, sorbent bed and the ambient temperature oxidation catalyst.  We will determine the weight and volume of the unit as well as the energy required to circulate the contaminated cabin air through the purifier.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The main attraction of our research to NASA is its ability to provide a lightweight, compact, gas purification system for an advanced spacecraft.  Reducing the weight and volume of the sub-components of the spacecraft atmosphere restoration system is of critical importance to NASA particularly for next generation planetary exploration missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A successful ambient temperature CO oxidation catalyst and air purification system that can remove harmful contaminants from breathing air will find an immediate use in a range of commercial markets.  We estimated a total market for fire protection systems and indoor air quality control in the U.S. and Europe to exceed 250,000 units per year, assuming an average shelf life of 2 years for the respirator.  Total revenues of fire mask and escape hoods manufacturing business are large over $1 billion/year.  In addition, fire recovery units are in use on-board the submarines of many nations, and an improved unit would fine a ready market.

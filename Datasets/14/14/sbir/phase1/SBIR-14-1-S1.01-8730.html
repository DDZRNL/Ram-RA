		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose a novel new architecture for a low-phase noise electronically tunable laser single-frequency laser at 2.05 microns that meets all the demanding requirements as a seed laser for NASA Lidar applications measuring CO2 densities in the atmosphere. The laser technology is based on previously developed hybrid integration technology that enables the direct optical coupling of active and passive waveguide chips.  Array scaling was previously demonstrated for a 4-channel IFOG optical engine and this technology will be applied to the development of the array-scalable tunable laser. The proposed tunable laser can address LIDAR applications at 2.05 microns and can be modified to any wavelength spanning the range of 640-2500 nm.

		<BR>
		The proposed laser system is the key enabling component for the development of advanced LIDAR systems for NASA applications measuring and monitoring CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere from both ground based and space based systems. The availability of this laser system will significantly reduce the development time to develop the next generation of Lidar systems. The next gen Lidar design can take advantage of the hybrid integration technology to minimize the foot print, to increase the ruggedness and to reduce the power consumption and weight.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The use of lithium (Li) metal as an anode material has emerged as one highly attractive option for achieving high specific energy due to lithium having the highest capacity (3876 mAh g-1) of all potential anode materials.  However, the reliable use of these exceptionally high capacity anodes in a commercial cell has not been achieved due to safety and reliability concerns resulting from thermal runaway and short-circuit issues due to dendritic growth on the metal anode from lithium plating during charge-discharge cycles.  Solid-state electrolytes (SSE) have been identified as one option to address this cell failure mode, but SSE technologies must be developed that combine high conductivity and mechanical properties conducive to smooth Li plating with feasible manufacturing processes.  Also, the Li anode must be combined with an ultra-high capacity cathode in order to reach NASA's aggressive cell-level energy goals.<BR><BR>To address this need, Solid Power proposes to utilize a Li-metal-compatible solid-state battery design to far exceed the specific energies achieved by state-of-the-art (SOTA) Li-ion batteries in a format that also provides for intrinsic safety and abuse tolerance. Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of surpassing 600 Wh/kg and 1000 Wh/L at the cell level which will give a 3-5X improvement over the best battery technologies planned for NASA missions today.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has a wide variety of applications in need of advanced rechargeable battery solutions including exploration vehicles, extra-vehicular activity (EVA) equipment, landers and rovers, human habitat systems, and planetary orbiters. A common thread among the battery needs for all NASA missions is an increase in specific energy.  Packing more energy into a given mass or volume can improve operational capability and flexibility, and it can also result in significant launch cost savings. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are now becoming the new industry standard for use as secondary batteries in space due to their specific energy advantages over legacy technologies. Even Li-ion, though, falls far short of the energy goals set by NASA for next-generation missions. <BR><BR>Thus, if successful the commercial potential within NASA for the proposed solid-state battery technology is vast.  Broadly speaking, the proposed safe, ultra high energy and low cost could see use in NASA missions such as scientific and exploration satellites, crewed spacecraft, human habitat systems and planetary rovers.  If successful, the proposed technology would directly impact these missions by increasing operational performance (e.g., reduced system mass, increased system lifetime, reduced system cost, etc.) while also increasing mission reliability through the reduction in safety concerns associated with conventional Li-ion rechargeable batteries.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Beyond the impact to NASA missions, the commercial potential for the proposed safe, low cost and ultra high energy all solid-state rechargeable batteries is vast as it could find use within virtually every sector of the $20+BN rechargeable battery markets.  Potential applications include commercial and military satellites, commercial and military aviation, military power (e.g., UAVs, ground vehicles, portable power, etc.) electric vehicles, utility grid-storage and consumer electronics among others.

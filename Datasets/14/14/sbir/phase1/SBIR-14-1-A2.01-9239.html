		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS) requires a robust, reliable communication link between the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and its operators. Constant communication is a necessity. New and innovative approaches are needed to provide high-bandwidth Control and Non-Payload Communications (CNPC).<BR><BR>To enable the CNPC system and increase the utility of UAS in the NAS, NuWaves Engineering has teamed up with Auriga Microwave (http://www.aurigamicrowave.com/) of Chelmsford, MA to propose the UAS Power amplifier for Extended range of Non-payload communication Devices (UPEND) project. UPEND combines a very high-efficiency radio frequency (RF) power amplifier (PA) with innovative linearization techniques in a miniature package capable of being integrated into UAS platforms as small as the venerable Boeing/Insitu ScanEagle. NuWaves' UPEND leverages advanced Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technology, as well as efficiency and thermal design, to minimize size, weight, and power (SWaP) of a PA module, while maintaining the linear output required by complex modern communications waveforms, such as 802.16.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-payload applications include telecommand, telemetry, navigation aid data, air traffic control (ATC) voice relay, air traffic services (ATS) data relay, sense and avoid data relay, airborne weather radar data, and situational awareness video. However, this proposed linear power amplifier technology also applies to payload communications, including but not limited to command & control (C2) uplink, sensor downlink, video downlink, etc.<BR><BR>Phased-array Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems for airborne land mapping science would require linear power amplifiers. Target programs include NASA/GSFC's L-band "DBSAR," and P-band "ECOSAR." Space-based SAR systems may include "SPACESAR" and "SESAR."<BR><BR>NASA/GSFC also has a number of airborne weather RADAR at X-, Ku-, Ka-, and W-bands that use linear solid state amplifiers. The projects include "XRAD," "HIWRAP," and "CRS." Studies on putting similar capabilities into space, specifically focusing on the Ka- and W-band measurements, have been commissioned.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed high-efficiency, high-linearity C-band power amplifier technology is ideal for a variety of applications. A high linearity PA enables the transmission of high PAPR signals, such as OFDM and QAM, without distortion. These modulation waveforms enable greater data throughput, leading to a reduction in overall system latency. Non-payload applications include telecommand, telemetry, navigation aid data, air traffic control (ATC) voice relay, air traffic services (ATS) data relay, sense and avoid data relay, airborne weather radar data, and situational awareness video. However, this proposed linear power amplifier technology also applies to payload communications, including but not limited to command & control (C2) uplink, sensor downlink, video downlink, etc.<BR><BR>Non-NASA customers may include major UAS suppliers who may be required to use an interoperable data link for CNPC in NAS in the near future. Additionally, communication system integrators for both terrestrial and space-based communications could be potential commercial users.

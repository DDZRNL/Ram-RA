		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The high-efficiency and linear UPEND RF C-band power amplifier was designed, simulated and partially prototyped in Phase I to provide range extension for the NASA/Rockwell Collins Control and Non-Payload Communication (CNPC) program's transceiver in support of NAS integration of UAS. UPEND leverages state-of-the-art analog pre-distortion linearization and Doherty power amplifier circuits, MMIC technology, and module-level power efficiency and thermal design, to minimize size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) of the connectorized PA module, while maintaining the linear output required by amplitude modulation. The UPEND model achieved significant improvement in Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) and power efficiency, while the proof-of-concept prototype provided validation for the model with respect to EVM performance improvement with linearization.<BR><BR>In Phase II NuWaves will address the needs of both amplitude-modulated and constant-envelope waveforms by developing multiple MMICs and packaging them together as needed. Separate die will be fabricated for the Doherty amplifier and the linearizer circuits, wire bonded and packaged into two different component-level integrated circuits &#150; one with and one without the linearizer. Two different connectorized PA module variants will be developed using these two component-level ICs, adding the necessary power supply circuitry, supporting circuitry, and mechanical and thermal design to address different NASA and commercial market needs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications include:<BR>- Unmanned Systems command & control and payload communications, including UAS, Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV), Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV).<BR>- Terrestrial and airborne tactical communications, including handheld, manpack and vehicle-mounted data links.<BR>- Broadcast communications, including television camera-mounted data links.<BR>- Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)<BR><BR>Non-NASA customers may include major UAS suppliers, such as General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, Lockheed Martin Mission Systems & Sensors, Lockheed Martin Advanced Development Programs (Skunk Works), Textron Systems AAI, etc., who may be required to use an interoperable data link for CNPC in the NAS. Additionally, terrestrial and space communication systems integrators, such as CNPC contractor Rockwell Collins, L-3 Communications (Communication Systems - West, and Cincinnati Electronics), Cubic Defense Applications, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Information Systems, Boeing Defense, Space & Security, BAE Systems, Cobham, Harris, General Dynamics, and Raytheon, are potential commercial users for the UPEND technology.

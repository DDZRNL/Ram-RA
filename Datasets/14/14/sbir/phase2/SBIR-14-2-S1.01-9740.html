		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Fibertek proposes to develop laser technology intended to meet NASA's need for innovative lidar technologies for atmospheric measurements of methane. NASA and the 2007 NRC Earth Science Decadal Study have identified methane lidar as a key technology needed to address global change research. Under this SBIR opportunity, we propose to develop an injection-seeded Erbium-doped YAG (Er:YAG) laser transmitter for methane lidar that can be used to increase performance of an existing GSFC methane lidar SNR by 20-40 times and enable future International Space Station (ISS) and satellite platform missions. In addition to targeting space flight applications, the technology could also be used for future global hawk (GH) mission. Key innovations of this technology include: * Average output power >5W at 10kHz pulse repetition rates * Direct generation of near-transform-limited single-frequency output at a 1.65um methane absorption wavelength with appropriate linestrength for high-altitude aircraft or spaceflight measurements. * High reliability and compact size, weight and power (SWaP) * Potential for high efficiency (4-8% wall plug efficiency)

		<BR>
		Methane lidar is needed by the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) to support earth based global change research and exploration science mission to identify the planetary sources of sinks of methane, a key green house gas.  NASA mission use includes: Updating existing NASA DC8 lidar, technology support development of a Global Hawk, high altitude UAV, methane lidar as part of an Earth Venture Suborbital mission; A successful phase 2 can support a satellite based global methane measurement that can identify more localized methane sources/sinks and can operate in day and nighttime conditions which provides additional data when combined with passive optical systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Fibertek's core business is aerospace lidar  and laser technology in support of commercial , aerospace and government customers. The core Er:YAG technology developed as part of this SBIR can be utilized for NASA markets in support of global change research, gas exploration market to identify methane and hence sources of natural gas and oil, pipeline leak identification. The Er:YAG core eye safe technology also enables advanced performance aerospace needs in : Laser rangefinding, target designators, 3D flash and scanning imaging lidars and coherent imaging systems.

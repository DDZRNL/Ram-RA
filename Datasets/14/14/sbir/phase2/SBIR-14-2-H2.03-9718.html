		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Design, fabrication, assembly and test of the Florida Turbine Technologies, Inc. (FTT) concept for a submersible, superconducting electric boost pump during Phase II will transition the pairing of superconducting motor and high performance pump technology for use in liquid hydrogen (LH2) from TRL 3 to TRL 6.  This innovative solution offers significant performance and operability benefits to future nuclear thermal and conventional chemical propulsion powered cryogenic in-space and upper stage systems.  FTT's submersible superconducting electric motor driven liquid hydrogen (LH2) boost pump combines a high performance hydrogen pump inducer along with an electric motor drive using active speed modulation to maintain constant discharge pressure with up to 55% vapor at the inlet. The LH2 environment enables an energy dense superconducting motor that is precisely controlled.<BR><BR>This approach substantially reduces the risk of cavitation in the main pump and enables the downstream high speed turbopump to be operated at optimum efficiency with much reduced pressures in the propellant tank.  Utilization of the low-cost, near-zero NPSHr electric boost pump permits considerable tank weight savings (as much as 40% for the NTP Mars Mission). The concept also offers significant operability and vehicle performance advantages for new cryogenic upperstage vehicles using conventional chemical propulsion engines.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications for the technology developed under this SBIR include low heat leak cryogenic circulators and transfer pumps for propellant depot, upper stage engine recirculation pumps, and cryogenic stage boost pumps, including the NTP application. Additional applications for this technology include small, light-weight, cryogenic; Hydrogen, Methane, Oxygen propellant boost pumps for chemical rocket engine applications as well as propellant loading ground support equipment.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential Non-NASA commercial applications of the technology developed under this SBIR include any boost pump application for cryogenic upper stages to increase main pump NPSP margins and/or reduce tank pressurization requirements to reduce system weight. Ground based refueling station applications to transfer liquid natural gas from the storage tank to the vehicle tank.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's Road Maps for both Launch and In Space Propulsion call for the development of non-toxic, monopropellant reaction control systems to replace the current toxic hydrazine based systems.  The Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle capsule with twelve 160 pound force (lbf) hydrazine monopropellant thrusters and the Orion Service Module with eight 100lbf NTO/MMH auxiliary propulsion thrusters are obvious insertion candidates.   Additionally, the Commercial Crew and Cargo spacecraft have also demonstrated the need for 100lbf class attitude control thrusters with quantities comparable to Orion.  Hydrazine replacements, including non-toxic HAN- and ADN-monopropellants, combust at higher temperatures making them incompatible with current Inconel 625 thrusters used in 100lbf engines. With an emphasis on hydrazine replacement increased performance, ease of manufacturing and cost reduction, a "green" 100lbf flight-weight thruster is being developed.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications include reaction control thrusters for the Orion MPCV capsule and service module; 100lbf thrusters in support of Commercial Crew and Cargo spacecraft; Reaction Control Systems for Space Launch System
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications include Commercial Access to Space programs including the lift/space craft programs for SpaceX Falcon/Dragon and Orbital Antares/Cygnus; Satellite insertion and positioning; tactical missile divert and attitude control; auxiliary power generators; and jet engine restarters.

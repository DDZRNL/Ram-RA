		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Phase I was successful in delivering a complete prototype of the proposed innovation, an LED-based, solid state, large area, pulsed, solar simulator (ssLAPSS).  The prototype not only proved the initial concept but significantly reduced risk and dramatically increases our ability to deliver a fully functional ssLAPSS in Phase II.  The proposed innovation simulates AM0 response of single, dual, 3, 4, 5 and 6 junction solar cells by using an array of different wavelength LEDs in close proximity to the solar panel string under test.  The ssLAPSS is adjustable in spectrum for selected wavelengths and Class A, the highest standard, for spatial uniformity and temporal stability.  The ssLAPSS consists of LED modules that are repositioned in a mounting frame to test many strings on a panel in sequence.  The ssLAPSS also includes optical sensors so that all metrics can be calibrated and validated automatically.<BR><BR>Solar simulation is critical for all solar cell testing, and current large area, pulsed solar simulators will not work for coming 4, 5 and 6 junction technologies.  Because the vast majority of NASA missions rely on solar cells, this is critical, enabling test technology for future solar cells.  While accurate solar simulation is critical to all solar cell missions, it is particularly important to missions requiring large amounts of power, such as solar electric propulsion (SEP) missions.  Beyond NASA's needs, other members of the aerospace community, including prime contractors, solar panel integrators and solar cell manufacturers have a critical need for this capability, which presents excellent commercialization opportunities after the Phase II maturation of the technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Large area, pulsed, solar simulation of advanced 4, 5 and 6 junction cells will benefit all NASA missions, particularly high power missions such as solar electric propulsion (SEP).  Solar simulation of advanced cells will enable current, industry-standard practices on near-future solar cells.  <BR>Many NASA labs benefit from large area, pulsed, solar simulation for test of solar arrays.  All NASA facilities studying, manufacturing or using solar panels could benefit from ssLAPSS technology.  Post-Phase II purchases would be ideal candidates for the Phase II-X program.<BR>Additional applications include:<BR><BR>- Advanced solar cells not currently available, including SBT6J, IMM with greater than 6 junctions and cells with quantum dots<BR><BR>- Low intensity, low temperature (LILT) applications<BR><BR>- High intensity, high temperature (HIHT) applications<BR><BR>- End of Life (EOL) and cell junction current matching studies
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		All of the potential NASA commercial applications also apply to non-NASA entities, including other government agencies, solar cell manufacturers, aerospace prime contractors and solar panel integrators.  Some of these applications include:<BR><BR>- Low-cost, smaller area ssLAPSS systems for cubeSats and microSats.<BR><BR>- Terrestrial technologies, up to 6 junctions, could greatly benefit from the spectral control and flexibility of ssLAPSS.  All benefits listed above could apply to terrestrial cells as well, with the greatest benefit for multijunction cells.<BR><BR>- Some past partners in other projects have already expressed interest in investing in a potential Phase II-E for commercialization and scale-up into the market.

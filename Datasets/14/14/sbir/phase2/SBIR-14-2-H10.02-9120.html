		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		There is an extraordinary need for a universal biomedical analyzer that has broadly flexible capabilities for cell studies, small animal experiments, and crew member health.  The goal of our rHEALTH X device is to create a single palm-sized device with tripartite capabilities:  non-invasive measurements, cell cytometry analysis, and multiplexed nanostrip tests.  Currently, there is no single device that is able to provide comprehensive non-invasive measurements, let alone combine it with the rHEALTH's significant wet laboratory analytical capabilities.  We have developed the existing rHEALTH technology in collaboration with NASA and here, in this Phase II proposal, we intend to further push the envelope and develop a fully integrated solution.  The non-invasive module will include measurements of heart rate, SpO2, body temperature, respiratory rate, and EKG.  The module will be housed in the back of the rHEALTH X and will be fully detachable for wireless/wearable applications.  The main unit will provide wet laboratory capabilities for cells and nanostrips.  At the end of Phase II, we will deliver a rHEALTH X with vitals patch to NASA and bring it up to TRL 7, so that it can be flight-certified and flown on the International Space Station (ISS) in a timely manner.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The rHEALTH X can be utilized onboard the ISS to perform science.  These applications include non-invasive measurements of cells and small animals, temperature monitoring of experiments, 4-parameter flow cytometry applications, multiplexed gene expression analysis using nanostrips, biomarker measurements of cell changes, flexible assay capability for space research community, and use of rHEALTH X in Microgravity Sciences Glovebox or Disposable Glove Bag to solve sample transfer issue.<BR><BR>The rHEALTH X will aid crew members on the ISS and for travel to Mars.  Capabilities allow for rapid monitoring of immune alterations from radiation, bone loss from microgravity environments, kidney health based on metabolites, cardiac rhythm disturbances, sleep alterations, and other critical and emergent conditions that may affect the health and safety our crew members.  In addition, the technology can be broadly utilized to track body health and performance in cabin and EVA.  Other crew health application include real-time monitoring of astronaut health status, heart rate monitoring to detect arrhythmias, temperature to assess infection or fever, respiratory rate to determine breathing capability, SpO2 to measure respiratory function, study of bone health via 25-OH vitamin D, assessment of immune function via TNF&#945;, study of space radiation effects, systematic monitoring of astronaut health status, acute determination of trauma and blood loss.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The rHEALTH X will have a transformative effect on the delivery of diagnostic information.  This includes real-time health monitoring, providing rapid diagnosis, measurement of leukocytes to diagnose infection and inflammation, portable EKG to allow immediate measurement of heart rate and rhythms, temperature to assess infection and fever, respiratory rate to measure breath capability, SpO2 to measure oxygenation and breathing changes, acute determination of trauma and blood loss, comprehensive portable health monitor with tripartite capabilities, healthcare diagnosis at home and in the field, consumer health management.  The rHEALTH X will enable the democratization of biomedical diagnostics.

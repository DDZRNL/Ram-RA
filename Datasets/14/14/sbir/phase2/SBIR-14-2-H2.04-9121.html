		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has identified Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) as an approach that can provide the fastest trip times to Mars and as the preferred concept for human space travel. In order to perform component testing in support of NTP engine development, an efficient means for delivering high-flowrate, high-temperature hydrogen is required. Non-nuclear generation of the desired hydrogen flowrates and temperatures for ground test of NTP components and subsystems is problematic. ACENT Laboratories is developing a Hydrogen Wave Heater (HWH) for this application. The HWH is an innovative embodiment of a wave rotor. Wave rotors can be used as a primary compressor/heater or as a topping compressor/heater to multiply the temperature and pressure of an existing compression or heating process. These highly-scalable continuous-flow devices are capable of flow rates in excess of 100 lb/s and temperatures over 5000 F.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The target markets for the ACENT wave heater are commercial and government entities that require high temperature heating of gases to temperatures beyond the current state of the art using electrical or combustion-driven heat exchangers. Ongoing NASA efforts relating to Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) technology development require heating of hydrogen to temperatures well beyond conventional heating capability. ACENT is actively engaged in discussions with relevant personnel at NASA SSC and MSFC regarding possible heater development opportunities beyond this SBIR effort. Additionally, the hypersonics community within NASA and the Department of Defense (DOD) has a strong interest in the development of high temperature clean air heaters for high enthalpy wind tunnels.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to Department of Defense applications for high enthalpy wind tunnel applications, the ACENT wave heater is pertinent to any application of gas heating above the temperature limits of conventional materials.  Applications include manufacturing and material processing among others.   Additional spin-off technologies currently under consideration include condensing wave rotors for CO2 separation and capture in addition to supercritical CO2 wave cycles that can enable efficient waste heat utilization.

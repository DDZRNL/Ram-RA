		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA and NASA funded missions/instruments such as Aura (EOS CH-1)/MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder), SOFIA/GREAT and STO have demonstrated the need for local oscillator (LO) sources between 30 and 300 um (1 and 10 THz). For observations >2 THz, technologically mature microwave sources typically have microwatt power levels which are insufficient to act as LOs for a heterodyne receivers.<BR><BR>LongWave Photonics is proposing to develop a compact, frequency agile, phase/frequency locked, power stabilized, single mode quantum cascade laser (QCL) system with > 2mW power output. The system includes distributed feedback grating (DFB) QCL arrays packed with multiple devices on a single semiconductor die with individual devices lasing at different frequencies. The source will be frequency agile over 150 GHz with center frequencies ranging from 2 to 5 THz range. The DFB QCL array will be packaged in a high-reliability Stirling cycle cooler. The source will be phase/frequency locked to a stable microwave reference synthesizer which allows continuous phase-locking ability over the THz laser tunable range with <100 kHz line width. <BR><BR>The proposed system will be able to provide sufficient power for an LO at > 2 THz, with reduction of LO linewidth, and absolute frequency accuracy and with output power stabilized to reduce system noise. The whole system will be in a compact package which can be further reduced for a flight instrument.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications include the use of the QCL as an LO for >2 THz receivers for future missions. Here the narrow line width (<100 kHz) of the QCLs can be used to resolve Doppler-limited low pressure gasses (~MHz linewidth). The DFB QCL array LO would be a frequency agile, compact replacement for any gas-laser LO.<BR><BR>The resulting source will be compact, reliable, table-top sized THz high power with stabilized frequency and power.  It will be an easy-to-use platform for NASA researchers to study the performance of other key components in the receiver such as Schottky or HEB  mixers.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Initial applications for this technology are mainly research markets for low pressure gas spectroscopy.  The narrow line width and the ability to provide real-time frequency information of the THz radiation also has great appeal. Another potential application is to replace THz gas laser used for THz detector power calibration. <BR><BR>Long-term applications include industrial uses for trace gas detection. For industrial applications, the use of high-reliability, compact Stirling cycle coolers would greatly increase the usability of these QCL devices, which have traditionally required liquid nitrogen cooling or larger cryocooling systems.

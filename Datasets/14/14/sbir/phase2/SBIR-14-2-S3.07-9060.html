		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's future remote sensing science missions require advanced thermal management technologies to provide effective cooling for multiple instruments and reject heat through multiple radiators.  To meet this need, we propose to develop a reconfigurable two-phase pumped loop that can accommodate a complex network of evaporators and multiple radiators.  The pumped loop has two performance features: (1) reliable refrigerant circulation with a mechanical pump even when the refrigerant flow exiting the radiators is a two-phase flow with significant vapor quality, and (2) reliable flow distribution among evaporators to minimize flow maldistribution due to heat load variation.  These features are achieved by a combination of an innovative loop configuration and Creare's proven enabling components.  In Phase I, we proved the feasibility of reliable refrigerant circulation through building and testing a proof-of-concept two-phase pumped loop with key features, optimizing the pumped loop design, and predicting its performance.  In Phase II, we will build and test an integrated pumped loop with multiple evaporators and heat sinks, optimize the pumped loop components and operating parameters, demonstrate its steady state and transient performance in representative thermal environments, and deliver it to NASA JPL for further performance evaluation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed thermal control technology will be ideal for remote sensing science instruments in future missions. It will maintain a constant instrument temperature under widely varied heat loads and environmental temperatures. More specifically, the technology will be uniquely suitable for a Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission that aims to survey Earth's surface water and map ocean surface height with greater detail than previously recorded.  The two-phase pumped loop is also ideal for maintaining a uniform temperature in waveguide manifold and its temperature stability.  The thermal control technology can also be used in future spacecraft with applications that include space telescopes, satellites, and exploration vehicles on Mars, the Moon, asteroid exploration, and high-altitude air balloons. The Phase II pumped loop prototype will be delivered to NASA JPL to allow NASA engineers to assess the unique capability of Creare's robust pumped loop and its potential for further science mission.

		The reliable pumped loop technology also has applications to advance two-phase thermal control systems in commercial and military satellites and aircraft, as well as high power electronics systems.

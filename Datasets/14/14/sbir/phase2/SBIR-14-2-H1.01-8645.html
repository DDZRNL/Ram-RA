		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is developing methods to collect and convert local resources such as Martian air (mainly carbon dioxide, CO2) into oxygen that can be used during the mission. The objective of this project is to protect such equipment from dust that may be sucked in with the CO2. We proposed an innovative dust filtration system that is ideally suited for long duration operation in Mars because it works well in a low pressure environment and it is essentially self-cleaning. The system is based on two mechanisms of dust filtration that have been tested separately and successfully In Phase I. In Phase II, parametric tests will be performed with simulated Mars dust and under simulated Mars environment to optimize each mechanism. Then the two mechanisms will be combined in a prototype and tested. The prototype will be delivered to NASA for potential future tests in the zero gravity airplane and in combination with the equipment to be protected.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary intended application of the proposed technology is in the filtration of Mars dust under the NASA In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) program. Technologies such as MIT's MOXIE that may be sensitive to particulate contamination can benefit from using BlazeTech's dust filter.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The dust filter technology can also be extended to other applications where filtration without significant use of manpower is a priority.  Examples include: (1) filtration of sand from gas streams that enter the engine compartments in helicopters and aircraft especially in desert conditions like in Iraq and Afghanistan extending their life, (2) separation of fine particulate contaminants from emissions from chemical process industry and smoke stacks in power plants, and (3) cleanup of particulate contaminants (bacteria, dust, etc.) from air conditioning system in aircraft.  We have collaborated extensively with key players in both areas over the years and we will reach out to them in Phase II to seek their input in extending our technologies to their applications.

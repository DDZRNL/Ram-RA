		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In Situ Resource Utilization(ISRU) is a key technology required to enable missions to the Moon and Mars. The Martian atmosphere consists of 95% carbon dioxide which can be used in (ISRU) processes to synthesize propellant and life support consumables. Reactive Innovation proposes to develop a lightweight electrochemical reactor to collect and pressurize CO2 from the Martian atmosphere. The Phase I successfully demonstrated collection and pressurization of CO2 from pure and dilute gas streams.   In the proposed Phase II program, we will continue to optimize components and scale up the technology to meet the needs of NASA's ISRU processing applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology has significant NASA applications in ISRU processing on Mars, where carbon dioxide is a plentiful resource and can be processed to make propellants and oxygen. Other NASA applications include air revitalization.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to NASA, this technology will have significant terrestrial-based applications. The  market for collecting and separating carbon dioxide from other gases is expected to grow with continued interest and emphasis on reducing CO2 emissions.

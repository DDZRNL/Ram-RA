		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to build and commercialize a working prototype Geospatial Decision Support Toolkit (GeoKit). GeoKit will enable scientists, agencies, and stakeholders to create and deploy their own web based applications containing maps, forms, algorithms, and a rich set of functionality related to visualization, analysis, reporting, querying, and publication of geospatial data and information. GeoKit is intended for customers who are experts in a particular area or problem; have in mind a set of users who will use their site to address a specific problem; have in mind a particular workflow that they want the users to perform and datasets they want to utilize; do not necessarily know or want to know about geospatial data types, formats, operations, and structure; and do not necessarily know or want to know how to construct a web-based application. The mission of GeoKit is to reduce and eventually remove technical barriers that limit direct stakeholder control over the creation and management of geospatially enabled web applications. AGS has worked on numerous geospatial web based applications and services, and continues to have active projects in this area. Our Phase II GeoKit proposal is to create the technological foundation for the distributed "open source DST development framework" that NASA envisions as described in the 2015 Subtopic S5.02 SBIR solicitation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed innovation (GeoKit) will be especially applicable in service of NASA needs and objectives. First, NASA scientists involved in building decision support tools on top of data dissemination activities would be primary potential customers. Second, future proposal applicants working in areas of research, or applications development could be encouraged to make their data and applications available using NASA's GeoKit application. Applied Geosolutions could partner with or be contracted to develop enhancements or interfaces to new data types, if needed.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications for GeoKit will reach broadly into a number of different stakeholder communities. In the area of environmental resource management, tools could be constructed that make the job of monitoring the state of the agro-ecosystems, forests, or aquatic habitats streamlined and tailored to the needs of the specific agency or regional office. Researchers in academia and in commercial R&D could have a greater access to NASA data combined with data from other sources, with custom rule-based algorithms and visualization tools.

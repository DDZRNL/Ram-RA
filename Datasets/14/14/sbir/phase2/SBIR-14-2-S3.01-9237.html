		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In the proposed Phase II project, MicroLink and its collaborator, Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), will incorporate quantum dots (QDs) in the GaAs and InGaAs subcells of an InGaP/GaAs/InGaAs triple-junction solar cell to increase the radiation tolerance and thereby improve the end-of-life performance of the solar cell by >5%. The quantum dot solar cell will be grown in an inverted metamorphic (IMM) format on GaAs and will be compatible with MicroLink's epitaxial lift-off (ELO) process.  The resulting solar cells will be lightweight, flexible, and radiation tolerant.  Mechanically, they will resemble a sheet of thin metal foil.  Innovative light management techniques such as reflective metal back contact and silver nanoparticle-enhanced reflectivity will be employed to increase absorption in the solar cell
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The improved radiation tolerance and temperature coefficients will open the design space for NASA-specific missions such as low intensity missions to the Jupiter system or high intensity probes near Mercury and the Sun. Solar panels made up of QD embedded triple junction ELO solar cells makes them lighter and high specific power will make them suitable for high power solar panel requirements for solar electric propulsion (SEP) applications. Also the cost reduction factors such as substrate reuse of ELO solar cells make them more attractive for high power panel applications.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA applications include, commercial and military satellite power systems, Electric unmanned aerial vehicle endurance enhancement and Mobile electric solar power and recharging. In the commercial market, these cells can be used for concentrator CPV applications as ELO brings in added advantage of lower cost and better heat dissipation properties

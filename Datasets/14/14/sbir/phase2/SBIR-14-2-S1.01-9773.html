		echnical Abstract:<BR>IThis Phase II SBIR program will build on successful Phase I work to provide Technology Readiness Level 4 (TRL-4) laboratory brassboard  demonstration of laser sources and non-linear wavelength converters with significant improvements in efficiency and reduction in size, weight, and power consumption compared to systems currently available for space-based instruments planned for the coming 10 to 15 years. This new-generation technology is needed to reduce the size and weight of flight hardware to make it compatible with affordable, more capable satellite payloads. In particular we propose to demonstrate a novel laser transmitter architecture capable of providing a factor of two to three higher average power, pulse energy, and efficiency than laser systems flown on first-generation space-based active remote sensing systems.   Our proposed  program also includes brassboard demonstration of a highly-efficient wavelength conversion to the blue spectral region (450-500 nm) desired for oceanographic lidar sensors, of interest both for ACE and nearer-term Earth Venture missions.

		<BR>
		State-of-the-art compact laser transmitters for atmospheric and ocean lidar systems. This program will provide laser technology that is commercially unavailable to NASA.  Efficient, compact lasers at high TRL will enable the development of highly desired instruments for measurement of atmospheric and ocean scattering at the critical air-sea interface in support of atmospheric modeling and climatology. <BR>Transition to space-based sensors supported by Earth Venture class and Decadal Study missions. Early development of airborne demonstration systems is a critical step in technology maturation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Within the U.S. Navy, the principal end-technology application is for advanced lidar systems requiring blue laser output for underwater detection systems for ocean-type water, where blue wavelengths provide significantly greater penetration. The proposed laser system also produces green output at 532 nm, which is suited to applications in shallower coastal waters (for example, shallow-water mine detection and bottom mapping). The high efficiency and low SWaP of the new laser design makes it a candidate for replacing heavier, less efficient laser transmitters on underwater lidar systems based on UAV platforms.

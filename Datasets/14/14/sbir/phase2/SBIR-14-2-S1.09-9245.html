		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase II SBIR will seek to develop a prototype laser source suitable for atomic interferometry from compact, robust, integrated components.  AdvR's design is enabled by capitalizing on robust, well-commercialized, low-noise telecom components with high reliability and declining costs which will help to drive the widespread deployment of this system.  The key innovation is the combination of current telecom-based fiber laser and modulator technology with periodically-poled waveguide technology to produce tunable laser light at rubidium D1 and D2 wavelengths (and expandable to other alkalis) using second harmonic generation (SHG).  With this technology, multiple channels can be independently tuned to produce the fields needed for addressing atomic states in atom interferometers and clocks.  In addition, this technology could be useful in the development cold-atom inertial sensors and gyroscopes.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Several NASA applications include the use of a frequency doubler module to generate fixed or tunable radiation from the visible to near IR.  Poled materials offer a wider array of functionality including robust, multi-element platforms for combining tasks like frequency conversion and modulation without losing power due to additional components.  The primary beneficiary of the proposed system is NASA's GSFC team working on atom interferometry.  Atom-based inertial sensing and free space communications are other exciting new technologies that could benefit from highly efficient frequency conversion devices in this wavelength range.  Remote sensing missions like ACE that require such platforms will also benefit.  AdvR will maintain communications with these NASA groups during this Phase I effort to stay current with the present needs and remain flexible towards meeting specific application needs as technology progresses.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Nonlinear poled materials play an increasingly important role in photonics applications that may be in nonstandard wavelength regions, some of which include microwave photonics, up conversion, infrared detection, IR generation, and bio-photonics.  In addition to its use with NASA's nonlinear optical material based photonic applications, the technology will be of use for military applications, sensing and environmental monitoring, and basic research.  Additional markets that can utilize compact, rugged, highly efficient, wavelength conversion modules are free-space telecommunications, remote sensing, precision spectroscopy, interferometry, and frequency metrology.

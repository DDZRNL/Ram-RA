		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Peregrine will bring together recent laboratory developments and mature the technology so that complete mirror and telescope assemblies can be reliably and robustly produced.  This proposed innovation will lower the cost of space mirrors from their current state of the art of $6.4 M/m2 to less than $1.6 M/m2 while maintaining low weight, high stiffness and high performance for x-ray, neutron and UV/optical mirrors.  The basis of this approach relies upon Be-38Al (a lower cost beryllium) to create a substrate, the use of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) matching phosphorous containing electroless nickel plating (NiP) to establish an amorphous surface, and then single point diamond turning (SPDT) that surface to a precision optical figure out to the edge of the substrate.  Be-38Al provides a substrate material that can provide the same stiffness as beryllium because it is not limited by its fracture sensitivity like beryllium.  Electroless nickel applied to Be-38Al with the right phosphorous content can match the Be-38Al's CTE, and the use of diamond turning can readily produce optical surfaces that can be used as is or with final polishing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential uses, first and most obvious are for the applications currently under consideration for NASA large optical systems. That in and of itself will be a substantial technological success that will enable the advancement of the current state of the art of this innovative material system. In addition, this technology will be adaptable to other satellite programs like:<BR><BR>-Astrophysics applications that require large aperture, lightweight and highly reflective mirrors that can operate down to cryogenic temperatures.<BR>-Lightweight x-ray imaging mirrors for future large advanced x-ray observatories. <BR>-Could enhance programs like AFTA/WFIRST, JUICE, ASTRO, EVI and possibly Euclid.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This advanced material system as it applies to mirrors for both UV/optical and x-ray optics can be applied to many research and development applications here on earth. Fast scan mirrors and surveillance systems rely upon low density, high stiffness and high performance optics. This material system can provide solutions. In addition, commercial and military optical systems, particularly Earth observation satellites like Google Earth and other systems could benefit from this technology.

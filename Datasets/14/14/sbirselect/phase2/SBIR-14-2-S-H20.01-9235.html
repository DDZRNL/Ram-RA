		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		CHI Systems and the Institute for Human Machine Cognition have teamed to create a human-robot interaction system that leverages cognitive representations of shared context as a basis for a fundamentally new approach to human-robotic interaction. This approach centers on a framework for representing context, and for using context to enable robot adaptive decision-making and behavior. The framework is called CARIL (the Context-Augmented Robotic Interaction Layer).  Context is an important part of human-human interaction.  Unfortunately, context is often overlooked when designing robotic systems.  The challenge is to translate high-level concepts, such as teamwork and collaboration, into specific requirements that can be implemented within control algorithms, interface elements, and behaviors.  During Phase I, CHI Systems developed a proof-of-concept CARIL implementation and applied it to a notional simulated robot in a simple station model.  This simulation demonstrated CARIL's feasibility by demonstrating how it gave the simulated robot a capability to reason about its context to avoid spatial interference with astronaut activities and tasks.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		CARIL allows a robot to have "action compliance" &#150; an ability to adapt its behavior to that of human astronauts around it, by using a human-like model of context.  Action Compliance, the behavioral analog of physical-interaction force compliance concept, is an enabling capability.  Its post-applications are to the Robonaut-2 program at Johnson Space Center, the Free-flying robot (SPHERES) program at Ames Research Center, and as an embeddable, enabling technology, to all future robotic or robotic programs or future missions requiring robots or robotic vehicles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Military Robot and Uninhabited Robot Vehicles (URV) Markets &#150; provide increased robotic autonomy and enhanced human-robotic control to military URV applications.<BR><BR>Civil/Commercial Robot and Uninhabited Robot Vehicles (URV) Markets &#150; provide increased human-robot collaboration and adaptive behaviors to business whose future strategy relies on the use of robots and drones to optimize manufacturing, supply-chain and distribution processes.

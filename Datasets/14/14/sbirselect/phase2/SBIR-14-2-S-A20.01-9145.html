		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's Air Traffic Management (ATM) research has produced many important, advanced decision support tools (DSTs) over the past three decades. A key challenge in the design and use of ATM DSTs is to determine how much control should be applied to the flow of traffic and at what point in the flow the control should be applied. This question can be addressed both during the initial operational ATM planning process, as well as during dynamic operations re-planning. This challenge has significant impact on the resulting effectiveness of any ATM control program that is applied, because inefficiencies can be caused by either under or over-control of the flow. Unfortunately, comprehensive DSTs don't exist for many ATM decisions that must be made, and most DSTs that do exist do not provide any guidance regarding when the control should be applied, nor do they quantify the potential risk associated with the timing of control application. An integrated decision support capability is needed to provide ATM specialists and flight operators with information to support planning and decision-making about tactical and strategic TMIs. The significant challenge that exists in providing this decision support capability is the uncertainty of prediction of both demand and capacity.<BR>The work that has been conducted in this Phase I SBIR effort, and that is proposed for continuation in Phase II, addresses this fundamental research need in ATM automation system design in the context of the integration of Tactical Departure Scheduling (TDS) with Traffic Flow Management (TFM). During Phase I, we designed, tested and conducted initial validation on mathematical and simulation models that characterize and quantify the relationship between IADS capabilities and other TMIs. These models provide guidance and input for further NASA research efforts and activities, and they will also provide real-time operational decision support for Traffic Management Coordinators (TMCs) and other ATC specialists.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		As this innovative concept is directly related to the air transportation system, the most appropriate application of the concept and prototype will be further research on ATM operational improvements. This concept for the integration of strategic and tactical Traffic Management Initiatives can be applied by NASA across many concepts and technologies to enhance their integration within the Traffic Flow Management procedures and tools in the National Airspace System. Mosaic ATM has provided significant support on numerous projects in the successful transfer of NASA research into the operational inventory of the FAA. Our approach to this technology transfer is to provide support for the transfer process, but to remain within the direction of NASA and the FAA at all times. Using this approach, the research is properly recognized as NASA technology, and the FAA receives in-depth support from an organization that already knows the details of the technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NAS Flow Constraint Monitor concept described in this proposal can provide valuable information for airlines and other flight operators about the potential constraints and congestion that flights will experience in the NAS based on traffic management initiatives. Flight operators can then use this information to plan for potential delays or reroutes and their effect on their overall network of flight operations. Advance notice of potential delays can aid dispatchers in planning what routes to file, which alternative arrival airports to utilize, and how much fuel to load on the aircraft. Within this Phase II proposal, we have included a license application to use the Future ATM Concept Evaluation Tool (FACET), which is NASA Intellectual Property. Our commercialization approach leverages FACET as a platform for providing situational awareness and planning capabilities for airlines. Multiple airline customers that have adopted technology that originated from NASA have selected Mosaic to provide contract-funded support for these technologies. Thus, Mosaic ATM is in an excellent position to continue to commercialize NASA technologies through a licensing agreement as described in the proposal.

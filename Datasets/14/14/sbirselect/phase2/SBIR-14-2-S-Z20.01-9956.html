		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this NASA SBIR-select Phase 2 program Fibertek will develop, test and validate a high-fidelity 1U CubeSat Lasercom Optical Terminal prototype, optimized for deep-space optical communication, and targeting the following characteristics &#150; <BR>(i) Low Size/Weight/Power (SWaP) 1U Lasercom Terminal for deep-space mission (total power budget P<10W is targeted), <BR>(ii) Athermalized optical design of a fiber-coupled laser transmitter to innovative optical telescope for lasercom transmit/receive function, <BR>(iii) quasi-monolithic design and fabrication of the optical assembly with large 65 mm aperture, <BR>(iv) integrated beam point-ahead and beam-pointing stabilization capability, <BR>(v) integrated radiation-tolerant controller card for all control and interface functions for this 1U CubeSat terminal, <BR>(vi) Low power radiation-tolerant FPGA based electronics design, for a reconfigurable and highly capable processing platform, and <BR>(vii) compatible with a CubeSat bus interface with the appropriate ADCS system.<BR><BR>The prototype optical terminal will be tested and characterized in a lab environment, for optical signal sensitivity levels, acquisition field-of-view requirements, and very low jitter pointing stabilization, representative of the requirements for deep-space optical communication link.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		(1) 1U CubeSat lasercom optical terminal for deep-space and inter-planetary missions <BR>(2) Compact, efficient space lasercom optical terminal for LEO/GEO platforms <BR>(3) Optical terminal design can be adapted for active remote-sensing of planetary atmospheres. <BR>(4) Optical terminal can be used for lidar based entry-descent & landing, as all needed functionalities - laser transmit/receive, processing, and optical telescope are already available <BR>(5) Compact and cost-effective optical terminal for potential imaging applications from CubeSat or SmallSat platforms
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		(1) Compact, efficient LEO-GEO space lasercom optical terminal for DoD applications, e.g. AF, NRO <BR>(2) Compact, efficient lasercom optical terminal for UAV to satellite applications <BR>(3) Can be adapted for any optical terminal (Transmit/Receive) needs for a SmallSat platform on hosted payloads.

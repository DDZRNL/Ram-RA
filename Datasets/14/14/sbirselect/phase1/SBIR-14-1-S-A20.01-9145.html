		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In the ATM Select topic area of Integrated Arrival, Departure and Surface (IADS) planning, this proposal addresses Tactical Departure Scheduling (TDS), which is a commonly used procedure in the NAS. It is estimated that approximately 60,000 flights each month are subject to tactical delays via TDS, which is approximately 3.5 times the number of flights that are impacted by strategic Traffic Management Initiatives (TMIs).  Despite recent advances in tactical departure scheduling like that demonstrated in NASA's Precision Departure Release Capability (PDRC), little is currently known about the overall effect on the NAS when implementing tactical events.  In fact, today no comprehensive guidance exists for FAA personnel to determine which TMI to use for a particular traffic problem, the duration of that TMI and the recommended control parameters. <BR>An integrated decision support capability is needed to provide ATM specialists and flight operators with information to support planning and decision-making about tactical and strategic TMIs. The significant challenge that exists in providing this decision support capability is the uncertainty of prediction of both demand and capacity.<BR>To address this current shortfall of the National Airspace System (NAS), Mosaic ATM proposes to conducted detailed research on the interrelationship between IADS scheduling and metering capabilities and other TMIs. The output of this research will be both mathematical and simulation models that characterize and quantify the relationship between IADS capabilities and other TMIs. These models will provide guidance and input for further NASA research efforts and activities, and they will also provide real-time operational decision support for Traffic Management Coordinators (TMCs) and other ATC specialists.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		As this innovative concept is directly related to the air transportation system, the most appropriate application of the concept and prototype will be further research on ATM operational improvements. This concept for the integration of strategic and tactical Traffic Management Initiatives can be applied by NASA across many concepts and technologies to enhance their integration within the Traffic Flow Management procedures and tools in the National Airspace System. Mosaic ATM has provided significant support on numerous projects in the successful transfer of NASA research into the operational inventory of the FAA. Our approach to this technology transfer is to provide support for the transfer process, but to remain within the direction of NASA and the FAA at all times. Using this approach, the research is properly recognized as NASA technology, and the FAA receives in-depth support from an organization that already knows the details of the technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The system impact assessment concept described in this proposal can provide valuable information for airlines and other flight operators about the potential constraints and congestion that flights will experience in the NAS based on traffic management initiatives that are implemented. Flight operators can then use this information to plan for potential delays or reroutes and their effect on their overall network of flight operations. Advance notice of potential delays can aid dispatchers in planning what routes to file, which alternative arrival airports to utilize, and how much fuel to load on the aircraft.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		IFOS proposes to design and build fiber-optically sensorized robotic fingers that can sense force and, objects using only tactile feedback, similar to the skin on a human hand. The innovation, employing fiber optic sensors, will b integrate the highest-density EMI-immune optical sensing for robotic hand systems to enable human-like tactile sensing capabilities.  The innovative high-density manipulative system will add great dexterity to robotic hands and will be fully adaptable to performing complex Extravehicular tasks. In Phase I, IFOS will design a robotic hand and fingers system, focusing on the skin and muscle hardware requirements for tactile and force feedback information to be relayed to a central processor, which will then identify objects based on tactile feedback and provide a full haptic sense.  A proof-of concept experiments planned for Phase I will demonstrate gripping and grasping using a sub-scale sensorized set of fingers. Results will be used as input for prototype planned for Phase II, along with preliminary test and evaluation recommendations for potential insertion into an advanced Robonaut servicer.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		If a single basic transducer technology (such as FBGs) can be adapted to multiple sensory modalities, the problems of sensing, wiring, weight, size, instrumentation and signal processing will be reduced and system reliability will improve. Space exploration, including future missions to Mars, will greatly benefit from robotic sensing technologies. High-dexterity robots will enable remote operation in high risk or inaccessible areas, such as encountered in long space voyages and hazardous exploration. In other applications, human-safe manipulators will collaborate with operators and astronauts to enhance performance and to reduce fatigue. This project will assist NASA in its goal to achieve safe and responsive robotic manipulators designed to have the dexterity of a space-suited astronaut capable of operating tools and performing extra-vehicular activities (EVAs), particularly repairs, on spacecraft.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Multiple commercial applications exist for the transformational robot sensory capabilities proposed here. Market sectors benefiting from the proposed innovation include the military, energy, mining, construction, search & rescue, manufacturing and medicine.  In most applications, robots with haptic capabilities can perform (a) dexterous tasks in environments dangerous or inaccessible to humans, such as encountered in the handling nuclear or bio-hazardous materials, (b) highly skilled operations for which human operators may require enhanced capabilities, e.g., robotic tele-surgery. According to IFR, the national robot associations and UNECE, there are approximately 1 million robots in use worldwide with over 100,000 units sold annually across several industries.  Meanwhile, BCC Research estimates a $700M market in medical robotics, with a compounded annual growth rate of 18% to 2014, with 60% by surgical robots. IFOS has established partnerships with medical robotics pioneers and progress has been made towards demonstrating the promise of the IFOS technology in medical robotics.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Innoflight proposes developing a 0.5U Deep Space Cubesat Regenerative-ranging Transponder (DeSCReeT) compatible with NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) and similarly capable ground assets and with flight-ready units available for CubeSats deployed in cis-lunar space via the Exploratory Mission 1 (EM1) program. The transponder will leverage Innoflight's flight-heritage Software-defined Compact Radio (SCR) family of radios.<BR><BR>Phase 1 design efforts include requirements gathering from Pre-Phase A and Phase A CubeSat missions, Forward Error Correction trades, X-Band versus S-Band trades, and radiation-tolerant component trades. Given the EM-1 timeline, the Phase 1 effort will successfully complete a CDR-level design by the end of the period of performance.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		DeSCReeT will have significant opportunities across a number of different applications because of the breadth of its capabilities beyond the state of the art.  We have captured just a few of its personalities and associated applications below:<BR><BR>? Low-Power Deep Space Ranging Transponder.  The application is not limited to CubeSats and it could become the de facto transponder for deep space missions.<BR><BR>? X-Band Transmitter.  With the trend to increasing payload data in more capable CubeSats and SmallSats, an X-Band Transmitter is increasing in demand.<BR><BR>? Higher-orbit CubeSat Transponder.  Mission designers are looking at workhorse-applications for CubeSat and SmallSat at orbits beyond LEO.<BR><BR>Innoflight's strategy is to work directly with AES on existing, planned and potential SmallSat deep space mission requirements to produce an affordable CubeSat form factor Deep Space Transponder.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Ever since our 2012 success of qualifying a s/w-defined CubeSat S-Band radio, spacecraft and payload system primes have contacted Innoflight about a similar SWaP ranging transponder and/or X-Band transmitter capability for payloads generating higher data rates.  Besides NASA, the interested customers have been both DoD and commercial, e.g., looking into early surveying /seismology for asteroid mining.  Based on its SWaP and a corresponding much lower price point, DeSCReeT will offer something not currently available in the market for Deep Space and more severe earth orbit applications.

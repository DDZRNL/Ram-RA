		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A spaceborne radar system that operates simultaneously at multiple frequency bands from microwave through millimeter-wave frequencies can exploit the largely varying frequency response of electromagnetic radiation to various atmospheric conditions, thus forming a highly-capable remote sensing system for NASA earth science objectives such as cloud and precipitation monitoring. We propose the development of an electrically scanned, co-located Ku/Ka-band (13.4/35.6 GHz) linear array in the Nuvotronics PolyStrata&#174; technology for integration with an electrically scanned W-band (94 GHz) linear array to form the feed for a three-band remote sensing system. The PolyStrata&#174; wafer-scale microfabrication process, with the capability to monolithically integrate dielectric-free antenna arrays with ultra-low-loss air-coax feed networks in three-dimensions, will be a key enabler of achieving the state-of-the art performance requirements for front-end losses at the desired operating frequencies as well as the desired scalability to 2-3 meters. Unprecedented transmit efficiencies and power levels will be achieved by leveraging Nuvotronics' history of developing Gallium Nitride (GaN) power amplifiers and low-loss switches at similar frequencies.  A prototype hardware demonstration of the co-located Ku/Ka-band antenna array fabricated in the PolyStrata&#174; process will be provided.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Nuvotronics proposed solution applies to several NASA earth science missions including: the Global Cloud and Precipitation Mission (GCPM), Aerosol/Cloud/Ecosystems (ACE) mission, and the Snow and Cold Land Processes (SCLP) mission.  Additionally, this state-of-the-art electrically scanned millimeter-wave array technology has applications in planetary landing radars such as what is used for the  Mars Science Laboratory mission.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Military applications include: active denial directive energy systems and millimeter-wave radar systems for: degraded visual environments, actively guided missile seeker technology, and unmanned aerial system collision avoidance.  Non-military, commercialization opportunities for this technology include: point-to-point datalinks and homeland security systems.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Cubesats require highly compact technologies to maximize their effectiveness.  As cubesats are expected to be low-cost and, relative to the space industry, mass produced, their technologies should be simple to manufacture, yet achieve aerospace quality standards.  This proposal aims to describe a novel high-efficiency (i.e., comparable to solar panels) fabricated power supply for cubesats and other small satellites that has marked advantages over solar photovoltaic cells.<BR>Nanohmics Inc. proposes to develop and test a compact, high efficiency solar thermoelectric generator.  The technology is amenable to mass manufacturing and is based on recent development successes at Nanohmics: thermoelectrics development and coatings to maximize emissivity.  On a space vehicle, the energy generator would be deployable in a number of ways including a folding fan-like unpacking or other compact designs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A low-cost alternative to solar panels could enable long-term operations for cubesats and cubesat constellations.  As a scalable technology, it could be applied to 1U through 6U cubesats for missions in Earth orbit and beyond.  Due to the lack of a fragile semiconductor junction, the energy generators would be robust to radiation and increased life.  Additionally, the robust architecture would improve ease of handling, packaging, and deployment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Thermoelectric waste heat recovery is a growing industry.  A low-cost manufacturing solution for thermoelectrics, even at moderate efficiency, would allow regeneration of substantial power from parasitic heat losses in industrial and commercial systems.

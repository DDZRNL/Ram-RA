		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Improved hyperspectral imaging technologies could enable lower-cost analysis for planetary science including atmospheric studies, mineralogical investigations, and geological mapping.  Traditionally, multispectral imaging (beyond RGB) requires numerous optical filters, complex spectroscopic instrumentation, or massive systems.  A compact system that enables real-time hyperspectral imaging or long-term averaging without moving parts could revolutionize planetary observation techniques.<BR>Nanohmics, Inc. proposes to develop a novel on-chip hyperspectral imaging system for use in planetary missions.  The hyperspectral system can be integrated with existing commercial-off-the-shelf imaging systems, providing an immediate route towards commercialization.  The compactness will enable the technology to be applied in a variety of mission environments ranging from Flagship-class programs to cubesats.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A real-time hyperspectral camera would provide the planetary sciences realm with the ability to record atmospheric phenomena at multiple frequencies simultaneously.  Furthermore, geo-mapping capabilities would be greatly improved.  As an on-chip technology, it would greatly improve the mission base that could support hyperspectral imagers.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This has cross-application in chemical engineering for imaging multi-fluid flow fields with unprecedented simplicity.  Surveillance applications can include improved target identification.  Additional applications can include environmental monitoring efforts, such as discovery of chemical dumping sites through contaminant spectral response.

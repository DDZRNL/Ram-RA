		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The PMWC Flight Demonstrator Payload is a trash dewatering and volume reduction system that uses heat melt compaction to remove nearly 100% of water from trash while significantly reducing the volume. Recent advances have proven that ORBITEC's HEHO-PMWC is a viable technology for producing 16" square tiles for radiation protection. ORBITEC proposes to enhance the current SOA by repackaging all the components developed under prior SBIR efforts for ISS utilization and to create a test protocol for testing of the system on orbit for radiation effectiveness.  The HEHO-PMWC and other Heat Melt Compactor technology has often been tested piecemeal. The proposed system will contain all systems including the primary processing chamber where the tiles are produced, any necessary avionics, and any necessary support equipment, which includes devices for air removal, contaminant and odor scrubbers, water degassers, and water handling.  Plastic tiles output can be placed within the ISS or within the BEAM (ORBITEC has an excellent working relationship with Bigelow Aerospace). Any and all data gathered during on-orbit testing can be used by NASA to create the next generation of heat melt compaction technology for future manned spaceflight.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary NASA application of this technology is for any long-duration human spaceflight mission, including microgravity and planetary surface operations. Besides the primary benefits of the PFDP, which include waste volume reduction and water recovery, secondary benefits include additional health benefits by completely encapsulating the final compacted waste product, ultimately deterring microbial elements from entering the breathable airstream, and the plastic tile byproduct, which is high in polyethylene, can be used as an effective radiation barrier.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		As commercial space travel becomes more prominent, the need for efficient water recovery, volume reduction, and safe atmospheric conditions has become more critical. The PFDP, and similar HMC technology, will be a viable system not only within all NASA space travel vehicles but also in commercial space vehicles as well. <BR><BR>The addition of a system that reduces waste volume, recovers water, and creates a useful byproduct can be a boon for commercial aerospace companies, such as Bigelow Aerospace, trying to reduce overall mission costs.

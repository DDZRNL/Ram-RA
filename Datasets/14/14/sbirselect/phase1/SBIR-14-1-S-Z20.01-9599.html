		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed novel program will use measurements of high-energy photon output from celestial gamma-ray sources to design a new, unique navigation system for a deep space CubeSat demonstration. An integrated CubeSat design will be developed to demonstrate the performance and feasibility of the Gamma-ray source Localization-Induced Navigation and Timing, or "GLINT", technology and software developed under a previous NASA Phase I SBIR. In this past research, our team established the feasibility of using photons from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to provide deep-space vehicles the capability for self-navigation, showing that with key improvements to detector and timing instrumentation, the technique could achieve three-dimensional position accuracies of less than one kilometer. In this proposed research, recent developments in these hardware components will facilitate the design of a high resolution GRB monitor and precise timing circuit board, which, due to their size, weight, and power requirements, are prime candidates for integration into a 6U or smaller CubeSat. The mission proposed will fly two 3U-sized CubeSats equipped with this system, which will use time differenced of arrival measurements from the same observed GRB to determine a relative position solution. The GLINTSAT demonstration mission will measure the performance capabilities of this system. The team will design the mission architecture, including system requirements and components. An advanced photon timing instrument board will be designed, along with an accompanying high-resolution gamma-ray detector. Integration into the 3U CubeSat design will be detailed. Navigation performance will be evaluated using the designs and a prototype laboratory relative timing experiment. An integrated system error budget will be produced and the mission performance will be assessed to establish the feasibility and detail the path to environmental testing and full CubeSat system development for a 2017-timeframe launch.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications consist primarily of support for the autonomy of low-cost CubeSats into deep space, the offset of Deep Space Network workload, dual-use gamma-ray detector technology for both science and navigation use, improved high-energy celestial source analytics and detector technologies, formation flying and asteroid rendezvous, and space weather research and warnings. The GLINTSAT demonstration mission would allow direct feasibility and performance assessments of this technology in enabling self-navigating deep space CubeSats. This will provide NASA load shedding for potentially oversubscribed DSN operations. The advanced detectors and sub-microsecond timing capabilities will also serve to enhance the science capabilities of high-energy photon experiments onboard these vehicles, and eventually extend to the Inter-Planetary Network and Gamma-ray Burst Coordinate Network for burst detection and localization. Additionally, this relative navigation technique could support formation flying spacecraft missions, as well as precise navigation to planetary objects like asteroids. The integration of these systems onboard future CubeSat missions will also provide space weather researchers with a solar system-wide early warning system for solar storms and intense celestial gamma-ray outbursts, allowing notifications for safe harboring of personnel and hardware, monitoring EVA high-energy radiation dosages, or post-burn analysis of data from sensitive instruments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications include lower operations cost for DoD and military deep space ventures, backup relative navigation capabilities for commercial crewed transport, low-cost space-based terrestrial nuclear detonation detection, and terrestrial detectors and dosimeters. The integrated design of the GLINTSAT system could easily support any commercial or military venture far from Earth, without requiring costly communication and telemetry for navigation, and instead would allow these vehicles to navigate, coordinating with measurements from other deep space vehicles both collecting their own measurements, or already in communication with the GCN or IPN. These new cost-efficient sensors would include missions in geosynchronous or supersynchronous orbits, and ventures to the Moon or asteroids. The precision timing of the detector and timing circuit could also greatly enhance the capabilities of ground-based nuclear detonation detection and dosimeters, without the need for site inspections or frequent site monitoring.

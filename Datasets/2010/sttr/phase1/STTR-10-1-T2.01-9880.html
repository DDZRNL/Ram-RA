		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		An all-electric aircraft testbed is proposed to provide a dedicated development environment for the rigorous study and advancement of electrically powered aircraft.  The new testbed aircraft will be developed from an existing conventional airframe and provide a dedicated platform to study, design, and test electrically powered propulsion systems for use in commercial, military, and general aviation vehicles.  The testbed aircraft will allow various electrical propulsion system technologies to be tested to determine performance, reliability, safety, and cost.  These include various battery, fuel cell, super capacitor, and motor technologies.  Additionally, the new aircraft could be used to study energy-harvesting solutions including photovoltaics, vortex energy extraction, and piezoelectrics.  An electric aircraft has several significant advantages over a conventional internal combustion driven aircraft.  These include zero, or near zero emissions, increased reliability and safety with only one moving part, reduced noise and vibration, increased comfort, and reduced maintenance.  RHRC and the University of Illinois propose to develop an all-electric testbed aircraft able to systematically evaluate new and existing technologies, which will make these systems, safe, reliable, and cost effective.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		An advanced aircraft electric propulsion system will have significant potential application across a wide range of NASA aircraft including both manned and unmanned systems.  With two of NASA's primary goals being reduced aircraft emissions and noise, a realizable, efficient, and competitive aircraft electric propulsion system is a highly sought after commodity.  The testbed aircraft will allow NASA personnel to quickly and rigorously evaluate multiple electrical propulsion systems in a cost effective and timely manner.  The advanced technology developed through the testbed aircraft will be highly desirable to both commercial and military customers for both manned and unmanned systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The potential for an advanced electric propulsion aircraft is quite good.  If results from the testbed aircraft show that an all-electric propulsion aircraft can be produced which can compete with a conventionally powered aircraft on both a performance and cost basis, the system will be in extremely high demand.  The systems emissionless, or near emissionless operation will be highly desirable in an increasingly environmentally conscious world where ever more stringent emissions standards are continually being enacted.  The additional benefits of electric propulsion including increased reliability, low maintenance and maintenance costs coupled with low noise and reduced vibration will make the system highly attractive to commercial, military, and general aviation markets for both manned and unmanned systems.

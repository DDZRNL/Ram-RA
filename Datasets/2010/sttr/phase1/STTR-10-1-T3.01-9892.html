		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) together with the University of Connecticut (UCONN) proposes to demonstrate the improved fuel cell catalyst support durability offered by directly incorporating nitrogen functionality into graphitic carbon supports.  In Phase I, PSI will utilize the functionalized carbon support in the construction of single cell fuel cells in order to demonstrate the performance and durability of the support material in the PEM fuel cell environment.  The performance of cells upon accelerated life testing will be characterized and compared with that of cells assembled using commercially available support materials to quantify the benefits offered by the functionalized support.  In Phase II, PSI will work with UCONN to optimize and scale-up the support production processes.  Incorporation of additional functionalities will also be investigated.  Demonstration cells will be constructed and delivered for functional and environmental testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology could be utilized in all primary and regenerative proton exchange membrane fuel cell systems (PEMFCs).  Incorporation in NASA PEMFC systems would enhance the durability of the electrocatalyst-support system extending the system lifetime.  Further, increased interaction with the catalyst may allow for reduced catalyst loadings, reducing total system cost.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The initial market for the proposed technology is military applications requiring a stable, long-life power source.  Military applications of fuel cells range from portable power sources for the foot soldier to undersea vehicle power supplies. The Army and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency have been funding the development of proton exchange membrane fuel cell systems for individual soldiers in the field. Applications for these fuel cell power sources include electronic equipment, micro-climate cooling, digital battlefield sensors, and battery charging.

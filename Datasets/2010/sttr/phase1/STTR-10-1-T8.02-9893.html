		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In Sub-topic T8.02, NASA has identified a need for improved circuit boards to mitigate the hazards of internal electrostatic discharge (IESD) on missions where high energy electrons may lead to internal electrostatic discharge-based failure.  The proposed STTR program will transition polymer technology developed at the Research Institution, the College of William and Mary, to NASA programs and to the private sector through the aegis of the Small Business, International Scientific Technologies, Inc.  The program Technical Objectives include evaluation and selection of nanoparticle, organometallic, and metal-ligand additives compatible with polyimide resins to produce electrically  conductive circuit boards that reduce the effects of  IESD, fabrication of polyimide films incorporating metallic nanostructures to optimize both volume and surface electrical resistivities, and characterization of electrical conductivity, electron beam charging effects, and thermo-mechanical properties of the polyimide resin circuit board materials.  The innovation of the Phase I and Phase II programs is the development of polyimide nanocomposite circuit board materials that are resistant to Internal Electrostatic Discharge.  The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) is 2 at the beginning of Phase I and 4 or higher at the end of Phase I.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed multifunctional polyimide circuit board materials have NASA applications in mitigating Internal Electrostatic Discharge (IESD) in critical electronics in missions, such as the Plymouth Rock Deep Space Asteroid Mission, the Manned Mission to Mars and Outer Planet Flagship Mission (OPFM).  The Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) segment of the OPFM would require a space probe to survive Jupiter's high-energy electron belts.  NASA needs IESD-mitigating circuit boards for the EJSM.  Critical Satellite systems can also benefit from the proposed IESD Mitigating Circuit Boards.  Middle Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites are subject to internal charging that can lead to damage to sensitive electronics.  Protection of Satellite-on-a-Printed Circuit Board (PCBSat) systems will also be one of the outcomes of a successful Phase I and Phase II program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications of the Internal Electrostatic Discharge (IESD) mitigating circuit board are found in both commercial terrestrial and aerospace electronics applications.  The printed circuit boards will extend the lifetime of computers, telephones and sensors subject to electrostatic discharge (ESD).  The proposed nanocomposite polymer materials will find direct application in the prevention of charging by static electricity.  Anti-static packaging having good mechanical and thermal properties will meet needs for electronic component enclosures.  Additional non-NASA applications may be found in the development of flexible and transparent electronics.  The STTR program will result in a technology base of design, process and testing knowledge that will enable ready transition from research into a product-production mode through interactions with suppliers of anti-ESD equipment and with aerospace companies.

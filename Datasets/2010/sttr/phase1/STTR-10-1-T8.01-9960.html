		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<BR>Protection of critical electronic systems in spacecraft and satellites is imperative for NASA's future missions to high-energy, outer-planet environments. The objective of this project is to develop flexible, transparent, and removable conformal coatings to protect delicate, mission-critical electronic components from electrostatic discharge damage. In collaboration with our partners, InnoSense LLC (ISL) proposes to develop a Transparent Conformal Conductive Coating that will meet the needs of NASA's space programs. The transparent conformal coatings will consist of a flexible and low-water-absorbing polymer matrix blended with conductive polymers. Phase I tasks focus on (1) preparing conductive polymers and conformal coating formulations, (2) developing coating and curing processes, and (3) testing conformal coatings with respect to adhesion, UV resistance, offgassing, resistivity, charge dissipation, ease of removal, and resistance to temperature cycling and vacuum.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		<BR>NASA's vision for the future focuses on missions beyond Earth's orbit to Mars and throughout the solar system. This vision will involve long-duration missions to environments with high radiation. Highly charged particles penetrate spacecraft and satellites and can do considerable electrostatic discharge damage to electronics. Electrostatic discharge will also be a problem in any long-term colonies engaged in lunar or other non-Earth mining activities. ISL's coatings will reduce the risk of damage by dissipating charge on the surface of electronic circuit boards in a controlled manner. The conformal coating will be applied by a standard industrial method such as brush painting or spray coating. The coatings will have low outgassing and low water absorption. In addition, our coatings will be transparent for visual inspection and thermoplastic for removal when necessary. <BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		<BR>Damaging electrostatic charge accumulation and discharge is a grave issue in many industries including electronics, aerospace, transportation, and defense. ISL's coatings can be incorporated in printed circuit boards of sensitive electronic devices used in many industrial and commercial fields. These materials have applications in the protection of complex electronic-based products such aircraft, missiles, nuclear power plants, supertankers, and motor vehicles. They can also be used for static dissipation in the oil refinery industry, explosive environments, dust control, flexible displays, EMI shields, and industrial worker uniforms.<BR><BR>

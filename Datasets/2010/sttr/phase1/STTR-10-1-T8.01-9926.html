		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The space environment poses significant challenges to spacecraft electronics in the form of electrostatic discharge (ESD) as a result of exposure to highly charged radiation belts.  The NASA Europa Jupiter System Mission environment, for example, exhibits radiation levels seven times greater than Earth's geostationary orbit.  In addition to the Jovian environment, highly charged environments can also exist at geosynchronous and medium Earth orbits owing to solar winds/storms and trapped radiation belts.  Such environments can wreak ESD havoc on unprotected critical spacecraft components inside the spacecraft bus.  While existing conformal coatings serve their purpose of insulating and protecting electronics from environmental effects, they do not exhibit ESD mitigation qualities.  No solution currently exists to provide both electronic environmental protection, optical transparency for component inspection, and charge dissipation characteristics in one coating system. To address this need, Luna, in partnership with The Aerospace Corporation, proposes to modify industry standard and space-qualified conformal coatings by dispersing transparent and conductive nanoparticles within them to impart electrical conductivity levels sufficient for charge dissipation and increased radiation hardening capability. The proposed coating system will provide the appropriate performance properties of both common conformal coating protection and radiation hardening through ESD mitigation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		If Luna's approach is successful, a new electrically conductive conformal coating suitable for enhanced radiation hardening will be available that offers multifunctional performance for spacecraft applications.  The resultant technology will be applicable to a wide range of NASA satellites, orbiting probes, and or planetary surface rovers that require enhanced ESD protection not afforded by existing conformal coatings.  The most likely flagship platform will be the Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO) as part of the NASA Europa Jupiter System Mission.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The resultant technology will be applicable to a wide range of military and commercial satellites and related applications that require enhanced ESD protection not afforded by existing conformal coatings.  Successful demonstration of the feasibility of using conductive nanoparticles to impart moderate electrical conductivity to commercial, MIL and Space-qualified conformal coatings will help provide spacecraft manufacturers and system integrators a simplified mitigation strategy for optimum spacecraft protection in service.  Other potential uses include ESD sensitive aircraft electronics.

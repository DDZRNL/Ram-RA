		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NanoSonic's Shape Memory Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> (SM-MR) exhibits reconfigurable and recoverable changes in structural and RF properties as it can be mechanically and repeatedly inflated without loss of EMI shielding (-88dB).  In support of NASA's goals for a robust space exploration program, it is anticipated that NanoSonic's lightweight low permeable bladders shall also exhibit long term radiation resistance upon morphing; a property that few, if any, inflatable materials offer.  Typical highly filled or metal evaporated nanocomposites crack upon flexing.  Conformal and compliant SM-MR is based on self-assembled high-z, dense, nanoparticles covalently bound to ultra-low glass transition temperature (as low as -145&#61616;C, 128 Kelvin) elastomeric or shape memory polymers.  NanoSonic and our STTR partner, Colorado State University, have demonstrated that SM-MR is up to 50% lighter in weight and provides greater gamma ray attenuation relative to commercial shielding materials, without emitting harmful secondary radiation under a 137Cs source.  During Phase I, low temperature flexibility, and radiation/micrometeorite (lunar dust) resistance would be verified under simulated Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR) conditions, using gamma radiation sources and an electron accelerator with uniform beams up to 20 MeV.  TRL9 shall be reached with our space systems partner upon infusion of Thoraeus Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> onto NASA habitats.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Structural, yet compliant, high temperature, radiation resistant Shape Memory-Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> composite materials having unique morphology and multiple controlled electromagnetic properties are possible via NanoSonic's automated spray-on ESA manufacturing approach.  SM-MR adaptive materials represent a new class of robust, stowable  deployable structures for inflatable habitats and spacecraft based on covalently bound shape memory polymers and nanostructured conductive particles.  For this program, SM-MR shall be integrated as a low temperature flexible bladder for Lunar systems, and shielding coatings for exploration vehicles and satellites in LEO, GEO, and HEO.  NanoSonic's SMPs may be combined with our family of nanostructure materials produced in house (noble metals, magnetics, ceramics and quantum dots) for limitless combinations of multifunctional morphing materials for civil and space applications.  SM-MR free standing nanostructured skins offer dual-use commercialization for NASA and civil markets in the electronics, aerospace, automobile and microelectronics markets for the production of conductive, high temperature, rad hard coatings.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Additional applications for SM-MR include ultra-lightweight sensors/actuators for shape changing inflatables, rigidizable/deployable aerospace structures, and as protective coatings against electrostatic charging, radiation, and abrasion.  Low cost, highly EMI/ESD protective skins for aerospace, biomedical and microelectronic components are offered via Shape Memory Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> with metal-like EMI SE up to -88dB under repeated and severe reconfigurations.  Such EMI shielding skins can be envisioned for use on aircraft, morphing unmanned aerial vehicles, antennas and space structures.  Structural, high temperature, composite materials having unique dielectric and multiple controlled electromagnetic properties are possible via NanoSonic's layer-by-layer approach.  Spray ESA is envisioned as a cost-effective, environmentally friendly technology to displace sputtering and traditional dense filled composites.  Metal Rubber<SUP>TM</SUP> Fabrics and films can also function as conducting electrodes for high strain mechanical actuator and sensor devices, and as low-weight, electrically conductive and mechanically flexible coatings for systems requiring physically-robust electromagnetic shielding, ground planes or electrical interconnection.

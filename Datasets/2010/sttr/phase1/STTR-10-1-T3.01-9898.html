		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The objective of this NASA STTR program is to produce ultra-lightweight electrical wire and cable harnesses to reduce the liftoff weight of future space flight vehicles.  In cooperation with materials scientists at Texas A&M, NanoSonic would develop and manufacture ultra-lightweight Metal Rubber- and carbon nanotube-based rubber (CNT Rubber) wire and cables with performance equivalent to that of conventional copper cables but with only 10% the weight.  Wiring harnesses contribute significant weight load to the spacecraft structure.  Ultra-lightweight Metal Rubber and CNT Rubber wires and cables can reduce that weight while offering comparable or superior electrical power and data transmission performance and EMI resistance.  During Phase I, NanoSonic would design, fabricate and test lightweight Metal Rubber and CNT Rubber wire and cable prototypes.  Texas A&M's nanotechnology laboratory would co-develop methods for CNT Rubber production and evaluate resulting material properties.  The conducting core and outer shielding layers would be fabricated by molecular-level self-assembly.  Electrically-conducting cable shielding tape layers would be dimensioned using CAD-driven templating equipment at NanoSonic.  Wire and cable would be manufactured using wire feed, dielectric extrusion and shielding tape winding steps.  NanoSonic is working with a major U.S. cable manufacturer and a major U.S. spacecraft prime contractor on this program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Ultra-lightweight wires, cables and instrumentation harnesses have application on all future NASA spacecraft, research aircraft, and upper altitude instrumentation surveillance missions.  Mechanically flexible Metal Rubber and CNT Rubber wire has potential applications as a replacement of conventional lead-tin solder in electronic assemblies, and as sensors and interconnects in crew diagnostic sensor systems for measurement of EKG, and heart and respiration rate.  Ultra-lightweight sheet forms of Metal Rubber and CNT Rubber materials offer direct replacements for conventional shielding materials for spacecraft systems.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications of Metal Rubber and CNT Rubber materials include 1) EMI resistant and EMC shielding materials for electronic enclosures, 2) direct replacements for conventional solder forming metals in flip-chip bonding systems, 3) highly flexible interconnects in medical prostheses that require high deformation, and 4) in lightweight wires for portable personal electronic equipment.<BR><BR>

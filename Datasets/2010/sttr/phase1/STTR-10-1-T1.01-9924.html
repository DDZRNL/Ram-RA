		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Global Aerospace Corporation (GAC), and its research partner, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (CPSLO), will develop an integrated Small Probe Reentry System (SPRS) for low Earth orbit (LEO) small satellite Earth reentry missions. The SPRS delivers the small probe to a targeted reentry, protects it from the harsh atmospheric reentry environment, slows it down so that it can land without damage to its payload, and announces its position for recovery. This technology will be applicable to very small satellites that could carry 1 kg sample return payload will experience a low-temperature rise and a low deceleration load.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Small satellite missions are an increasing segment of space operations for astrobiology experiments; low-cost, in-space satellite component technology testing; orbital science constellations; and commercial applications. One reason for this growth is that the access to space for small satellites has increased and is expected to expand as commercial companies complete the development of systems to deliver cargo to the International Space Station (ISS) and ancillary payloads to LEO. This expansion of small satellite activities has already resulted in significant interest in self-contained small satellite sample return missions.  SPRS technology responds to the NASA need for low-cost, LEO sample return and reentry experiment capabilities. This innovation could be used for thermal protection system tests, astrobiology experiments, material space exposure investigations and technology demonstrations. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are potential non-NASA applications of the Small Probe Reentry System technology that could be applied to defense, academic and commercial small satellite sample return and reentry experiment missions. Already a number of small satellites are being developed and launched by DARPA, a number of US and international universities and commercial companies. At least one Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) supplier is planning to deliver small commercial self-contained payloads to LEO as an adjunct to International Space Station resupply. As small LEO satellite capabilities expand, there will be a growing interest in small satellite sample return and reentry experiment missions.

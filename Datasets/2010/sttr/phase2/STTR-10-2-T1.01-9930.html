		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In Phase 1, Intelligent Fiber Optic Systems Corporation (IFOS), in collaboration with North Carolina State University, successfully demonstrated a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)-based system for simultaneous, continuous, multipoint temperature measurements at different depths in a representative Thermal Protection System (TPS) material (Super Lightweight Ablator &#150; SLA), with testing performed near its char temperature. Special high-temperature FBG sensors were also developed and tested to 1000¿C with an applied 7 kpsi tensile stress, and with an applied 18 kpsi after cooling to room temperature.  A pure thermal loading calibration of these sensors in this temperature range was performed. The response of the FBG sensors was much faster than that of thermocouples, and all electrical wires were replaced with a single optical fiber.<BR>In Phase 2, IFOS will embed 1000 ¿C-capable optical fiber sensors into a TPS material. Following an appropriate instrumentation development, we will demonstrate temperature profile measurements with a depth resolution of 250-¿m or better. We will also distinguish between temperature- and strain-induced responses in the FBG sensors, a critical consideration for embedded sensor arrays. Our Phase 2 base work plan is designed to advance the TRL to 5, with TRL 6 being obtained in a Phase 2-E program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The TPS-integrated temperature sensing technology will support NASA's goal of developing a more complete understanding of ground test-to-flight traceability issues in small probe TPS applications. Furthermore, this technology has the potential to support NASA's efforts to develop higher performance TPS materials as well as integrated Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) systems.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The work will significantly benefit the development of commercial re-entry vehicles and hypersonic vehicles (engine and airframe). Additionally, this technology could readily lend itself to temperature measurement and monitoring applications in, for example, jet engine and coal power plant gas turbines and furnace heat recovery units (recuperators).

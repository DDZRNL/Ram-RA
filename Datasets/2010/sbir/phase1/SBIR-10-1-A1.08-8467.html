		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Scientific Monitoring, Inc. proposes to develop a robust propulsion control approach to facilitate control law design and simulation-based validation. The proposed approach integrates system identification and robust control design, specifically tailors it to handle large perturbations and model uncertainties affecting engine operations, and provides a framework for successive design optimization through iterations.  The integrated and iterative design methodology will reduce the cycle time in propulsion control design and validation to maintain engine operations in the presence of adverse conditions, such as engine icing, foreign object damage, and high angle of attack. <BR><BR>In Phase I, A proof-of-concept (POC) simulation will be conducted to demonstrate the merit of the robust control approach in the presence of larger than normal variations in the design model. The control design and closed-loop POC will use the NASA-developed C-MAPSS generic engine model as the simulation framework. <BR><BR>The anticipated benefits of the proposed innovation are to reduce design cycle time and increase robustness of the controller design, while optimizing the closed-loop system performance. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications include all engines and aircraft supported by The NASA Aviation Safety Program.  This includes existing and future commercial engines which will be specifically operated to address the Nation's aviation safety challenges of the future. This technology will also support engines and aircraft designed to address the projected increases in air traffic capacity and realize the new capabilities envisioned for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS). <BR><BR>Additionally, this technology has potential application to rocket propulsion control.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The two primary areas of program interest, adaptive systems for in-flight operability and system-level integrated resilient control technologies are applicable to militrary aircraft and engine systems.  Specifically our work will address aircraft engines operating in adverse conditions, such as engine icing, foreign object damage, and high angle of attack. <BR>

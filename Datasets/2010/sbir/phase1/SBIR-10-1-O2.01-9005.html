		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Micro-Space proposes to adapt the High Audio Frequency "Non Radiated Field" (AC Magnetic Field) systems we have been developing for 6 DOF Vehicle Localization and Navigation for use as reliable, Short Range Data Links. The inherent short range of these Dipole Magnetic Fields isolates them from accidental or deliberate Interference, as well as Interception.  Range is more than sufficient to link systems and payloads in a complex rocket.  These magnetic fields are far less attenuated by rocket materials than RF, and lack the deep nulls often present with RF.  In addition they can function with sub milliwatt total power and fractional gram mass. Wireless pre-launch testing and reprogramming is easy, and wireless battery recharge is possible. <BR><BR>In all uses, this system will eliminate many, if not all, of the connectors, particularly those which must have troublesome "Quick Disconnects" capabilities, which reduce reliability of Space Systems, and add mass. <BR><BR>Phase 1 efforts will develop the basic systems and integrate them into a representative, small launch vehicle for full systems tests.  Phase 2 will install the hardware in several complex rocket systems for flight testing to identify special problems which might be revealed in flight operations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA and commercial users will find these systems very valuable whenever small single payloads or payload clusters need to be tested and integrated into a small launch vehicle. The processing efforts are radically reduced with much more reliable results.  The integration can also include propulsion modules and "Strap Ons", which increase the flexibility and cost effectiveness of launch systems.  In this case, that flexibility can be achieved with low engineering and labor costs.

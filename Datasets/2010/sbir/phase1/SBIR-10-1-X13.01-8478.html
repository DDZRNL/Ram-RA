		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Crew behavioral health and performance are of high importance, especially for long duration exploration missions. Early detection of stress and effective options for restoration and enhancement of behavioral health are imperative for accomplishment of mission objectives and for maintaining a productive spaceflight environment. To address the behavioral health issues during exploration missions, the NASA Behavioral Health and Performance Program Element (BHP) is looking for a non-invasive technology that would unobtrusively, and with minimal crew time and effort: monitor physiological markers of stress; offer countermeasures for maintenance and restoration of behavioral health; and identify methods to prevent decrements in behavioral health. The primary goal of this project is the development of a tool to provide Behavioral Monitoring and Evaluation for the Delivery of Interactive Cognitive behavioral therapy (B-MEDIC).  During Phase I we will provide an analysis of measures and technologies for physiologically monitoring, assessing and treating stress; and provide requirements for the technological enhancements necessary to produce B-MEDIC. By the end of Phase II, our multi-disciplinary team proposes to develop a functioning prototype of B-MEDIC to address the following gaps outlined in the BHP Integrated Research Plan (July 2010): BMED1, BMED2, and BMED6. (Phase I TRL: Beginning 1, End 3)

		B-MEDIC will have several applications for the NASA Human Research Program, including the Behavioral Health and Performance Element (BHP) at Johnson Space Center. The tool will provide astronauts with the capability to unobtrusively monitor, assess, and maintain their own behavioral health in the absence of direct support from a clinician or ground control. B-MEDIC will accomplish this goal by addressing the following gaps identified in the BHP Integrated Research Plan (July 2010): BMED1, BMED2, and BMED6. B-MEDIC can also support NASA's partnership with the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI), including the Neurobehavioral and Psychosocial Factors Team's mission to help astronauts deal with stress during the isolation and confinement of a space environment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		B-MEDIC could potentially benefit groups that perform research and operations in space-analog environments.  This group primarily includes the United States Antarctic Program (USAP), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC). B-MEDIC would be an easily deployable tool that researchers, aquanauts, or submariners can use privately in the limited personal space allowed to them. Also, outside of space-analog environments, B-MEDIC could provide adaptive support to users who experience stress due to their daily working conditions, and do not have either the access or desire to seek clinical care.  B-MEDIC could be distributed at the individual level to help people working in extreme environments successfully cope with stress and alleviate or prevent potential performance and/or behavioral decrements.

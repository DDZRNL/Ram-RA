		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Formaldehyde (HCHO) is of great interest to atmospheric scientists in NASA and other research institutions.  In this SBIR project, we propose to build an airborne or ground based, atmospheric formaldehyde (HCHO) profiler implementing Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) techniques.  The instrument will be able to operate under the range of environmental conditions encountered during ground and airborne tests.  In the phase I effort, we will breadboard system and perform a proof of concept HCHO measurement. We will also carry out a comprehensive review of the UV laser systems and identify the optimum laser for the prototype sensor.  The outcome of the Phase I work will establish the feasibility of this LIF technique for high sensitivity detection of HCHO, and provide the design of the prototype sensor.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The HCHO profiler can be easily mounted on an aircraft or deployed ground based, which makes it a suitable candidate for a lot of currently active and future NASA missions for independent measurements or satellite validation.   HCHO is a primary measurement objective in two missions of the Decadal Survey (GEO-CAPE and GACM). The proposed sensor allows profiling of formaldehyde for Earth science research such as, climate science, environmental monitoring and commercial pollution compliance efforts.   With minor adaptations such as using a UV laser at different wavelengths, the sensor can be used to measure fluorescence signal of other chemicals such as NO, NO x , NO2, and OH, etc.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Several government agencies including NASA, EPA, DoE and DoD have identified the need for instruments for formaldehyde detection.  Besides the environmental and industrial application, many other military applications including detection of Chemical warfare Agent (CWA), bio warfare agent (BWA) aerosols, explosives, can make use of the devices developed in this project.

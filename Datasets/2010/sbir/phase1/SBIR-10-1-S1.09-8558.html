		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Aerius Photonics and its partners propose the development of a high resolution, radiation hardened 3-D FLASH Focal Plane Array (FPA), with performance expected to be > 6Mrad total incident dose (TID), and will be able to perform at extremely low temperatures (-230C) without the need for a warm box. This TID performance at cold temperatures is the result of utilizing silicon germanium (SiGe) bipolar technology for the ROIC implementation, and will be the largest SiGe imaging ROIC ever designed and demonstrated. This ROIC will be hybridized with an appropriate selected detector array to produce a FPA of unprecedented TID performance. The TID performance will allow for reduced size, weight, and power (SWaP) for lunar and deep space instruments, thus saving fuel for the mission. The resulting FPA can be utilized in instruments for the Europa-Jupiter System Mission (EJSM), including the near-IR imaging spectrometer, and wide angle, high resolution camera (HRC). It can also be used in flash lidar applications for 3-D mapping to help with hazard avoidance, and for a rover operating during the lunar night in one of the permanently dark polar craters, where optical (passive) cameras could not operate.

		The developed FPA can be utilized in a number of instruments for the Europa-Jupiter System Mission including the near-IR imaging spectrometer, and the high resolution, wide angle camera (HRC). It can also be used for 3-D terrain mapping of the moon. The developed ROIC can also be used in flash lidar applications for a lunar lander (imaging for hazard avoidance during the terminal landing phase), and a rover operating during the lunar night in one of the permanently dark polar craters (looking for the ice), where optical (passive) cameras could not operate. Also lidar gives a 3D terrain map that can be used for autonomous navigation (not awaiting joy-stick instructions from Earth operators).  Flash focal plane arrays are beginning to find wide application in lidars for rendezvous and docking, planetary landers, topographic mapping, and forest imaging.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Aerius has uncovered multiple significant commercial and military markets for the application of the developed technology. Aerius is under contract to develop a low cost, monolithic 3-D FLASH ladar ROIC, with integrated silicon avalanche photo diodes (APDs), for humanitarian applications to assist blind people with obstacle avoidance. An additional large commercial market for this technology is the automotive market for anti-breaking and collision avoidance. Aerius is under contract to develop a 3-D FLASH ROIC for use in laser vibrometer systems to detect improvised explosive devices for military applications. This can also be applied to remote sensing of soldier vital signs. The technology also has commercial and military application in the detection of suicide bombers in the field, at air ports, and in public places.

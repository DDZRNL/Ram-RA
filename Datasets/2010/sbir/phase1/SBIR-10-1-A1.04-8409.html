		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Icing is one of the most significant hazards to aircraft.  There is still much research to be completed with regard to developing remote-sensing technologies for accurately identifying where icing conditions exist in clouds.  There is a need to provide in-situ measurements of cloud liquid water content to validate the remote measurements.  <BR>Anasphere, Inc. proposes to develop a modernized version of the classic vibrating wire cloud liquid water content sensor.  This modernized version will apply updated technology to the measurement, and more importantly will add a droplet sizing capability that the original versions of these sensors lacked.  It will be designed to be compatible with a wide variety of radiosondes.<BR>Phase I will see the development and laboratory testing of the improved probe, its incorporation into a droplet sizing system, and finally actual test flights into clouds.  Phase II work will involve developing more precise calibration methods, improving manufacturability, and extensive test flights.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
			NASA will be able to use the cloud liquid water content sensor to support the development of remote sensing methods for the measurement of cloud liquid water content.  This data will support the development of operational meteorology products as well as fundamental research into icing.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
			Other government agencies and universities engaged in cloud, precipitation, and related research (such as cloud radiative transfer properties) will be able to use the sensor in their research.

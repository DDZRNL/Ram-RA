		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<BR>NASA requires a highly efficient lubrication system for robotic operations, which will withstand very low temperatures (20 K) and other rigors of outer space and planetary surface operations. Building on prior experience in the materials area, InnoSense LLC (ISL) and an experienced consultant will formulate ionic liquid (IL)-based lubricants that will be not only thermally resistant but also compatible with a variety of raw materials for potential NASA-relevant lubricant formulation. Phase I tasks are designed to develop a library of these lubricant formulations by synthesizing and testing according to specified durability metrics. During Phase I, ISL will demonstrate the proof of concept by formulating IL-based lubricants and evaluating physical properties, coefficient of friction, and thermal tolerance. The Phase II project will focus on optimizing a line of IL-based lubricant formulations, fine-tuning physical properties at extreme temperatures, and investigating electrical applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		<BR>Future NASA missions will require robotic systems that operate remotely. These systems will be critical in preparing site infrastructure for surface operations. Current liquid lubricant systems are unsuitable for harsh conditions because of problems such as volatility, deterioration in vacuum, and freeze-up in ultra-low temperatures. In this SBIR project, ISL will meet NASA's need for lubricants for advanced robotic systems and planetary surface assets.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		<BR>The lubricating oil and grease industry keep the wheels of industry well- oiled. This industry segment is expected to produce about 60.5 million barrels of lubricants in 2010. The U.S. uses about two-thirds of this amount. The industry as a whole is expected to generate revenue of about $13.24 billion in 2010. IL-based lubricants promise to meet needs in areas such as low-temperature engineering fluids and specialized automotive and aerospace machinery. Because of their conductive nature, these lubricants have potential for uses in the electronics industry. Large-scale industrial applications such as metal machining and refinement are of significant interest. The products can also be added to conventional mineral lubrication oils to increase wear resistance.

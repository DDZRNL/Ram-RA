		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		An accurate assessment of composite structural performance and proactive component and system life management strategies requires quantitative information on the damage states of the components. Recent advances in infra-red (IR) sensing and data processing technologies have enabled real-time thermoelastic stress analysis (TSA) methodologies to finally become viable for accurate diagnostics and prognostics of composite structures. The success of these thermography methods, however, depends strongly on the characteristics of the surface layer. In this SBIR program Materials Technologies Corporation proposes to design, develop and implement specialized, multi-purpose witness layers for carbon composite structures which would facilitate high accuracy quantitative thermoelastic analysis through improved IR response and thus enable on-going in-situ diagnostics (and prognostics) during component lifecycle without necessitating disassembly and off-line inspection. Phase I program will be based on concept feasibility demonstration through extensive experimental and FE analysis. At the end of Phase II program, samples of developed coating systems will be delivered to the NASA program manager for further evaluation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed system would help NASA in its program for Low-Cost and Reliable Access to Space (LCRATS). It can be used for determining structural integrity of bonded assemblies; and non-intrusive inspection of Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPV), Orion heat shield and painted surfaces. In addition it will facilitate detecting and pinpointing corrosion under painted surfaces; predicting remaining coatings effectiveness/life expectancy; identifying composite defects and evaluating integrity; non-destructive measurement and evaluation of COPV; and damage inspection and acceptance testing of Orion heat shield.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The commercial applications are numerous. Almost all industries from aerospace to automobile, from energy sector to food industry would need NDE inspection systems. <BR>

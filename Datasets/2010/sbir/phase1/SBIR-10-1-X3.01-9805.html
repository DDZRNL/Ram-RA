		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The availability of high-quality potable water is essential in crewed space missions. Closed loop water recycling systems as well as potable water holding tanks and waterlines provide environments for biofilm formation that can facilitate the growth of human pathogens, as well as organisms that can cause deterioration of distribution lines. Prevention requires the maintenance of a chemically stable and biologically effective residual concentration of biocide in water and wetted surfaces of the system. Current disinfection technologies in potable water systems for space applications utilize either iodine or silver biocide. Limitations exist in terms of incompatibility with some disinfection chemistries and surfaces, long-term health risk, rapid biocide depletion, and need for consumable supply and waste disposal. Lynntech proposes to develop an advanced disinfection system for water disinfection and biofilm prevention based on an on-demand biocide generator which does not require consumable chemicals. Excess disinfectant is decomposed on-demand into water and oxygen, representing zero toxicity for crew consumption of potable water. During the Phase I project, the effectiveness of the proposed system for potable water production will be demonstrated. During the Phase II project, an automated system will be developed and delivered to NASA.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The availability of high-quality potable water is essential in crewed space missions. The proposed system will provide an effective biocide for water disinfection and biofilm prevention in potable water systems for space applications. Other NASA applications of this system are in water treatment and reclamation, urine pretreatment, potable and technical water storage, supply of clean water for hydroponic crop systems, and disinfecting water for surfaces within spacecraft, space stations, and future planetary habitats.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications include incorporation into water treatment and supply plants, portable field water treatment units for use during camping, hiking, fishing and outdoor activities and in-home water treatment units. The system also has applications for the production of pyrogen-free water (i.e., sterilized water), such as in the medical industry (e.g., hemodialysis units, irrigation of operating rooms), pharmaceutical industry (intravenous drug delivery) and hydroponics industry. On-demand, on-site generation of the biocide can be used for numerous commercial applications which presently transport hazardous solutions and dilute the disinfectant at the point of use.  Other commercial applications include environmental remediation of ground water and soil, production of high quality potable water, and food and surface sanitation.

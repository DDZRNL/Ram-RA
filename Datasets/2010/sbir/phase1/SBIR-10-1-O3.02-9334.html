		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase I study will design and develop a NanoRacks Control Module (NCM) that provides communications, control functions and data processing in a NanoRacks compatible CubeLab form factor. This standard module is intended to dramatically reduce the development time and cost for an experiment to be flown in a Nanoracks module. Certain aspects of a NanoRacks compatible experiment stay the same regardless of the type of experiment. The proposed NanoRacks Control Module provides communications compatible with the NanoRacks module. This includes methods for preparing data generated in the NanoRacks CubeLab module for download, as well as communications and commands to the NanoRacks CubeLab module. The NanoRacks Control Module is configurable by the user to generate and receive various signal and data types that may be required for the experiment. The NanoRacks Control Module has its own series of sensors that can provide baseline data about the experiment in process, such as vibration and temperature. In addition, the NCM has a battery operating mode that allows for the environment to be monitored before flight and attachment to the NanoRacks frame.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A flight qualified, Commercial Off The Shelf control module designed to operate in a NanoRacks CubeLab module allows the designer of a NanoRacks experiment to focus on the experiment rather than the details of operating inside a CubeLab. This simplifies the process of preparing a NanoRacks experiment and keeps the development time and effort required for a NanoRacks compatible mission to a minimum.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications for the NanoRacks Control Module include experiments that fly on near space and sub-orbital missions. The Module can determine when to come out of extreme low power mode and activate all of the on-board electronics for flight. For low cost flights that are loaded in advance and do not have any human attention, either before or during flight, this mode helps insure success of the mission, regardless of extended launch delays and other unforeseen events.

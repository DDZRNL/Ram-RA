		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this program, APEI, Inc. will build on successful demonstrations of SiC-based wireless transmitter designs in high temperature and high mechanical load environments to develop silicon carbide (SiC) based integrated wireless sensor-transmitter suites for extreme temperature operation in nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) engines. These sensor suites will allow for the realtime monitoring of critical engine components, reducing the risk of catastrophic failure and decreasing the inherent risk associated with NTP operation. Arkansas Power Electronics International, Inc. (APEI, Inc.) will prove the feasibility of the concept and design through the successful demonstration of a prototype SiC wireless sensor suite operating in excess of 450 <SUP>o</SUP>C at the conclusion of Phase I.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed SiC wireless sensor suite can be used not only in NTP rocket engines but also in chemical rocket engines, since a similar extremely harsh environments can be found in these engines (except the high radiation in NTP engine). With proper sensors, the SiC wireless sensor suite can also be applied as a part of telemetry systems in planet exploration such as Mars and Venus, and future space exploration.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The immediate application of the proposed hash environment SiC wireless sensor suite will be the health monitoring of turbine engine for both military and commercial aircraft. The ability to have embedded sensors (in both aircraft and spacecraft) that can detect temperature, strain, vibration, cracks, etc. will provide much needed engine health status as well as prognosis for possible or eminent in-flight failures. This technology will enable nearly continuous on-board situational awareness of the vehicle health state for use by the flight crew, ground crew, and maintenance depot, and contribute to the reduction of aircraft system and component failures and malfunctions that cause and contribute to aircraft accidents and incidents.

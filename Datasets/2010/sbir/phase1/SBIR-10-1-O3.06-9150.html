		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Acoustic survey is now performed using hand-held devices once every two months on the international space station (ISS). It takes quite a lot of precious crew time and the sporadic monitoring program is not adequate. <BR>This Phase I proposal is concerned with developing an automated sound level and noise exposure monitoring system running on a ZigBee-compliant wireless sensor network. In the proposed research, we will focus on <BR>a preliminary design of the monitoring terminal that integrates the functionalities of microphone, data sampling, and signal processing along with data communication through a ZigBee wireless channel. Sufficient compliance of the developed sound level meter and noise dosimeter with the related ANSI standards will be tested and demonstrated. This<BR>plan takes advantage of our broad knowledge in acoustic signal processing and ZigBee wireless sensor network, and will benefit from our experience <BR>and skills with the development of embedded digital signal processing systems using either FPGA (field programmable gate array) or DSP (digital signal processor). The Phase I effort will provide a foundation for prototype design to be conducted in Phase II.

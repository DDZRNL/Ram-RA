		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Exquadrum, Inc. proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of an innovative approach to providing NASA with a Guided Dropsonde (NGD).  NASA's desire to use existing aircraft systems such as the AVAPS aboard NASA/NOAA P-3 aircraft will be met by incorporating existing dropsonde sensors with innovative aerodynamics, deployment structures, and programmable control packages to facilitate more accurate observations in extreme conditions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA/NOAA probes hurricanes and is interested in ash clouds from volcanic eruptions.  This technology would allow greater detailed observations from these and other airborne phenomena that are currently to dangerous to investigate.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Most airsondes are used by non-NASA government agencies (NOAA. DoD, etc). The National Weather service alone currently launches over 200 airsonde balloons a day in the United States and Caribbean. A small simple system to recover some of these sensors intact could lead to reuse and higher quality equipment and data at a lower cost.

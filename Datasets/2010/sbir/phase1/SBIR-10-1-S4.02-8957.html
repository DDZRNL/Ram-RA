		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to demonstrate ultra precision manufacturing of components for NASA payloads, specifically for electro-optical and infrared sensors that are used in Earth, atmosphere, oceans, and planetary missions.  We will integrate the optical and mechanical element and form lighter, more efficient sensor components, capable of replacing traditional multi-element higher weight and more expensive optics.  The ability to take advantage of new manufacturing capabilities including micro and nano fabrication, with surface quality in the sub micrometer, and advanced metrology, allows us to develop more efficient sensor payloads, that will result is smaller, lighter less expensive EO and IR sensor payloads.  We have selected to manufacture one specific optical system for Phase-I that will demonstrate the concept and increase confidence in the process.  In Phase-II we will fabricate additional optical elements.  Together with the Phase-I optical system, these element will be assembled into a complete sensor system and the sensor performance will be characterized and compared with present NASA technology in terms of overall optical efficiency (that affects sensor sensitivity, & SNR performance) as well as size, weight, and cost.  If successful, these optical components can be introduced into future NASA mission planning.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has extensive interest in hyperspectral imaging for airborne (AVIRIS), spaceborne Earth observing (HyspIRI), Lunar (Moon Mineral Mapper) and planetary (Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars) sensors.  Such sensors can take advantage of the performance improvements offered by more compact and high-performance components to be developed under the proposed investigation.  In addition, the technology will support other Earth Science (Airborne, Biosphere, Atmosphere), Space Science (Astrophysics, Planetary), Exploration Technology and Nanotechnology missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		OKSI manufactures and markets the HyperScan family and the 4-Dimensional Imaging Spectrometer, or 4DIS, line of sensors.  These sensors are utilized at various universities, manufacturing, and agriculture and growers firms, as well as other government agencies including DoD, DoE, USDA, NIST.  Producing higher efficiency, lower cost sensors will expand the market penetration of the products.  These sensors are quite expensive and often are limited by low lighting level that produces low SNR.  Similarly the sensitivity, or detection threshold, of the sensors may limit their use.  The proposed manufacturing technology has the ability to improve all aspect of the sensors and therefore increase their applicability within the same markets as they are currently in use, as well as expanding the markets to newer applications.

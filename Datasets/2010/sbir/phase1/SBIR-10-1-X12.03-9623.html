		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase I SBIR proposal describes, "A New Approach to Commercialization of NASA's Human Research Program Technologies." NASA has a powerful research program that is developing cutting-edge technologies for use in the space program, and these technologies can become important in many non-NASA commercial and medical markets. NASA is looking for new ways to increase the number of valuable biomedical devices that are being commercialized. Virtual Incubation Company (VIC) is a technology venture development firm that creates successful new enterprises by focusing on developing early-stage technologies into market-focused products. We currently have 11 portfolio companies ranging from new established companies (at TRL 2) that are seeking first funding to established ventures (at TRL 9) with growing production and sales. Our business development team has proven expertise in executive management, strategy development, financial management, funds acquisition, IP management, legal support, grant writing, market and technical research, and negotiating sublicense and partnering agreements.  This proposal outlines VIC's business development model, demonstrates the breadth of its experience in creating actionable business plans for various stage technologies, and provides examples of product development and company development successes.  Virtual Incubation Company has the experience and expertise necessary to help drive improved commercialization of NASA's Human Research Program Technologies by identifying and validating market opportunities, outlining go-to-market strategies, developing a funding strategy, and minimizing business development risks.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA will benefit directly from improvements to biomedical technologies that will result from commercialization. Much of the emphasis of product development research lies in making technologies more reproducible, hardy and user-friendly which will be of benefit to anyone using these technologies, including research scientists and engineers at NASA. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The potential benefits of commercializing NASA's powerful suite of biomedical technologies in the traditional market are profound. Many of the technologies that are leaving NASA are both cutting-edge and have practical application. The optimized use of these technologies could allow for groundbreaking advances across many medical fields. Virtual Incubation Company is in a unique position to optimize the benefit to both NASA and the traditional market in commercializing NASA's technologies.

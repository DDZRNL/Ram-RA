		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Variable-emittance materials are in high demand for applications ranging from manned and unmanned space platforms (e.g. in radiators at the Moon's poles where damage could be prevented during times of low heat load) to spacecraft thermal control (especially for micro-, nano-spacecraft where no effective thermal control currently exists).  They are superior to technologies such as loop heat pipes, louvers, MEMS systems, electrostatic systems, phase change materials, and others. A key requirement is a high Turn-Down Ratio (TDR, ratio of high/low emittance), up to 10.0, and Delta-emittance, up to 0.55. In ongoing and recent prior work (for Air Force, JPL, NASA), this firm has developed a novel, patented variable emittance skin technology, based on conducting polymers (CPs), microporous membranes and ionic liquids, with proven, space-environment performance. The proposed work will develop this with further, radical innovations including entirely new CPs, to achieve a TDR of ca. 8.0 and possibly up to (from current ca. 3.0), and Delta-emittance of ca. 0.60 (from current ca. 0.50). The more than eight innovations are based on actual, prior experimental data and include  incorporation of new CPs, alteration of the substrates and surfaces, radical increase in doping level, use of new ionic liquid electrolytes with higher conductivity and several others.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology may displace extant, alternative technologies (e.g. those listed in the Abstract) on manned and unmanned space platforms, e.g. those originally planned under NASA's Constellation mission and now to be transitioned to new science missions, and small (micro-, < 20 kg, nano, < 2 kg) as well as large spacecraft. It will also give rise to much greater engineering design flexibility in space platforms as well as spacecraft, potentially opening doors to profound new applications. The potential variable emittance market is estimated at several hundred m^2 per year, with a substantial (> 50%) portion for NASA.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology may not only displace extant technologies for manned and unmanned space platforms and small as well as large spacecraft, as described under NASA applications above, but also give rise to much greater engineering design flexibility in space platforms as well as spacecraft. This may potentially open doors to profound new applications, e.g. in micro-satellites such as the CubeSats which currently have no thermal control means. This would "democratize" space, allowing small and medium businesses to launch their own, dedicated satellites. Other potential applications of this technology include terrestrial, military IR camouflage/stealth which this firm has been pursuing elsewhere, with an estimated market size about 3 X the space market, and building or shelter cover materials for desert climates with high night/day temperature variations, in both commercial and military applications.

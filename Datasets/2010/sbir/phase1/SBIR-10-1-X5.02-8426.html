		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Aluminum based metal matrix composites are particularly attractive in aviation and aerospace applications because of their exceptional strength and stiffness-to-density ratios and superior physical properties.  A vast range of composites have been fabricated with reinforcements such as glass, ceramic particulates and fibers, and more recently carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes present considerable improvement in properties of the composite but suffer from problems of galvanic corrosion at the interfaces. Other nanotubes that are not galvanically detrimental to the composite are required for design of ultrastrong composites.  Boron nanotubes are attractive in this respect, as they are lighter than carbon and are not very far removed from aluminum in the electrochemical series, thus avoiding corrosion issues, while retaining the excellent mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes.  MMI's proposed technology that produces composites comprising boron nanotubes will have the considerable impact on future structural applications of NASA.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA:  Composites that combine low mass with high strength, flexibility, and other mechanical properties will find extensive use in the aerospace industry, mostly in structural applications.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non- NASA:  The civilian aircraft industry, in fact, was the first to introduce lightweight materials (e.g., aluminum alloys) on a widespread scale beginning in the 1920s. Al-BNT composites will be instantly consumed by such industry. Another potential area of application would be electronics packaging.  The semiconducting properties of boron nanotubes will also add to their use in electronics industry.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The innovation proposed for research, and evaluation, and maturation is that of a new class of small Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) with increased payload capability, which may be well suited for use as an aerial payload platform in harsh, remote environments. In specific, the innovation proposed is the use of a hybrid structure in an electric man-portable UAS for scientific use. The fabrication techniques to be investigated in Phase 1 will also lead to a unique and repeatable lean airframe manufacturing process.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In-situ investigations within volcanic plumes  sampling and measuring ash clouds in their native airborne environments  are required to generate boundary conditions and calibration and validation data for models and remote sensing observations. Currently there is a need for improved unmanned aerial sensor platforms for conducting scientific observation in harsh and remote environments such as this.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Within the current and near-term operational constraints for UAS in the national airspace, the platform could perform environmental research and monitoring for other government agencies such as NOAA or the US Forest Service in extreme or remote conditions, including airborne particle imaging, trace gas sampling, and forest fire imaging.

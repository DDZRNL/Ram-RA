		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address NASA's need for applying advanced dynamical theories to space mission design and analysis, especially in the context of unstable orbital trajectories in the vicinity of small bodies and libration points, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a novel advanced Orbit Dynamic Computation Approach for Space Mission Analysis in the Vicinity of Small Bodies and Libration Points (ODYBOLP), with corresponding computational algorithms and software based on advanced models of complicated celestial dynamical systems with libration points (LPs) and a pseudo-arclength continuation method for computation of periodic orbits in such systems. The ODYBOLP approach will enable users to analyze space missions using: (a) all possible stable and unstable periodic orbits near LPs of Sun-Earth and Earth-Moon systems, etc.; (b) all possible periodic orbits near asteroids and comets; (c) possible dynamic transitions between different orbits connecting them to each other to organize space for near-zero fuel cost passageways through such orbits. The ODYBOLP software will be integrated into standard NASA software (GMAT, JAT, etc.) for mission analysis and design. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the ODYBOLP approach. In Phase II, POC will develop a fully functional software system and demonstrate its complete feasibility.

		<BR>
		The proposed ODYBOLP will extend NASA leadership in design and analysis of space missions using unstable orbital trajectories in the vicinity of small bodies and libration points. It will improve libration point dynamical system models associated with the multi-body problem and celestial small bodies and provide methods to use these models in space mission analysis and design. Finally, the ODYBOLP makes choosing the suitable nominal orbits and transfer trajectories with near-zero fuel costs easier and faster for the mission designer.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The U.S. space and satellite market involves numerous government agencies, many different parts of the DoD, and many commercial organizations. The world market is forecast to exceed $158B in 2010, while DoD spending on space is expected to reach $28B. The U.S. space satellite manufacturing and launch industry had record sales of almost $40B in 2008, thanks to its access to the world's largest government market including the DoD, NASA, and the DoC. The large companies in this market are Boeing, Northrop Grumman, etc. The proposed ODYBOLP approach has significant commercial applications for numerous government agencies and commercial players of the national space and satellite market in effective and robust computations of trajectories of space craft used for space guidance, navigation, control, and cargo transportation, and long-distance passageways through the solar system, with near-zero fuel cost.

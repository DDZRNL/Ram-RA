		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Measurements of vehicle/test article component loads and control-surface loads are required during testing to provide vital information for flight vehicle control, design and performance estimation and for structural design load prediction. Accurate measurements of forces and moments experienced by the test article are critical during wind tunnel tests. Typical hypersonic wind tunnel tests conducted at a speed of Mach 8 are under high temperatures up to 900ºF. Thermal effects associated with the tests in the continuous-flow hypersonic wind tunnel impose challenges for strain-gauge balances or other force/moment measuring devices used for component loads. These challenges are even greater when the temperature is unevenly distributed in the force balance.  A new sensor design that requires no water-cooling or thermal protection is highly desired.  In this proposal, Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) outlines an innovative high temperature force balance for hypersonic wind tunnel test.  This new sensor can sustain high temperatures without the need for any water-cooling or thermal protection.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed adaptive autonomous network management has potential to largely reduce the operation costs while maintain or even enhance the reliability for the NASA missions. Due to the heterogeneous nature of network assets and the lack of autonomy, the developed network management solution can be applied to the NASA's efforts on the integration of its current agency networks. The potential customers of our solution include robotic and human missions at locations ranging from the near Earth (e.g., EO-1) to deep space (e.g., Mars exploration).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed solution also has potential to greatly enhanced survivability for the war-fighters. Given the GIG vision, such heterogeneous and dynamic wireless networks will be common, and the developed network management solution can be applied to various military networks potentially supporting a number of major programs such as Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T), Future Combat System (FCS), Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), and Airborne Networks.<BR>The commercial drive for reliable communication is also increasing due to the increasing popularity of wireless network technologies. The potential commercial applications include satellite communications, wireless ad hoc networks and vehicle networks. The size of the market is quite large and may grow rapidly with the demand for network reliability and availability.

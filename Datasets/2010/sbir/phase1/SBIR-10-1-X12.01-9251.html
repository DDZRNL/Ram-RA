		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address the NASA Johnson Space Center's need for a space auscultation capability, Physical Optics Corporation proposes to develop a Hybrid High-Fidelity Auscultation Scope (AUSCU-SCOPE) based on a unique combination of multiple auscultation mechanisms with a novel sensor-fusion algorithm. This system incorporates a hybridized sensor configuration and novel signal processing algorithm that will separate low-intensity body sounds (<25 dBA) from a noisy background (>70 dBA) experienced in spaceflights with a 20-dB signal-to-noise ratio. The non-invasive and space-qualified AUSCU-SCOPE is safe, easy-to-use for a non-expert crew member and does not require extra training of clinicians to Doppler sounds. Additionally, the system easily connects with space telemetry systems via Ethernet, firewire, USB, and wireless 802.11 for transmitting sound data for distance diagnosis. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate feasibility of AUSCU-SCOPE through system design, simulation, assembly, and testing of a benchtop prototype, which will reach TRL-level 4 by the end of Phase I. In Phase II, POC will develop a fully functional prototype at TRL-6 and demonstrate high-fidelity spaceflight auscultation capability in the presence of a 70-dBA noise. The results will enable NASA to perform spaceflight auscultation even against significant background noise.

		<BR>
		The weightless environment of spaceflight can cause health problems; for example, fluid shifts and lack of resistive motion can harm cardiovascular performance. The AUSCU-SCOPE can be used on spaceflights as well as on the International Space Station (ISS) as a handy tool in assessing and maintaining the health of the ISS crew who are stationed for prolonged periods of time (>6 months).

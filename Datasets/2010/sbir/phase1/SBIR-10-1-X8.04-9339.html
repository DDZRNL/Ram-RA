		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Deployable Space Systems, Inc. (DSS) will focus the proposed SBIR program on the development of a new highly-modularized and extremely-scalable solar array that provides immense power level range capability from 100kW to many Megawatts in size.  The proposed ultra-high power solar array will enable extremely high power spacecraft, space-tug, power station applications, and large-scale Planetary and Lunar surface missions.  The proposed technology's broad power level scalability is achieved while still retaining industry leading solar array performance metrics and mission enabling features for lightweight, high performance, compact stowage volume, and affordability.  The proposed technology will enable future ultra-high power missions through low cost (25-50% cost savings depending on PV and blanket technology), lightweight, high specific power (>200 W/kg to 500 W/kg BOL at the wing level depending on PV and blanket technology), compact stowage volume (>80 kW/m3 for very large arrays), reliability, platform simplicity, high deployed strength/stiffness (10X stiffer and stronger than rigid panel arrays), radiation hardness, high voltage operation capability, scalability to ultra-high power (100kW to beyond Megawatts), and operability in unique environments (high/low illumination and high/low sun intensity).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA space applications are comprised of practically all Exploration, Space Science, Earth Science, Planetary Surface, and other missions that require photovoltaic power production through deployment of a lightweight and modular structural system.  The proposed technology is particularly well suited for ultra-high power applications including, but not limited to, high power spacecraft, space-tugs, power station applications, and large scale Planetary and Lunar surface applications.  The technology is also well suited for applications requiring affordability, lightweight, scalability/modularity, compact stowage, operability within high radiation environments, high voltage operation, and operation in LILT and HIHT environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA space applications are comprised of practically all missions that require photovoltaic power production through deployment of a lightweight and modular structural system.  The proposed technology is particularly well suited for ultra-high power applications including, but not limited to, high power spacecraft, space-tugs, power station applications, and other large scale applications.  The technology is also well suited for applications requiring affordability, lightweight, scalability/modularity, compact stowage, operability within high radiation environments, high voltage operation, and operation in LILT and HIHT environments.  Applicable non-NASA space missions include: LEO surveillance, reconnaissance, communications and other critical payload/equipment satellites, LEO commercial mapping and critical payload/equipment satellites, MEO satellites & space-tugs, GEO commercial communications and critical payload/equipment satellites, and GEO communications and payload/equipment satellites.  The proposed technology also has tremendous dual-use non-space commercial private-sector applicability including fixed-ground and deployable/retractable mobile-ground based systems.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Today, the ability of sensors to generate geographical data is virtually limitless.  Although NASA now provides (together with other agencies such as the USGS)  a capability for accessing, manipulating, and visualizing these data, an enormous gap still exists between the sensor data and the visualization capability, largely due to the rapid technological advances with respect to desktop visualization of large datasets.  The challenge addressed in this research is to develop new methods for automating the access and processing of raw sensor data, sharing data and methods among researchers, and integrating visualization throughout the process.  To meet this challenge, we will develop two new innovations: Geo-Cloud and COAST HPGIS. <BR><BR>Geo-Cloud is the distributed network environment that maintains connectivity between a geo-browser and Geo-Resources (sensor data, GIS datasets, models, simulations, and metadata).  The Geo-Cloud maintains all metadata (and ontology) required to efficiently catalog, locate, store, access, and update Geo-Resources.  The significance of the Geo-Cloud creation is that it is a highly performing, scalable, network environment that encompasses: 1) a high performance cloud computing (HPCC) environment, and 2) geographical context (HPGIS) whereby users can store, access, and manipulate extensive geographical resources.  The Geo-Cloud provides virtualized access to Internet2 and supercomputing resources for processing very large datasets and simulations.<BR><BR>COAST HPGIS is an enhanced version of the NASA COAST product which is based on the NASA World Wind geo-browser.  COAST HPGIS includes plug-ins, overlays, and interfaces for COAST in order to enable interaction with the Geo-Cloud for real-time visualization of temporal and parametric simulations and models.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The development of the Geo-Cloud and COAST HPGIS technology will enable the integration of models and simulations used to conduct scientific studies using large NASA datasets.  The following NASA commercial applications are envisioned.<BR><BR>--COAST HPGIS which provides access to extensive Geo-Resources from within the NASA COAST geo-browser allowing researchers to easily share GIS assets across a high speed network.<BR><BR>--COAST HPGIS-PV which provides a capability to perform real-time parametric and temporal visualization of GIS data layers.  <BR><BR>--COAST HPGIS-SPEC which allows COAST users to directly interact with powerful Spectroscopy resources to select, filter, and analyze multi-beam and hyper-spectral datasets.<BR><BR>--COAST HPGIS-SIM which allows COAST users to interact with models and simulation of GIS data<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Applications of the HPGIS technology will be limitless.  As researchers begin to test and share Geo-Resources and models and simulators, many new applications will be in demand.  In addition to the research community, we expect that the use of GIS-enabled data will grow in commercial markets that make use of scientific and industry-specific (market intelligence) data.  The following table provides a partial list of initial products that we likely would commercialize, beginning in Phase II.  <BR><BR>--GIS-as-a-Servcie (GaaS)<BR>--Algal Monitoring Application<BR>--Sediment Monitoring Application <BR>--GeoToGo (Geo-Cloud handheld)<BR>--Geo-Cloud Licensing to 3rd-party GIS tool providers<BR>--GOM Oil Lease field Application<BR>--Wild Fire Monitoring Application <BR>--Wetland Monitoring Application<BR>

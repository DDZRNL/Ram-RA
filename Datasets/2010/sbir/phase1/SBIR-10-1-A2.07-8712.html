		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Orbital Research proposes to develop, build and test a high temperature Data Concentrator Module for use in distributed turbine engine control at high temperatures.  The concentrator receives analog and digital signals related to turbine engine control and communicates with a FADEC or high level command processor.  This data concentrator is follows the road map put forth by DECWG for use in creating a demonstration platform for turbine engine distributed controls communication development that operates at temperatures at least up to 225<SUP>o</SUP>C.<BR><BR>The goal of Phase I is to develop detailed specifications for each component needed for the system, as well as to define the total system specification.  This will entail a combination of system design, compiling existing component specifications, laboratory testing, and simulation.  The results will show feasibility of the data concentrator.<BR><BR>Phase II of this program is will focus on three key objectives:<BR>The first objective will be the detailed design, fabrication and testing of three new high temperature ASICs.  Secondly software necessary to demonstrate operation the prototype will be developed.  Finally integration of the components and software into a prototype high temperature Data Concentrator Module will be completed to demonstrate operation of the complete system in a realistic environment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Multiple NASA, Defense, and Commercial applications exist for the proposed Data Concentrator module technology, the associated high temperature integrated circuits, and variant high temperature control modules.  Within NASA the variants of the Data Concentrator can be incorporated into:<BR>	Ground testing of rocket engines;<BR>	Ground testing of turbine engines (including VAATE);<BR>	Sensor webs and distributed sensors (non-engine);<BR>	Highly reconfigurable sensors<BR>	Space-related applications due to inherent radiation-hardened characteristics of SOI electronics.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Defense and Commercial applications include:<BR>	Next generation military and civilian aircraft turbine engines, including rotorcraft, UAS, and land vehicles (very large market potential);<BR>	Down-hole drilling and geothermal drilling controls;<BR>	Ground testing rocket and turbine engines;<BR>	Prognostic Health Management (PHM)/Integrated System Health Management (ISHM);<BR>	Chemical, nuclear, refinery, and process plant instrumentation<BR>	Powertrain controls for internal combustion engines, gas or diesel (for instance an improved waste gate turbo-booster).<BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		TRS Technologies proposes to develop a very wideband ultrasound diagnostic tool for quantification of trabecular bone properties for astronauts in long term space missions.  Loss of calcification in bones and general loss of strength must be monitored in missions to insure personnel health, however, there are currently limited non-invasive methods that can do this. Research has shown that different parameters of bone health can be elucidated from ultrasound characteristics at different frequencies, and the goal of TRS is to make a device that can produce the nearly 5 octave range necessary to evaluate these parameters. TRS will utilize PMN-PT single crystal piezoelectrics, which have inherent advantages over traditional materials, and integrate this with photolithographic micromachining methods to produce a device with high sensitivity and bandwidth that surpasses other systems. Bone scans will be used to show both the resolution and depth of penetration characteristics of the device and its applicability for future in vivo use in space.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		With the potential as a low-cost system, the ultrasound method could be implemented as a series of units for astronauts both in space and before or after returning. The applications of the material and methods can also be integrated into other areas, such as evaluation of materials (non-destructive evaluation) while on the job. The cryogenic performance advantages of single crystal have been shown in adaptive optics applications, showing that this could be a very adaptable technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There is potential for the ultrasound system to be used as a low-cost diagnostic tool in the medical setting, particularly in areas where the larger, more costly imaging tools such as CT and MRI are not available. The additional information from this method could also surpass these modalities. This system could be used in smaller settings such as the thousands of retirement communities across the nation.  Nearly 28 million people suffer from osteoporosis at least in its early stages, and this could be a significant tool in monitoring the populace.

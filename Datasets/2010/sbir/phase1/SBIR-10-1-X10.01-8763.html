		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced Materials Technology, Inc (AMTI) responds to the NASA solicitation X10 "Cryogenic Propellant Storage and Transfer" under subtopic X.01 "Cryogenic Fluid Management Technologies".  NASA is seeking for technologies in advanced cryogenic fluid storage and transfer to reduce launch operation costs by providing higher efficiency, lower maintenance and longer life while improving safety and minimizing consumable losses.   To address the NASA needs, we propose to develop novel, sprayable, fire resistant, composite coating for insulation of advanced cryogenic fluid storage systems.  The novel insulations will offer affordable cost, high strength and flexibility, high thermal stability, excellent durability, and easy processability through spraying technique, which will result in improved efficiency and reliability of the cryogenic systems.  Once the feasibility of fabrication of lightweight cryogenic insulating materials by the proposed technology is demonstrated in Phase I, we shall scale-up this technology in a Phase II program to meet the NASA's requirements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Primary attributes of the proposed composite coatings include fire retardant, broad range of temperature applications (from cryogenic to elevated temperatures), lack of outgassing, and good mechanical properties.  Therefore, these materials are the ideal choice for lightweight insulation in space applications.  One such application is cryogenic insulation for fuel tanks on major rocket propulsion systems.  Another is thermal insulation on the louvers of communications satellites where intermittent exposure to sun and darkness requires these materials operating temperature range.  The technology proposed in this program will help NASA to reduce the cost of space flight.  Our materials will provide NASA with robust cryogenic solutions and, therefore, will significantly decrease space mission failures.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The new insulation's ability to maintain its flexibility at cryogenic temperatures makes it a superior choice for cryogenic expansion joints, designed to absorb expansion/contraction stresses.  Some examples of cryogenic applications of these new materials include medical storage/transport units, cryogenic fuel tanks, and wind tunnels. The technology developed under this program can benefit aerospace, marine, aircraft, electronic, electrical, rail, automotive, recreation, building materials, and construction industries.  Immediate benefit from the proposed Phase I program is the design and fabrication of a composite-based spray deposition insulation system for thermal protection of aircraft surfaces.  The ability to tailor the thermal and mechanical properties of proposed thermal coating system allows it to be a flexible solution to meet a wide range of technological needs.  The new composite based materials can be used as thermal insulation on marine vessels.  They can also be shaped for easy installation as pipe covering.  The new materials are specifically suited for the needs of the aircraft industry.  These high performance thermal insulators will provide weight savings, improved handling/installation characteristics and enhanced performance durability in service.

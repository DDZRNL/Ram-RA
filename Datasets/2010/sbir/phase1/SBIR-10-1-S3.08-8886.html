		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Physical Sciences Inc. proposes to design, develop, and demonstrate, a novel high performance monopropellant for application in future planetary ascent vehicles. Our non-carcinogenic, non-cryogenic, monopropellants will significantly augment specific impulse and density specific impulse over conventional monopropellant and bi-propellant systems. In Phase I, the proposed investigation will focus upon characterizing critical thermal and chemical behavior of our monopropellants to ensure realistic system level design and maximum performance of future planetary ascent vehicles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Successful demonstration of our high performance monopropellants will have applications in multiple NASA's planetary exploration missions. Our monopropellant provides a propulsion system that will maximize engine performance, minimize logistical operational expenses associated with most high performing liquid systems, and provide a more compact propulsion system. It also provides a low cost technology solution to achieve high thrust profiles expected from future planetary ascent vehicles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Successful demonstration of our liquid monopropellant will have applications in both commercial and military technology ranging from expendable and reusable launch vehicles to small tactical missiles. Development of a low cost monopropellant solution capable of producing high thrust profiles will allow for critical technology development in strategic and space defense.

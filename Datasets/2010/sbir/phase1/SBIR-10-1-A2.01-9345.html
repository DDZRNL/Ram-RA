		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Durable high temperature materials are required for structural thermal protection systems (TPS) that exhibit a structural load carrying capability at temperatures in excess of 2700ºF. Fabrication times and costs are challenging for high acreage applications such as a structural TPS system. This proposed effort offers a new approach in manufacturing of SiC/SiC ceramic matrix composite components cost effectively with short lead time and high flexibility. The composites will be fabricated via a powder metallurgy/sintering approach using an emerging field assisted sintering technology (FAST). The objective is to fabricate and demonstrate making a cost effective CMC composite by FAST. The SiC/SiC produced will be produced from SiC constituents suitable for TPS applications.  Basic mechanical and thermal properties will be measured to assess the promise of the FAST process to rapidly producing a SiC/SiC composite.  A technical assessment of the FAST process to produce a 2700ºF+ SiC/SiC will be made as well.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The development of advanced ceramic composite materials and components with enhanced thermal-structural performance over those currently available could directly support future enabling technologies for hypersonic propulsion and hot structures. Applications for ceramic<BR>composites in advanced airbreathing combined-cycle propulsion systems and control surfaces for reusable hypervelocity and exo/transatmospheric aerospace vehicles are directly addressed by this technology. These potential applications are critically dependent on the development of<BR>lower cost advanced materials capable of high-performance load-bearing operation up to and beyond 1500<SUP>o</SUP>C (2700<SUP>o</SUP>F). Successful demonstration of the life at temperature of the CMC concept could result in a valuable near term increase in airframe performance and reliability for a variety of hot structures and thermal protection systems critical to both DoD and NASA highspeed aircraft and re-entry vehicles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Opportunities for retrofit and new application in turbine engine systems also exist. The potential low cost and high temperature capability could lend itself to these applications for internal hot gas path parts.  <BR><BR>Similar requirements for high-temperature materials exist for commercial/industrial applications as well. Although less aggressive than the aerospace/defense and nuclear energy-related initiatives, programs are in place for evaluating reinforced ceramics for land-based turbine components, catathermal combustion devices, heat exchangers and radiant burners, which represent opportunities in energy and pollution abatement technologies that may mature over the next 10 or so years.<BR>

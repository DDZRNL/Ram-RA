		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced Scientific Concepts, Inc. (ASC) is a small business, which has developed a compact, eye-safe 3D Flash LIDARTM Camera (FLC) well suited for real-time spacecraft trajectory, speed, orientation measurements relative to the planet's surfaces and evaluating potential hazards during the critical landing sequence.  Data collected using ASC's FLC at JPL's Mars Yard and in NASA ALHAT flight tests demonstrated that ASC Flash LIDAR system can meet the requirements for Entry Descent and Landing (EDL).  Aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour (STS-127), SpaceX and ASC demonstrated the DragonEye Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking (AR&D) Flash LIDAR solution in low earth orbit, the first Flash LIDAR in space.  ASC has developed the core technology for Flash LIDAR with its 3D-FPA hybrid and would like to work with NASA to further enhance the functionality of the 3D sensor by adding embedded image enhancement and classification algorithms. For this SBIR solicitation, ASC is proposing embedded processing, for image enhancement and hazard identification, of 3D Flash LIDAR point clouds.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This sensor will increase the success of NASA operations such as:<BR>	Mars Landed Exploration <BR>	Exploration of Moons (ALHAT, Jupiter Icy Moons) <BR>	Asteroid and Comet Rendezvous and Sample Return <BR>	ISS Rendezvous and Docking (manned & unmanned)<BR>	Space Situational Awareness<BR>	Extravehicular Robotic Camera<BR>	Rock Abundance and Distribution Maps <BR>	Topographical Mapping <BR>	Rover Mobility and Navigation <BR>NASA Langley Research Center has purchased two of ASC's existing FLVC systems for performing laboratory, field, and airborne test and evaluation of this technology for use on the ALHAT program.  A FLC been deployed for EDL helicopter and high altitude fixed wing experiments, and has shown excellent results.   ASC is continuing to develop and improve its line of 3D Flash LIDAR systems, one of which successfully flew on the Endeavor (STS-127) for AR&D testing.  <BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Humidity is a critical variable for monitoring and control on extended duration missions because it can affect the operation and efficiency of closed loop life support systems. Humidity sensors are needed for real-time process control over the critical O2, H2, and CO2 gas streams in the system.  Sensors with the right combination of performance, size, low power consumption, and durability for this application are not available.  Synkera proposes to develop an advanced microsensor for humidity, which takes advantage of an innovative combination of nanomaterials and ceramic MEMS technology to meet the need for reliable and accurate humidity process control sensors for spacecraft. In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of integrating the elements described above to prepare a stable and accurate sensor, which will advance the technology from TRL 3 to 4.  Then, in Phase II and beyond, we will work with an ECLSS prime contractor to develop space-qualified prototypes that are commercially viable for NASA and third-party applications and to integrate these sensors within NASA's closed loop life support systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Significant advancements have been made in technology to implement Significant advancements have been made in technology to implement regenerative, closed loop environmental control and life support systems (ECLSS).  Humidity is a critical variable for monitoring and control in ECLSS because it can affect the operation and efficiency of a number of key subsystems.  Currently, humidity is monitored on the International Space Station primarily in the crew cabin using a mass spectrometer, which is complex, costly, and not amenable to in-situ process control.  However, a network of reliable and ultra-compact humidity microsensors, developed in this program and distributed at specific locations within the ECLSS, would allow for real-time process control over the critical O2, H2, and CO2 gas streams used in ECLSS.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Beyond the NASA application, there are significant opportunities for an innovative humidity sensor in the commercial sector including: food processing, agricultural and pharmaceutical industries, indoor air quality control, heating/air conditioning systems, and industrial process control. Humidity and temperature transmitters are being introduced for climate control in luxury cars.  Moisture control during construction plays a key role in preventing microbe growth and monitoring concrete drying.  Moisture sensors are also used for control of the basement and crawl space ventilation in residential buildings, especially in areas prone to flooding and with soil expansion problems.  Many high temperature baking and drying processes require water vapor control.  All of these applications share a common problem, the need for reliable and robust humidity sensors, which can resist environmental contamination and wetting.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Size and weight of payloads on space platforms is limited by the launch vehicle capacity, and NASA platform designers must use every square inch and pound effectively.  Power consumption requirements for satellite and deep space applications demand lower power and more efficient systems in order to maximize payload resources.  Future NASA missions will require higher performance transceivers in order to handle ever increasing data rates .  The current NASA vision calls for advanced Ka-band communications links and antenna arrays.  Nuvotronics will demonstrate minimum size, weight, and power optimized transceivers based on PolyStrataTM microfabrication technology.  The PolyStrata transmission architecture provides superior isolation compared to other available microwave routing technologies, resulting in higher packing density and smaller size, while allowing integration of active and passive devices to create a superior transceiver for space applications.

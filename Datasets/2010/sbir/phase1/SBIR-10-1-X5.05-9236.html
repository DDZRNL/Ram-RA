		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Space missions could benefit from improved lubricant technology. PSI intends to develop novel liquid lubricant formulations which are applicable for future NASA missions. Our concept is based upon use of nanofluid technology whereby stable, colloidal suspensions of additives are present in perfluoropolyalkylether (PFPE) base fluids. The additives will become sheared within minute scratches and grooves while separating surface asperities. At the conclusion of Phase I, we will have prepared ~ 10 nm diameter additives with ~ 115 m2/g and ~ 80 m2/g gravimetric surface areas, respectively. Their surface will have been chemically modified and shown stable from -65oC to +65oC. A 50% reduction in friction and wear at steel surfaces upon dispersion of the additive to PFPE will have been demonstrated. PSI will have shown that the viscosity of Uniflor 8960 PFPE is maintained at 60 cSt ± 5% upon formulation with the additive. PSI will have demonstrated that the particles maintain an average particle size of ~ 10 nm within PFPE, and would have settling times > 5 years. The TRL at the beginning of the Phase I contract will be at 2, while the TRL at the completion of the Phase I contract will be at 3-4.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed lubricants and formulations will have direct applications to NASA aerospace systems that require minimal/no maintenance over extended periods of time. These systems include rovers and machinery used in constructing the lunar habitat. The compounds will provide lower volatility, decreased wear effects, and better tribological characteristics than those of standard liquid lubricants that are currently used, particularly at lower temperatures.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed lubricants and formulations have applications in terrestrial machinery. They will substantially increase performance, and reduce maintenance costs and frequencies of industrial transportation and construction systems. The compounds will also be valuable in gyroscope bearings on board satellites. The Mars Science Laboratory program will use a rover to determine if the planet could sustain microbial life and is habitable. Aquarius, another mission to be initiated in 2011, will use a satellite to measure the earth's global sea surface salinity in varied climates.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		CPI proposes to develop an innovative, generalized retrieval algorithm and analysis tool (GRANT) that will facilitate analysis of remote sensing data from both terrestrial and planetary atmospheres, and that is applicable to a wide range of NASA's remote sensing missions. GRANT will be based upon a generic and flexible implementation of the optimal estimation inversion technique for atmospheric retrievals (OPT), and be driven by a state-of-the-art FUV-NIR atmospheric radiance model (AURIC) for its forward model. GRANT will possess a flexible, user-configurable sensor model for generating realistic simulated data that tailors the retrieval algorithm to a specific sensor and measurement system.<BR><BR>The anticipated Phase I result will be a working prototype analysis tool for application to terrestrial and planetary atmospheres. This prototype will be validated against a focused set of existing retrieval algorithms using remote sensing data from several NASA and DoD sensors. Phase II will yield a prototype that includes additional retrievable geophysical parameters, has a graphical user interface, incorporates a detailed formal error analysis capability, and has improved forward modeling capabilities such as energetic particle transport and enhanced Visible/IR modeling.<BR><BR>The TRL levels at the start and end of Phase I are estimated to be 3 and 4, respectively.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		If the proposed development effort is successful, the fully functional Phase II analysis tool will be applicable to a wide range of current and future NASA missions including: Cassini-Huygens, CALIPSO, SDO, SORCE, NOAA-N, TIMED/GUVI, MAVEN, New Horizons, and IT-Energetics. Application of the Generalized geophysical Retrieval & ANalysis Tool for planetary atmospheres (GRANT) to these and other NASA missions will provide much-needed support for important science objectives such as understanding how the interaction of the solar wind with atmospheres affects planetary environments and evolution.  <BR><BR>Most of these are current missions, for which the software would be adapted to retrieve geophysical parameters from existing data. Possible benefits range from validation of existing algorithms and data products to implementation of new retrieval strategies and additional data products.<BR><BR>The full capability of the software, however, is best realized in applications to missions that are still in the development stage. In this scenario the analysis tool will be used to its full potential, initially aiding in the design of the sensor and measurement strategy and ultimately evolving into a tool for operational data analysis as the mission matures.  In this regard the IT-Energetics mission provides the ideal application of the GRANT software.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We anticipate potential commercial demand for the GRANT analysis tool from large aerospace contractors involved in the development of sensors, platforms and integrated mission design for geophysical remote sensing programs. The strongest demand in this sector will likely be for the software's simulation capabilities, which will provide a powerful diagnostic tool for evaluating competing design options in the sensor and mission development phase. We also expect demand for the software's retrieval and data processing capability from sensor vendors who continue to support operational and legacy missions through routine data production.<BR><BR>Ball Aerospace has already recognized this potential by providing a letter of endorsement for this proposed effort. One particular application of interest is tailoring the prototype GRANT tool to support their CALIPSO program during Phase II. CALIPSO is a NASA satellite mission to study clouds and aerosols, for which Ball supplied two of the primary sensors. Ball has expressed interest in the potential of this product to improve CALIPSO data products, as well as identifying and enhancing potential new applications and future instrument modifications.<BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this Phase I project, Impact Technologies, in collaboration with Prof. R.K. Yedavalli, propose a novel verification environment for eventual rapid certification of distributed engine control systems (DCS).  Our approach is focused on providing a set of tools to the government and industry that will allow faster certification of the control system as new high-temperature components and control laws are developed.  A distributed hardware-in-the-loop (D-HIL) simulation tool is proposed to assist NASA and the Distributed Engine Control Working Group (DECWG) to integrate DCS components onto existing and next-generation engines.  The proposed D-HIL simulator consist of a thermal test chamber operated by an engine simulation which is capable of subjecting components to a range of possible transient thermal conditions seen during engine operation , while functioning as elements in the networked control loop.  To aid in certification of more complex distributed engine control hardware and software, a set of analysis tools is proposed.  The Global Verification Toolset makes use of global stability and bounded verification methodologies to allow stability and performance to be assessed in a systematic fashion.  At the conclusion of Phase I, the new verification facility and software tools will be demonstrated in a system test using the C-MAPSS engine.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed distributed hardware-in-the-loop evaluation platform and verification software tools will enable the development of distributed aircraft propulsion control systems and flight control avionic systems.  In addition to Fundamental Aeronautics, the developed tools extend to verification of flight-critical control and health management software and distributed avionics that are relevant to the Aviation Safety and Exploration Systems.  Impact Technologies will position the hardware simulator for inclusion in future planned NASA/DoD-led Distributed Engine Control demonstrations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Aside from commercial aviation platforms, the application arena for distributed control system V&V tools extends to Air Force engine platforms.  The verification toolset will benefit fly-by-wire systems sponsored by DoD such as UAVs, UGVs, and AUVs.  Interest in fault-tolerant distributed control systems spans across many industries, particularly the automotive, energy, and manufacturing systems areas.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has identified in-space cryogenic fluid management (CFM) as a high priority for technology development because the construction of an in-space propellant infrastructure is anticipated to dramatically decrease costs across a broad spectrum of missions.  This importance is reflected in the designation of CFM as a Flagship Technology Demonstration Mission (FTD-2) as well as a mission at the level of Crosscutting Technologies (CRYOTE).  Sierra Lobo proposes to develop a CFM testbed at the scale of an Edison Demonstration Mission (CryoCube) that would serve as a platform for a series of flight tests of many major CFM technologies.  The missions will be designed to be conducted as stand-alone satellites, without reliance on propellant transfer from an upper stage, in order to provide the greatest possible flexibility for launch vehicle selection.  Follow-up missions using dedicated small satellite launch vehicles could take advantage of the technology demonstrated during this SBIR program, and could be performed as funding becomes available instead of depending on the allocation in a large block.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Although a large number of CFM technologies have been matured by ground testing, many key technologies await flight testing.  CubeSat-scale tests can improve the understanding of the phenomena affecting many of the technologies; for example, liquid acquisition and zero boil-off storage.  Some of the technologies can be tested as they would be used in a full-scale depot; for example, pressure and acceleration sensors, and the sensors used in the Reduced Gravity Cryo-Tracker<SUP>REG</SUP> mass gauging system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Sierra Lobo will endeavor to transfer technologies developed during the course of the project into other small satellite applications.  The thermal management technology to be developed is directly applicable to satellites that require sensor cooling.  The technology could also contribute to propellant storage and transfer to extend the life of small satellites; for example, through enabling the storage of xenon in a liquid state.

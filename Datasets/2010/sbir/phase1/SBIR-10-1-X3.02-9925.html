		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		During this Phase I effort, CRG proposes to demonstrate the ability to significantly reduce the acoustic signature of vaneaxial fans by establishing quiet aerodynamic, mechanical, and electronic design features.  CRG will focus primarily on reducing tonal and broadband aerodynamic noise, using a combination of theory and experimentation to investigate the acoustic benefits of i) asymmetric blade spacing, ii) serrated trailing edge features, and iii) wearable blade tip liners on a scale representative of the NASA applications.  In addition, CRG will leverage its experience in high-efficiency vaneaxial fan design, which includes the development of state-of-the-art motor and controller technology, to identify the potential noise reductions in the drive system.  The Phase I results will provide a baseline for Phase II acoustic modeling, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, drive system development, and vaneaxial fan system demonstration.  Finally, the transition of next generation quiet, high-efficiency vaneaxial fans into future NASA human exploration systems to increase occupant comfort, such as the predecessor to the space shuttle, commercial crew and cargo systems, lunar exploration systems, and even Mars exploration systems, defines the overall goal of the program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Supporting NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate, this project's technologies directly address requirements for low noise ventilation fans for application in human exploration systems.  These systems include next generation crew launch systems, lunar exploration systems, Mars exploration systems, and even private sector space exploration, such as projects supported by NASA's Commercial Crew and Cargo Program.  This project's technologies offer significantly reduced acoustic signature, coupled with high fan efficiency, to increase occupant comfort and reduce power demand.  Human comfort and energy conservation are both critical for long endurance space missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Government systems that would derive the benefits due to quiet vaneaxial fans would include but not be limited to thermal management systems for land, air, space and sea vehicles, and building and deployable habitat HVAC operated by the Department of Defense.<BR>This technology's attributes for high-efficiency, low-noise vaneaxial fans should yield a high potential for integration into private sector space systems, such as those supported by NASA's Commercial Crew and Cargo Program.  In addition, the fans are also ideal candidates for commercialization into building HVAC systems by a variety of building engineering firms.<BR>

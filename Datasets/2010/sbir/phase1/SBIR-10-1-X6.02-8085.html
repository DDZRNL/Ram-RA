		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Our vision for this NASA proposal is to develop a rad-hard and ultra low power (ULP) reconfigurable FPGA that will have 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		One of the limiting factors for the EJSM is the mitigation of TID radiation.  Both the JEO and JGO will be subjected to various doses of radiation during the mission.  In fact, the radiation design point for the JEO is 2.9 Mrads (Si) over its nine year mission. Hence, electronic components and processors (FPGAs, ASICs, etc.) that are capable of operating in such environment will be desirable. The rad-hard ULP FPGA that will be developed is capable of operating in such environments and also consume low power. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The rad-hard and ULP FPGA can be used by other agencies, such as, MDA and DoD for satellite applications and high-altitude airborne applications. Because the FPGA will consume very low power, it can also be effectively used in no-radiation environments (commercial applications such as cell phones, remote sensor platforms, hand-held devices, etc.) where the major requirement is extremely low power consumption and extended battery life.

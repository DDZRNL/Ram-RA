		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose the development of transceiver offering wide bandwidth (1 Mbps to 10 Gbps) that operates in space environments targeted by NASA for robotic exploration.  Fiber optics holds significant advantages over copper for high-speed data communications in space applications  it neither produces nor is affected by EMI, it offers ground isolation between electronic units, reduced power, reduced size and reduced weight.  Mil-airframes are increasingly fielding fiber optic wiring infrastructures as a long-term solution to bandwidth upgrades (for example, Joint Strike Fighter, Raptor, F-18 and B-2) [1].  Space systems are coming on-line that route 100's of signals with bandwidths greater than 1 Gbps [2, 3 and see Potential Post Applications below].   As NASA engineers forecast the spacecraft trends for increasing science data throughput and on-board processing, the use of fiber optic data links between spacecraft subsystems has gained considerable interest.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary goal is to enable NASA to field high-resolution sensors and computational systems in robotic exploration missions throughout the Solar System. NASA is pursuing technologies to enable robotic exploration of the Solar System including its planets, their moons, and small bodies. NASA has a development program that includes technologies for the atmospheric entry, descent, and landing, mobility systems, extreme environments technology, sample acquisition and preparation for in situ experiments, and in situ planetary science instruments. Robotic exploration missions that are planned include a Europa Jupiter System mission, Titan Saturn System mission, Venus In Situ Explorer, sample return from Comet or Asteroid and lunar south polar basin and continued Mars exploration missions launching every 26 months including a network lander mission, an Astrobiology Field Laboratory, a Mars Sample Return mission and other rover missions. Numerous new technologies will be required to enable such ambitious missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology will also expand the use of fiber optics within terrestrial extreme environments (such as down-hole oil and underwater Arctic Circle exploration) and within DOD weapons systems.  We will leverage technology that undergone extensive space qualification and today produces transceivers for the space and military markets.

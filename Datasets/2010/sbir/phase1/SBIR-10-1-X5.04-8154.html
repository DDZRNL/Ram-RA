		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Picometrix's time-domain terahertz (TD-THz) non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technology could be used<BR>to inspect space flight structures such as inflatable space habitats, thermal protection systems (TUFI-type<BR>tiles, SOFI TPS), for voids, disbonds, and damage such as tearing and micron-meteorite impact. In this<BR>Phase I SBIR project, we propose to test the feasibility of three key technological changes which could<BR>substantially reduce the volume, mass, and power requirement of the TD-THz instrumentation, making it<BR>more suitable for use by an operator in space. The current instrumentation paradigm is that a multi-purpose<BR>TD-THz control unit is used to provide common drive, data acquisition, and analysis functionality to<BR>interchangeable sensors and imaging which connect to the control unit with a fiber-optic/electrical<BR>umbilical. However, the current COTS control unit is substantially larger and heavier than would be<BR>desirable for a space-flight capable unit. The proposed developments would enable a control unit for a<BR>hand held NDE imaging tool, sufficiently robust for spaceflight, no larger than a small shoebox. It should<BR>be possible to reduce the size of the control unit to approximately one sixth of the current values to, for<BR>example, 14 in. X 8 in. X 4 in and 10 pounds.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		At the end of a successful Phase II, the goal would be to space qualify the compact control unit design in<BR>Phase III so that it could be used for in-orbit inspections of inflatable habitats and thermal protection<BR>systems. In addition, THz NDE instrumentation will be valuable in characterizing the aging and durability<BR>of aircraft and spacecraft materials and components. Materials include ceramics, foams, Kevlar, Zylon, and<BR>other non-conductive polymer matrix composites. Additional NDE applications include inspection of soft<BR>shell fan containment, thermal protection systems, and composite overwrap pressure vessels.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Ceramics, foams, and polymer matrix composites are used in automobile and ships and many other<BR>consumer and industrial products. A compact TD-THz imaging system could be used inspect automobile<BR>dashboards, inspect for delamination of printed circuit boards, inspect of pipe insulation, as well as inspect<BR>manufactured parts such as pure plastic and paper products. A compact TD-THz imager benefits homeland<BR>security applications under development such as personnel and luggage inspection for concealed weapons<BR>and explosives (in luggage, shoes, etc.).

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR will develop and demonstrate acoustic sensor technology enabling real-time, remotely performed measuring and monitoring of sound pressure levels and noise exposure levels in long-duration space vehicles.  The acoustic sensor technology developed will enable a network of continuously monitored, real-time acoustic sensors providing sound pressure level information as a function of frequency and/or time at multiple locations for the current International Space Station (ISS) and future long duration spaceflight missions.  The phase I will show the feasibility for the phase II to develop the software and hardware of an acoustic monitor to a TRL 6 level.  In phase II a demonstration unit and it software package will be delivered to NASA for their testing.  A phase II demonstration will be done in JSC Acoustics and Noise Control Lab (ANCL) so that testing can be performed in the ISS Acoustic Mockup.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Wirelessly network acoustic monitoring technology from this SBIR is highly desired for use by NASA on ISS and for future long duration space missions for the long-term.  To reduce crew work while improving monitoring NASA needs a miniature, lightweight, network of acoustic monitors that can process data at the sensor and transmit their data wirelessly.  Low power consumption is very important to achieve long operating life with minimal crew maintenance.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Technology from the project can be used in a number of commercial applications.  IntriCon has both the manufacturing and the marketplaces established to apply the technology commercially.  Applications include surveillance by law enforcement, Homeland Security, wireless hearing health products, industrial maintenance and airport monitoring.

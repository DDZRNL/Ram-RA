		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Rocketstar Robotics is proposing the development of a modern dual drive actuator.  Rocketstar has put together numerous modern concepts for modular actuators that feature gear ratios on the order of 1000:1 and would be ideal candidates for many space applications.  These actuators are evolutionary advancements of actuators that are currently in use today and offer performance benefits over heritage counterparts including; higher torque margins, flexible gear ratios, flexible gearing components, higher specific torque and the ability to be non redundant, electrically redundant or fully mechanically and electrically redundant.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A family of modular actuators would be useful in a wide variety of NASA applications, particularly instruments, deployment devices, rover wheels, robotics applications and pointing mechanisms for antennas and/or cameras.  These devices could provide better specific torque performance for lower mass, greater capability and higher margins.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Some of these devices could be very useful in similar high reliability applications where it is not always possible to easily access the hardware.  These would include military applications such as robotics, deep sea applications and sub surface terrestrial applications.  The devices might also be applicable for military or commercial aircraft applications.

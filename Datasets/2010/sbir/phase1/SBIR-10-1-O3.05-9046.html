		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		MaXentric's is proposing a radiation tolerant Software Define Video Processor, codenamed SDVP, for the problem of advanced motion imaging in the space environment. SDVP will take advantage of state of the art rad-hard by design (RHBD) manycore processors to provide radiation tolerant reprogrammable encoder, video enhancement, and other video processing capabilities for HDTV, digital cinema camera, and other image sensors used in the operations on orbit, while withstanding radiation damage that degrades image quality and performance.  Furthermore SDVP will improve the motion imaging technology in the space by offering standard compliance flexibility, multimode operation and power management capabilities. As missions evolve, parameters change that can affect the ideal motion imaging configurations. SDVR highly programmable platform will make it easy to upload patches, upgrades, and new applications and improvements, hence providing "Future-proof" video processing and over-the-air reconfiguration. SDVP can support other applications in parallel with video processing, reducing SWaP of the greater system.<BR>

		The adoption of a radiation hardened software defined video processor, SDVP, meets several important needs for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) by advancing the motion imaging technology in the space environments. One example is the use of HDTV camcorders on the Space Station. The deployment of a high definition television (HDTV) camcorder on the International Space Station is part of a public-private NASA partnership with Dreamtime Holdings Inc., Moffet Field, Calif., to upgrade NASA's equipment to next generation HDTV technology. Another application is the Live HDTV broadcast from Space. On October 2009, NASA transmitted the first live high-definition television (HDTV) broadcast from space (in this case the International Space Station) to earth. Designed to give curious minds a look at life aboard the 220-mile high space station, the broadcast aired on Discovery HD, a NASA partner on the program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A reprogrammable video processor will provide significant advantages in the commercial market of high quality motion imaging. One prominent sector is the medical equipment market, where high quality and flexibility are both in demand based on the situation and location. A reprogrammable encoder that provides high quality and rate control makes it possible to use the equipment in remote locations, like disaster areas and make shift hospitals, while getting high quality images to specialists and physicians in central locations. Overall it is important to notice that a programmable processor is important for applications that support multiple coding standards, proprietary functions, or future changes to application requirements. Programmable video processor architectures achieve best performance through the use of parallelism at the data, instruction (VLIW), and multiprocessor level, and optimally sized ALU, multiplier, and load/store data paths.

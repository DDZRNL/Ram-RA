		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Combustion instabilities pose a significant technical risk in the development of liquid and solid rocket motors. Much of the effort in modeling combustion instabilities has focused either on systems-level tools, or use of detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate all the involved processes. The important effects of finite-rate chemical kinetics and turbulence-chemistry interactions have been neglected in combustion instability modeling. In this SBIR project, CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC) will team up with Gloyer-Taylor Laboratories (GTL) to develop a hybrid approach by combining CFD capabilities with a systems-level instability modeling approach, the latter based on the Universal Combustion Device Stability (UCDS) process.  These capabilities will be used to quantify the effects of finite-rate chemistry and turbulence-chemistry interactions on combustion instabilities. In Phase I, feasibility of the proposed approach will be demonstrated by combining 2-D Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes and Large Eddy Simulation computations with the UCDS framework. In Phase II, the instability analysis will be enhanced by coupling: (1) 3-D CFD analysis; and (2) Improved UCDS process with more accurate treatment of boundary conditions and the flame.  The proposed approach will enable an accurate combustion instability analysis of rocket motors, gas turbine combustors, and ramjet and scramjet engines.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The model developed in this SBIR project will be extremely useful in identifying the potential sources of combustion instability, and ways to suppress them. The tools developed will allow mitigation of instability problems in the design-phase, eliminating expensive testing needed when combustion instabilities occur in engine testing.  The methods developed under this project will have wide ranging applications at NASA, including design of propulsion devices such as solid rocket motors, liquid rocket engines and gas turbine combustors  important in the design of the Heavy Lift Launch System, In-space propulsion systems, numerous planetary spacecraft missions, etc. The instability analysis methodology developed in this SBIR project can also be applied to high-speed combustion devices such as ramjet and scramjet engines, as the method combines the key advantages of both sufficiently detailed CFD analysis and accurate system-level modeling paradigm. In this respect, the tool will be useful to NASA's Hypersonics Program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The tool developed will also be useful to a number of industries, including gas turbine manufacturers for civilian energy and aviation applications. The tool will also be useful to the Air Force in the design of propulsion devices such as the engine for the Joint Strike Fighter.  The software developed in this SBIR will allow cost-effective design and analysis of combustion systems. The ability to avoid combustion-driven instability and investigation of high-payoff ideas will be possible. The final product will be marketable to OEMs and designers/manufacturers of gas turbines, I.C. engines and other combustion/propulsion devices which can be affected by combustion instability.  The tool will also be useful in missile propulsion system designs such as X-51, Waverider as well as Standard Missile 6 upgrades.  It will also be useful in the next generation launch vehicles such as Falcon.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR will develop core Yb laser technology that is higher than 50% optical to optical efficient with pulse energies up to 300uJ/pulse in the all fiber version and up to 5mJ using planer waveguide power amplifiers. This SBIR try to newest fiber technology  3C fiber as the gain medium fiber to improve the stability of beam profile, pointing and polarization stability to suitable for space working environment. The proposed laser transmitter is based on Fibertek's proprietary laser architecture that utilize state-of-the-art optical and ultra high bandwidth RF analog and digital electronic component technologies.<BR><BR>Technical Objectives of SBIR program:<BR>  Analysis and Design of high energy, high efficient fiber based 3C amplifier transmitter at the 1030 nm.<BR> Laboratory Benchtop Demonstration of 300uJ/pulse operation at 10 kHz with 1.5 ns pulse width and >17dB PER<BR> Design fibre-PWG hybrid amplifier and have PWG fabricated and tested<BR>Work Plan for Phase I:<BR> Model & optimize both type amplifiers' parameters for high energy, high efficiency and stability<BR> Build fiber based lidar transmitter and demonstrate proposed operation in the laboratory environment.<BR> Initial investigate on the PWG optical characterizations and amplification performance. <BR><BR><BR>

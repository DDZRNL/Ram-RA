		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal is directed toward the development of innovative high-efficiency UV photocathodes based on the wide bandgap III-nitride semiconductors for reliable operation at high temperature and high radiation environments for future NASA missions near the Sun and in deep atmospheres of Venus and Jupiter.  The proposed work includes the incorporation of these photocathodes on Al2O3-based high-temperature micro-channel plates (MCPs) for high-sensitivity UV photon counting and imaging

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Detection of light in the ultraviolet (UV) range (< 400 nm) has a wide range of commercial, scientific and military applications, particularly in those areas where the UV component of light needs to be analyzed in the presence of large visible and/or infrared (IR) backgrounds.  Gallium nitride (GaN) and its alloys with aluminum are the most promising semiconductors for development of ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors for applications in space-based UV spectroscopy and imaging.  GaN-based devices are also extremely robust and are suitable for operation in very high temperature (HT) and high radiation environments which is required for some of future NASA inner planetary and near Sun missions

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High performance photodetector and imaging systems are essentials part of the enabling technology for future space-borne astronomy as well as many civilian and military applications. This SBIR program is directed toward the development of novel high-efficiency UV photodetectors for these high-end applications.  Additionally, the same technology can be used to fabricate high-brightness electron emitters for applications in maskless electron lithography, metrology, and solid-state lighting. The Development of high-brightness photoemitters are also of great interest to government labs involved in high-energy physics for application in high intensity electron guns and beam-line injectors.

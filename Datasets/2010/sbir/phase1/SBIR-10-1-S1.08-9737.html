		<BR>
		Long term ocean measurements are severely impacted by algae growth. In this proposed work algae will be inhibited  by localized, intermitent microgeneration of chlorine from seawater at sub-PPM levels. This technology will minimize operational labor requirements by eliminating ship time now required for cleaning of these sensors, as well as preventing the release of caustic chlorine to the environment. The calibration of deployed, submerged conductivity/temperature sensors will be extended from the present period of 1 month to 6 months or greater. After phase II an antibiofouling generic design will be available for general ocean instrument use.

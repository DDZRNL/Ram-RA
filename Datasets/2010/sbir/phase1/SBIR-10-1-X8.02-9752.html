		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Quallion's intends to develop an all-solid 600 Wh/kg, flexible form-factor lithium rechargeable energy device for advanced space power applications. Quallion's approach is to achieve greater than 600 Wh/kg combines three key proprietary developments:  (1) a recently developed electrolyte, (2) a lithium surface treatment technology and (3) a high energy density cathode.<BR><BR>The all-solid high-energy density battery can meet NASA mission requirements. The system has a non-flammable electrolyte, making it safer than current state-of-the-art, but with greater energy and tolerance to abuse, making it ideal for manned missions. NASA would be able to deploy this battery without any risk of fire or catastrophe.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		As Quallion has many existing aerospace and military projects, the initial market for the developed system will be aerospace military focused. However, high-energy density, safe cells have the potential to be used in virtually any market  ranging from vehicles to consumer electronics. <BR> <BR>Expected NASA Applications: Manned Space Shuttles, Rovers, Crew Capsules, etc.<BR><BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA Potential Applications: Military Vehicle Battery, Military Aviation Battery, Medical Implantable Battery, Car (PHEV) Battery.

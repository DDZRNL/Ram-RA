		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal is in response to NASA SBIR Topic A2.08 in the area of "Variable Fidelity, Physics-Based Design/Analysis Tools".  The development of a coupled viscous/inviscid analysis tool for powered-lift airfoils and wings is presented.  In this context, powered-lift airfoils are taken to be airfoils under the influence of a high-energy jet, and include jet-flaps, augmenter-flaps, upper surface blowing, and circulation control airfoils.  This methodology consists of coupling a viscous jet analysis, using a finite-difference approach, with a potential flow panel calculation.  The method uses an iterative procedure to capture the effects of viscous mixing and determine the correct jet shape. The goal in developing 2-D powered-lift predictions is to couple this analysis with a pre-existing modified Weissinger method to accurately predict 3-D wing performance based on sectional data.  In this manner, high-lift wing characteristics can be determined at a fraction of the computational cost of CFD.  An MDAO framework for aircraft-level optimization will be developed with the goal of integrating the powered-lift analysis such that ESTOL concepts and technologies can be incorporated at the conceptual and preliminary design stages.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This tool would have immediate application in NASA MDO toolkits.  It would also serve as a useful resource in analysis of unconventional systems and allow for parametric design studies of powered-lift systems.  AVID's experience in software development with easy-to-use, intuitive graphical interfaces would also make this product a viable commercial quantity.  Potential customers include small-business UAV companies, engineering analysis and design groups, and universities.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA Commercial Applications would be similar in nature to the NASA Commercial Applications addressed above. <BR>

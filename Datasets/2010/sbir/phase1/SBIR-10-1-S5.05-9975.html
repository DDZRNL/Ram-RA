		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Current and future NASA exploration flight missions require Avionics systems, Computers, Controllers and Data processing units that are capable of enduring extreme low temperature environments of Deep space, Lunar and Martian surfaces.  With recent technological advances in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), it has become possible and feasible to architect complete System on a Chip (SoC) using a single FPGA.  Large FPGAs have increased number of gates per square inch with reduced power consumption per gate and include µProcessors with soft and hard IPs, Arithmetic modules, sizeable onboard memory and A/D included.<BR><BR>Our proposal in particular responds to the technologies sought that enable NASA's long duration missions to low temperature and wide temperature environments.  This Development is required under the technology prioritization list for Extreme Environment Technology.<BR><BR>As outlined in this proposal we will explore innovative approaches and introduce new technologies that will enable engineers to build high-reliability and high-performance, cold capable Space and Avionics  data acquisition and computers systems that are able to operate and perform in extreme cold temperature range beyond the standard military specification of -55 <SUP>o</SUP>C, surviving cryogenic temperatures over mission life.  Proposed innovative architecture will use an existing Radiation Tolerant/Hardened FPGA technology.  <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The operation of data acquisition control systems and data acquiring probes at cryogenic temperatures is anticipated in many current and future NASA space missions such as planetary exploration, earth orbiting and deep space probes.  <BR><BR>Some future NASA missions where electronics instrumentation is expected to operate in cryogenic temperatures are:<BR><BR>1-	MARS Polar Regions where temperature can be in excess of 123K (-150ºC).<BR>2-	Space probes deployed near Pluto must operate in temperature as low as 43K (-230<SUP>o</SUP>C).<BR>3-	Orbit of Jupiter at about 123K (-150<SUP>o</SUP>C).<BR>4-	Asteroids at about 93K (-180<SUP>o</SUP>C). <BR>5-	Lunar surface can dip to 117K (-153<SUP>o</SUP>C).<BR>6-	Average temperature near Saturn rings about 90K (-183<SUP>o</SUP>C).<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Low temperature data acquisition and controller instrumentation have a particular niche market within the US government, specialized academic interests (possibly sponsored by the US Government) and Communication satellites industries.  <BR><BR>Therefore the non-NASA commercialization strategy is based on marketing to the Aerospace companies or Universities that do direct work with both government such as DOD or commercial satellite industries such as remote-sensing and communication satellites that require electronic system operation at low temperatures. <BR><BR>Technologies developed as a result of this effort will enable electronic designers to build flight capable COTS data acquisition controllers and computers that are capable to endure and operation in high radiation environment as well as in cryogenic temperatures.<BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Science Mission Directorate is chartered with answering fundamental questions requiring the view from and into space.  Its future direction will be moving away from exploratory missions (orbiters and flybys) into more detailed/specific exploration missions that are at or near the surface of planets and small bodies (landers, rovers, and sample returns) or at more optimal observation points in space.  This drives a need for propulsion technologies that enable precision landing, hazard avoidance, in-space rendezvous, and ascent/decent vehicle propulsion.  These missions will entail higher propulsion system duty cycles, more challenging environmental conditions, and extended operation. Moreover, propulsion system objectives will need to be met with more stringent constraints on mass, volume, power, and cost.<BR><BR>C3 Propulsion proposes the development of an advanced CV engine prototype featuring an innovative combination of multiple throttling techniques to enable sustained deep throttling without sacrificing engine performance. The Constant Volume combustion engine is an innovative design that combines light weight, low pressure fuel tanks and operates at high chamber pressures. The CV engine has nearly identical specific impulse as a constant pressure engine with the same mass flow and throat area, furthermore, the nozzle optimizes at the same area ratio. It has exceptional thrust-to-weight ratios. It will be designed for high duty cycle, extended operation to satisfy SMD mission requirements. The suitability of this engine for a range of SMD missions will be proven through engine testing that demonstrates deep throttling capability, and the development of appropriate scaling laws that allow engine sizing to be performed based on mission requirements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Our goal is to develop a high duty cycle, extended operation CV engine that is at TRL 6 at the end of Phase II.  Our strategy to ensure mission pull involves teaming with a leading supplier of in-space propulsion products early in the development process.  This will ensure that the technology developed can be easily integrated within the current framework of the future missions of the Science Mission Directorate.  Furthermore, we will adopt a rigorous process of design for reliability, maintainability, and supportability early in the development process to ensure a balance of performance with cost and robust operability.  Upon successful completion of Phase I demonstration testing, C3 Propulsion will submit further patent applications for the innovative CV engine design.<BR><BR>Chemical propulsion will be the workhorse for NASA missions for many years to come and the proposed CV engine technology can play an enabling role in future NASA Science Mission Directorate programs.  The CV engine will be specifically designed for use with non-toxic propellants.  Its versatile multi-mission capabilities make it applicable for a broad range of missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications include the potential for use on military platforms such as Kinetic Kill Vehicles, as well as adaptation for commercial satellites using hypergolic propellants for orbital maneuvering and station keeping.<BR><BR>C3 Propulsion has working relationships with several prime contractors. We can work with them to establish a common set of requirements and system level characteristics to help us guide system design.  Involvement of the Phase III customers in the early phase of the project will maximize technology transition potential. Moreover, to increase our technology transition potential we work with businesses specialized in SBIR technology transition like, Vital Strategies, LLC.  Their brokerage services help align small business inventiveness with industry technology gaps as corporations make cost-effective responses to key national needs, as well as consumer needs.<BR><BR>C3 Propulsion actively protects developed Intellectual Property (IP) and works to maximize the potential impact of our commercialization efforts.  We have retained a Patent Agent to ensure that our intellectual property  and company trademarks are protected and can yield the maximum commercial benefit. For example, eight patents have been filed with the U.S. Patent Office and are currently under evaluation.

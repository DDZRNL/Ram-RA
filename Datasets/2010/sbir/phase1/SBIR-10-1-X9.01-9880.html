		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		During this program Fiber Materials, Inc. (FMI) will develop innovative yet practical methods for preparing Phenolic Impregnated Felt (PIF) materials for thermal protection system (TPS) segments and heat shield assemblies. Future mission flight environments and designs, such as those anticipated for Mars EDL missions, will require a variety TPS options to accommodate entry system designs.  The capability of the developed PIF solutions will address various vehicle shapes, integration methods and the ability to deploy a flexible TPS. Testing of mechanical and thermal robustness, heat exposure and surface recession under representative mission conditions will be conducted in a two phase program approach. The Phase I program will assess materials, designs and processing options that can be cost effectively manufactured and assembled.  The material approaches, design options, fabrication/assembly methods, Phase II work plan, Phase II proposal and final report are delivered at the conclusion of the Phase I program.  During the Phase II program, a mission-applicable PIF TPS utilizing the developed material system will be demonstrated and tested under representative flight conditions.  The proposed materials, designs and methods are currently TRL ¡Ü 3. It is anticipated that TRL ¡Ý 5 will be achieved at the conclusion of a successful Phase I and Phase II program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Stardust Sample Return Capsule completed its objective with earth reentry in January 2006.  Mars Science Laboratory Aeroshell heat shield has been completed and delivery of the Curiosity rover to Mars is scheduled for 2015.  FMI¡¯s successful fabrication of carbon preform¨Cphenolic matrix composite TPS heat shields in support NASA flight missions demonstrates the capability and basis of the proposed material system. FMI is prepared to continue supporting NASA mission thermal protection by providing additional enabling material options for a variety of thermal exposures. The program proposed will assist FMI in long term support of future NASA missions including Mars EDL development.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		PIF solutions developed under this program coupled with PICA would support commercial space operations including Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS).   During 2008, NASA entered into contracts with Orbital Sciences and SpaceX to utilize their COTS cargo vehicles, Cygnus and Dragon respectively, for cargo delivery to the International Space Station (ISS).  PIF can be enabling technology for all commercial space return or planetary missions requiring TPS.

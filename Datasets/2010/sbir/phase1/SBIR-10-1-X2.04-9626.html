		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This project will develop a high-temperature tolerant electrically-insulating coating for magnet wires. The Phase I program will result in a flexible, inorganic coating for copper, nickel, aluminum and their alloy wires that can be wound to produce magnets with superior thermal resistance. Eltron will produce a conformal insulating coating that permits continuous operation at temperature of at least 500 deg. C (932 deg. F), which exceeds current SOA coatings by 100%. According to NEMA, magnet wire is required for the production of 90% of all electricity. As industry attempts to shrink process size and increase output from these devices, their operating temperatures increase and conventional wire insulation tends to fail. High-temperature magnet wire allows for continuous operation under these environments. Few competitors exist that are producing magnet wire capable of functioning in this temperature range.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Electric propulsion devices such as Hall effect thrusters make use of electromagnets to steer and confine charged particles as an integral part of the propulsion system. Current designs are limited by the capability of the magnet wire to survive high-temperature operation. The operating temperature in current designs is a result of both joule heating effects derived from high current loads dissipated by the magnets and close proximity to hot plasma from the thruster. Improved insulation will increase the maximum operating temperature, allowing for greater flexibility in placement and design while also facilitating higher field strengths through larger current loads across the magnet circuits.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This topic addresses the need for functional high-temperature magnet wire coatings. Eltron Research & Development has the experience to produce a conformal insulating coating that far exceeds the maximum working temperature of current magnet wires while maintaining excellent flexibility and mechanical toughness. Magnet wire is widely used in most motors, pumps, power generators, alternators, power transformers, particle accelerators and MRI/NMR instruments. Providers within these diverse markets strive to reduce the physical size and increase the output of these devices. As a result, operating temperatures increase and conventional wire insulation fails. Eltron's high-temperature magnet wire will allow for continuous operation up to at least 500 deg. C (932 deg. F). No known competitors produce magnet wire with comparable functionality in this temperature range. In addition, the proposed magnet wire coatings are vacuum compatiblean advantage for applications in the aerospace and nuclear physics sectors.

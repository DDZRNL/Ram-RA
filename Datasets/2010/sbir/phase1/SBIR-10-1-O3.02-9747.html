		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Lynntech proposes to develop and demonstrate the ability of a compact, light-weight, and automated universal sample preparation module (USPM) to process samples from various sample matrices (blood, swab, etc) to yield high quality nucleic acids for downstream molecular detection and identification.  This unit allows previously complicated, labor-intensive, and time consuming processes to be carryout by a turn-key and closed system.  Current utilization of biological testing in the ISS is limited by available upmass, downmass, and crew time as well as by the capabilities of the interfaces and hardware already developed.  Our proposed sample preparation module can play a major role in achieving the reality of on-orbit molecular analysis techniques (gene array test, DNA analysis, DNA storage) that would extend and enable additional research and development activities in space, including the ISS.  This will enable near real-time space research studies such as space radiation exposure and enhanced pathogen (bacterial, fungal, viral) virulence in micro-gravity, to be performed without having to store and bring the samples back to earth for complete analysis.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The ability to carry out sample preparation using a small footprint device in a completely enclosed format will allow numerous molecular tests to be carried out in space.  Example applications include microbial detection in advanced life support systems, in-vitro testing for infectious diseases during space flight, gene expression analysis for radiation exposure monitoring/studies, and effect of space flight on microbial gene expression and virulence.  The USPM can be easily coupled with suitable downstream detection modules to expand its capability.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		With advances in molecular diagnostics, life science, and forensics, there will be a vast increase in demand for instrumentation that can handle automated sample preparation within a closed format to eliminate cross-contamination.  Other applications of this USPM include environmental monitoring, agriculture, and food production safety.  According to Frost and Sullivan's U.S. Nucleic Acid Isolation Markets Report, the instrumentation segment of the nucleic acid preparation market reported revenues of $60.6 million in 2004, and is expected to reach $133.8 million by 2011.

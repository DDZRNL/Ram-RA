		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		An accurate prediction of aero-elastic effects depends on an accurate prediction of the unsteady aerodynamic forces. Perhaps the most difficult speed regime is transonic where the motion of the shock wave and its interaction with the boundary layer are dominant factors. In spite of over 40 years research into the computation of unsteady transonic aerodynamics there still appear to be areas where available technology is inadequate. A research axiom is that if a particular viewpoint fails to resolve an issue then the problem should be viewed differently. The research proposed here is to re-examine some issues in unsteady transonic aerodynamics using some recent theoretical developments. All aspects of unsteady transonic flow, including limit cycles and control strategies will be considered.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The innovation will help NASA to achieve its goals for improving the competitiveness of national aerospace industry by introducing a more comprehensive understanding of unsteady transonic aerodynamics into NASA software. New concepts for control of the characteristic shock wave boundary layer interaction may significantly improve the efficiency air vehicles flying at transonic speeds.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The innovation will help the national aerospace industry and the Defense Department by enabling the development of more comprehensive software.  New concepts for control of the characteristic shock wave boundary layer interaction may significantly improve the efficiency of air vehicles flying at transonic speeds.

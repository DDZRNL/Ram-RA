		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Successes to date with the use of integrated software framework tools have led NASA engineers and other researchers to expand the breadth, depth, and sophistication of the problems that they are attempting to solve. Both the utilization of "high-fidelity" physics based models ("depth") and the total number of different engineering disciplines included in system models ("breadth") have steadily increased. As model size and complexity grows, the number of engineers involved in the development and maintenance of these models is also increasing. Increases in system model size and complexity and the corresponding need for collaborative model development are beginning to stretch the limits of existing software frameworks. Large models are more difficult to build and maintain, while the inclusion of more people in the development process leads to model management and coordination issues. Enhanced and improved framework tools are required if NASA and industry are to continue to expand their modeling, simulation, and design capabilities. In this project, Phoenix Integration will develop an innovative software environment that will allow individual engineers and collaborative engineering teams to better build and manage large, complex, system models. Key elements in the solution include a new infrastructure for hierarchical model building (models within models), enhanced data linking and model verification tools, and an integrated version-controlled model and data library. These tools will combine to provide NASA engineers with a powerful and flexible environment for creating, maintaining, and collaborating on the creation, execution, and maintenance of large and complex system models.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology will combine with previously developed NASA SBIR technology and other NASA funded technologies to directly support the goals of the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Program (FAP) and the Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) programs by giving NASA engineers the tools that they need to efficiently develop more comprehensive and accurate MDO system models. The end result will be a shortened design cycle, a reduction in errors and rework, increased innovation, and ultimately better aircraft designs. The need for a comprehensive and flexible MDO design tools extends beyond aeronautics and also encompasses other important NASA activities. For example, the framework will also benefit engineers in the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) and the NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD), as they develop the next generation of space vehicles and systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Beyond NASA, the proposed technology will benefit a wide range of high-tech organizations involved in the design of complex vehicles and systems. These organizations include other government agencies such as DoD, DOE, and DOT/FAA, as well as commercial aerospace and defense organizations such as BAE, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Pratt and Whitney, and Raytheon. Other markets include the automotive, green energy, electronics, process, energy, heavy machinery, and shipbuilding industries.

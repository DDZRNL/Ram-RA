		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		 For NASA's Exploration Medical Capabilities mission, extremely high specific energy power sources, with specific energy over 2000 Wh/kg, are urgently sought after. Such battery can be used to power the mobile oxygen concentrators. Current primary lithium batteries, such as Li/SO2 system, Li/CFx system, and fuel cells, have limited specific energy to around 500 Wh/kg.  Lithium air cell has over 11500 Wh/kg theoretical specific energy, so it holds the great potential to realize such challenging goals. However, the state-of-the-art lithium air battery development has encountered several technical difficulties, including air cathode performance, air management and cell packaging prevent <BR>     Driven by the strong market pull for this technology, Bettergy has conducted preliminary investigation into solutions to those problems. Based on our extensive experience in the field of metal air technology, we have come up with several innovative solutions. Initial results are very promising. With the support of this SBIR program, we will further implement and test our unique concepts in order to realize the full potential of the lithium air system.<BR>	 <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced high energy battery systems are now sought for use in the Exploration Medical Capabilities mission. Numerous mobile medical devices such as mobile oxygen concentrators require long durability power sources. This represents significant market opportunity.

		<BR>
		Market analysts suggest that primary battery still holds the lion-share of world-wide military and aerospace market and there is ever increasing demand for high energy density power sources. In this respect, advanced lithium air battery developed in this program could be well positioned to serve this market and replace the Li/SO2 and Li/SOCl2 as environmental benign, high energy density battery. Moreover, advanced lithium air battery with several time more specific energy than zinc air button cells currently used in commercial hearing aid devices can take significant market share in this market.

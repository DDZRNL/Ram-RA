		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed effort aims to evaluate the feasibility of using transpiration-cooled Titanium as the primary material in small-scale thrust chambers for in-space chemical propulsion applications in the 25-5,000lbf thrust class. This approach would allow for bipropellant thrust chambers that are almost 10-times lighter and significantly less expensive than current state-of-the-art radiatively-cooled refractory metal (e.g. Iridium / Rhenium) systems. In addition, since they are actively cooled, the proposed approach will allow for higher chamber pressures, thereby providing further reductions in thruster size and mass for performance improvement.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications for the proposed systems are expected to include maneuvering or orbit transfer in science and exploration missions, RCS thrusters for in-space maneuvering, first stage and upper stage propulsion for nano-sat launch vehicles, and planetary lander ascent / descent engines.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA applications are expected to include maneuvering or orbit transfer thrusters for DoD spacecraft (particularly those for low-cost and responsive access to space). Further non-governmental applications could include lightweight apogee-kick motors for commercial satellites as well as use by integrators of small space propulsion systems for commercial missions and small-scale reusable vehicle developers.<BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Graphene's tightly bonded impermeable single atomic layer of carbon offers unrivalled potential for lightweight flexible gas barrier applications. Graphene has been shown to be conductive, durable, flexible, and impermeable, ideal for wall material of inflatable space structures.  SMI proposes to demonstrate the material as the principal material in impermeable gas/vacuum barrier fabrics for expandable space habitats and structures, and develop a low cost roll-to-roll production process.  In Phase I, SMI produce 10x10cm graphene films and characterize them and refine the process for web production.  SMI will also design a flexible, lightweight graphene-based multilayer barrier structure for space applications.  In Phase II, the graphene roll-to-roll production will be developed and graphene-based flexible multi-layer impermeable barriers will be demonstrated.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This program will develop ultra-lightweight, durable, reliable, and flexible gas-impermeable barriers for the walls of inflatable structures for space applications.  This technology will prove highly advantageous for habitat design and construction.  In addition to structures in space and on the moon or other celestial bodies, this technology to develop ultra-lightweight impermeable fabrics has potential application for space suits, solar sails, and impact attenuation airbags for vehicle landings.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology also has potential as a transparent barrier for encapsulation of atmosphere sensitive technologies, such as organic LEDs for solid state lighting.  It also has potential application as a high performance filter material when patterned with precisely size holes, as a chemical sensor, as low-dimensional transistor, and as a flexible transparent conductor.  Development of the production tools and methods are essential to all these applications.

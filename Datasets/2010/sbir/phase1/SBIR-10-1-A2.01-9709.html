		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The identification of new, structurally sound, thermally stable materials for aviation applications will enable a wide range of technologies. The identification of new materials is hindered by the lack of information about compositions outside the existing composition space. New materials and new methodologies for selection of these materials are essential. Eltron will develop a correlational/theoretical approach to materials selection that follows its previous work in the selection of cathode electrocatalysts, oxygen evolving anodes for high temperature melts, solid electrolytes, and mixed ion/electron conducting materials. This approach will allow the exploration of composition properties space by the use of existing data. Phase I will develop and demonstrate a model for selection of new materials and confirm predictions by synthesizing new materials.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are opportunities for developing both new materials and a software package for prediction of new material structures and their properties. Eltron's previous activity has established a groundwork for development of such a package.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Stakeholders in this technology will be aviation companies, fuel cell companies, scientific software companies, and customers of these companies as well as DoD. Potential customers include the aforementioned companies. The resulting materials technology would compete with existing metal alloys and composite materials.

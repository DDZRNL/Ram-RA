		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The CubeSat platform represents a valuable architecture from which to develop satellite capabilities, payloads and technologies.  However, CubeSat spacecraft must be able to support a variety of payload options and mission profiles while providing high reliability.  A highly efficient CubeSat Electrical Power System (EPS) is critical to enabling these mission and payload requirements.  When compared against existing products, an Innoflight CubeSat Power Management Controller (CPMC) with associated CubeSat Solar Array Articulation System (CSAAS) provides game changing performance, flexibility, and reliability.  The proposed CubeSat CPMC / CSAAS solution provides 20 watts of on-orbit average power, accommodates various battery chemistries, supports ultra-capacitor technologies for high peak power payload, and is provided in a fully redundant configuration.  At the conclusion of Phase 1, Innoflight will demonstrate the operation of a prototype CPMC / CSAAS system for a representative CubeSat mission, bringing the system to a TRL of 5.  During Phase 2, Innoflight will complete functional and environmental qualification, bringing the system to a TRL of 8.  Following the completion of Phase 2, two sets of CPMC / CSAAS flight hardware will be fabricated and tested, and the system will be ready for flight demonstration on a CubeSat platform.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Innoflight CPMC and CSAAS products can be used to enhance the performance and reliability of NASA CubeSat missions.  Given the highly constrained volume available onboard CubeSat spacecraft, an efficient EPS solution is vital to maximizing the utility of these small spacecraft -- opening the door to missions that typically required either dedicated or full secondary accomodation on a launch vehicle.  Given the flexibility of the design, the Innoflight CubeSat EPS products are suitable for use on virtually any CubeSat implementation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Innoflight CPMC and CSAAS designs can be used on any CubeSat or more generally any low-power spacecraft.  The high reliability of the design may appeal to other potential government customers, such as DoD missions (classified and unclassified).  The low cost of the Innoflight EPS system will appeal to all customers, especially bus suppliers under a fixed price or per-CubeSat cost cap.  Finally, the high performance of the CPMC and CSAAS system should appeal to all CubeSat suppliers since there is nothing comparable on the market.

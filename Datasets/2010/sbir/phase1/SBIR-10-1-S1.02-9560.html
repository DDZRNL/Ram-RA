		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Teraphysics Corporation proposes to design and develop a microfabricated, 94 GHz, 25 W traveling wave tube (TWT) with 53% efficiency for NASA applications.  In Phase I, we plan to prove feasibility by completing electrical designs of all major components.  In Phase II, we would complete the mechanical design, fabrication, assembly, and test of a laboratory model.  To successfully complete this program, Teraphysics will apply our expertise in vacuum electronics focusing in mm-wave and THz devices; expertise in high level, three-dimensional, computational modeling; novel, patent protected, helical TWT designs for mm-wave and THz operation; and novel, patent protected, helical TWT microfabrication techniques. In Phase I, the technology will advance from TRL 2 to 3.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The advantages of implementing high efficiency amplifiers into NASA spacecraft compared to the current state of the art include lower system power requirements, reduced payload volume and reduced thermal management challenges.  The amplifier could be employed by NASA in applications such as advanced cloud and precipitation radars, advanced SAR, and telecommunications. In the area of telecommunications, this amplifier could enable very high data rate communications for links between orbiting satellites; planetary spacecraft; planetary surfaces and orbiting spacecraft; and deep space and earth.  This 94 GHz technology would also increase the volume of data transmitted for low earth orbiting spacecraft that are in view of a ground station only briefly.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Teraphysics has the capability to commercially exploit this technology, and it would have a wealth of commercial opportunity. The upper end of the mm wavelength band will be attractive to space commercial users because of the large amounts of contiguous spectrum that are available for broadband, high data rate, satellite and wireless terrestrial communications.  This is also applicable at E-Band where larger bandwidth is commercially available as well as around 140 GHz where there is more spectrum and fewer competing allocations.  The technology developed for the proposed 94 GHz TWT can readily be applied at E-Band or operation above 100 GHz.  In fact, the same 94 GHz slow wave circuit proposed here can operate at E-Band simply by increasing the beam voltage.  Additional applications include imaging for areas such as homeland security.

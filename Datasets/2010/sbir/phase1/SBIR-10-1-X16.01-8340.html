		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Monitoring the health and wellness of mission pilots is a critically important function.  Space flight has an adverse effect on the human immune response.  During space flight the immune system weakens and some herpes viruses that are typically latent begin to appear in the saliva.  Currently, saliva samples are taken in space and preserved for post flight assay.  The presence of reactivated herpes virus in saliva samples is an indication of a weakening immune defense.  RST Bioscience LLC proposes an innovative in flight assay to monitor the efficacy of the immune system in-situ.    <BR>RST Bioscience has designed a test that is perfectly suited for space flight.  The test will be small, light weight and easy to use.  The sample used in this test will be saliva, which can be easily collected through non-invasive means.  Results are delivered in minutes to hours.  The test is sterile and disposable, used sample is contained and disposed of along with the disposable kit.  There is no heavy equipment needed to process samples or read results.  The kit is self-contained.  Phase 1 will focus on assay development.  In phase 2 we will build and test a prototype of the disposable delivery device.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary NASA innovation is an in situ assay kit that provides (1) real-time assessment of immune function (2) early warning of pilot susceptibility to infectious disease (3) the opportunity to learn how time in space relates to weakening of immune defenses (4) the capability to map genetic markers that indicate resistance to the effects of time in space on compromising immune function (5) data that will allow for the correlation of specific environmental variables with weakening of the immune system (6) a chance to evaluate specific counter measures designed to protect and preserve the integrity of immune defense.  The innovation would enable scientists to better understand the risks of prolonged space exploration and to develop strategies to protect astronauts on long journeys.  We believe we are beginning at about TRL 3 in Phase I and plan to advance the technology to TRL 6 by the end of Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		RST will produce a kit for clinical use.   Current methods for detecting Herpes Zoster virus do not have the combination of features and benefits RST can offer.  Unlike existing products, we test saliva as opposed to blood or cerebrospinal fluid.  Our test is therefore much less invasive.  Any potentially infectious sample is contained in the completely disposable kit, which is discarded at the end of the test.  Our test will be self-contained requiring no capitol equipment.<BR> <BR>RST kit is based on antibody specificity.  This creates the opportunity to configure the kit to detect a massive range of targets by simply changing the antibodies.  Other disease agents, biological warfare agents and environmental pollutants are examples of the different types of molecular targets we could configure our kits to detect.  RST kits will require no electrical power and can be used in remote locations.  <BR>

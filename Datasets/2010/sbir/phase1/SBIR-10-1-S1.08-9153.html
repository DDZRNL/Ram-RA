		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The innovation is an advanced Airborne Thematic Thermal InfraRed and Electro-Optical Imaging System (ATTIREOIS).  ATTIREOIS sensor  payload consists of two sets of advanced Focal Plane Arrays (FPAs)   a broadband Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS)  and a four (4) band Multispectral Electro-Optical Sensor (MEOS)  to approximate Landsat ETM+ bands 1,2,3,4, and 6, and LDCM bands 2,3,4,5, and 10+11.   The airborne TIRS is 3-axis stabilized system capable of providing 3D photogrammetric images with a 1,850 pixel swathwidth via pushbroom operation.  MEOS has a total of 116 million simultaneous sensor counts capable of providing 3 cm spatial resolution multispectral orthophotos for continuous airborne mapping. ATTIREOIS is a complete standalone and easy-to-use portable imaging instrument for light aerial vehicle deployment. Its miniaturized backend data system operates all ATTIREOIS sensor components, an INS/GPS, and an e-Gimbal Control Electronic Unit (ECU) with a data throughput of 300 Megabytes/sec. It has a volume of 0.03 m3 and a mass of 20 kg. The backend provides advanced onboard processing, performing autonomous raw sensor imagery development, TIRS image track-recovery reconstruction, LWIR/VNIR multi-band co-registration, and photogrammetric image processing. With proposed geometric optics and boresight calibrations, the ATTIREOIS data products are directly georeferenced with an accuracy of approximately one meter.<BR><BR>

		ATTIREOIS is a portable airborne instrument that provides optical and boresight calibrated, precisely and directly georeferenced, and error-estimated surface emissive and solar reflective LWIR/VNIR multispectral images. By approximating 5 fixed wavelength bands of Landsat ETM+ sensor at very high resolution, it has near term NASA commercial applications of:<BR>1) Underflight satellites to support satellite measurement calibration and validation observations;<BR>2) Location and mapping of water-harboring subsurface caves and new sources of spring waters in the southwestern United States (Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah); <BR>3) Deployment in a UAV/Airship for either field-expedient or persistent launch range surveillance/intrusion data collection; <BR>4) Mapping of river, river delta, and coastal water thermal gradients, color gradients, and pollution. <BR>Its long term NASA applications include: <BR>1) Exploration of Martian water-harboring subsurface caves; <BR>2) Mapping the extent of certain Moon/Mars surface resources and identifying promising outpost/science sites and traversable terrains. <BR><BR>

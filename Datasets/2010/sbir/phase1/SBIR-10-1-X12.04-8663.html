		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This project will advance an efficient and lightweight energy storage device for Oxygen Concentrators by developing a high specific energy lithium-air cell. Specifically the project advances high specific energy cells by focusing on the catalysts in the cathode and anode protection of our existing cells under various oxygen atmospheres for NASA applications. Our high-energy air cathodes will be improved upon and incorporated into the cell designs. Several different chemically composed air cathodes will be investigated. Lithium-air cells produce power by the lithium reacting with the oxygen in the cathode. The anticipated result of the phase 1 project is a bench top operational cell (TRL4). Advantages of the proposed lithium-air cell include a high energy density, safe and lightweight design, and a high energy density cathode.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed high specific energy lithium-air cell has the potential to be used as a primary cell. The lithium-air cell could provide energy storage for astronaut equipment such as oxygen concentrators up to human outposts. This technology may also be used to power vehicles on the land, air or sea, and even rovers. The lithium-air cells are adaptable to near space and terrestrial applications.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed lithium-air cell has a broad range of commercial applications from storing energy for satellites in space to powering robots deep beneath the ocean floor. Lithium-air cells have the potential to replace other cells and batteries currently used to power electronic equipment. The strength of the system is its very high energy density and specific energy. Its lightweight nature and flexible design provide it adaptability to many commercial products such as cell phones and computers.<BR><BR>

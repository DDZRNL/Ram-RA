		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Adaptive control offers an opportunity to fulfill present and future<BR>aircraft safety objectives though automated <BR>vehicle recovery while maintaining performance<BR>and stability requirements in the presence of unknown or <BR>varying operating environment.<BR>Future aircraft are a natural application of adaptive control. These<BR>aircraft will be more fuel efficient, have longer operating ranges though <BR>more flexible aircraft structures.  This<BR>increased flexibility will result in structural modes being in the<BR>same frequency range as the rigid body modes.  The traditional<BR>non-adaptive control design approach to address the aeroservoelastic (ASE)<BR>interaction of decoupling the rigid body and structural dynamics <BR>will not work. Furthermore, the application of adaptive control<BR>to these flexible aircraft may result in<BR>undesired ASE  excitation<BR>leading to structural damage or failure.   Hence<BR>an integrated flight control system is needed for gust load<BR>alleviation, flutter suppression and rigid body control of the<BR>aircraft which works in concert with the adaptive control system<BR>for improved resilience and safety.<BR>MUSYN proposes an integrated approach based on linear, parameter-varying <BR>(LPV) control to the design of the<BR>flight control, load alleviation and flutter suppression algorithms.<BR>The Phase I and Phase II research will focus on applying and<BR>extending LPV techniques to model, design, analyze and <BR>simulate control algorithms for flexible aircraft.<BR>The objective is to combine the integrated<BR>LPV flight control system with adaptive control to<BR>preserve rigid body performance during upsets while retaining the load <BR>alleviation and flutter suppression characteristics of the <BR>nominally augmented aircraft. <BR>Phase I will develop a prototype LPV framework for modeling, analysis,<BR>control and simulation and Phase II will develop a comprehensive<BR>LPV software tool suite.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The immediate NASA application will be the X-53 Active<BR>Aeroelastic Wing (AAW) test bed at NASA Dryden. This aircraft will provide<BR>an experimental flight test capability for aeroservoeleastic<BR>control research. NASA and the USAF developed this test bed to<BR>investigate the use of wing aeroelastic flexibility for improved<BR>performance of high aspect ratio wings. The AAW test bed is <BR>an ideal facility to use the LPV framework for modeling, analysis,<BR>control and simulation. The proposed research will develop<BR>an integrated LPV flight control, gust alleviation and flutter suppression<BR>system for the AAW test bed. The performance and robustness<BR>of the LPV design will be accessed and compared with a baseline<BR>aeroservoelastic system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA commercial applications fall under two categories:<BR>(1) Uninhabited aerial systems (UASs) like SensorCraft, for <BR>     intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR)  and<BR>(2) Space, automotive and ship transportation systems. MUSYN<BR>or the companies it has worked with have already demonstrated<BR>the application of LPV control techniques to<BR>aircraft, launch vehicles, automotive suspensions,<BR>trucks, missiles and underwater vehicles. All these systems<BR>are seeing increased aeroservoelastic coupling due to the push<BR>for more efficient, lightweight structures. The software tool<BR>develop in the SBIR addresses a unique need that is currently<BR>only being addressed by European aerospace companies using<BR>proprietary software tools.  A  Matlab based LPV Control Toolbox<BR>would address a need in the US aerospace and<BR>transportation communities and complement the<BR>robust control tools already developed MUSYN.

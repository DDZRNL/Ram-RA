		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This NASA Phase I SBIR effort proposes to establish the feasibility of significantly improving coupling at fiber to waveguide interfaces for the manufacture of low loss fiber coupled components being developed for several NASA lidar based initiatives, including LaRC's HSRL program.  Efficient and robust coupling of single mode fibers to optical waveguides is essential to the performance and manufacturability of a variety of low loss, fiber coupled non-linear optical components such as amplitude modulators, wavelength converters and integrated waveguide-based photonic devices.  The goal of the Phase II effort will be the delivery of HSRL-specific waveguide components to LaRC that incorporate the improvements developed in the SBIR effort.  Once optimized, the proposed approach will allow for a robust, low loss method for fiber to waveguide coupling that will be well-suited for air-borne and space based applications, thus advancing NASA's requirement for state-of-the-art lidar technology with emphasis on compactness, efficiency, and performance.

		<BR>
		NASA has a need for a reliable, low loss method for coupling optical fibers to non linear (NLO) optical waveguide devices for airborne and eventual satellite missions, such as for HSRL (High Spectral Resolution Lidar), which requires the use of fiber coupled wavelength converters, phase modulators, and related integrated NLO components to stabilize the seed laser system.   Other NASA projects that would benefit from this technology include the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM), the Light Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) Mission, and the NASA Tropospheric Wind Lidar Technology Experiment (TWiLiTE) program, which need efficient, fiber coupled, high power phase modulators and frequency conversion modules for visible and ultra-violet (UV) generation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-linear waveguides are playing an increasingly important role in a myriad of photonics applications, some of which include microwave photonics, up conversion, infrared detection, IR generation, and bio-photonics.  In addition to its use with NASA's fiber coupled nonlinear optical materials photonic applications, the technology can also be applied for systems used for environmental and pollution monitoring, spectroscopic measurement techniques, stabilizing laser sources, telecommunications, and remote sensing. Military applications include fiber optic sensors in use by the military, as well as the private sector.  AdvR will be in an excellent position to capture a large part of the market where low loss fiber coupling for high power waveguides is a major barrier to market expansion. The development of a robust, low loss, high power handling capability, and low back reflection fiber to waveguide interconnect will result in wide commercial use in a host of photonics applications.

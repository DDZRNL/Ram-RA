		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to develop a non-thermal soot denuder for measuring chemical components of the nucleation mode particulate matter emissions from gas turbine engines, in combination with an Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS). This proposed approach will effectively eliminate the contribution of soot particles to the AMS-measured volatile PM mass spectrum. It is capable of identifying the semi-volatile composition of the nucleation mode particles based on their characteristic mass spectra and also determining the particle size distribution in aerodynamic diameter.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary NASA need for this technology is in its research programs to monitor nucleation mode particulate emissions from aircraft engines. In addition to AMS, other particle measurement instruments with an aerodynamic lens such as Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS), which NASA has used in its previous field missions, can also be integrated with the proposed soot denuder to monitor soot particles without the influence of non-refractory coating.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This proposed apparatus can be easily transferred from a soot denuder into a non-thermal nanoparticle purifier and could become a continuous and environment-friendly method to purify and size-select the desired nanoparticles in the same time. Such technique would have a great impact on the mass production of high-quality nanoparticles. The material and operational cost of this instrument is so low that there is little financial burdening to add it to the current available nanoparticle synthesis scheme.

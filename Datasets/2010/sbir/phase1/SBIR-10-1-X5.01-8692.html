		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is seeking innovative structure technologies that will advance expandable exploration space modules and surface based habitats.  To address this need CTD has proposed to develop multi-functional, highly mass efficient deployable composite structures.  These composite structures will build upon CTD's innovative Composite Rollable Extendible Slit-Tube Structures (CRESTS) and TEMBO<SUP>REG</SUP> shape memory composites.  The deployable composite structures have much lower mass and part counts than corresponding mechanical deployable systems.  These composite deployable structures can be configured to meet a variety of needs within Expandable Space Habitats, and significantly increase functionality.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Successful achievement of the objectives defined for this program can provide a significant capability to NASA and NASA contractors to aid in the development of many future NASA planetary and space science missions.  With the goals set by NASA to support the manned exploration of other planets, the development of innovative structure technologies that will advance expandable exploration space modules and surface based habitats is a necessity.  The proposed deployable technology will make significant progress toward this end by providing a low-cost, mass-minimized deployable structure that can be used to maximize operational volume and structural performance of a crewed or material transfer pressure vessel.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		CTD has also been working to adapt deployable technologies for a variety of terrestrial applications which have significant commercial potential, such as the roll-out footbridge or solar array described previously.  The proposed technology will add to a portfolio of useful structural concepts that may be of interest to the armed forces as well as civilians for terrestrial based structures that can be easily carried and deployed in the field.

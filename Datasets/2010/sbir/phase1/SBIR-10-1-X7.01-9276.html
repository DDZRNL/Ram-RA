		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal concerns the fabrication of a hybrid battery capacitor (HBC) using Eltron's knowledge gained in battery and capacitor research. Energy storage systems are sought for use in remote robotic systems for planetary surface operations. HBCs offer improved performance while minimizing costs.<BR><BR>Eltron has developed two different technologies that will be combined to create a hybrid device. First, modified graphite nanofibers (MGNs) with high power density have been prepared for electrochemical capacitors. Second, Eltron has developed a patented, low-cost synthesis method for preparing high surface area LiFePO4 cathode materials. Incorporation of the MGN between the LiFePO4 particles will provide an improved electrically conductive network that will advance charge transfer throughout the electrode, improving power density, cycle lifetime, and discharge capacity. We will also partner with an electrolyte manufacturer that has proven wide temperature electrolytes that perform exceptionally well at low temperatures.<BR><BR>In Phase I composite electrode materials will be synthesized and characterized. Lab test cells will be constructed and tested using galvanostatic (charge discharge), EIS (electrochemical impedance), and wide temperature testing methods. In Phase II we will improve the performance of our HBCs and work with a manufacturer to produce prototype cells that will be delivered to NASA.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is interested in advanced energy storage technologies for remote robotic systems. These systems cover all aspects of planetary surface operations. Examples of such operations include cargo transporters, power generation systems, inspection systems, site setup, emergency response, and payload offloading. NASA is emphasizing advanced cell chemistries with aggressive mass and volume performance and improved environmental robustness including temperature swings, solar events, micrometeorite bombardment, and abrasive planetary dust.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Hybrid battery capacitors with high energy densities, improved power densities, long-term cycling, thermal stability, and low-cost will find applications in military and civilian communication equipment. Lithium ion battery technology is also being developed for electric and hybrid vehicles for replacement of toxic, lead-acid batteries. Hybrid battery capacitors could capture a significant portion of the secondary battery market for electric vehicles. The market for Li ion batteries is estimated to be $8 billion in 2010. Market growth is projected to be 10% per year, driven largely by use in electric and hybrid electric vehicles. Materials that reduce cost, are environmentally friendly, and increase performance, such as the proposed hybrid battery capacitor chemistry, will capture a significant share of this market. Other large markets include energy for consumer electronic devices such as smart phones, laptops, and anywhere else where mobile power is needed.

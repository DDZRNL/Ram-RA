		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose the development of nanoscale superlattices (SLs) as the active elements of high efficiency thermoelectric coolers.<BR>Recent models predict that the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT can reach 4 for elements fabricated from HgCdTe-based SLs and<BR>could exceed 6 for related metal/semiconductor SLs. The feasibility of using HgCdTe and metal-based SL materials with embedded<BR>nanodefects for increased hot-carrier transport during thermoelectric cooling will be demonstrated in the proposed Phase 1 effort. We<BR>will perform calculations to optimize the material parameters of HgCdTe- and metal-based SL structures to maximize ZT. Next, we will<BR>use our extensive experience in molecular beam epitaxy to grow the designed structures. Finally, we will develop device structures<BR>and metallization methods appropriate for performing ZT measurements, measure the ZTs of fabricated devices and compare results<BR>with theory.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Thermoelectric coolers have long contributed to NASA missions. For example, thermoelectric devices cool HgCdTe-based infrared<BR>imaging cameras such as those on the Hubble Space Telescope. They are employed as refrigerators in various space science<BR>experiments. Thermal loop spacecraft temperature control systems employ them as well. The same materials also hold great<BR>potential in thermionic energy conversion. All these applications will benefit from the improved efficiency of Hg1-xCdxTe- and<BR>metal-based SL thermoelectric coolers, together with the already realized benefits of solid state coolers, namely reliability,<BR>ruggedness and low cost. In particular, the possible monolithic integration of thermoelectric coolers and HgCdTe-based infrared focal<BR>plane arrays promises major reductions in the weight, size and cost of missions employing air- and space-borne high performance<BR>infrared imaging instruments

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High efficiency thermoelectric coolers possess a myriad of applications including portable cooling and precise temperature control for<BR>electronics, optics and medical systems. Present commercial thermoelectric devices operate at about 10% of the Carnot efficiency,<BR>whereas the efficiency of a compressor-based refrigerator varies from 30% to 90% depending on the refrigerator size. The<BR>temperature differences required in air conditioning are usually within the capacity of thermoelectric heat pumps, but their relatively<BR>poor coefficient of performance prohibits wide deployment. An increase of the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT above 3 is needed<BR>before thermoelectric technology can be used on large scales and potentially replace current refrigeration and air conditioning<BR>technologies. Our proposed coolers have a predicted ZT above 3 and hence can play a major role in next generation refrigerators<BR>and air conditioning systems.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Deployable Space Systems, Inc. (DSS) will focus the proposed NASA Phase 1 effort on the development of our innovative Functional Advanced Concentrator Technology (FACT).  FACT is an affordable practical high-efficiency concentrator blanket assembly for ultra-lightweight solar arrays.  FACT coupled to an ultra-lightweight solar array structural platform (such as DSS's ROSA) will provide game-changing performance metrics and unparalleled affordability for the end-user.  FACT will enable emerging Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) Space Science missions, and other NASA missions, through its ultra-affordability, high voltage operation capability, high/low temperature operation capability, high/low illumination operation capability, high radiation tolerance, ultra-lightweight, and ultra-compact stowage volume.  Once completely optimized through the proposed Phase 1 and Phase 2 programs the FACT technology promises to provide NASA/industry a near-term and low-risk flexible blanket technology for advanced solar array systems that provides revolutionary performance in terms of high specific power / ultra-lightweight (>400-500 W/kg BOL at the array level & >1000 W/kg BOL at the blanket level, PV dependent), affordability (>50% cost savings at the array level), compact stowage volume (>80 kW/m3 BOL, 10X times better than current rigid panel arrays), high operation reliability, high radiation tolerance, high voltage operation capability (>150 VDC), scalability, and LILT & HIHT operation capability.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA space applications are comprised of practically all Space Science, Earth Science, Exploration, Planetary and Lunar Surface, and other missions that require affordable and high performance photovoltaic power production through solar arrays.  The technology is particularly suited for missions that require game-changing performance in terms of affordability, high voltage operation, radiation tolerance, ultra-lightweight, compact stowage volume, and operation within LILT and HIHT environments.    
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA space applications are comprised of practically all missions that require affordable and high performance photovoltaic power production through solar arrays.  The technology is particularly suited for missions that require game-changing performance in terms of affordability, high voltage operation, radiation tolerance, ultra-lightweight, compact stowage volume, and operation within LILT and HIHT environments.  Applicable non-NASA space missions include: LEO surveillance, reconnaissance, communications and other critical payload/equipment satellites, LEO commercial mapping and critical payload/equipment satellites, MEO satellites & space-tugs, GEO commercial communications and critical payload/equipment satellites, and GEO communications and payload/equipment satellites.  The proposed technology also has tremendous dual-use opportunities for a variety of non-space applications including both ground and roof-mount applications where low cost, manufacturability, ease of installation, compactness and high reliability is demanded.  A terrestrial version of the technology would allow for low-cost high-performance theater mobile power production for the U.S. armed forces, or mobile power production for the commercial terrestrial based user.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Propellant densification systems particularly for H2 require compression systems developing very large amounts of head.  Development of this head requires multiple stages of compressors running at high speed.  In the past these compressors have run on grease-packed ball bearings with very limited life.  This project will utilize special foil bearings in place of the ball bearings and not only greatly increase bearing life but also permit even higher speed operation which will reduce the number of compression stages and increase system efficiency.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This special foil bearing technology will allowhigh speed, more efficient and reliable operation of cryogenic turbomachinery used in many NASA applications.  These include propellant densification, cryogen subcooling for long term space storage, LH2 or LOX turbopumps and many other cryogenic pumps and compressors for ground support or space application.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are many commercial cryogenic applications where this technology could be used.  Specifically H2 circulators for neutron sources and flux reactors could both use this technology in applications that currently use short maintenance interval ball bearing machines.  Also many cryogenic high-speed He compressors are needed for cooling superconducting magnets.  Finally, cryogenic refrigeration systems require high-speed ompressors and expanders that would greatly benefit from this technology.

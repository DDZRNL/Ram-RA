		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has a need for process technologies that enable life support loop closure for manned exploration missions beyond earth's atmosphere.  A critical component in life support loop closure is the removal of carbon dioxide (produced by the crew) from the cabin atmosphere.  An attractive approach for removal of carbon dioxide is the Bosch reaction, where carbon dioxide is reacted with hydrogen (produced from water electrolysis) to produce solid elemental carbon and water.  However, no technology currently exists for the continuous operation of a Bosch reactor.  The process cannot be run in a continuous manner because of degradation of the catalysts, which are required to precipitate carbon at a reasonable rate.  In this Phase I SBIR, PH Matter, LLC will develop a catalyst for the continuous formation of carbon in a system fed with carbon dioxide and hydrogen.  Researchers will demonstrate continuous operation of the catalyst in Phase II.  Based on the catalyst performance, a reactor will be designed to allow continuous carbon formation without the need for regular maintenance.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The main application for the technology being developed for NASA will be as a component in life support systems.  As NASA plans longer manned missions beyond earth's atmosphere, the technology will enable continuous removal of carbon dioxide from the cabin atmosphere without the removal of oxygen as well.  These systems will be used in spacecraft, space stations, and planetary bases to maintain habitable environments.  On earth, this same technology can be used for submarines.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications for the technology could include improved processes methods for the manufacturing of nano-structured carbon.  The technology will enable scalable and continuous production of nano-materials.  Such materials could have multiple uses, including polymer composites, coatings, electronics, catalysts, sorbents, sensors, and electrode materials.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal is submitted to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of processing the space environment stable, multifunctional thermal control material system (TCMS) that can be applied to space hardware and can enables the hardware to carry higher leakage current through engineering the high electrical conductivity. An innovative space environmental stable TCMS is suggested through research & development work for the multifunctional, low (&#945;S/&#949;T) material systems that can meet these aggressive goals in cost effective, reliable manner. The suggested efforts emphasize developments in two material science areas: the first one considers the development of born nitride nano structure that includes nanotubes and nano mesh (BNNT-BNNM<SUP>TM</SUP>) and the second area proposes the synthesis and processing of various homologous compounds of Zinco-Indates that are recently identified as the high conductivity compounds with high refractive index. The material system that integrates these two technologies can allow higher leakage currents that may also help to defend against the natural solar storm events. The suggested TCMS have been derived from the available mathematical models for space craft charging that pay attention to the individual charge dissipation mechanisms and the molecular dynamics of the material systems as well as its thermodynamics. Thus the envisioned derived material systems can provide the needed reliable TCMS in typical space environments in (LEO), (GEO) & beyond. The reliability goal for the multifunctional conductive TCMS is to have a design life of > 10 years in LEO and > 15 years in GEO, and we anticipate the developments to mature by end of phase II ready for the hardware demonstration.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The concepts on the suggested nano-science inspired generic multifunctional high conductivity capable thermal control material system are suitable for the science and o exploration hardware needs and are geared towards delivering the reliable end products. These developments will contribute uniquely to the survivable material systems. The NASA missions that can benefit from its applications: Tether concepts. The missions that need white (low &#945;S/&#949;T) conductive TCMS coatings are: JUNO, MAVEN, GOES-R, LADEE GRAIL, JPSS, & SAA.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Like NASA, the commercial industry has plans for several satellites for the communication activities. The transportation authorities are also planning commercial space based radars. These planned candidate optimal fleet operations may require designs that require radiation stability along with the high conductivity for the higher leakage current carrying capability. Currently technology gap exists and no TCMS is available that is space stable and provides flexibility in leakage current. Success of this program spells fulfillment of this gap. Many commercial as well as the DOD platform hardware can also benefit form the fulfillment of this technology gap. Thus, the return on investments can be sizable and multifaceted

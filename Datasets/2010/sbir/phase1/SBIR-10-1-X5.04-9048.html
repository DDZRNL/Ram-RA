		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		ViFiLite is a wireless infrastructure that utilizes the advantages of a V-band technology in supporting data gathering for structural health monitoring as well as supporting high throughput local area wireless communication for  NASA applications. This system  provides: non-line-of-sight operation, wireline level reliability for the link, high node density, high throughput links, low delay data/signal, susceptibility to jamming, safe operation near ordnance/fuel for some operations, and compatibility with avionics data bus infrastructure. Our technology incorporates different techniques to utilize the 60GHz band based on the application scenarios to virtually eliminates nonLOS issues in the operating environment. The development of the proposed technology will allow for replacement of the wires for signal data and video communication onboard a spacecraft/space-vehicle platform and reducing risks resulting from the weight, the cost and the time of qualifying the wire-based architecture and the inflexibility of wired connections.<BR>

		Our technology incorporates various techniques to utilize the 60GHz band. These techniques can be applied based on the application scenarios and they virtually eliminates nonLOS issues in the operating environment. The development of the proposed technology will allow for replacement of the wires for signal data and video communication onboard a spacecraft/space-vehicle platform and reducing risks resulting from the weight, the cost and the time of qualifying the wire-based architecture and the inflexibility of wired connections. This technology can directly benefit the Habitat Demonstration Unit Project, the Desert RATS, the Exploration Technology Development Program, the Orion Crew Vehicle , the various Launch Vehicles program and etc.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This wireless high data rate cable replacement solution can be used in virtually all types military and commercial aircrafts. Each year tremendous amounts of resources is used resolving issues with aircraft wiring, such as hazardous insulation. Specific concerns with regards to a wiring include the old age of such aircrafts, which could lead to more wiring related hazards. Such hazards include autopilot malfunction, fuel tank explosions, and unintentional maneuvers by the aircraft. Such hazards and issues can be resolved with the introduction of ViFiLite on the aircraft. It would also save the military millions of dollars in aircraft redesign because ViFiLite makes the addition of new onboard equipment to be very easy.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Paragon Space Development Corporation proposes the use of an microporous-ionomer membrane pair to improve the robustness and effectiveness of membrane-based water separation processes.  Improved robustness and effectiveness will be evident through (1) reduced loading on the downstream post processor due to the ionomer's unique property of selective permeability, and (2) inclusion of a backup barrier between the rententate and permeate.  The microporous membrane's function is to prevent liquid wastewater from direct contact with the ionomer, a condition that would reduce the effectiveness of the ionomer.  The ionomer's unique characteristic of selective permeability suggests a possible role in water purification processes.  This activity is accomplished by means of the sulfonic acid groups.  It is this property that we wish to exploit.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Contemplated long-duration missions to the Moon, Near Earth Asteroids, and Mars will be mass-constrained.  The successful development and application of Nafion<SUP>REG</SUP> membrane technology to spacecraft water processing will lead to improvements in the efficiency, robustness, and reliability of these systems.  These improvements will in turn translate directly into safety improvements and mass reductions.  
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The non-NASA applications are significant as fresh water demands are becoming a serious problem at many regions of the planet.  The technology generated here may very well help improve the efficiency and/or portability of terrestrial-based water recovery systems.

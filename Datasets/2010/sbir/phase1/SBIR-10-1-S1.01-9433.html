		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Fibertek proposes a high energy and flexible operation 1570 nm pulsed lidar transmitter for airborne and space-based remote CO2 gas and doppler wind sensing. The lidar system is expected to operate with 5 mJ energy at 1 kHz repetition rate, and the pulse width will be adjustable from 20 ns to 1 microseconds. The proposed system is based on Fibertek's proprietary laser architecture that utilize state-of-the-art optical and RF analog and digital electronic component technologies.<BR>

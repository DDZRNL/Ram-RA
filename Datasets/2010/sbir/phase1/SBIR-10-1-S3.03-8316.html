		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Spire Semiconductor proposes to make an InGaAs-based three-junction (3J) tandem thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cell to utilize more of the blackbody spectrum (from a GPHS) efficiently. Semi-insulating InP wafers will be used for monolithically integrated module (MIM)compatibility and to achieve low free-carrier absorption. In Phase 1, we will design, epitaxially grow, and process large area single junction test cells for each of the three bandgaps proposed (to evaluate material quality), as well as for a full tandem cell structure. In Phase 2, we would further refine the structure and incorporate the material into MIM modules.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We estimate 50% more power may be available from the proposed tandem MIMs than for single junction MIMs developed previously to a 20% system efficiency for deep space missions using an 1100C GPHS, primarily from a voltage boost of about 0.4V/junction to 1.1V/junction in the tandem MIM.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This type of InGaAs multijunction stack could be adapted for terrestrial concentrator solar cells to increase efficiency from demonstrated 41% levels to 45% or more.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's Science Mission Directorate is currently considering various sample cache and return missions to the Moon, Mars and asteroids. These missions involve the use of a coring tool to produce rock and soil cores. The MEPAG committee recommends that core acquisition take place directly into an individual encapsulation sleeve with a pressed-in cap. The improved sample encapsulation technology of this proposal can be activated while the drill bit is still in the drill hole, thus preserving sample integrity before the core is even extracted. It also insures the sample does not fall out during bit extraction. The sleeves can handle cores of rock, soil or regolith; and are translucent or transparent enabling inspection of the core after extraction. They preserve stratigraphy, volatiles, voids and gaps, and incomplete cores. A unique aspect of the sleeves instills the ability to preserve core integrity even in the vibration and shock environment of a sample return mission. This proposed Phase 1 effort involves a design trade study, analysis and a proof-of-concept test.  At the end of Phase 1, the innovations will be at TRL 4. A proposed Phase 2 effort would involve integration into a core drill design, environmental testing, and shock and vibration testing to advance the technology to TRL 6.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Sample Encapsulation Technology of this proposal could be used for any sample collection or return mission to the Moon, Mars or Asteroids. There are two of three Phase A projects competing for NASA's 2018 New Frontiers Mission which could utilize the technology of this application. OSIRIS-REX is an asteroid sample return mission and MoonRise is a Lunar South Pole sample return mission. Additionally there will be a Mars 2018 sample collection mission to support a sample return mission in the 2020's.  The potential Mars MAX-C mission has been proposed by the MEPAG's MMR-SAG committee for this purpose.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are a number of potential non-NASA applications for this Sample Encapsulation Technology including earth sciences research and the oil and gas industry.  Down-hole core encapsulation is an important technique for the oil and gas industry during exploratory drilling.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose the concept of a tube map display as a means to effectively integrate schedule timeline information and fault diagnosis data into a single high value presentation. Tube maps are potentially a high value method of presenting multiple dimensions of information. This work will prove the feasibility of depicting combined schedule and fault information in the domain of asset scheduling using  a communications simulation testbed. This testbed will be based upon key node and link abstractions of the space, ground and deep space networks. In order to simulate how mission schedules are affected by faults, a range of communication path faults can be selected by a user and injected into mission scenarios in order to gain further insights into how schedules can be tuned in real time to changing conditions on ground and space assets. Injected faults are modeled as a set of additional scheduling constraints in exactly the same way as other physical or mission preference constraints. The uniform constraint representation used capture mission requirements, preferences, constraints and faults can also be extended to multi-criteria optimization objectives for the resource scheduler  enabling a mix of factors to drive the generation of the optimized schedule.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		1) Generation of feasible candidate structures for organic chemistry synthesis or biochemical reactions through the expression of fundamental functional groups, reagents and reactants on tube map displays. Such displays could aid the understanding and exploration of biochemical drug interaction pathways in research areas such as cancer and AIDS.<BR>2) Packaging of tube map interface functionality into binary or source libraries to augment interfaces for existing commercial scheduling systems.<BR>3) Flexible scheduling of surgical teams across a set of hospitals or operating rooms whilst coping with emergencies.<BR>4) Visualization of complex timetabling function such as optimized staff rostering involving a large number of staff and long time intervals with short notice absences and interchangeable skill sets.<BR>5) Redesigned alternative display for air traffic control that enhances the use of color, coding and criticality in such a way that attention is more promptly drawn to areas requiring immediate attention.<BR><BR>

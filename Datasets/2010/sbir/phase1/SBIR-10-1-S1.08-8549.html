		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Flux measurements of trace gases and other quantities, such as latent heat, are of great importance in scientific field research.  One typical flux measurement setup involves placing measurement equipment (sonic anemometers and associated sensors or samplers) on rigid towers (rigidity being required to provide a stable platform for the sonic anemometers).  These towers are relatively immobile, and cannot be readily moved nor installed in remote locations.  This prevents fluxes or vertical profiles of trace species from being measured in many remote areas.  <BR>	Anasphere will develop a tethersonde system which will allow flux measurements to be made using tethered blimps or kites.  The tethersonde modules will incorporate a three-dimensional sonic anemometer plus motion-correction sensors so that the motion of the tether and module may be removed from the wind measured by the sonic anemometer.  The result will be a highly mobile flux tower.  <BR>	In Phase I, a proof-of-concept tethersonde module will be built and tested which incorporates a three-dimensional sonic anemometer and motion-correction sensors.  It will be tested in flight.  Phase II work will see the refinement of the modules and sensor algorithms, as well as extensive field tests.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
			The new tethersonde will facilitate a wide variety of in-situ earth science measurements, particularly those related to science areas within the Atmospheric Composition focus area.  It may be used for the measurement of trace gas fluxes in remote areas.  It may also be used to conduct basic meteorological and turbulence research.  Its inherent mobility, as it will be deployable by tethered blimps and kites, means that it can be taken to remote areas and set up with minimal effort.  <BR>	The tethersonde system may also be of use to other NASA programs.  For example, it can provide local wind profile measurements in support of various flight operations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
			Other government and academic researchers will be able to use the system for the same purposes as were described above for NASA.  Additional applications for the basic meteorological and turbulence measurement capabilities will include aircraft flight test operations and weather measurements around forest fires.

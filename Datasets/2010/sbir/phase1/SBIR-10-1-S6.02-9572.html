		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Much of the earth science research data available is shared across departments and agencies and often made available to the public. But sharing isn't enough. As federal organizations increasingly consult one another for expertise, the need for functional platforms that foster collaboration becomes vital.<BR> <BR>The proposed innovation aims to develop the tools for open source geobrowsers, specifically: COAST (Coastal On-line Assessment and Synthesis Tool) and NASA's World Wind Java (WWJ), to communicate over local networks and the Internet to create a real collaborative experience over computer desktops, greatly increasing the quality of the decision support tools available to government agencies and emergency management, especially when it is most needed: just after a disaster has struck.<BR><BR>The ultimate objective would be to develop a fully interoperable virtual "geo-collaboration environment" of software and hardware that delivers accurate information on emerging situations while collaborating with distributed partners, advisors, specialists and authorities in various jurisdictions.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA would greatly benefit from the future development of the open source collaboration tool in everything related to intra- and inter-agency collaborations dealing with Earth Science Research Data.<BR>In a future phase III, the open-source geobrowser solution developed in phase II will need integration with existing NASA GIS and IT infrastructures to provide a common operational picture (COP) across the agency in addition to providing a "trusted information environment" that allows leadership to perform all critical functions even during urgent situations. StormCenter Communications, Inc. would offer its services to make this happen across individual organizations and agencies.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In a future phase III, the open-source geobrowser solution developed in phase II will need integration with existing GIS and IT infrastructures to provide a common operational picture (COP) across multiple organizations in addition to providing a "trusted information environment" that allows leadership to perform all critical functions even during urgent situations. StormCenter Communications, Inc. would offer its services to make this happen across individual organizations and agencies.<BR><BR>The solution would be designed to assist in all aspects of the disaster management cycle operation; from pre to post disaster, including rapidly deployable distributed networks to support larger geographic areas of first responders.  These networks are critical to coordinate situation awareness and decisive actions just after the disaster has struck. <BR>

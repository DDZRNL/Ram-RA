		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to develop a system that enables integrated and adaptive analysis and visualization of satellite network management data.  Integrated analysis and visualization will enable users to see important patterns that span diverse types of satellite network management data, such as the health status of network components, network resource levels, scheduled activities, and resource allocations.  This system will simplify the creation of linked visualizations that are implemented as tightly integrated displays showing time-oriented data, schematics, spatial data, and statistical graphics.  Adaptive capabilities will enable the system to select appropriate analyses and design visualizations automatically in order to answer higher-level user questions and show data patterns of interest.<BR><BR>During Phase 1, we will acquire a more detailed understanding of the data analysis and visualization requirements, design representative data visualizations, produce a high-level system design, and develop a software prototype that demonstrates the utility and feasibility of our approach.  The Phase 2 project will produce TRL 6 data visualization software technologies that support greater situation awareness, enabling NASA to diagnose and manage the SCaN integrated network and other NASA space vehicles and ground-based systems more effectively.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The resulting technologies will enable other USG agencies such as the Department of Defense, as well as their contractors and other corporations, to incorporate linked visualizations and automated visualization design within analysis, decision support, and planning applications.  These visualization enhancements will enable users to see complex patterns more easily and make better decisions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		These visualization technologies will enable NASA to diagnose and manage the future SCaN integrated network and other high-value NASA space vehicles and ground-based systems more efficiently

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To develop an Augmented Reality system that runs on a small portable device to aid crew in routine maintenance activities by providing enhanced information and situational awareness of their immediate environment. This system would improve the speed and quality of maintenance procedures, and reduce error and risk. The specific enhancements we will investigate include:<BR>- Overlaying devices with relevant telemetry.<BR>- Highlighting of items that require action, e.g., a switch that needs to be flipped, a hose that needs to be removed, or a bolt that needs to be tightened.<BR>- Information about consequences of actions, e.g., if the bolt is removed, this assembly will be detached or if the switch is flipped then this panel will be powered on.<BR>- Guidance aids through planned procedures or activities.<BR>- Navigation aids, e.g., where is the next device to be adjusted.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed AR system could be adapted to work interactively with ISS procedure execution. It could also be adapted to work in other manned spacecraft developed by NASA.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed AR system could be readily adapted to commercially developed manned space vehicles. It could be adapted to aid maintenance operations on a large military vehicle such as a naval vessel. It also could be used in commercial shipping and complex commercial systems such as chemical plants, refineries, manufacturing facilities, etc.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose development of new algorithms specifically designed to exploit the highly parallel structure of graphics processing units (GPUs) for performing the following most expensive, but parallelizable computations in combustion CFD: (1) Chemical kinetics source term (including Jacobian matrix) evaluation; (2) Transport property evaluations; and (3) Matrix factorizations and inversions.<BR><BR>The algorithms developed in this work will be implemented as software modules that can be easily interfaced with arbitrary CFD solvers for rapid computations using GPUs. A user guide will be delivered with directions for coupling the provided algorithms with users' CFD programs. Phase I work will demonstrate the computational acceleration achieved using the preliminary algorithms; and Phase II work will optimize the algorithms for improved performance and implement the algorithms as well-documented, distributable software modules as described above. This work will significantly increase the predictive capability of combustion CFD simulations by enabling efficient application of much larger chemistry models (which is essential, but currently prohibitively expensive) for accurately modeling the combustion of practical fuels. <BR><BR><BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The GPU algorithms developed in this work will complement NASA's combustion research. These new algorithms can be interfaced with NASA's in-house combustion CFD tools such as the National Combustion Code (NCC), to greatly facilitate modeling of combustion phenomena relevant for analysis of, for instance, gas-turbine engines. Specifically, NASA's capabilities for modeling emissions performance of gas turbine combustors, which requires incorporation of detailed combustion chemistry, will be greatly enhanced. Other NASA applications related to reacting flow simulations, such as rocket or aircraft propulsion or plume modeling, will also benefit from this project.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Successful completion of this project will also benefit a wide array of industrial and government customers outside NASA whose efforts involve combustion CFD. Customers in automobile and aircraft engine companies, petrochemical companies and energy companies could take advantage of the GPU algorithms to enhance their combustion CFD capabilities for engine design or process optimization. DOE, DOD and NOAA researchers could also utilize these algorithms for a wide range of applications, including combustion modeling, propellant and alloy formation, or atmospheric and air pollution modeling.

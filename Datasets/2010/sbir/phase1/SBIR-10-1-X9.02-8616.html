		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This program will mature and further develop structural syntactic foam insulated integral Thermal Protection System (TPS) designs and materials as an enabling technology for the highly reliable, reusable launch system.  This proposed SBIR program will build on Powdermet's extensive prior experience with SiC rigid insulators, CMCs, and ultrahigh-temperature coatings, combined with design modeling from MR&D associates that identified positive directions needed in foam-supported integral structural TPS systems. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications include future reentry vehicles and hypersonic flight vehicles as well as structural insulators for control and rocket divert motors.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non NASA applications include insulation for  high temperature applications furnace insulation potential for commercial space craft applications as well as rocket and hypersonic control surfaces from commercial and military craft.<BR>

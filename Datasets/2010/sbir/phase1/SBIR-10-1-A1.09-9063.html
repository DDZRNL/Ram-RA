		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		ZONA Technology, Inc. proposes an R&D effort to develop an adaptive flight control system which can provide near-nominal performance for the aircraft under off-nominal conditions, consequently reduce pilot-vehicle interactions. Furthermore, this adaptive control system is combined with a monitoring system to detect possible Pilot-Induced Oscillation (PIO) while both pilot and controller are adaptively working, in order to avoid PIO and enhance aviation safety. The proposed comprehensive combined control technique aims to reduce the interaction between the adaptive flight system and the pilot control action to a minimal level, when the aircraft experiences system failures, damage and/or upset conditions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Comprehensive adaptive controller for regaining nominal performance and suppressing PIOs can be used as part of a new generation Flight Control System, within the effort of Aviation Safety program. The enhanced aviation safety can further contribute to various research projects conducted in NASA.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The potential non-NASA customers for this tool include the R&D departments of USAF, Navy, Army, and major aircraft manufactures. It can be readily adapted by a wide class of aerospace vehicles ranging from current to next-generation designs such as: (a) USAF's F-22 and F-35 aircrafts at Edwards AFB, (b) UASF's Hilda and/or SensorCraft aircrafts, (c) USAF's next generation stealth and morphing UAV/UCAV, (d) DARPA's new Switchblade Flying Wing Program, and for (e) Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) with enhanced control/maneuver capability. ZONA Technology's reputation and track record in supporting the aerospace industry and government with ZONA codes can assure the success of the commercialization plan.

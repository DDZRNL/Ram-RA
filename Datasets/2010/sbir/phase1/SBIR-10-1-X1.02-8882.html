		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This small business innovation research is intended to develop a long-life, highly efficient O2-CO cogeneration system to support NASA's endeavors to pursue extraterrestrial exploration (Moon, Mars, and Asteroids/Phobos).  The cogeneration system will be built using a Tubular, Negative Electrode-supported Solid-Oxide Electrolysis Cell (Tune-SOEC) employing MSRI's most promising degradation-resistant ceramic materials and a unique cell design.  The system will be capable of co-generating breathable oxygen and CO fuel directly from carbon dioxide extracted from the Martian atmosphere, lunar regolith/soil, or from the cabin air of extraterrestrial human missions at 750~850ºC.  In Phase I, CO2 electrolysis degradation mechanisms will be investigated via nonequilibrium thermodynamic analyses and tests of Tune-SOECs with special embedded reference electrodes.  Unique solutions for long-term, high performance CO2 electrolysis will be developed and implemented.  In Phase II, a prototype O2-CO cogeneration system using the Tune-SOEC technology will be developed.  A proof-of-concept system will be demonstrated, cogenerating O2-CO directly from a CO2 source at temperatures ranging from 750ºC to 850ºC; showing the capability of using ISRU to generate 1 kg oxygen per day (enough to support 1 human).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The subject long-life, highly-efficient O2-CO cogeneration system will be developed to support NASA's development of In-situ Resource Utilization technologies, and will be capable of producing fuel and oxygen from carbon dioxide extracted from the Martian atmosphere, lunar regolith/soil, and/or from the cabin air of extraterrestrial human missions.  In addition, the same system can be used for H2O electrolysis, from which the H2 product is used for synthesizing methane (via Sabatier reaction) to support In-situ Propellant Production (ISPP) development. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA commercial applications lie in both the oxygen related industries and hydrogen markets, which are predicted to grow to $192.3 billion by year 2050 to support hydrogen vehicle deployment.  Some applications include: (a) greenhouse gas reduction, (b) hydrogen production, (c) synthetic fuel production via integration of renewable energy with Co-electrolysis of CO2 and H2O, and (d) energy storage (convert renewable energy into synthetic fuels).

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		SibellOptics proposes to develop an eye-safe, long-range, compact, versatile, all-fiber wind LIDAR system for wake vortex measurement and other wind measurement applications that is more efficient, and reliable, and at a much lower up-front and lifetime cost than any wind LIDAR system currently available. It is proposed herein that the fiber transmitter sub-system be ordered and built on a breadboard and characterized.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The fiber-based wind LIDAR system will be applicable to all wind phenomena measrements including wake vortices, wind shear, and gust fronts.  The LIDAR system can detect and measure winds out to 14 km and as close as 100 m with the capacity for adjusting range gates and measurement accuracy by adjusting the drive current via an operator interface.  The unit will also have an internal switch that will "wake" the system up or change operation mode when aircraft comes within range.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to the aviation market already discussed in detail in this proposal other industries that would benefit from the commercialization of a compact, inexpensive, reliable fiber LIDAR system are:<BR>1.	Wind Energy<BR>A wind LIDAR for both wind assessment and operations where its longer range (14 km) combined with an attractive price can be utilized to replace multiple LIDARS or anemometer towers.  <BR>2.	Yachting<BR>Maritime markets potentially include ocean-going vessels as well as subscription wind data and weather sales to harbors and ports.  There are four opportunities to address in this market: (1) the owners of luxury yachts, (2) the yacht manufacturers, (3) the yacht charter operators and (4) the harbor market where ships of all types operate. Potential users are comprised of both sailing and motor driven vessels.  <BR>3.	Meteorological<BR>Environmental scientists have successfully used the WindTracer<SUP>REG</SUP> system to accurately track the direction and dispersion of factory atmospheric emissions and volcanic ash. The WindTracer<SUP>REG</SUP> LIDAR has also been used by atmospheric scientists to study the formation of typhoons over the Pacific Ocean.  <BR>

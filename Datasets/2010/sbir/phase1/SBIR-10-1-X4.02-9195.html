		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA objective of expanding the human experience into the far reaches of space requires the development of regenerable life support systems.  This proposal addresses the development of a regenerable air-revitalization system for trace-contaminant (TC) removal for the space suit used in Extravehicular Activities (EVAs).  The proposed innovations are: (1) a carbon monolith sorbent, in contrast to the currently used bed of granular charcoal; (2) carbon pore structure tailored for optimal vacuum/thermal regeneration; (3) resistive heating of the carbon monolith for rapid regeneration; (4) low pressure drop; and (5) good resistance to dusty environments.  The overall objective is to develop a trace-contaminant control system that is regenerable and that possesses substantial weight, size, and power-requirement advantages with respect to the current state of the art.  The Phase 1 objectives are: (1) to demonstrate the technical feasibility of using a novel monolithic carbon sorbent for trace-contaminant control; and (2) to demonstrate effective ammonia capture and sorbent regeneration.  This will be accomplished in three tasks: (1) Preparation and Characterization of Carbon-Sorbent Monoliths;  (2) Sorbent Testing; and (3) Product Assessment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The main application of the proposed technology would be in spacecraft life-support systems, mainly in extravehicular activities (space suit), but after modifications also in cabin-air revitalization.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The developed life-support technology may also find an important application in air-revitalization systems on board U.S. Navy submarines.

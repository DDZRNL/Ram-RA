		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Integrated circuits in NASA spacecraft and vehicle electronics must operate over large temperature extremes and mitigate radiation effects that can result in upset and/or destruction of devices. PrivaTran has previously demonstrated a two-terminal, electronically-programmable resistor as a nonvolatile memory (NVM) element with performance metrics exceeding those of competing technologies, and herein proposes this device as a radiation hardened NVM array formed within the metal interconnect layers of the integrated circuit and fully integrated in a 3D architecture, resulting in significant savings in weight, power and reliability.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Radiation Hardened Electronics for Space Environments (RHESE) program primary customers are the multiple mission elements of NASA's Constellation Program, including the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle, the Earth Departure Stage of the Ares V launch vehicle, the Altair Lunar Lander project, Lunar Surface Systems elements, and Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) elements. Secondary customers for RHESE technologies include NASA science missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Non NASA commercial market also requires massively dense next generation radiation hardened memory devices to drive future growth and expansion of features in existing commercial communication and imaging satellites, as well as commercial space launch systems. DOD Applications include radiation hardened devices for space-based surveillance platforms, launch vehicles and MDA BMDS miniature kill vehicles; integrated sensor systems for imaging sensors used for automatic object identification and target recognition; friend or foe identification; and theater threat assessment.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		High throughput, fast detection and characterization of organic and inorganic materials have become important challenge for future planetary robotic rover exploration and planetary missions. Crystal Research, Inc. (CRI) proposes to develop a compact resonance-enhanced Raman spectral sensor that can provide highly sensitive remote detection and in situ characterization of geological materials.  Through resonance-enhanced Raman scattering by exciting samples deep in the UV region, we can enhance Raman signal intensities by a factor of 1 million or more compared with conventional Raman spectroscopy.  Furthermore, the proposed instrument is operated in a spectral region that is free of fluorescence interference.  Recent advances in highly efficient diode pumped true CW UV laser using a novel mixed laser crystal at CRI makes the development of such a miniaturized sensor system feasible.  The proposed instrument is a miniature, low-power stand-off sensor, ideal for future NASA in situ explorations.  In Phase I, we will develop all required building blocks and perform proof-of-concept demonstration. The Phase II research will be focused on the design, fabrication and characterization of a working prototype for NASA evaluations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The instrument proposed here will provide NASA a powerful tool to: "conduct robotic exploration of Moon/Mars to search for evidence of life, to understand the history of the Solar System, and to prepare for future human exploration." This technology is useful for a broad range of in situ measurements for: space science and terrestrial geochemical, geophysical and geobiological studies; planetary protection applications such as measuring/characterizing organic or biogenic contamination on outbound and inbound spacecraft; and for general application to high quality non-invasive, non-destructive measurement of trace levels of contamination on surfaces.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		UV-Raman spectral sensors have wide applications to include homeland security, life science, and matter physics and chemistry. It offers a non-destructive and non-contact method of analysis suitable for both laboratory-based and plant based applications.  In addition, a broad range of non-government commercial and industrial applications include environmental testing of water, soil and air; municipal and industrial water and waste-water quality testing; commercial product quality control testing of manufactured food, chemical, semiconductor, and other commercial products.  Furthermore, UV-Raman spectral sensors provide the unique sensitive fluorescence-free and real-time analysis of microalgae for biofuel production in renewable energy industry.

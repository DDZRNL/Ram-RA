		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR phase I project proposes a single frequency high energy resonant amplifier for remote sensing. Current state-of-art technologies can not provide all features of high energy and efficiency, compactness, and narrow spectral width. PolarOnyx proposes, for the first time, a high energy (100 mJ) resonant amplifier to meet with the requirement of solicitation. This proposal is based on the spectral shaping sub-mJ fiber laser at 1550 nm we have achieved in our labs.  In the high power amplifier stage, PolarOnyx proposes an innovative resonant cavity based amplifier approach by employing our patent pending proprietary technologies in hybrid high energy amplifiers, that will be able to operate at low repetition rate (10's Hz to 1 kHz) and reach high energy level of 100 mJ. These will make the hybrid fiber laser transmitter system superior in terms of wall plug efficiency (over 30%), energy(100 mJ), noise, size, and cost.  A tabletop experiment will be demonstrated in Phase I time frame for proof of concept. A compact prototype will be delivered in Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Immediate NASA applications include Doppler Wind Lidar, DESDynI, LISA, coherent communications, laser tracking systems and coherent lidars applications. By frequency doubling to 532 nm and quadrupling to 266 nm, it will be able to find other applications for optical sensing systems. Other military applications include coherent systems for airborne lidars and laser transmitter for satellite communications

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are a number of potential applications for the proposed high power fiber laser transmitter system:<BR>	Medical equipment and biomedical instrumentation. The high power laser can be applied to ophthalmology, refractive surgery, photocoagulation, general surgery, therapeutic, imaging, and cosmetic applications. Biomedical instruments include those involved in cells or proteins, cytometry, and DNA sequencing; laser Raman spectroscopy, spectrofluorimetry, and ablation; and laser based microscopes.<BR>	Military / aerospace. The proposed fiber laser can be directly used in military applications, and space, aircraft, and satellite applications such as LIDAR systems, remote sensing system, illuminator system, and phase array antenna system. <BR>	Optical fiber communications. Tunable lasers represent the next generation of critical optical components needed to build the local optical networks of the future and cable TVs that will deliver increased communication bandwidth and improved Quality of Service (QoS) to local access users. The market for the application is growing and will be of great potential. RHK reported the tunable lasers will have a market potential of 800 millions dollars in 2006 as a result of applications of local optical networks and cable TVs. With successful development of the fiber lasers, the technology proposed by PolarOnyx will provide a vital tool to solve the existing and potential issues and merge with the huge market of optical fiber communications. <BR>

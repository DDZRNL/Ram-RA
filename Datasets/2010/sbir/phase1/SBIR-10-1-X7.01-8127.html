		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The objective of this proposal is to develop a hybrid battery-ultra capacitor storage system that powers human-robotic systems in space missions. Space missions involving human-robotic systems utilizing battery based electrical power often undergo numerous operations within each complete cycle. During Phase I of this program Yardney in collaboration with Maxwell Technologies propose to develop a hybrid system consisting of a high energy Li-ion battery, high power ultracapacitor (UCAP) and the electronic interface control module. The hybrid system to be developed in this program will provide electrical energy to human-robotic systems for advanced next generation space missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		 The target application for this Li/UCAP hybrid system is to supply electrical energy to remote human-robotic systems in space missions. Such a hybrid system will meet the power requirements of the robotic systems at various operations. Employing ultra capacitor and batteries in a hybrid systems will enable high power during short duty cycles without adversely impacting the high energy Li-ion battery. Hybrid system will have superior electrochemical performance at high and moderate duty operations due to the integration of a high energy Li-ion battery, high power ultra capacitor and the electronic interface control unit module. A hybrid battery-UCAP system can be used where mobility and ground operations, long life, safety, longer cycle life, and long-term stability are required.

		<BR>
		Li-ion/UCAP hybrid systems with high power and long life will benefit all DoD, National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) spacecraft applications, military and commercial communication satellites and even Hybrid Electric Vehicles.

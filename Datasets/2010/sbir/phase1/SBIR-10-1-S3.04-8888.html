		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Physical Sciences Inc. and AMPAC In-space Propulsion propose to develop a unique chemical propulsion system for the next generation NASA science spacecraft and missions that is compact, lightweight, and can operate with high reliability over extended periods of time and under wide range of thermal environments.  The system uses a storable, low toxicity, monopropellant as its working fluid.  Under this SBIR program we propose to investigate applications of this monopropellant to the design of in-space propulsion systems appropriate for NASA planetary spacecraft and missions.  In Phase I, we propose to experimentally characterize the propellant ignition and combustion processes in detail and use the data to develop design concepts for a liquid monopropellant thruster.  In Phase II, we propose to develop and deliver a small scale proof-of-concept engineering prototype thruster.  Upon successful technology development under the SBIR program, full-scale protoflight and space flight propulsion systems applicable to specific missions will be developed in Phase III NASA programs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's future science missions need propulsion systems with demanding performance in challenging environmental conditions, with long operational life, and with high duty cycle.  Examples of missions enabled by the proposed propulsion technology include sampling atmospheres of planets, their moons, and other small bodies, descent and landing on their surfaces, returning soil samples from their surfaces in ascent modules, and rendezvous and docking with orbiting mother ships.  Missions to the earth's moon, Venus, Mars and its moons, moons of Jupiter, and asteroids are envisioned for applications of our propulsion technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Applications of the proposed technology to non-NASA agencies include the Air Force and the Army.  Specifically, the Air Force is interested in liquid thrusters for in-space propulsion and the Army is interested in the development of green monopropellant based high pressure gas generators for pressurizing gelled propellants.  Other potential DoD applications include liquid engines for propelling highly maneuverable, throttlable tactical missiles.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Volcanic research is a significant part of the "Earth Surface & Interior" focus area of the NASA Earth Science program. Of particular interest are sensors for measuring the chemical composition and emission rate of gases released by volcanoes, from magma to the atmosphere, both prior to and during eruptions. The vast majority of ground based plume observations concern sulfur dioxide (SO2), the third most abundant volcanic gas. Sulfur dioxide measurements provide valuable information concerning the masses and motions of underground magmas. Vista Photonics proposes an innovative self-calibrating optical technology for sensitive and selective in situ measurement of SO2 in volcanic gas plumes. The self-calibrating feature is intended to maintain the specified performance characteristics under harsh operating conditions. Phase I research will focus on demonstrating the feasibility of the innovative SO2 detector and outline the design of the Phase II prototype instrument. Successful completion of this program will lead to development of an inexpensive, compact, self-contained, lightweight SO2 measurement instrument suitable for use on a variety of ground based and airborne platforms including remotely operated aircraft and surface craft.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology meets the needs of the "In Situ Airborne, Surface, and Submersible Instruments for Earth Science" subtopic of the NASA SBIR Science Program. The technology developed under this research program will provide a new tool for in situ measurement of SO2 in volcanic plumes. These measurements performed both prior to and during eruptions are very important for improving the accuracy of volcanic hazard assessment and eruption forewarnings. The envisioned target instrument will be compact, low weight and inexpensive to meet the strict requirements to qualify for use on a variety of ground based and airborne platforms in harsh environment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology has a variety of non-NASA commercial power and energy applications such as assessment of sulfur content in fossil fuels, which is important for fuel cell based electric power generation fueled with natural gas, gasified coal, or liquid hydrocarbons.  Also, sulfur dioxide is one of the six "criteria pollutants" listed in the Clean Air Act; therefore, the technology will also be of interest to the atmospheric science and environmental monitoring communities.

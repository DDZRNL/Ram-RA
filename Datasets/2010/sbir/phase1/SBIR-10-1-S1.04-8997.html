		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase I SBIR proposes to develop high quantum efficiency (QE) and low dark current infrared epitaxy materials based on Type II Strained Layer Superlattice (SLS) for space-based sensor applications. The epi materials will be grown with Sb-capable multi-wafer production Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) reactor at IntelliEPI.  The initial goal includes achieving QE of at least 50% with MWIR spectral wavelength band in the 2.5 to 5 um.  The SLS detector design will be done in collaboration with Dr. Sarath Gunapla's infrared device group at JPL to ensure that the effort addresses NASA needs.  Advanced structure design incorporating barriers will be used to reduce dark current.  If successful, a Focal Plane Array may be fabricated during Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Completion of this SBIR will enable Type II SLS technology to serve as a platform for the next generation of high performance and large format infrared FPAs. This will be a further performance enhancement to the on going SLS technology being developed at JPL. SLS will be an enabling technology for the exotic and often very specialized infrared imaging NASA needs such as this high sensitivity and high operating temperature sensor for space-based applications. As a band-gap engineered device, the spectral response for SLS can also be custom tailored to suit NASA or customer specialty needs. GaSb being a III-V-based is particularly attractive because it can be processed in conventional III-V compound semiconductor fab line.  Because SLS couples to normal incident radiation, no complex coupling schemes such as grating is requiredthus significantly simplifies device processing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		With the success of this SBIR to develop resonant Type II SLS technology, both the military and commercial markets stand to benefit greatly. The SLS technology offers the opportunity to realize very high sensitivity thermal imager operating at higher operating temperature from mid wave to long wavelength, and to very long wavelength infrared based on readily available GaSb substrates. With GaSb material system, very large format FPA will be possible.  Currently, 4" diameter substrate is already available.  Further, p-QWIP can piggy back on the III-V semiconductor industry for rapid product ramp up. For the military, this opens the door for more vehicles/platforms to be outfitted with these high performance cameras. Commercial business such as environmental or gas sensing can benefit from very competitive eventual cost structure.

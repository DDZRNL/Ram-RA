		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Rocketstar Robotics proposes the development of a gearbox that uses all ball rolling contact for the highest loaded output gear reduction stage(s), is dry film lubricated and limits peak stresses to the well documented threshold limitation of dry film lubricants.  Extensive test data exists in the literature for the reliable application of dry film lubricants in ball bearing applications.  A gear reducer that utilizes ball bearing gear elements as the gear reducers highest loaded components will provide high specific torque and reliable, long life performance consistent with existing test data.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Some potential NASA applications include; Mars landers/rovers, Earth and non-Earth Moon landers/rovers, asteroid exploration landers/rovers, on-orbit or space based cryogenic applications such as space telescopes and instruments, extreme environment antenna pointing mechanisms and robotics applications as well as rocket engine fuel management applications.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The potential uses for this technology for commercial applications are too numerous to name them all however some examples might be deep sea robotics and actuators for science, military or oil drilling applications, arctic or ant-arctic applications, high altitude air vehicle applications, and industrial low temperature applications.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Optimax VIBE process is a full-aperture, conformal polishing process<BR>incorporating high frequency motion that rapidly removes sub-surface<BR>damage in a VIBE pre-polish step and eliminates mid-spatial frequency<BR>(MSF) errors created by deterministic polishing in a VIBE finishing step.<BR>This Phase I feasibility study will focus on the VIBE finishing step to<BR>remove undesirable MSF errors while at the same time maintaining the<BR>desired low spatial frequency form accuracy.

		<BR>
		VIBE technology to reduce and/or eliminate mid-spatial frequency errors has potential to be used for optics in many applications.  Specifically those applications that are susceptible to small angle scatter sometimes referred to as flare.  The International X-Ray Observatory (IXO), consisting of 361 grazing incidence nested, azimuthally segmented shell mirrors, is susceptible to mid-spatial frequency errors.  These thin (0.4mm) mirrors are produced through a thermal slumping technique where a thin glass substrate replicates the shape of a mandrel (fused quartz or stainless steel).  The current budgeted error for the IXO mandrels is 1.4nm rms over the 2  20mm spatial frequency range.  In addition, exo-planet imaging systems require minimal scattering due to mid-spatial frequency errors on their primary and secondary mirrors.  An example is the specification for the Jovian planet finder optical system was less than 1nm rms in the 4  50cycles/aperture range.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA commercial applications include high energy laser systems, EUV optics (lithography), imaging systems and X-ray synchrotrons.  High energy laser applications, such as Inertial Confinement Fusion National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory are susceptible to mid-spatial frequency errors.  The MSF errors are a source of damaging intensity, specifically in the region of 120ìm  33mm.  In EUV lithography, flare is a significant problem.  Flare as mentioned earlier is directly associated with mid-spatial frequency error.  The mid-spatial frequency errors cause light to scatter into small angles and reduce image contrast.  The specific mid-spatial frequency region of interest to the EUV lithography community is between 1ìm  2mm.  The mid-spatial frequency error scales as 1/(lambda)^2, which causes an increasingly significant problem as the lithography industry heads toward shorter and shorter wavelength systems.

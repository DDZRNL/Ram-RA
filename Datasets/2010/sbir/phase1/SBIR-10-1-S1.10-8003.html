		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This project addresses the need for higher data rate recording capability, increased correlation speed and flexibility needed for next generation VLBI systems. <BR>The proposed solution utilizes an innovative software defined platform with standard interfaces to commodity hardware, using advances in multi-core, multi-processing, and graphics processors, technology, combined with streaming data and storage concepts developed in the defense community. <BR>The result is an open architecture, commodity hardware based software defined, flexible correlator and data recorder at low cost that provides future scalability and maintainability. The system will have separable well defined components that can be changed over time increasing system life while decreasing maintenance cost. <BR>Performance target is to do >8gbps continuous recording, enable 16gbps recording and show even higher speed in burst mode, then provide a feasibility study for a software correlator capable of 32 stations at 16gbps per station, all with commercially off the shelf components<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed system has applicability in both the research community as well as in the commercial world. We see this system for the VLBI community as the first step to a fully usable base system that can be used within the community in low volumes (few hundred units) with a relatively large amount of media. This system shall be easily maintainable over time combined with a clear upgrade path with planned obsolescence and increased bandwidths. <BR><BR>XCube intends to serve the community with assembly, service, test and deployment but will also support use of other off the shelf systems within the VLBI community. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The work with the data recorder and correlator architecture is today applied by XCube in the Automotive Active safety area. The challenge in the automotive space with vehicles carrying multiple radar system, cameras and LIDAR, is that the there is an immense amount of data that is then processed and fused on-board the vehicle to assist the driver, keeping the car in the lane, avoid collisions, prepare for crash, identify pedestrians, road signs and other important information. <BR>There is a huge challenge in verification of active safety algorithms and repeatability of tests. Many expeditions simply can't be done again without huge costs, and even then there is no guarantee that a particular situation occur again. Therefore there is a need for a high-speed, high capacity portable data recorder and means for re-simulation and playback of raw-signal history collected directly in the vehicles. XCube has built systems for this application and intends to extend them to the VLBI2010 component concept and to be able to record at >20gbps

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This 2010 NASA SBIR Phase 1 proposal for an innovative Low-Field Vector Magnetometer (V-400-LF) is a response to subtopic S1.06 Particles and Field Sensors and Instrument Enabling Technologies. The V-400-LF instrument is intended for making high-resolution magnetic field measurements of planets and in interplanetary space on small satellites and spacecraft. The Phase 1 effort includes development of designs for advanced miniaturized components and a conceptual design for a miniaturized V-400-LF instrument in order to establish the feasibility of designing and fabricating a prototype V 400-LF in Phase 2. Laser-pumped helium magnetometers have proven to be world-class instruments for measuring the direction and magnitude of the geomagnetic and planetary fields. The V-400-LF will build on the heritage of the Low-field Vector Helium Magnetometer (LVHM), the Scalar Helium Magnetometer (SHM), and the laser-pumped vector/scalar Self-calibrating Vector Helium Magnetometer (SVHM). The goal of Phase 1 is development of a conceptual design for a miniaturized instrument appropriate for small spacecraft and microsatellites. This miniaturization will be accomplished through the use of advanced miniaturized components and packaging methods for the V-400-LF Sensor and Electronics. The V-400-LF can be used to measure vector components of low magnetic fields, scalar gradients (difference of vector magnitude measurements from two V-400-LF instruments), and gradient tensor elements (difference between vector components using three or more instruments) with very high stability and accuracy. The V-400-LF will have a dynamic range of +/- 1,000 nT, a sensitivity of 10 pT/rtHz at 1 Hz, and a calibrated accuracy of +/- 0.5 nT. The sample rate will be 430 Hz. The TRL is expected to be 4 at the end of the Phase 1 contract.

		The V-400-LF is intended for NASA spacecraft and satellites that will measure low magnetic fields in interplanetary space as part of heliophysics investigations or studies of planets and planetoids that do not have a strong magnetic field. With modifications to increase the dynamic range, other opportunities include future microsatellite missions and proposed magnetic surveys in cooperation with NASA, USGS, and NOAA. The vector laser magnetometers are also under consideration for volcanic eruption predictions and geo-potential changes in the Earth's crust associated with earthquakes and subduction zones. The miniaturized V-400-LF will find wide application in future missions focused on the accurate measurement of the magnetic field components and their orientation in low-field regions. Applications of the technology developed in this SBIR project include advanced instruments for airborne, satellite, and surface measurements of magnetic fields on Earth and for other bodies in the Solar System. The V-400-LF instrument, with its high accuracy, stability, and sensitivity along with a compact size, will also be a superior vector magnetometer for reference, calibration, and measurement applications in large magnetic coil facilities or shielded facilities that can reduce the magnitude of the magnetic field for evaluation of spacecraft components.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The V-400-LF technology with higher dynamic range can be used for surface and airborne magnetic prospecting. Polatomic is jointly exploring use of the V-400-LF technology in a tensor gradiometer configuration for mineral and petroleum exploration with Southern Methodist University. In addition, there is a need for improved high-resolution magnetic mapping and magnetic location systems for marine industries. The V-400-LF technology in a tensor gradiometer configuration could provide increased resolution for marine mapping of magnetic buried objects, pipe lines, buried cables and ship wreck search and salvage. The V-400-LF magnetometer and gradiometer can be easily mated to magnetic gradiometer software for such purposes. Furthermore, the V 400-LF technology will have applications in UAVs and UUVs used for sea surveillance for Anti-Submarine Warfare and for over-land surveillance for tanks under trees, tunnels, and underground facilities. Polatomic's vector magnetometers are being considered by the Office of Naval Research for use on a Navy Global Hawk (BAMS) for geomagnetic noise reduction for submarine dipole detection. Polatomic is pursuing opportunities in magnetic detection of tunnels and underground facilities with Argon ST that have applications for border security and monitoring. The V-400-LF gradiometer technology can potentially be used to locate unexploded ordinance, a world wide humanitarian issue.

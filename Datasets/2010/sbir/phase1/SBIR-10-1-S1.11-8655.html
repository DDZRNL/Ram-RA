		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In response to NASA's solicitation for light-weight and power efficient instruments that enable elemental and/or mineralogy analysis, Q-Peak, together with Firestar Technology and the Colorado School of Mines, proposes to develop a compact, robust and efficient, instrument capable of performing, Laser-Raman Spectroscopy and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS).  The main advantages in using these techniques for planetary science is the ability to rapidly collect a wealth of chemical information, by simply directing a laser beam on remote targets of interest. As an important component of the Raman/LIBS instrument, Q Peak proposes to develop, build, and test a miniature Q-switched, solid state laser, producing 1-3 mJ, nanosecond-duration pulses at 526 nm wavelength.  We will produce a preliminarily design for integrating the laser into a robotic arm. The proposed work will utilize a low-pressure uLIBS investigation facility, and spectrometer and available at the Colorado School of Mines, and a processing algorithm development begun under an ASTID award.  We will initiate the design review to integrate the uLIBS system into the CHAMP-SLS microscope, a spaceflight qualifiable microscope with a laser spectroscopy optical path.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The results of this Phase I SBIR program will benefit NASA applications requiring compact, efficient, reliable, moderate-energy, nanosecond-pulsed lasers.  For planetary exploration, these applications are in LIBS systems used for planetary surface characterization and in lidar systems for atmospheric measurements of aerosol concentrations and distributions, as well as short range planetary surface mapping.  The laser we propose to develop is compact, efficient, rugged and reliable, making it ideal for planetary missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		LIBS/Raman systems, besides having numerous scientific applications in materials characterization, can also be used in industrial applications such as process control through the monitoring of exhaust streams, analysis of pharmaceuticals, profiling of metals, composition determination of minerals in mining, and detection of contaminants in the environment.

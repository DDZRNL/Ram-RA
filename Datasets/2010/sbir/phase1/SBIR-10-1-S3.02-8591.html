		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		PDT is proposing a High Performance Space Pump based upon an innovative design using several technologies. The design will use a two-stage impeller, high temperature motor and a next generation sensor-less motor controller to provide several potential system improvements:<BR><BR>Increased pump delivery pressure (hydraulic HP) would provide greater flow potential and improved heat transfer performance. It also makes possible heat exchanger performance improvements that will allow space and weight reductions that may aid overall vehicle performance.<BR><BR>Improved overall efficiency resulting from the two-stage impeller reduces vehicle power consumption which may aid overall performance/weight/volume. This results in improved energy efficiency for all applications.<BR><BR>Future mission requirements willdrive fluid temperatures above current pump operating limits. The elimination of hall-effect sensors removes the driving consideration for the maximum operating temperature of PDT's current deep-space rated pump designs.<BR><BR>The higher operating temperature capability allows flexibility in placing pump within the fluid loop which may offer packaging benefits at the vehicle level.<BR><BR>Higher pump temperature capability may allow use of alternate coolants at higher radiator operating temperatures. This may provide opportunity to use pumped liquid cooling for high heat flux devices.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are several potential NASA applications for this technology in two major areas. The first is any mission, manned or unmanned, that will drive fluid temperatures above current pump operating limits. These include:<BR><BR>Missions using nuclear powered vehicles.<BR>Exploratory missions to high temperature environments such as Venus and close-in solar orbits<BR>Any mission requiring vehicles using any high heat flux devices, such as high powered lasers, future high powered communications satellites, etc. <BR><BR>The second area is any mission requiring or benefiting from higher efficiency pumps. This includes:<BR><BR>Any future interplanetary exploratory missions would benefit from the improvements described in the Technical Abstract.<BR>Satellite re-fueling of hydrazine will benefit from improved size and weight factors resulting from improved efficiencies.<BR><BR>Given all the benefits described in the Technical Abstract: high-temperature capability, reduced size and weight, and improved efficiency there are numerous potential NASA applications. <BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are numerous non-NASA commercial application potentials:<BR><BR>DoD/Aerospace- Many systems involving high-power radar arrays, lasers and other sensor technologies are currently fielded or in development for both air and ground vehicles. They all could benefit from increased efficiencies and reduced size and weight.<BR><BR>Medical- Current and future diagnostic and therapeutic technologies need efficient cooling systems. MRI and other imaging technologies already use liquid cooling and could benefit from increased efficiencies. In addition emerging technologies such as high intensity focussed ultrasound create high thermal loads that need cooling.<BR><BR>HVAC- While price is a concern here, there may be technically challenging applications that would place a high value on improved pumping efficiency, or high temperature capability.<BR><BR>Oil Exploration- The downhole environment is high temperature and needs high reliability, compact pumping and cooling technology. The proposed pump technology can be ruggedized for this increasingly challenging environment.

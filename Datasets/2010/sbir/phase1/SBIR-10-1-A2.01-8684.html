		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this Phase I SBIR, Firehole Technologies will develop proof-of-concept modeling framework for a multiscale physics-based modeling tool for predicting foreign object damage in ceramic matrix composites (CMCs). We will accomplish this by adapting the core technology, multicontinuum theory (MCT), from our existing industry-leading software analysis tool, Helius:MCT, to the problem of impact damage in CMCs. Our approach will involve modeling the composite at three levels: constituent level (fiber, matrix, interphase), mesostructure-level (fiber tow architecture), and macrostructure level (impact test of a multi-ply laminate). The mesostructure and macrostructure will be modeled using an explicit finite element analysis code. The constituent level modeling will be carried out using MCT, which permits constituent stresses and strains to be exactly determined from composite-average strain. The objective of the Phase I effort is to develop the modeling framework and compare predicted results with published experimental results. In-depth study of ceramic physics, development of an experimental validation program, and commercialization of the software would be part of a Phase I effort.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary NASA applications are the hypersonic, supersonic, and subsonic fixed wing programs. In the hypersonics program heat resistant structural components are needed, for which CMCs are used. Furthermore, combustor panels used in scramjet or ramjet technologies require robust performance and high temperatures, which CMCs could provide. The tools developed under this SBIR would enable designers of these components to select materials and material structures based on virtual testing rather than expensive experimental tests.<BR>The Supersonics and Subsonic Fixed Wing programs have similar needs. Namely, turbine housing and turbine blades must operate at high temperature with the potential for high velocity impact damage from foreign objects. The tools developed under this SBIR are specifically designed to address these issues and would provide rapid assessment of structural performance of CMCs under FOD without resorting to tests.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The initial primary target market for a suite of analysis tools for CMCs is with the U.S. Department of Defense and their Tier 1 OEMs.  Firehole Technologies, with a successful history within the Air Force, is uniquely positioned to apply this SBIR technology in the design and analysis of next-generation warfighting capabilities. Pratt and Whitney-Rocketdyne is a primary candidate for a commercialization partner, as indicated in their letter of support for this proposal. In addition, through past and existing contracts, Firehole has experience utilizing existing methodology for composite structures built by many of the major DoD  prime contractors including: Lockheed Martin, United Launch Alliance, ATK, and Boeing.  All of these companies are potential commercialization partners for the proposed technologies.

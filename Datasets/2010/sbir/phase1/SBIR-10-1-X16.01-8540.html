		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has a serious unmet need for miniature biologic sensors capable of on orbit sample analysis and in situ, real time analysis of astronaut health.  We propose an alternative way to monitor the health or illness of the crew members that would provide continuous monitoring of blood analytes. This information can be transmitted back to ground control in real time. The method could bypass the need to preserve biological specimens.  This novel multivariate system would measure the optical rotation of laser polarized light reflected from human skin as well as scattering and absorption characteristics directly related to the concentration of certain blood analytes that reliably indicate the state of health of the individual.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This apparatus will have a large impact on monitoring of an individual's overall health. Continuous health data will be valuable for understanding of a person's physiological changes as a mission progresses.  Extended space flight such as to the moon, International Space Station, or potentially Mars missions would benefit greatly from continuous testing rather than requiring samples to be taken, stored at constant temperature and preserved until coming back to earth. Additionally, this technology could also be used for NASA ground support that would benefit from monitoring due to mission critical requirements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non invasive monitoring of blood composition would revolutionize medical diagnosis and monitoring of outpatients and hospital scenarios.   Continuous monitoring in a hospital or a patient at home will give important information that can alert a health professional of either abnormally low or high levels that need to be evaluated.  The technology is particularly applicable to Glucose monitoring for patients with Diabetes as the current method of drawing blood 4-5 times a day to measure glucose levels is non-ideal. According to MarketResearch.com, Glucose monitoring devices are set to reach $16 Billion by 2014. This technology can also be applied to Chiral drug manufacturing.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A highly efficient and lightweight dual bridge matrix power controller development is proposed that will provide high performance to a solar powered high altitude long endurance (HALE) unmanned air vehicle (UAV), Solar Deck 24-7, that can stay aloft for an indefinite period of time (Goal > 5 years) without fuel. This UAV will be able to hover at altitudes greater than 60,000 feet and perform many of the reconnaissance, communications, and scientific data gathering tasks now performed by geosynchronous satellites at an altitude below low earth orbit thus attaining GEO below LEO. In this Phase I R&D effort, we will define the key requirements and develop the preliminary designs for the dual bridge matrix converter for the UAV application. Simulation models will be developed based on the preliminary design to allow assessment of their performance in the UAV application. . At the end of this Phase I R&D effort, we will have advanced the power controller design to the point where we will be ready to perform detailed design and analysis and build and demonstrate prototype unit during the Phase II effort.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This vehicle can directly support NASA's Earth Science Mission's strategic goal of meeting the challenges of climate and environmental change. The vehicle can play a key and cost effective role in the U.S. Integrated Earth Observation System by providing continuous monitoring and data continuity for high priority observations as identified by the Decadal Survey. The vehicle provides a platform to support the Earth Sciences Research program in the major focus areas of Atmospheric Composition, Weather, Carbon Cycle and Ecosystems, Water and Energy Cycle, Climate Variability and Change, and Earth Surface and Interior. It specifically is well suited for regional coastal research. The vehicle supports the goals of the Airborne and Suborbital Science Program. In that light, this vehicle can perform many of the tasks now performed by fuel burning vehicles, thus supporting the national objective of reducing America's dependence on foreign oil and reducing the effects of global warming.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A HALE air vehicle that can hover over a geographical area has tremendous potential for commercial communications and broadcast. The vehicle can be used to replace cell phone towers in urban and rural areas at competitive costs.  A long life UAV provides a low cost satellite radio option for smaller markets. In addition, the UAV can be used for TV broadcasting and internet communications. A recent application that is being explored is the use of air vehicles to coordinate power flow and grid status of the United States power utility network. Solar powered UAVs can be put in place expeditiously to provide continuous communications during national emergencies. Solar Deck 24-7 is a transformational technology from the standpoint that it can replace a multitude of fuel burning vehicles that now perform surveillance and reconnaissance for military and civil purposes, news and traffic monitoring, scientific research, and environmental data collection.

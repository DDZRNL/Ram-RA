		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Intelligent Fiber Optic Systems Corporation (IFOS) proposes, in this Phase 1 SBIR project, to demonstrate the feasibility of innovations based on an ultra-light-weight, ultra-high-speed, multi-channel, optical fiber sensor system for acoustics emissions (AE) monitoring for detection of damage and cracks in composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPV). The project goals are to (1) design an ultra-high-speed, high resolution , small-foot-print fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor interrogator, (2) construct a system model, (3) test platform including embedded FBG sensors and (4) develop signal processing algorithms to identify and measure AE signals in the presence of a quasi-static background strain field. The system model will demonstrate proof-of-principle and the test results will provide proof-of-functionality of the proposed sensor system for monitoring AE including using the advanced fiber optic sensor signal processing algorithms.  AE will be measured on composite cylinders performing pencil break or impact hammer tests.  The model test results will be compared to the measurements made concurrently by a standard single channel piezoelectric AE transducer. In Phase 1, IFOS will also develop a Phase 2 strategy plan that includes development and integration strategy, potential demonstration opportunities, program schedule, and estimated costs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary market focus for the application of this technology will be the in-service monitoring of NASA's COPVs. However, many other commercial markets exist that can realize significant benefits from this new technology for highly integrated/synergistic structures in the aerospace, automobile, and infrastructure industries. Commercial aviation will benefit significantly from this technology.  For example, widespread area fatigue damage has been determined to be a major source of problems for commercial aviation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The unique feature of the proposed research is not only detecting damage in a COPV but also identifying material characteristics, manufacturing anomalies, and operating histories. The transportation market for hazardous material transport as well as, the US military market with existing government contractor companies that supply composite-based parts to the government will benefit from this technology.

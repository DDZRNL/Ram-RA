		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Monolithic Integrated SiC Super Junction Transistor-JBS diode (MIDSJT) devices are used to construct 500 <SUP>o</SUP>C capable motor control power modules for direct integration with the exploration rovers required to operate in Venus-like environments. The Phase I of this proposed work will focus on the integrated MIDSJT device development and high-temperature packaging. Phase II will focus on the integration of the MIDSJT devices to construct full 3-Phase Inverter Motor Control Modules. Although SiC is the semiconductor material of choice for fabricating high-temperature (> 150 <SUP>o</SUP>C) power electronics, existing SiC MOSFET and JFET based transistor device technologies perform poorly at temperatures exceeding 200 <SUP>o</SUP>C. The proposed gate oxide-free Integrated MIDSJT device technology will overcome several problems associated with existing SiC device technologies by: (A) exhibiting desirable normally-OFF operation yet best-in-class on-state characteristics at temperatures as high as 500 <SUP>o</SUP>C, (B) eliminating parasitic inductances/capacitances associated with interconnecting discrete devices, and (C) eliminating high-temperature gate oxide reliability issues. Special device designs and fabrication processes will be investigated in this work for reliable device operation at 500 <SUP>o</SUP>C.  Novel power device packaging techniques in the areas of power substrate, die-attach, chip metallization and wire bonds will be explored to demonstrate reliable module operation at 500 <SUP>o</SUP>C after several thermal cycles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Drive and control electronics for motors in the next generation robotic systems such as rovers have to be directly placed on the motor housing. Integration of 500 <SUP>o</SUP>C capable power electronics with the motor enables creation of distributed actuator systems with significantly reduced interconnects and wiring. Furthermore the motors and actuators have to be placed on the extremities of the robotic systems and are exposed to environmental parameters such as large temperature changes (-125 <SUP>o</SUP>C to 450 <SUP>o</SUP>C in the case of Venus, up to 350 <SUP>o</SUP>C for Jupiter).  The motor sensing electronics consists of a position sensor, digitizer, digital controller and digital to analog converter. The actuator drive consists of power switching devices that are configured in an H-bridge that is connected to the digital controller through pre drivers and buffers. For DC-DC converters, power ICs developed in this program connects power sources in a wide variety of NASA mission systems with power sources as Solar arrays, Brayton rotating unit, stirling radioscopes, and fuel cells with various loads like electric propulsion, communications systems, instruments and actuators. A power IC is also the building block for the interface between energy storage devices like batteries and flywheels with the energy sources and loads. Switchmode power supplies improved by high frequency, high temperature power switch is critical for NASA synthetic aperture RADAR's (SAR) antenna array T/R modules.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology to be developed in this program  will find application in Air-force propulsion system externals like actuators, pumps, and starters, weapons ejection, fuel transfer, lighting, avionics, RADAR, landing gears & breaks, steering, powered doors and ramps, gun drives, anti-icing, environmental control and auxiliary emergency power systems. The realization of a high power density switchmode power supplies and DC-DC conversion circuits will benefit Army's Future Combat System (FCS). An electric and hybrid vehicle technology directly affects the M113 APC, Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, HMMWV, 5-ton M939A1 truck, AAAV, 50-ft personnel boat and a more electric aircraft by making them highly deployable, sustainable, survivable, lethal and affordable.  An integrated electric power system made using SiC high power devices will increase component placement flexibility within vehicles, double fuel economy by continuously operating smaller engines under optimum conditions, and reduce armor protected volume.  It will also enable increased acceleration and maneuverability due to immediate torque to the wheels or tracks, reduce vehicle thermal and acoustic signatures and reduce system cost and logistics requirements. Commercial switchmode power supplies used in computer power supplies, cellular phone base station power supplies, consumer electronics, lighting applications, and robotic and motor control applications will also benefit from the development of such components

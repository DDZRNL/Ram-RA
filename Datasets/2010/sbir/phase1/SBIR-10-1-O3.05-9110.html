		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		High-performance HDTV cameras are commercially widespread, but are not presently available in radiation-hard versions. The objective of the proposed SBIR effort is to develop and commercialize a radiation-hard, high-performance HDTV sensor for NASA missions and other space-based and high-energy physics applications. Key features of this program are the use of radiation-hard, fully depleted silicon photodiodes to maximize quantum efficiency, and the use of both radiation-hard-by-process and radiation-hard-by-design strategies in the development of the highly integrated readout circuit.<BR>Voxtel anticipates that its technology will enter the program at TRL=3, finish Phase I at TRL=4, and exit the Phase II program at TRL=5.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The innovation is primarily applicable to digital HDTV cameras onboard the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The innovation is applicable to digital imaging applications in non-NASA government markets in space-based imaging and star tracking, as well as DOE and other science applications in high-energy physics.

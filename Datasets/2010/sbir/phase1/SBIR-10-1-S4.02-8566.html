		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed effort will make a dramatic improvement in a) size, weight and power based on a transformative approach to manufacturer 3D electronics as well as 2) ease of integration by exploiting standards efforts in the Space community and specifically CubeSat.   The most significant contribution we will make is in next generation packaging through the use of Additive Manufacturing of Structural Electronics. The concept of "Plug and Play" implies simple and compatible, but it also implies traditional modular packaging for a specific form factor.  By eliminating solder, wire bonds, connector, excess silicon and excess substrate, the possibility exists to shrink an electronic system by more than 100 times.  This 100 fold shrinkage will apply to both size and weight and the newly available volume could be applied to power generation and storage. By extending the plug and play concept to "3D Print and Play"  in which entire satellites will be fabricated layer-by-layer into a monolithic, intelligent, conformal structure. Consequently, the development time is radically reduced, not from "months to days" but rather "days to hours," by automating the manufacturing component of development.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		CubeSats provide a key benefit to NASA from the extremely minimized SWAT of this platform. This translates into an easily deployable space platform that enables the opportunity to expand and accelerate experimentation with self healing networking, swarming, and sensor suites. The ability to 3D print structural electronic devices in the SPA platform with highly integrated sensor payloads will further accelerate these experiments. The ability to design and fabricate in 3D opens up new applications while driving the per satellite, per function cost. The capability to design and fabricate in 3D that is form factor and function agnostic opens the door to any application be it small like CubeSats, or large like TDRS. Total freedom in 3D will unlock new exploration, and platform opportunities.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		CubeSats also fill a need in the DoD, and commercial sectors. The NRO is looking at networked CubeSat "constellations" as the next generation of satellites that provide redundancy as well as a smaller target for adversary countries to hit. Additionally, CubeSats provide a great opportunity for expanding education on the support Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics for Universities and High/Middle Schools. The ability to 3D print CubeSats from a 3D graphic also pulls in an artistic skill set that will bring in a new thought process for CubeSats as well as other functional devices. This aesthetic also brings in a potential new breed of designer, or engineer from youth that operate in the cyber 3D world through gaming and graphic software like Adobe Illustrator. Any 3D object that can incorporate aesthetics with structure and with electronic function opens the door to many applications as well as those yet to be imagined.

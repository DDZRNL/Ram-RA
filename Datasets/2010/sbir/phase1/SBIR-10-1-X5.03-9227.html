		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has identified polymer matrix composites (PMCs) as a critical need for launch and in-space vehicles, but the significant costs of such materials limits their use.  This proposal addresses the need for lower cost PMCs through the development of discontinuous fiber reinforced polymer composites with an in-situ grown carbon nanotube 3-D network that will translate to less expensive components with properties approaching those of continuous fiber reinforced polymers.  The use of microwave processing will further reduce costs and improve the properties such that the Phase I and 2 efforts could lead to the implementation of these composites for a multitude of applications for which they are currently deemed too expensive.  Ceralink will team with Florida International University, who will perform the in-situ growth of carbon nanotubes, and HITCO Carbon Composites, who will evaluate the developed materials and provide an assessment of technical and commercial viability.  It is anticipated that a technology readiness level of 4 will be achieved by the end of the Phase I program. <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary NASA application for the microwave processed multifunctional polymer matrix composites is in structural aerospace components, where lighter weight, higher strength, and lower cost parts are required.  The major aerospace areas include aircraft, helicopters, missiles, and spacecraft.  Composites are the primary candidates for components used in space travel since they offer 10-15% better fuel efficiency, reduction of weight, easy integration, increased durability translating to longer structural life, and improved aerodynamic efficiency and performance.  The polymer composites developed in this program will specifically target launch vehicles and in-space structural component applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The most direct benefit to non-NASA applications for this technology is the development of high strength to weight ratio airframe materials for commercial airliners. This includes, but is not limited to: regional jets, long-haul jets, light jets, and very light jets. The inclusion of composites in commercial aircraft can improve the flight performance characteristics, such as range, payload, speed, and decreased fuel consumption. Other commercial sectors that currently use carbon fiber composites are marine, automotive, and recreational equipment. This proposed work targets reducing composite cost, which will help increase their implementation in these markets.

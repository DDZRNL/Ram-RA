		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Optoelectronic integrated holds the key to higher performance, reduced mass and radiation-hard space systems.  A special need is increased flexibility of phased arrays for communication and detection. Currently RF arrays use ferrite waveguide elements for phase shifting which are both bulky and lossy with a phase shift limit of 360º . Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) arrays currently use a single optical source with mechanical steering. An identified goal would be an RF array with true time delay for beam steering and combined in the same physical location with an optical array steered via optical phase shift. ODIS approaches this problem with an optoelectronic circuit that integrates the RF and optical elements within a single chip. The RF at Ka band is generated by an optoelectronic oscillator and converted to RF power in a photodiode at the antenna element. The antenna element is a printed dipole on chip with dimensions of &#955;/2 (&#8776;4.3mm). The optical source is an array of vertical cavity lasers spaced sufficiently closely to achieve a coherent beam. Optical beam steering is achieved by optical phase shifting of the coherent beam. In this SBIR, ODIS will demonstrate the key components integration to achieve a common RF/optical aperture.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		     NASA applications are focused on the need for combined Rf and optical sensing. Current and future satellites require a multitude of sensors mounted an the satellite external surfaces covering  wide bands in the mm wave band and separately in the optical spectrum.  Sensing is central to the NASA mission. The POET technology base has great potential to address this sensing with unique ability to collapse the sensors into a single aperture. Simultaneously POET address many internal computational requirements related to on-board communications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
			Phased arrays with electronic scanning represent a huge future commercial market in the wireless, security and free space optics communications industries. The optoelectronic integration platform being developed here provides a cost effective approach to combine optical and electronic device capabilities from which to generate the components for computer buses, AD converters, optical data links, optical switching matrices, optical routers, optical memories and many more yet to be identified. The integrated approach is the key to reduced cost and improved reliability.

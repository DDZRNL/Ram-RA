		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		FMI currently manufactures Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) material for Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) systems, such as the Stardust Sample Return Capsule and the Mars Science Laboratory Aeroshell. FMI plans to further develop TPS in support of future sample return missions such as MoonRise and OSIRIS-REx. Development of a PICA TPS with reduced mass, thermal performance enhancements, and optimized single-section near net-shape preforms are enabling technologies for these applications. It is the objective of the proposed program to develop a graded density preform to achieve a reduction in PICA TPS areal mass, to assess the performance of such a TPS, and to develop a plan for manufacturing scale-up.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Stardust Sample Return Capsule completed its objective with earth re-entry in January of 2006. The Mars Science Laboratory Aeroshell heat shield has been completed, and delivery of the Curiosity rover to Mars is scheduled for 2015. With the successful fabrication of these PICA TPS heat shields in support of NASA flight missions, FMI has quoted and is prepared to continue supporting PICA heat shield missions. The advancements in the development of the preform material proposed in this program will support future NASA missions, including New Frontiers Sample Return Capsules, which are proposed to utilize a Stardust-like heat shield.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed advanced ablative TPS preform material would support commercial space applications including Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS). During 2008, NASA entered into contracts with Orbital Sciences and SpaceX to utilize their COTS cargo vehicles, Cygnus and Dragon, respectively, for cargo delivery to the International Space Station (ISS). In addition, FMI small return vehicles such as the Re-Entry Break-Up Recorder would benefit from improvements in preform material.

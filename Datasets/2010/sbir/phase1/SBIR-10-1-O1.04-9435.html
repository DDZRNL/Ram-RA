		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Uplink Laser Beacons for deep-space communication, can benefit greatly from migration to the 1010-1030nm wavelengths, via use of Silicon-APDs on the spacecraft receiving terminal. Fibertek has developed an uplink laser transmitter testbed using a multi-stage fiber-MOPA platform, that is also scalable to a multi-aperture architecture. Preliminary demonstration for 1064nm operation has shown multi-kW peak powers using long-pulse slot(>100nsec)based M-ary PPM format. The highly flexible platform developed at Fibertek, also corrects for pulse-shaping, and pulse-train variations, inherent in such multi-kW long-pulse variable-symbool PPM data-format. This SBIR proposal aims to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a clear technical road map to translate this to shorter wavelengths <1030nm, as well as to further optimize the uplink laser beacon transmitter for representative M-ary PPM data formats, using FPGA based adaptive control.

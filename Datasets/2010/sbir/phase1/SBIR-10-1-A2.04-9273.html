		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The need to accurately predict aeroelastic phenomenon for a wide range of Mach numbers is a critical step in the design process of any aerospace vehicle. Complex aerodynamic phenomenon such as vortex shedding, shock-turbulence interaction, separation, etc. dominate at transonic and supersonic Mach numbers and hence the need to address these phenomena is of utmost importance in the modeling process. Research is proposed for the development and implementation of state of the art, large-eddy-simulation (LES) based computational models for problems in nonlinear aeroelasticity. Highly efficient and accurate subgrid-scale (SGS) models will be incorporated into the flow solver and coupled with high fidelity structure solvers to predict aeroelastic phenomena such as transonic flutter, limit cycle oscillations, etc. The SGS models proposed are based on eddy-viscosity and non-eddy-viscosity models and they will both be assessed for accuracy and robustness in the context of nonlinear aeroelasticity. The implications of the proposed work include using highly accurate turbulence models with efficient finite element models of structure to solve problems in nonlinear aeroelasticity. The application of the proposed innovations spans the range of flight, from subsonic to supersonic transport vehicles. Anticipated results include 1) the implementation of the proposed LES methodology into current aeroelastic toolset 2) application of the proposed work to large-scale simulation and comparison with experiment and lower fidelity RANS-based aeroelastic simulations and 3) advancement of the state of knowledge for nonlinear problems in aeroelasticity.

		<BR>
		Installation of a prototype device in air vehicles to suppress transonic flutter and LCO and extend the flight envelope is highly demanded for safely operating civil as well as military aircrafts. The direct application of the SBIR effort to the current needs of NASA represents a prime opportunity for further product development and enhancement and represents a considerable potential revenue stream in engineering support, plus further technology acquisition.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Improvement of physics-based identification, modeling and risk management of (transonic) flutter and limit-cycle oscillations of an aeroelastic system is a common interest for wide range of engineering applications and, thus is highly demanded. It will be demonstrated that the proposed methodologies have great potential for enhancing the physics-based identification, modeling and risk management of flutter and limit-cycle oscillations of an aeroelastic system. DoD components likely to have interests in the technology developed in this SBIR project are the US Air Force, Navy and Army. The US industrial companies, including various aerospace & ocean as well as general engineering companies such as Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, General Electric, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and Textron, will be the major non-military potential customers. In addition, the corresponding industrial companies in Europe and Asia represent a very large marketing share of the resulting methods and technologies.

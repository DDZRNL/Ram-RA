		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Innovative research is proposed in integrating fundamental aircraft design processes with an emphasis on composite structures. Efficient, lightweight composite laminate structural design requires highly integrated structural analyses on the laminate and stiffened panel levels, while incorporating manufacturing processes and limitations. Laminate optimization is only one of the many design variables that need to be considered simultaneously in aircraft design. Yet true system level OML surface optimization is an extremely challenging problem that can only be made tractable by reducing the problem into three sequential gates: ply count compatibility, layup sequencing, and ply layout size and shape. The innovative approach proposed solves all three of these seemingly intractable gates and in so doing provides synergistic optimization of ply drops and adds and reduced manufacturing ply processing steps (drawing part numbers) along with laminate sizing to damage tolerance material allowables. To achieve the highest level of design fidelity requires iterative communication with the designer's CAD tool and ply zone mapping tools. Previous data exchange technology used by NASA to couple separate discipline design tools is the XML ASCII file format. Proposed is the evaluation and implementation of a binary format called 'HDF5'.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The SBIR developed capability will be integrated into the existing commercial HyperSizer<SUP>REG</SUP> structural sizing software. HyperSizer SBIR innovations are being used on many NASA projects, most recently on the NASA Ares V Shroud and the NASA Composite Crew Module (CCM). On the NASA CCM, HyperSizer was used by the NASA team to perform structural analysis and margins-of-safety predictions for the testing. HyperSizer software was used throughout the almost three-year project to optimize the design, weight, and manufacturability of the CCM, which is constructed of honeycomb sandwich and solid laminate composites. Future potential NASA applications include the NASA Commercial Crew & Cargo Program Office (C3PO)'s Commercial Crew Transportation (CCT) capability that would be able to transport NASA astronauts and spaceflight participants safely to and from LEO and the ISS. Another is the Heavy Lift Launch Vehicles,  under which NASA is seeking industry input on heavy-lift system concepts and propulsion technology through a 2010 BAA. Through the Heavy Lift Launch Vehicles initiative, NASA is seeking an innovative path for human space exploration that strengthens its capability to extend human and robotic presence throughout the solar system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		HyperSizer is being used by all major American aerospace companies such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Goodrich, Gulfstream, Bombardier, Spirit Aero, and Northrop Grumman, by NASA, Air Force, and universities. See http://hypersizer.com/corporate/customers.html. This existing customer base is ideal for SBIR innovation commercialization and has given us great success at commercializing all SBIRs performed to date. Examples of successful non-NASA commercialization already achieved serve as models for Potential Post Applications<BR>Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 Thrust Reversers and Engine Nacelles <BR>Bombardier All-Composite Learjet 85 <BR>Wind Blade Design for Sandia National Labs<BR>Composite Commercial aircraft for our existing customers Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Gulfstream, Bombardier, and Spirit Aero, and Goodrich<BR>Composite Commercial Launch Vehicles

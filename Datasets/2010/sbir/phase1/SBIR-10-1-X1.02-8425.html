		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This project will investigate an entirely new battery chemistry by developing A Martian Air Battery. Specifically the project will explore the concept of a Martian battery that utilizes in-situ resources to produce energy for NASA applications. Our experience producing high-energy air cathodes for our work with existing metal-air systems will be utilized during this program. Our established air cathodes will be modified, to accommodate a Martian environment, and incorporated into cells. Several different chemically composed cathodes will be investigated. The anticipated result of the phase 1 project is a new battery. Advantages of the proposed Martian battery include a light weight source for in-situ energy production.  In addition the conceptual battery will be capable of atmospheric gas collection and separation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed high specific energy Martian battery has the potential to produce energy utilizing in-situ resources on Mars. The Martian battery could provide energy storage for astronaut equipment and habitats, vehicles, robots and other electronics. This technology may also be used to collect and separate atmospheric gasses.<BR><BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed metal-air cell has a broad range of commercial applications from storing energy for satellites in space to powering robots deep beneath the ocean floor. Metal-air cells have the potential to replace other cells and batteries currently used to power electronic equipment. The strength of the system is its very high energy density and specific energy. Its lightweight nature and flexible design provide it adaptability to many commercial products such as cell phones and computers.<BR><BR><BR>

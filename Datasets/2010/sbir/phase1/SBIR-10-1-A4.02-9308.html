		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Makel Engineering, Inc. (MEI) and the Ohio State University (OSU) propose to develop high sensitivity, miniaturized and in-situ operated gas sensors for the real time monitoring of chemical composition of turbine engine combustors and/or exhaust streams for real-time, in-flight propulsion system measurements to improve NASA's aeronautical flight test capabilities.  Gas microsensor arrays developed by MEI, OSU and our technical development partners including NASA have been demonstrated for ground test usage to quantify composition of critical constituents in turbine engine exhaust products, e.g., CO, CO2, NOx, O2, HC (unburned hydrocarbons) and H2.  These sensor systems provide the basis for the proposed NASA SBIR effort, which will also leverage development of packaging for extractive emissions testing developed for the DoD with support from NASA researchers.<BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal targets the improvement of NASA's ground and flight test aeronautics testing capabilities. Potential end users within NASA include ground test facilities such as Western Aeronautical Test Range (WATR) and Flight Loads Laboratory (FLL), as well as flight facilities such as DFRC with both piloted and unmanned systems.  Real-time, in-flight data regarding combustor condition and emissions species can provide a previously unavailable test capability for NASA.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology has military and commercial applications as well, which fits well with NASA's mission for the promotion of advanced technology for civil aviation.  Near term, based on input from members of the emissions testing community, there is a need for a lower cost, readily available emissions detection capability for use in engine development and performance measurements.  As the sensors and packaging technologies mature, the gas sensor array system might also be used for emissions certification testing for commercial engines. <BR>This technology will also apply to in-situ measurement capabilities for coal power plants, industrial burners, boilers, gas turbines, and other engines.<BR>

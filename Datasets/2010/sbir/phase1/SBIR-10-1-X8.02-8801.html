		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This project is a partnership effort between American Energy Technologies Company (Illinois), Yardney Technical Products (Connecticut) and A.J. Drexel Nanotechnology Institute of Drexel University (Pennsylvania).  The proposing team seeks to demonstrate tangible improvement in the performance of Lithium-Ion batteries by way of increasing their specific energy density beyond 300 Wh/kg at C/2 in the range of temperatures, at a minimum, from 60<SUP>o</SUP>C to 0<SUP>o</SUP>C.   The battery will use newly developed Silicon-doped, stabilized graphitic anode; Lithiated mixed oxide cathode, in its turn, doped with nano-sized cycling stability-enhancing additives; and an innovative inherently safe electrolyte system based on ionic liquids.  Special focus of the development effort shall be directed towards creation of scaleable Si-doped carbon material for the battery anode.   Cell optimization effort will focus on methodic rebalancing of the classic anode to cathode ratios, by devising unique, highly efficient cathode of increased thickness in support of operation of thin anode, whose specific capacity will vary from 300 to 2,000 Ah/kg at C/2.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed development of ultra high energy density, inherently safe and highly efficient advanced battery system is geared towards benefiting two groups of applications within NASA.  These are: energy storage in future NASA Exploration missions (e.g. landers and rovers), and creation of the reduced weight alternative to the battery banks, currently used on re-entry vehicles.  One of the partners on this proposal has direct experience with building batteries for Mars rovers.  Another partner has developed and fully commercialized several battery grade materials for critical application environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This project may lead to eventual commercialization of new and improved lithium-ion batteries with energy density, which is more than twice the level available today.  Introduction of such batteries will likely have a transformational impact on the consumer and emerging specialty markets where reduced cell sizes and weight often command premium profit margins. The first obvious segment of the market is 4C (cordless power tools, cameras & camcorders, cell phones and computer games on-the-go).  The second market segment is an emerging PHEV (Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) - one of emerging sources of US independence from foreign oil.  The third segment is military applications, especially for missions in air and water, where component weight and size reductions may carry the price tag of human life.

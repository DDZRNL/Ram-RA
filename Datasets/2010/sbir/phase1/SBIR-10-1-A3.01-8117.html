		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The operation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the National Airspace System (NAS) is a growing area of research for NASA, but the need for substantial amounts of research on the UAV-in-NAS concept is overwhelming. Furthermore, the quantity and nature of research questions on UAV-in-NAS operations are somewhat unpredictable as this research progresses, thereby requiring NASA to have flexible research tools and adaptable methodologies. To address these issues, we propose to develop the UAV-TEST toolset (User-Augmented Visualizations for Targeted Evaluation of Systems and Technologies). UAV-TEST will be a user-centered methodology that helps streamline the research process for UAV-in-NAS research at NASA and enhances the process of generating and connecting new measures, research questions, and visualizations. This concept will be instantiated within a flexible, low-cost toolset that seamlessly integrates with current research tools at NASA. The ultimate goal of the UAV-TEST product is to enable researchers to obtain clear and rapid assessments of key human factors issues in simulated flight environments. In Phase I, we will design this concept and develop a proof of concept demonstration. In Phase II, we will develop a functional prototype that can be used alongside actual NASA studies, particularly within the UAV-in-NAS research areas.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Within the Concepts and Technology Development Project, UAV-TEST will provide the capability to efficiently progress through critical study activities, such as measure authoring, research question development, and configuration of data visualizations. The rapid assessment capability will help meet multiple milestones cited in previous reference materials within the Airspace Systems Program. Similarly, other research groups within the Systems Analysis, Integration, and Evaluation (SAIE) Project and the Aviation Safety Program (ASP) conduct research activities with comparable needs. The end benefit for these groups would be a more flexible and streamlined research preparation process culminating with rapid assessments in the form of targeted data visualizations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		UAV-TEST will appeal to avionics manufacturers external to NASA that are developing and/or researching concepts and technologies aimed at the integration of UAVs into the NAS, for many of the same reasons as NASA would benefit. Research organizations (e.g., MITRE, Volpe) and universities may also benefit from this application, as they are often interested in conducting research within the scope of this same environment. Beyond the commercial aviation sector, there are extensive military applications for UAV-TEST ranging from Defense, Homeland Security, and Intelligence. They, too, have a need to conduct costly simulations for training or evaluation, many involving unmanned vehicles, and could benefit greatly from a self-initiated process of rapid testbed configuration.

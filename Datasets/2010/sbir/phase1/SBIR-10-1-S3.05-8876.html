		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Space Micro Arizona State University (ASU) team will develop an all-digitally controlled, wide temperature range point-of-load switch-mode DC-DC regulator core with built-in self-test (BIST) functionality which meets space radiation requirements. In Phase I we will produce a design that can be fabricated into silicon in Phase II and demonstrate aspects of the design in the laboratory with some preexisting silicon circuits and discrete components.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Virtually all NASA space programs have a demand for this proposed technology and product. NASA applications range from space shuttle, space station, earth sensing missions e.g. (EOS), and deep space missions. NASA programs/missions that will benefit include lunar landers and orbiters, Mars missions, solar system exploration e.g. (Titan, Juno, Gynemead, comet nucleus return, New Discovery and Living with a Star (LWS). New programs including both Ares, the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and Commercial Orbiter Transportation Service (COTS) would benefit.   Products evolving from this SBIR will be enabling for future programs such as Dawn, Aquarius, Kepler, Ocean Vector Winds, and space interferometry.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology may benefit commercial space platforms, both LEO and GEO telecommunication satellites, such as Intelsat, Direct TV, XM radio, and earth sensing applications e.g. (NOAA). <BR><BR>Terrestrial commercial applications may include nuclear power plants (near core) and research accelerators e.g. (Fermi Labs).<BR><BR>This technology and products will also address emerging MDA radiation threats. These programs include MKV, AEKV, THAAD, AEGIS, and GMD for Blocks 2010, and beyond. With the new challenge of atmospheric neutrons to MDA High altitude airship (HAA) programs and NASA or Air Force UAV programs, this R&D will be timely solution. <BR><BR>Other military applications may include strategic missiles (Trident and AF upgrades), as well as many DoD tactical weapon programs with nuclear survival levels.<BR><BR>The applications for the technologies developed as part of this SBIR can literally be almost any platform that goes into space. Every rocket, satellite, experiment, etc. that goes into space has a need for memory storage capacity to some extent. By developing the technologies described in this SBIR, and then maturing these to flight-grade, the processing power available to spacecraft, satellite, and experiment designers will be increased significantly.<BR>

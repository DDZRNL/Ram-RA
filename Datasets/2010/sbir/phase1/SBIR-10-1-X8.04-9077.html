		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A new method of transferring epitaxially grown active films onto an inexpensive polymeric flexible carrier. Specifically, for making thin lightweight high efficiency (> 30%) IMM3J solar cells while reusing the GaAs or Ge base wafer. This will reduce the costs of fabricating high efficiency PV cells by 30% and will raise specific power to > 200W/kg. The method uses a thin strained layer under the epitaxially grown active layers without ion implantation or wet etching. A crack propagates in the strained layer splitting the epi-layers from the base wafer after bonding to polyimide wafer, hence dry epitaxial lift-off (DELO), due to the difference in thermal expansion coefficients between the semiconductor and flexible substrate without applying mechanical pressure. The base wafer is re-used to grow new epi-layers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Lighter, more flexible and more cost effective high efficiency PV cells for space applications (satellites, space stations, planetary missions, etc.)
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Lighter, flexible, cost effective PV cells for powering mobile devices and for recharging batteries in combat/defense applications. Cheaper, more mobile PV systems for remote mobile use (with or w/o concentrators).

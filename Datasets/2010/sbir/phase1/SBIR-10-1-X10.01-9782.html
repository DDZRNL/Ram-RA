		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		KWJ offers this proposal for a very low power but very practical "nano-watt" MEMS sensor platform for NASA requirements. The proposed nano-sensor platform is ultra low power and has a long sensor lifetime for extended battery life or power-harvester operation. The extremely fast response time of the sensor (<100 nsec) will be utilized in this SBIR as a possible new and innovative avenue to create selectivity for TCDs. This approach would only be available to very fast detectors like the new KWJ MEMS detector. The sensor is a platform technology designed for multiple analyte measurement on a single chip.  In addition to cryogenic system leak detection for CH4, H2, and He, the platform can address trace levels of N2, O2, and H20 in gaseous helium purge streams. The SBIR project creates products and spin offs for NASA, industrial, and medical applications.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The technical objectives of A-DECK are:<BR>1)Flight Weight including rideshare payloads will be less than 500 Kg.<BR>2)First fundamental frequency of integrated A-DECK System including ESPA or Type C Adapter, payload(s), avionics and release mechanisms will be greater than 50 Hz.<BR>3)After initial qualification, A-DECK must not require additional EELV mission unique design or analysis.<BR>4)A-DECK delivery ICD and Verification products must be sufficient for acceptance of integrated A-DECK as ready to fly meeting launch vehicle, range safety and customer operations requirements.<BR>5)A-DECK mechanical interface to launch vehicle must be through multi-point pinned attachments to the interior of an ESPA or a Type C Adapter.  <BR>6)Type C Adapter will utilize standard EELV 62.01" (1575 mm) bolt hole template for both forward and aft interfaces.<BR>7)A-DECK electrical interface to launch vehicle will be through a single shielded multi-line cable to the launch vehicle secondary or designated electrical panel.<BR>8)A-DECK avionics must control, monitor and support all A-DECK mounted spacecraft and/or hosted technical payloads in manner not to interfere with launch vehicle operations or primary spacecraft.<BR>9)A-DECK integration, check out and acceptance will be performed at facilities outside of the Primary Spacecraft integration and check out facility.<BR>10)A-DECK and the A-DECK payloads must remain electrically and mechanically dormant until the launch vehicle transmits its initiate signal to the A-DECK avionics.<BR>11)To the greatest extent possible A-DECK will incorporate existing mechanisms, avionics and components designed to support Small Satellites as an example the Poly Pico-satellite Orbital Deployer (P-POD).<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		International Partner Space Agency Education and Research:A-DECK will enable NASA launch services to support both domestic and international partner universities and researchers.   <BR><BR>Partnership with the National Institutes of Health (NIH):In September 2007 NASA signed an MOU with NIH for the "development of biomedical research approaches and clinical technologies for use on Earth and in space and research in Earth and space-based facilities that could improve human health on Earth and in space."<BR><BR>Partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service:In July 2008 NASA and USDA sign MOU memorandum enable plant related research that will improve our understanding of biological cellular mechanisms and may lead to creative new ways to improve American agriculture, protect the environment and contribute to better human health.<BR><BR> <BR>Cross Agency United States Civilian Agencies:A-DECK will enable NASA to support National Science Foundation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency, Veteran's Administration (biotech research), Department of Interior (earth observation), Environmental Protection Agency and other civilian agency science and technology experiments and small satellites.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Enhancing United States Launch System Competitive Pricing:A-DECK provides a means by which U.S. launch companies including Lockheed Martin Commercial Launch Services, Boeing Launch Services, Space-X and Orbital Science Corporation Launch Services Group can provide commercial launch services for rideshare spacecraft customers.  By manifesting multiple rideshare spacecraft and payloads onto a primary spacecraft mission the launch services provider can lower the cost to each user of the shared launch and/or benefit from increases in profit margin per launch.  Thus the cumulative rideshare revenues can be used to reduce launch service bid(s) thereby increasing mission capture probability, increasing annual launch rate and optimizing use of launch facilities.<BR><BR>Enabling Small Satellite Commercial Industries:  Many new and experimental technologies cannot become commercial products due to their lack of space qualification.  It now remains for the space community to create launch systems designed to meet the cost and schedule demands of these researchers and users of small satellites.  A-DECK creates the ability for commercial component, systems, and bus/chassis manufacturers to gain low cost, reliable access to space.<BR>

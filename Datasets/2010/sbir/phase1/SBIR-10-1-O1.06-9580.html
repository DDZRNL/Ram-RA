		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Maximizing network efficiency for NASA's Space Networking resources is a large, complex, distributed problem, requiring substantial collaboration. We propose the development of an innovative software tool that will support mission and scheduling personnel in developing, de-conflicting, optimizing, and maintaining space networks. We have developed an innovative networking and scheduling framework that facilitates the development of more intelligent and optimizing scheduling algorithms with a mixed-initiative architecture. This framework will be augmented to handle the complex and diverse constraints found in the space communications scheduling domain, allowing for accurate modeling. A mixed-initiative conflict resolution assistant will analyze the schedule, and suggest ways in which any conflicts might be resolved. Once a valid schedule has been produced, a multi-objective resource optimizer will refine the schedule to maximize mission satisfaction. Some of this technology has already been applied to the NASA Ground Network (space communications) scheduling and several domains including those involving similarly complex constraints, such as the problem of optimizing ballistic missile engagements, which includes complex line of sight (LOS) and range calculations between satellite-based sensors and three-dimensional ballistic missile trajectories.<BR><BR>The ultimate goal of this proposed effort is to improve the space networking scheduling and execution capability.  The goals of the Phase I research are to further understand the current and future space networking domain, including user interactions and collaboration, to investigate integration requirements, and to elaborate the heuristics, algorithms and techniques for improved space networking, and analyze them as to their feasibility. Other goals are to define the metrics for space networking performance, further prove the feasibility through prototype development, and develop the Phase II system design.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We are already marketing Aurora, our general intelligent planning and scheduling framework, and customizing it for a variety of domains.  The additional capabilities developed for space networking can be synergistically marketed to the same clients. For example, the mixed-initiative conflict resolution manager proposed here would be applicable to many Aurora customers. In addition, we anticipate that this effort will result in additional scheduling algorithms that we will be able to incorporate into our existing scheduling products, thus increasing the benefits they provide as well as their value. There is great potential in this effort because it represents an opportunity to build on our previous scheduling and networking solutions and leverage our and OPNET's customer bases, both of whom can potentially benefit from this effort's enhancements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The most direct target for the results of this effort is NASA's Space Communications and Navigation Program.  By both demonstrating significantly improved performance during Phase II and ensuring that the ultimate results can be integrated into the operational systems, NASA will have a strong incentive to operationalize the Phase II development of the proposed solution.

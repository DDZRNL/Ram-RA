		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Instruments flown on board NASA missions often do not measure quantities<BR>of interest to scientists directly, but rather observable quantities. In addition,<BR>instruments often introduce artifacts into the data and techniques are needed to<BR>remove them. In both cases, scientifically relevant information can be<BR>inferred by simulating a parameterized model and adjusting the parameters to<BR>best match observed data. This minimization process of "fitting" a model to<BR>data is computationally demanding, since it requires evaluating the often complex<BR>models many times and minimizing a function of many variables. Fast, more efficient<BR>fitting techniques are therefore required in order to fully harvest the scientific<BR>output from NASA missions.<BR><BR>In this project, we will develop a fast, general-purpose parameter fitting software<BR>tool suite taking advantage of inexpensive, high-performance graphics processing<BR>units (GPUs). The goal of Phase I of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility<BR>of model fitting on GPUs.  We will therefore prototype forward models, relevant<BR>mathematical operators and the actual parameter adjustment algorithm on GPUs<BR>and compare their performance to a pure CPU implementation. We will particularly<BR>focus on ease of use for the scientist to migrate their applications to this infrastructure. <BR>During Phase I, the TRL will increase from 3 to 4. <BR><BR>In the Phase II, we will then harden the prototypes developed in Phase I and provide alternative modeling algorithms to support a broader range of applications. In addition, we will work with scientists from various NASA missions, including the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) III mission and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to accelerate their modeling needs. In addition to NASA missions, other federal or commercial applications<BR>requiring to adjust model parameters to fit large sets of observed data will benefit from this project. <BR><BR><BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Because of the widespread use of optimization techniques in parameter estimation, the software developed in this project will be used extensively by NASA scientists working on present and future missions. Moreover, with the increasing amounts of data to be processed, hardware accelerated optimization software will provide a valuable, time-saving tool to NASA scientists. Missions that will directly benefit from the proposed software are Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) III mission and the Solar Dynamics Observatory and Glory, to name a few.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Parameter fitting is found in almost all fields, from finance/banking and data mining to computational biology and numerical weather prediction, to name a few. One thing in common to all these fields is the rapidly growing volume of data and increasing complex models. To address the accompanying computational issues, low cost hardware accelerators, in particular graphical processing units (GPU), are increasingly being used with great success. This GPU accelerated tool suite will be developed into a commercial product that will be of general interest. <BR><BR><BR><BR>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Flight Deck i-Glasses is a color, stereoscopic 3-D display mounted on consumer style eye glass frames that will enhance operator performance and multi-modal interface research for NextGen operators.  This innovative project will prove that Microvision's new Pico Display Engine and new waveguide optic technologies mounted on commercial eyeglass frames will create a novel visual interface system where users can toggle information between left- or right-eye and view information in either a bi-ocular or 3-D stereo mode as required.  Leveraging the state of the art monocular goggle display, Microvision will identify commercial eye frames engineering requirements to determine size, weight and center-of-gravity constraints and then research what optics, electronics, mechanical and system interface alternatives exist.  Alternate designs of Pico Display Engine and electronic modules will be investigated.  A simplified optical relay approach and waveguide optical concepts design will be researched. At the conclusion of Phase 1, Microvision will report the scientific and technical feasibility findings and will provide bench-top demonstration of candidate Phase 2 waveguide optics technologies.  Finally, needed research/research and development tasks required to build a Phase 2 prototype will be identified.

		Flight Deck i-Glasses are a crew-centered and multi-modal interface technology that improves aerospace safety by enabling 3-D trajectory-based operations and head-up visual ops in non-visual meteorological conditions. Flight Deck i-Glasses are relevant within the Integrated Intelligent Flight Deck Technologies program in both Operator Performance and Multi-modal Interfaces research activities areas.  This visual interface technology enhances NASA's pursuit of Level 3 goals for NextGen operatorsit will increase the pilot's state of awareness and support integrated alerting/pilot notification in a head-up moderegardless of meteorological conditions.  Additionally, i-Glasses is applicable to Extra-Vehicular Activity Technology and Space Suit Displays where compact systems are needed to increase situational awareness.  Within the Automation for Vehicle & Crew Operations research area, i-Glasses can be used to display decision support system information.  Within flight/space operations, i-Glasses will provide operator content at the point of task  perfect for operations centers, ATC control and mobile maintenance environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Flight Deck i-Glasses have significant potential for successful commercialization.  Companies within defense, medical, industrial and consumer market segments are actively pursuing new head-up technologies to create product offerings around the i-Glasses concept.  Within defense, pilots need see-through color displays to portray 3-D situational awareness independent of helmet used.  Mounted and dis-mounted soldiers have begun to use see-through display applications to increase SA in operational and training (enhanced realism) environments.  Medical applications within the future operating rooms are concentrating on displaying 3-D imagery scans on the patient to improve procedure effectiveness and accuracy.  Similarly, mobile viewings of procedures, specifications and web-based logistics services, etc. are value-added applications facilitated by i-Glasses in the industrial segment.  Consumers are searching for 3-D i-Glasses for real-time mobile gaming and for mobile applications (i.e. Augmented Reality, broadband content, etc.) where real-time streaming of content from mobile devices can be viewed in a head-up mode.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal relates to a new materials concept for an aluminum-carbon nanofiber composite, high thermal conductivity ultra lightweight material that will form the basis for robust, lightweight deployable metallic radiator designs.  Specifically, this program will result in availability of high thermal conductivity, low coefficient of expansion, extremely low density carbon nanotube-reinforced aluminum composites suitable for use in radiator panel facesheets, closeouts, supports and joints.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		One example is a deployable space station radiator , electronic control boxes and other systems that need heat management especially in large scale devices and objects needing isotropic properties.<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications include the electronics industry for chip packaging Ga/ chips and other high heat load components needing heat removal. Other applications could be found in automotive and aerospace engine applications

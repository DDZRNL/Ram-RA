		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA needs narrow linewidth lasers in the 1.5 or 2 micron wavelength regime for coherent Lidar applications. The laser should be tunable by several nm and frequency modulated by 5GHz. Princeton Optronics has developed ultra-stable narrow linewidth diode pumped solid state lasers at 1550nm and has demonstrated frequency modulation with such lasers. In this SBIR, we propose to develop a Tm:YAG material based diode pumped solid state laser with a narrow line width which would be tunable and capable of frequency modulation by 5GHz. By the end of the SBIR program we plan to develop a prototype 2 micron laser which is tunable and has very narrow linewidth in a small package. The package with the device would be space qualified and commercialized after development.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High stability, narrow linewidth lasers has applications for LIDARs by NASA.  Narrow linewidth lasers can be used for many other NASA applications including ranging, wavefront analysis, wind speed measurement, surface topography, atmospheric composition analysis and communications. They can be used for remote sensing for entry descent and landing of spacecrafts.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A narrow line width 2 micron source will have a significant market for LIDAR, RF Photonics and sensor applications. The users will be military, NASA, homeland security, cable television distribution and oil exploration industry. The total market for narrow line width ultrastable lasers is currently at tens of millions of dollars. Princeton Optronics will commercialize the product very soon after development.

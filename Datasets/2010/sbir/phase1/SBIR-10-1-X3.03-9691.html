		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The objective of the Phase I SBIR project is to develop sensors that can discriminate the presence of combustible gases like oxygen (O2) in hydrogen (H2) or H2 in O2 backgrounds. These sensors will meet NASA applications for on-orbit crew and mission safety. Currently, H2 and O2 are produced by electrolysis of water. The O2 is used in the environmental control and life support systems (ECLSS) of spacecraft while the hydrogen is vented. H2 is a flammable gas while oxygen aids in combustion. InnoSense LLC (ISL) will utilize its Chemical Fingerprint (TM) sensor array fabrication technology in Phase I to engineer a miniature device with multi-analyte detection capability. The Phase I working model would be evaluated to demonstrate NASA use potential. Upon fine-tuning various parameters in Phase II, the system performance will be tested with a prototype hardware.  ISL has received technology endorsement letter from a prime contractor in the NASA application area.  For assuring success of this project, ISL has assembled a technical team with a cumulative 60 person-years of experience in developing commercially viable sensor systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA vision calls for safe, affordable human missions beyond Earth orbit to Mars, and through the Solar System. To support the transport of small crewed missions with capabilities to extend this to outer space, monitoring and controlling of the life-support process needs to be performed by devices having attributes such as: (a) high accuracy and precision, (b) reduced size and weight, (c) long operational life, (d) reliable performance, (e) minimal maintenance requirement, and (f) in-line operational ability. Hazardous trace gases within the space-craft crew habitat pose risks to human health during long duration missions. Therefore, the proposed sensor technology provides NASA with a low-cost, robust, real-time monitoring format for protecting both the crew and spacecraft at least for 3 years.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The multi-analyte capabilities of the device make it very attractive for applications ranging from environmental monitoring to process control.  The study by Frost & Sullivan on World Gas Sensors, Detectors and Analyzers Market reveals that these markets earned revenues of over $1 billion in 2005 and estimates this to exceed $1.4 billion in 2012 (Source: Frost and Sullivan Report MC1377591, August 31, 2006). Pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, fermentation monitoring, cell culturing, and tissue culturing represent some important applications. Upon repackaging, the device will have applications in a variety of civilian emergency response and occupational environment monitoring or related research facilities.  Examples include: firefighting, hazardous material response, hazardous material workers, industrial safety workers (e.g., coal miners, steel workers, etc.), and industrial confined space monitoring associated with many occupations (e.g., industrial chemical manufacturing). <BR><BR>

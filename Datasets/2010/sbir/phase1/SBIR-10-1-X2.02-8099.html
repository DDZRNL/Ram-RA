		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This development will provide an inexpensive vacuum nozzle manufacturing option for NOFBX<SUP>TM</SUP> monopropellant systems that are currently being developed under NASA SBIR funding. NOFBX<SUP>TM</SUP> is non toxic and utilizes a much simpler monopropellant feed system architecture. Furthermore NOFBX<SUP>TM</SUP> meets the criteria for a non-toxic propellants that will meet NASA's performance targets (as indicated by high specific impulse and high specific impulse density) while improving safety and reducing handling operations as compared to current state-of-the-art hydrazine-based propellants. During the proposed effort we will develop CC composite in-space nozzles for use on 100lbf class NOFBX<SUP>TM</SUP> thrusters. <BR>We have built the first CC composite rocket nozzle prototype that does not require autoclaving or CVD/CVI processes. In fact our process is more akin to typical carbon fiber lay-up standards than that of typical CC composites manufacturing methods.  <BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications include Non-Toxic In-Space Propulsion including 100Lbf and 5lbf Thrusters, Upper Stage Launch Vehicle and Kick motors, Small launch vehicle engines, Large launch vehicle engines<BR>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High temperature Carbon-Carbon composites are used in all sorts of high temperature applications. This development will provide an much less expensive way of manufacturing CC components that may be used in many terrestrial applications such as the nuclear and renew ables power industries.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Space presents a challenging environment for computing. Extended<BR>development times and radiation tolerance requirements leave hardware<BR>performance a decade or more behind the terrestrial state-of-the-art<BR>at the time of deployment. Additionally, once deployed, hardware<BR>changes are impractical, encouraging a trend towards increased<BR>software programmability. However, topside pressure from application<BR>advancements are forcing space-based platforms to improve throughput<BR>and latency while reducing power consumption. A popular approach to<BR>addressing the tension between these requirements is the heterogeneous<BR>processing architecture. By providing multiple hardware tools that<BR>optimally support a subset of the anticipated workload, a<BR>heterogeneous architecture can offer a diverse processing toolset to<BR>the application developer. However, programming these systems is<BR>extremely challenging because of variations in toolsets and data<BR>sharing interfaces. As a result, data sharing and  dynamic workload<BR>scheduling across heterogeneous architectures is often suboptimal and<BR>hindered by poor scalability. Maxentric proposes to solve this problem<BR>with RUSH, a heterogeneous processing architecture with a unified<BR>programming model for rapid development. RUSH employs a rad-hard<BR>multicore processor as a host and an FPGA as an accelerator chip. The<BR>RUSH software layer unifies these architectures through an innovative<BR>programming model described in the proposal.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		RUSH will provide a high-performance, flexible, and programmable<BR>heterogeneous processing platform for space applications. This work<BR>has broad impact for space command and control systems. Reconfigurable<BR>high-performance systems with updates will enable deployed systems to<BR>maintain high levels of utility as processing or mission demands<BR>shift. The system is well qualified to enable software de&#64257;ned radio,<BR>real-time video processing, sensor analysis, and automated landing and<BR>will play a central role in research, development, and deployment of<BR>platforms for achieving these requirements.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The applicability of RUSH is not limited to NASA markets. The military<BR>and civilian satellite designers and operators stand to benefit from a<BR>highly-reconfigurable performance computation platform. Target markets<BR>include the space and nuclear computing platforms for diverse<BR>activities from real-time video processing, to software defined radio,<BR>to sensor processing.

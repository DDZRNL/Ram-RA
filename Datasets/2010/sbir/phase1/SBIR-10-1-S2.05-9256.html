		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to develop an extended lateral range capability for a dynamic optical profiling system to enable non-contact, surface roughness measurement of large and aspheric astronomical optics in-situ during manufacture.  This instrument will be capable of measuring more than three decades of spatial frequency range for determination of rms surface roughness.  It will be insensitive to vibration, being based upon our patented phase-sensor technology, and capable of being mounted on a computer-controlled polishing machine for in-situ measurement of large, aspheric and freeform optics.  Objectives for Phase I are to demonstrate a novel automatic alignment system enabling in-situ extended lateral range surface profiling, demonstrate an extended lateral range concept, and to demonstrate a measurement range of more than three decades in spatial frequency.  Anticipated results of Phase I will be documented laboratory demonstrations of these capabilities.  Our TRL before Phase I is 2-3, after Phase I we anticipate a TRL of 3-4 and after Phase II a TRL of 6.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed on-tool measurement could reduce polishing time and improve surface quality of large and small optics with profiles from flat to aspheric.  Potential NASA applications include all major telescope projects where large precision optics are required such as JDEM, LSST, GMT, TMT and ICEsat.  The sensor can dramatically improve process control for the manufacture of large telescope optics by removing the need for replication and or contact metrology, which can damage surfaces.  It can also improve the manufacture of super-smooth optical surfaces, which are needed to achieve ultra-low scattering in projects such as WFIRST, LIGO, and LISA, by providing rapid, high resolution measurement over a wide spatial frequency range.  This type of measurement can also aid the manufacturing of aspheric and freeform optical components made with computer-controlled machines, in projects such as IXO and other x-ray telescopes.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed extended lateral range profiler can significantly improve the production of large and small optics for many DOD and commercial projects in the same ways it can for NASA projects.  Applications include large optics for telescope mirrors, super-smooth surfaces for x-ray, synchrotron, DUV and EUV optics.   In addition, the proposed profiler has many applications beyond optics production including precision machined surfaces in the medical and automotive industries, and engineered surfaces in the semiconductor, electronics, data storage, MEMS, MOEMS and display industries.

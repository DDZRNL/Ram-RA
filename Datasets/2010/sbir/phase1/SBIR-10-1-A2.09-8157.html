		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The incorporation of viscous analysis in design is vital for a complete<BR>understanding of aerodynamic problems.<BR><BR>This proposal offers to develop and integrate with RotCFD a method for semi-automatically generating grids suitable for viscous<BR>analysis on complex configurations as well as parallelize the solver in RotCFD to take advantage of today's<BR>multi-core machines.<BR><BR>The principle idea behind the semi-automation of the grid generation is to divide the geometry surface into patches and<BR>generate body-conforming grids from these patches.<BR><BR>This partitioning allows for automatic generation of grids with<BR>aspect ratios suitable for viscous flows.<BR><BR>Convection dominates the outer region, so unstructured Cartesian meshes<BR>can be generated quickly and easily here.<BR><BR>The outer grid will be conformed to the inner grid so the entire grid<BR>can be treated as one unstructured grid with an unstructured<BR>solver, or as a hybrid grid with multiple zones and solvers.<BR><BR>In the hybrid approach, viscous solvers can be used for the inner zone<BR>while the faster inviscid solvers can be used in the far-field.<BR><BR>In Phase I a proof-of-concept grid generator, and a conceptual methodology for solver<BR>parallelization will be developed and demonstrated to work with RotCFD the<BR>rotor aerodynamic design tool.<BR><BR>In Phase II, the features of the grid generator and solver will<BR>be fully developed and expanded.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The viscous extention and parallelization of RotCFD <BR>will find wide usage in NASA in addtion to the other<BR>branches of the armed services.<BR>The proposal offers a semi-automated viscous analysis tool<BR>that will lay the foundation for advanced designs in an<BR>economical way.<BR><BR>Sukra Helitek's software are currently used for many <BR>advanced configurations at an early stage in the design<BR>and the addtion of viscous capability and parallelization <BR>will increase its usefulness and marketability. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Surka Helitek's software has been extensively<BR>used by US Helicopter manufacturers for analyzing<BR>new and existing designs. The proposed software<BR>enhancements will extend its usefulness and retain <BR>a global advantage.

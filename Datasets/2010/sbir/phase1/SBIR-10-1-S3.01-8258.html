		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		According to the NASA Topic S3, "the Science Mission Directorate will carry out the scientific exploration of our Earth, the planets, moons, comets, and asteroids of our Solar System and beyond.  SMD's future direction will be moving from exploratory missions (orbiters and flybys) into more detailed/specific exploration missions that are at or near the surface (landers, rovers, and sample returns), that would require new vantage points, or that would need to integrate or distribute capabilities across multiple assets.  The demand for larger area coverage, higher resolution and multi-spectral capability in satellite remote sensing applications, and the demand for higher data rates in digital satellite communications networks continue to place ever increasing demands on onboard data handling and processing subsystems - 1 Gbps to 4 Gbps data rates are not uncommon and continually increasing. Further, satellite subsystems must be capable of reliable operation in the space radiation environment and will continue to be constrained by SWAP limitations. Shrinking development budgets and rapid development requirements are driving onboard data handling networks toward more flexible, non-proprietary architectures and interface standardization. Therefore, SPI proposes to develop a 10Gbps per channel optical transceiver and mating, multi-channel reprogrammable network interface card (NIC) that are RAD-tolerant to over 300KRad-Si TID, operate reliably from -25C to 85C.  Further, the NIC will be fully reprogrammable such that it may be reconfigured and utilized as an optical router, switch, or multi-protocol compatible gateway.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed product, in addition to SPI's other harsh environment optical networking products, specifically target onboard data handling needs of NASA, DoD and the Intelligence Community's satellite remote sensing applications.  Our multi-protocol, reprogrammable, intelligent networking systems can support the NASA SCaN Internet Architecture improvements.  The high speed, reprogrammable optical networking products developed under this contract will meet the advanced requirements of NASA with specific redundancy implementations for ultra-high reliability.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The following companies, government primes and agency branches have expressed interest in SPI's fiber optic networking products.  RFQ's have been received from Lockheed-Martin - Eagan, Honeywell-DSES,  Technobridge-Japan, Boeing, NASA-GSFC, NASA-JPL, Orbital Sciences Corporation, and Southwest Research Institutes.  These companies/organizations have expressed great interest in SPI's RAD-tolerant, high-speed fiber optics communications devices.

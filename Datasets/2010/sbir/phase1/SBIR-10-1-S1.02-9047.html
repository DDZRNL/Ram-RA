		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		AlGaN/GaN devices on SiC substrates will be utilized to achieve Power Added Efficiencies (PAE) in excess of 85%. These wide band-gap solid-state semiconductors will be used in novel Power Amplifier (PA) topologies such as Current Mode Class D (CMCD) and Class E. The power output goal of a single P-band PA module is greater than 50W, and the power output goal of the L-band PA module is greater than 10W. In turn, these power modules will be combined in push-pull to balance configurations for higher power.  Phase I will consist of choosing the devices sizes and topologies for the PA modules, and performing extensive modeling and simulation, especially for the large signal non-linear operation with harmonic terminations required to achieve the high efficiency goals. In addition, various power configurations will be simulated to achieve a 50 Ohm output without extensive impedance matching transformations to improve efficiency and useable bandwidth.  The power sizing strategies will be evaluated for overall system efficiency, size, and weight trade-offs.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The adoption of the proposed Ultra - high efficiency P-band and L -band power amplifiers technology meets several important needs for NASA by enhancing the performance of the following technologies.<BR><BR>One prominent example of these applications is NASA's RADAR Imaging of Mars. Radar observation at several incidence angles allows the relief to be extracted and the use of low radar frequency can provide information on the subsurface structure. Software defined radar, which is the latest trend in radar development will be enhanced by the proposed technology.  Another application of the proposed power amplifiers is interferometry, which is the technique of diagnosing the properties of two or more waves by studying the pattern of interference created by their superposition. Interferometry is an important investigative technique in the fields of astronomy, fiber optics, engineering metrology, optical metrology, oceanography, seismology, quantum mechanics, nuclear and particle physics, plasma physics, remote sensing and biomolecular interactions.<BR>

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		For non NASA applications, the proposed solution can be targeted to wideband cellular base stations (L-band), Public Safety Radio Base-Stations (P-band), UAV-Base Earthquake and Volcanic Eruption Advance Warning Systems, NOAA Interferometers, Naval and Air Force UAV Communication and Radar Pods.<BR><BR>In June 2006, the President signed the Public Alert and Warning System Executive Order to drive the creation of a more "effective, reliable, integrated, flexible, and comprehensive system that enables the American people to receive alert and warning information through as many means as possible."  In response, FEMA established the IPAWS Program Management Office (PMO) in April 2007.[1] A UAV-base advance warning system can increase the speed of communication in both remote and populated locations and save lives.<BR><BR>The proposed solution will improve the performance of UAV communications. The UAV's unique ISR and long-endurance capabilities provide the Navy and Air Force with real-time intelligence and situational awareness.

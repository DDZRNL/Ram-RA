		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has a requirement for a neurodiagnostic tool that can be used to monitor the behavioral health of the crew during long duration Exploration missions. The device should unobtrusively monitor and detect neurophysiological markers of stress that could lead to behavioral or performance deterioration. The neurodiagnostic monitor should be lightweight and compact and should require minimal time or effort for the crew to use. Among the various neurodiagnostic modalities, electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) are most amenable for integration into a lightweight, wearable system that can be adapted for use in Space. We will demonstrate the feasibility of a wearable multi-modality neurophysiological device for monitoring stress. The wearable monitoring system will provide a real-time functional imaging of cortical activity while the crew performs Exploration mission activities.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Crewmembers on long Exploration missions must remain productive in confined and crowed environments in which workloads are heavy, sleep is difficult, and where there is isolation from family and friends. Developing methods that allow crewmembers to deal with stress and other psychological challenges of long voyages will be critical to successful missions. The proposed neurodiagnostic device can be used to monitor levels of stress as well as the general psychological health of the crew during Exploration missions. The device can also be used to measure the degree of mental workload during performance of complex and cognitively challenging tasks and can be used to design and optimize the tasks. The low mass and low power consumption required for the wearability of the device are also key factors for space applications as launch costs are directly determined by mass and volume.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to monitoring the behavioral health of the crew during space missions, the proposed device can be used to diagnose and treat various neurologic diseases and psychiatric illnesses. The device, for the first time, allows ambulatory, dual-modality functional imaging of cortical activity. The system can be designed as ambulatory units for use primarily in home settings as well as stationary units for use primarily in clinical settings.

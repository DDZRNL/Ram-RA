		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) program is integrating its three current agency networks: Space Network (SN), Deep Space Network (DSN), and Near Earth Network (NEN). This effort raises several issues for the network management in the future integrated space networks. First, an integrated network management function, which uses common standards and implementations, is needed to serve as the interface for all SCaN network customers. Second, satellite operations currently use a highly manual approach. The research and development of autonomous operations has been conducted recently but is still at early stage. Third, due to different characteristics of space networks, security management mechanisms and other network management functions that are widely adopted in the traditional networks are not fully suitable to space networks. In addition, several issues related to Bundle Protocol exist and need to be further investigated to enhance the performance of bundle delivery in delay tolerant networks. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Security-Enhanced Autonomous Network Management (SEANM) scheme for reliable communication in space networking, which allows the system to adaptively reconfigure its network elements based upon awareness of network conditions, policies, and mission requirements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed DTN networking and network management solution has potential to largely reduce operation costs while maintain or even enhance the reliability for the NASA missions. Due to the heterogeneous nature of network assets and the lack of autonomy, the developed solution can be applied to the NASA's efforts on the integration of its current agency networks. The potential customers of our solution include robotic and human missions at locations ranging from the near Earth (e.g., EO-1) to deep space (e.g., Mars exploration) and SCaN program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed solution also has great potential in dynamic military applications. Given the GIG vision, such heterogeneous and dynamic wireless networks will be common and therefore robust and reliable communication is necessary. The proposed cross-layer information sharing architecture, mechanisms, and the developed network management tool can be applied to various military networks potentially supporting a number of major programs like Airborne Networks Program, Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Future Combat System (FCS), etc.. The commercial drive for reliable communication is also increasing due to the increasing popularity of wireless network technologies. Potential commercial applications include satellite communications, wireless sensor/ad hoc networks, and vehicle networks.

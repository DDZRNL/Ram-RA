		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) systems have proven their value in the remote measurement of spatially resolved atmospheric wind velocities in a number of applications, including the detection of clear-air turbulence, wind shear, aircraft wake vortices, and microbursts.  The capacity of coherent LIDAR systems to produce a continuous, real-time 3D scan of wind velocities via detection of the Mie backscatter of atmospheric aerosols in clear-air conditions and at stand-off distances of up to 50 km at relatively low pulse energy gives this technology a clear advantage over other atmospheric monitoring technologies.<BR><BR>During the execution of contract NNX11CG87P SIBELLOPTICS assembled the key components of the fiber-based transceiver in a breadboard system and demonstrated performance against proprietary LIDAR modeling.  In addition, we were able to demonstrate 12 hour battery-powered operation, a unique, compact BPLO method that uses quad-cells, and were able to take a significant step towards future miniaturization by packaging the fiber sub-assembly on a 1-ft x 1-ft optical bench.<BR>  <BR>In Phase II, it is proposed that, based upon Phase I efforts, a brassboard version of the fiber-LIDAR system be designed, assembled, and tested including data collection, processing, and display capabilities. The system will include custom opto-mechanical designs of mounts and benches, packaged components for reduced SWAP and more robust operation, and higher output energy to increase sensitivity.  Software will be developed to demonstrate real-time capability to collect, process, and display data in real-time using a unique interactive user interface.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Of particular interest to NASA are the following LIDAR advancements:<BR>¿	Detection of aircraft-induced wake vortices and turbulence<BR>¿	Novel transceiver architectures with improvements in <BR>	   range and sensitivity<BR>           size, weight and power (SWAP)<BR>	   system efficiency<BR>	   reliability and maintenance time<BR>¿	Wake processing algorithms<BR>¿	Real-time data reduction and display schemes<BR><BR>The fiber-LIDAR unit can also be redesigned for installation and operation in aircraft. Also, with some redesign, the sensor can be configured for atmospheric monitoring of chemicals and other particulants in the atmosphere.  This would be useful in climate change and meteorological studies.

		<BR>
		SIBELLOPTICS, LLC was formed to provide wind measuring instruments to several global market segments; (1) aviation, (2) wind energy (3) meteorology and (4) maritime . This company is based upon its' expertise in Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) technology utilizing new fiber optic technology which facilitates significant cost savings with equal or better performance than exists today. Activities which require accurate and timely wind measurement are the industries the company plans to pursue. The background of the founders of the company is LIDAR based wind measurement and the strength of the company resides in its founders who draw on many years experience in the design, engineering, manufacturing and marketing of LIDAR. The global contacts fostered through tens of years of international sales and marketing, provide SIBELLOPTICS the foundation on which it can grow.

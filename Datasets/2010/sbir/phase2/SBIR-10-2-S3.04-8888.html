		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) and Orbitec Inc. propose to develop a unique chemical propulsion system for the next generation NASA science spacecraft and missions that is compact, lightweight, and can operate with high reliability over extended periods of time and under wide range of thermal environments. The system uses a new storable, low toxicity, liquid monopropellant as its working fluid. In Phase I, we have demonstrated experimentally the critical ignition and combustion processes for the propellant and used the data to develop thruster design concepts. Phase I work achieved TRL 3. In Phase II, we propose to develop and demonstrate in the laboratory a proof-of-concept prototype thruster. Phase II will achieve TRL 4+. We envision follow-on Phase II Enhancement (Phase II E) and Phase III programs to advance the TRL to 5 and 6, respectively. Phase III will be the development of a full-scale protoflight propulsion system applicable to a class of NASA missions. On both Phase II E and Phase III programs, we will collaborate with specific NASA programs and the industry to address the cost share component. Following a successful Phase III a space flight demonstration on a NASA mission will advance the TRL to 7.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's future science missions need propulsion systems with demanding performance in challenging environmental conditions, with long operational life, and with high duty cycles. Examples of missions enabled by the proposed propulsion technology include sampling atmospheres of planets, their moons, and other small bodies, descent and landing on their surfaces, returning soil samples from their surfaces in ascent modules, and rendezvous and docking with orbiting mother ships. Missions to the earth's moon, Venus, Mars and its moons, moons of Jupiter, and asteroids are envisioned for applications of our propulsion technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Applications of the proposed technology to non-NASA agencies include the Air Force, National Reconnaissance Organization (NRO), and the Army. Specifically, the Air Force is interested in liquid thrusters for in-space propulsion, the NRO is interested in fast response, long-life, maneuvering propulsion systems and the Army is interested in the development of green monopropellant based high pressure gas generators for pressurizing gelled propellants. Other potential DoD applications include liquid engines for propelling highly maneuverable, throttlable tactical missiles.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Accurate simulations of unsteady turbulent flows for aerodynamics applications, such as accurate computation of heat loads on space vehicles as well the interactions between fluids and structures is of utmost importance to the aerospace industry and NASA. Using a Finite Element Framework suited for both fluids and structures, we propose to continue building on the successes of Phase I by adding various turbulence solution methodologies as well additional multi-disciplinary physics to address complex problems with complex geometries, while maintaining high order accuracy of the framework.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Accurate predictions of heat loads on space vehicles during ascent and re-entry is critical. In addition, fluid-structure interaction problems are becoming more important as we design ever quieter and more fuel efficient machines. Our computational tool will help achieve these goals. As CFD becomes the tool of choice for design and development, the accuracy of the numerical methods has become more critical. In addition, a desirable attribute of accurate methods is data compression and that is what we plan to deliver.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The aerospace industry is in dire need for accurate methods for unsteady turbulent flows that can be run on smaller clusters. This is a very challenging need and we are proposing to meet that need through our efficient and innovative finite element based computational framework. Outside the aerospace industry, many smaller companies desiring to use CFD in their design cycle will be able to do so with our newly developed tool.

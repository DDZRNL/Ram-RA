		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this Phase II proposal we plan to design and develop a semiconductor, low phase/frequency noise, single-frequency, external cavity semiconductor laser (ECL) emitting at 1064 nm for use in high-precision outer space measurement NASA missions.  Many NASA space missions rely on the utilization of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) techniques for atmospheric analysis and/or surface topography and distance measurement.  A key and vital component of any LIDAR system is the laser source. Single frequency lasers are highly desirable for use in planned missions using LIDAR systems.<BR><BR>The laser is based on the PLANEX&#61652; laser technology developed by Redfern Integrated Optics Inc. (RIO).  The PLANEX&#61652; 1550 nm laser was originally designed and developed for terrestrial applications but it has been experimentally demonstrated to have a sufficiently low level of frequency and intensity noise to be suitable for precision measurement applications, such as those encountered in spaceborne LIDAR.<BR><BR>For the Phase II effort, we propose to carry out a plan to design and develop a 1064 nm PLANEX laser for NASA LIDAR applications which will be based on the RIO PLANEX ECL originally designed for emission at 1550 nm, but need re-design for different semiconductor materials, fabrication processes and opto-electronic packaging for operation at 1064 nm wavelength in outer space.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A key and vital component of any LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and system are the single-frequency laser sources which are needed in any LIDAR-based terrestrial and space applications of atmospheric measurement and analysis as well as surface topography.  For instance, planned missions using LIDAR systems such as LIST (LIDAR for Surface Topography), LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), the follow-on GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment), and ASCENDS (Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons), would all benefit from the availability of space-qualified, high reliability, precision single-frequency laser devices.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Space qualified RIO PLANEX laser can be used in the LIDAR systems in various defense and commercial aero-space applications. Also applications will include injection seedlings of high power MOPA fiber and DPSS industrial lasers for material processing, second harmonic generation and UV lasers for scientific applications.  Furthermore, development of a 1064nm PLANEX laser will open up additional commercial and aerospace applications and markets for RIO, now served by 1064nm fiber lasers.  Potential commercial customers will include prime DoD contractors, like LMC, NGC, leading laser manufactures as IPG, Coherent, Continuum, Fibertek, etc.

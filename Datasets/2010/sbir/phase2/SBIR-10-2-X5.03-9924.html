		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Cornerstone Research Group Inc. (CRG) proposes to continue the efforts from the 2010 NASA SBIR Phase I topic X5.03, "No-Oven, No-Autoclave (NONA) Composite Processing." NONA offers NASA the ability to manufacture composites without an oven or autoclave, which will significantly decrease manufacturing costs. Large, single-piece composite structures for NASA Heavy Lift Launch Vehicles are currently expensive to fabricate partly because of the capital equipment (ovens, autoclaves, and tooling) needed to cure the part and maintain tolerances at cure conditions. There are only a few autoclaves in the world large enough to support large composite fabrication, and they are already committed to long-term programs. The cost of building additional autoclaves is prohibitive, and inherent size constraints still remain.<BR><BR>CRG's innovative technology addresses these roadblocks by providing:  <BR>- High-performance, 350F epoxy composite cured without oven or autoclave<BR>- Decreased capital, operating, and labor costs<BR>- No post cure required<BR>- A scalable resin infusion process<BR>- Increased part throughput

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Supporting NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate, this project's technologies directly address requirements for advanced manufacturing technologies for composite materials for launch and in-space vehicle structures.  This project's technology offers the ability to produce very large, high-performance, single-piece, affordable composite structures and tooling for these systems, providing benefit beyond current autoclave and out-of-autoclave cure systems
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This project's technologies developed for NASA systems would directly apply to systems operated by other government and commercial enterprises. Government systems that would derive the same benefits would include future Joint Heavy Lift and other cargo aircraft and future Navy ships operated by the Department of Defense. This technology's attributes for very large, affordable composite structures should yield a high potential for private sector commercialization of private space launch vehicles, commercial aircraft, large marine craft, civil and automotive infrastructure, and wind blades and towers

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Frequency-locked single-frequency 2 micron fiber laser is proposed to be used for airborne/spaceborne coherent lidar measurements, i.e., Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons. The laser is based on our proprietary fiber technology and extensive experience in fiber laser development, which features a compact, highly stable, frequency-stabilized light source. Advanced frequency-locking schemes for both center-line frequency-locking and offset-frequency locking is developed in the laser source to address the bandwidth issue associated with airborne and space-borne coherent lidar measurements. Important key concepts in the proposed laser have been successfully demonstrated in the Phase I effort. This Phase II program will focus on the development of prototype units of two frequency-locked lasers at a specific wavelength of NASA interest. The prototype units will be delivered to NASA Langley Research Center at the end of this Phase II program for evaluation test.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		For our proposed laser source, one of the potential NASA applications is NASA's ASCENDS mission, i.e., Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons. This mission will provide a tool and data to understand the natural processes driving the variability of natural carbon sources and sinks, and the transportation of carbon through the atmosphere. It needs to measure the number density of CO2 in the column of air through CO2 column profilers from air-borne or space-borne platforms. Our proposed laser system could be a perfect source enabling to use large-collection-area photo receiver in air-borne or space-borne CO2 coherent lidars for column measurements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are a number of potential non-NASA commercial applications for frequency-stabilized single frequency 2 micron fiber laser. Our proposed frequency-stabilized 2 micron fiber source is an ideal light source for mid-infrared frequency metrology. It can also be used in gas sensing and high-precision molecular spectroscopy.

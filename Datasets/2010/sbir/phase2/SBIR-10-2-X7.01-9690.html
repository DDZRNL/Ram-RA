		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA needs an advanced lubrication solution for its future robotic systems and planetary surface assets. The required lubrication technology must offer low-temperature performance while minimizing wear in these robotic systems and reducing the maintenance needed to keep them running. In this Phase II project, InnoSense LLC (ISL) proposes to meet NASA's need by further-engineering of its IonoGlide&#153; liquid-based lubricants and validating its performance through testing by third party. IonoGlide lubricants offer low-temperature performance with limited off-gassing and high decomposition temperatures. ISL's approach is to introduce proprietary additives to the ionic liquid matrix to impart thermal stability and enhance lubricity. This depresses the apparent freezing point while maintaining high decomposition temperatures. Through electrostatic interactions, the proprietary additive and ionic liquid form an order. With near metallic surfaces, this quasi-ordering contribute to improved lubricity. Phase I testing shows that ISL's lubricant outperforms top commercially available lubricants. ISL will work with a major NASA contractor to test lubrication efficiency under simulated field conditions. IonoGlide lubricants are envisioned for use primarily in metallic ball-bearing conditions at low pressures.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In collaboration with its industrial partners, ISL will continue to develop IonoGlide lubricants for NASA-specific applications ranging from Mars rovers to use in robotic arms for extravehicular missions. A potential operational limitation of remote robotic systems is lubrication failure at low temperature. IonoGlide lubricants promise continuing mission-critical performance in the harsh Martian environment. Preliminary results of ISL's lubrication technology indicate potential for dependable and prolonged performance in such extreme environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		According to a March 2010 Freedonia Focus report, synthetic lubricants and functional fluid demand in the United States is expected to be $4.8 billion by 2013 and grow by 3.2% per year. Synthetic engine oil is seen as a $2.6 billion market by 2013 with annual gains of 7.3% since 2008. The need for higher-performing engine oils drives this market. For the vehicle and equipment market, synthetic engine oils along with hydraulic and transmission fluids will drive an expected $4 billion in demand by 2013. According to the same report, the market for heat transfer fluids increased 6.8% between 2003 and 2008 to a value of $1.3 billion. This is the niche within which NASA applications fall. Heat transfer fluids are used in antifreeze, energy production, asphalt, laun¿dry, biotechnology, metalworking, mining, process manufacturing, and refrigeration and heating systems. In the commercial arena, variants of IonoGlide will find uses in aerospace, automotive, electronics, energy, synthesis, engineering fluids, and marine sectors.

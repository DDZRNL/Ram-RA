		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Deployable Space Systems, Inc. (DSS) will focus the proposed NASA Phase 2 effort on the development and TRL 5/6 maturation of our innovative Functional Advanced Concentrator Technology (FACT) for standard multi-junction and advanced IMM photovoltaics.  FACT is a highly-affordable, practical, high-efficiency, ultra-lightweight photovoltaic concentrator blanket assembly that can be rolled or z-folded in a stowed configuration.  FACT coupled to an ultra-lightweight solar array structural platform will provide game-changing performance metrics and unparalleled affordability.  FACT will enable emerging SEP Space Science and Exploration missions through its ultra-affordability, ultra-lightweight, ultra-compact stowage volume, and practical/user-friendly off-pointing versus power characteristics.  The FACT technology promises to provide NASA/industry a near-term and low-risk flexible blanket technology for advanced solar array systems.  The FACT technology provides revolutionary performance in terms of:  High specific power (>260W/kg BOL with ZTJ/XTJ and ~400W/kg BOL with IMM PV when coupled to ROSA-array); Affordability (>40% cost savings when coupled to ROSA-array);  Flexible blanket compatibility / architecture flexibility (accommodates rolled or z-folded blankets);  User-friendly off-pointing versus power characteristics;  Compact stowage volume (>50kW/m3); High deployment reliability; High radiation tolerance and high voltage operation capability;  Applicability/scalability to many missions (500W-1MW+ sizes);  LILT/HIHT operation capability; and Adaptable to standard rigid honeycomb panel arrays.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA space applications are comprised of practically all Space Science, Earth Science, Exploration, Planetary and Lunar Surface, and other missions that require affordable and high performance photovoltaic power production through solar arrays.  The technology is particularly suited for missions that require game-changing performance in terms of affordability, high voltage operation, radiation tolerance, ultra-lightweight, compact stowage volume, and operation within LILT and HIHT environments.  The proposed technology will enable ultra-high power solar arrays for future Exploration missions through affordability (>40% cost savings when coupled to ROSA-array), lightweight / high specific power (>260W/kg BOL with ZTJ/XTJ and ~400W/kg BOL with IMM PV when coupled to ROSA-array), compact stowage volume (>50kW/m3), user-friendly off-pointing versus power characteristics,  high deployment reliability, radiation hardness, high voltage operation capability, scalability to high power, and operability in unique environments.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA space applications are comprised of practically all missions that require affordable and high performance photovoltaic power production through solar arrays.  The technology is particularly suited for missions that require game-changing performance in terms of affordability, high voltage operation, radiation tolerance, ultra-lightweight, compact stowage volume, and operation within LILT and HIHT environments.  Applicable non-NASA space missions include: LEO surveillance, reconnaissance, communications and other critical payload/equipment satellites, LEO commercial mapping and critical payload/equipment satellites, MEO satellites & space-tugs, GEO commercial communications and critical payload/equipment satellites, and GEO communications and payload/equipment satellites.  The proposed technology also has tremendous dual-use opportunities for a variety of non-space applications including both ground and roof-mount applications where low cost, manufacturability, ease of installation, compactness and high reliability is demanded.  A terrestrial version of the technology would allow for low-cost high-performance theater mobile power production for the U.S. armed forces, or mobile power production for the commercial terrestrial based user.

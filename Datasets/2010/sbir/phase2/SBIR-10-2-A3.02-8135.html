		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) systems have proven their value in the remote measurement of spatially resolved atmospheric wind velocities in a number of applications, including the detection of clear-air turbulence, wind shear, aircraft wake vortices, and microbursts.  The capacity of coherent LIDAR systems to produce a continuous, real-time 3D scan of wind velocities via detection of the Mie backscatter of atmospheric aerosols in clear-air conditions and at stand-off distances of up to 50 km at relatively low pulse energy gives this technology a clear advantage over other atmospheric monitoring technologies.<BR><BR>SIBELLOPTICS proposed and successfully executed on a Phase I SBIR contract whose purpose was to design, build, and test a novel hemispherical scanner as part of a compact all-fiber coherent wind LIDAR sensor.  Activities included detailed drawings, procurement of the custom opto-mechanical materials, and build and test of the scanner assembly and controller.  <BR><BR>During the execution of contract NNX11CG86P SIBELLOPTICS designed, procured, and assembled the key components of the hemispherical scanner and controller and tested the assembly for operation with the control computer, repeatability of positioning, accuracy of pointing, and azimuth and elevation load endurance.  <BR>  <BR>In Phase II, it is proposed that, based upon findings and testing during Phase I efforts, the full hemispherical scanner system be designed, built, and tested using a computer-based controller that operates with an interactive, user-selected interface menu.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Of particular interest to NASA are the following LIDAR advancements:<BR>¿	Detection of aircraft-induced wake vortices and turbulence<BR>¿	Novel transceiver architectures with improvements in <BR>	  range and sensitivity<BR>	  size, weight and power (SWAP)<BR>	  system efficiency<BR>	  reliability and maintenance time<BR>¿	Wake processing algorithms<BR>¿	Real-time data reduction and display schemes<BR><BR>The fiber-LIDAR unit can also be redesigned for greater compactness and efficiency for installation and operation on an aircraft.  Reductions in size are facilitated because the full capabilities and environmental control will not be required on the aircraft.<BR><BR>In addition of wind sensing, SIBELLOPTICS engineers are exploring reconfigurations of the LIDAR system to allow the measurement of chemicals and other particulates in the atmosphere.  These capabilities have wide application in meteorology and climate change research.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		SIBELLOPTICS, LLC was formed to provide wind measuring instruments to several global market segments; (1) aviation, (2) wind energy (3) meteorology and (4) maritime.<BR>Aviation:<BR>In the major countries of the world, LIDAR has been recognized as the most suitable instrument to measure glide slope wind hazards and wake vortices. The U.S. aviation market could probably absorb at least 50 units over five years which represents a market size of almost $50 million at the proposed prices. On the international market, there are another 50 airports in need of a LIDAR system.<BR>Wind Energy:<BR>Wind energy generation is one of the fastest growing industries in the world. The Global Wind Energy Council is predicting the market to grow by 140 GW by the year 2012. LIDARs are gaining a great deal of momentum in this market segment as a means to assess potential wind farm sites, optimize the performance of current facilities, and to protect expensive wind turbines from damage. <BR>Maritime:<BR>Maritime markets include sales to ocean-going vessels as well as subscription wind data and weather sales to harbors and ports. There are four opportunities to address in this market: (1) the owners of luxury yachts, (2) the yacht manufacturers, (3) the yacht charter operators and (4) the harbor market where ships of all types operate. <BR>Meteorological:<BR>Environmental scientists have used LIDAR systems to accurately track the direction and dispersion of factory atmospheric emissions and to tracking typhoons.

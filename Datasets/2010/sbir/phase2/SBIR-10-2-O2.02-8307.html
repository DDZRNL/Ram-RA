		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In order to design and manufacture complex, one-of-a-kind to limited quantity rocket propulsion system components, while shortening the development cycle time and reducing the associated costs, an innovative method must be developed that expands upon current manufacturing technologies. A flexible manufacturing system that can handle the production of such parts in short time periods is desirable. Today's near-net fabrication technologies are extremely limited in design flexibility due to the use of injection molding. Considering the need for design flexibility as well as shorter development cycles, reduced costs, and minimized variance in making one-of-a-kind components, an innovative manufacturing technology will be demonstrated in this work to fabricate geometrically complex superalloy components

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA applications include rocket and airbreathing propulsion system components, especially those requiring sophisticated internal passageways for higher efficiency.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA applications include military and commercial rocket and airbreathing propulsion system components, industrial gas turbine components, industrial pump and valve components that use superalloys for corrosion resistance, and biomedical implants.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The International Space Station (ISS) needs to keep quiet to<BR>maintain a healthy and habitable environment in which crewmembers<BR>can perform long-term and uninterrupted scientific research<BR>under microgravity conditions. Acoustic survey is now performed<BR>once every two months using hand-held devices at 60 locations<BR>on the ISS. It takes a significant amount of precious crew time <BR>and the sporadic monitoring program is not adequate. NASA has<BR>defined a need for an automated, continuous acoustic monitoring <BR>system that is efficient in power consumption (long battery life),<BR>accurate, highly integrated, wireless connected, scalable, <BR>small and lightweight. WeVoice Inc.\ proposed to develop a<BR>ZigBee-based wireless sensor network for acoustic monitoring<BR>to meet the challenges. During Phase I of this projects, three<BR>essential capabilities were developed, tested, and validated:<BR>* The design of a data collection subsystem that integrates <BR>  measurement microphones and the feasibility of using the <BR>  state-of-the-art MEMS microphones.<BR>* The development of accurate and computationally efficient<BR>  signal processing algorithms for acoustic frequency<BR>  (octave, 1/3-octave, and narrowband) analysis and sound <BR>  level measurement.<BR>* The construction of a ZigBee network for data	communication.<BR><BR>In addition, the WeVoice SBIR research team has started working <BR>on flight-like devices. Clear directions for improvement were <BR>established for the Phase II efforts that may follow. The Phase II<BR>program focuses on system integration and optimization,<BR>software implementation, and graphical user interface development. <BR>An in-situ calibration plan will be suggested and a demonstrable<BR>system will be delivered to NASA for testing in a ground facility<BR>at the completion of the Phase II contract. So the expected TRL<BR>then is expected to reach 6.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The goal of this program is to develop a miniaturized and in-situ operated gas microsensor array for the real time monitoring of chemical composition of turbine engine combustors and/or exhaust streams to improve NASA's aeronautical flight test capabilities.  Phase II will develop a high temperature microsensor array suitable for incorporation in engines, as installed in aircraft.  Sensor arrays developed by our team and research partners have been demonstrated for ground test usage to quantify composition of critical constituents in turbine engine exhaust products, e.g., CO, CO2, NOx, O2 and HC.  To date, our research efforts for exhaust monitoring have focused on ground applications, such as installations in stationary rigs for engine development.  The goal of the proposed program is to build on knowledge accumulated on ground-based systems to develop a flyable prototype.  The program will leverage test opportunities in larger research programs to move through the maturation steps from ground-based to flyable systems.  The microsensor array probe, cabling and control electronics will be developed to withstand the harsh environment of an aircraft engine.  Initial tests will be performed with the prototype installed the engine of a grounded airplane.  Beyond Phase II, full flight tests are envisioned.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal targets the improvement of NASA's ground and flight test aeronautics testing capabilities. Potential end users within NASA include ground test facilities such as Western Aeronautical Test Range (WATR) and Flight Loads Laboratory (FLL), as well as flight facilities such as DFRC with both piloted and unmanned systems.  Real-time, in-flight data regarding combustor condition and emissions species can provide a previously unavailable test capability for NASA.  Monitoring of bleed air for contaminants and fuel backflow is also an area of interest.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology has military and commercial applications as well, which fits well with NASA's mission for the promotion of advanced technology for civil aviation.  Near term, based on input from members of the emissions testing community, there is a need for a lower cost, readily available emissions detection capability for use in engine development and performance measurements.  As the sensors and packaging technologies mature, the gas sensor array system might also be used for emissions certification testing for commercial engines.  This technology will also apply to in-situ measurement capabilities for coal power plants, industrial burners, boilers, gas turbines, and other engines.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Among thermal control methods, variable-emittance materials remain the most promising for addressing deficiencies of current systems (mechanical louvers, loop heat pipes, MEMS, electrostatics, phase change materials, others), especially, e.g., for missions in extreme light/dark environments, planetary platforms. This firm's unique, patented variable-emittance skin technology, based on conducting polymers, microporous membranes and ionic liquids, with proven, space-environment performance, remains at the world forefront, with highest known Delta-emittance, good Turn-Down Ratio (TDR), very low power, low cost. Phase I work demonstrated separate emittance variation from 0.065 to 0.816,  Delta-emittance > 0.48, and long-term space durability, with one "breakthrough" innovation, two  very significant innovations. A clear, specific pathway was demonstrated for combining low/high emittance in single devices to achieve TDR of 7.1, possibly 10.0. Phase II work will use this as basis to increase the TDR to > 7.1, possibly > 10.0, keeping the dark-state emittance ca. >/= 0.80.  Surface Solar Absorptance will be further reduced from present ca. 0.31 to as low as possible (objective 0.09 to 0.24). Other Phase II tasks, following completion of TDR optimization, will address Controller, further space-qualification testing, manufacture, space-flights,  commercialization pathway, other issues. Two identified commercial partners will assist in marketing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		If successful, this variable-emittance technology may displace extant, alternative technologies (e.g. those listed in the Abstract) on manned and unmanned space platforms and spacecraft, including planetary and interplanetary platforms  and small (micro-, < 20 kg, nano, < 2 kg) as well as large spacecraft. It will also give rise to much greater engineering design flexibility in space platforms as well as spacecraft, potentially opening doors to profound new applications. The potential variable emittance market is estimated at 120 to ca. 2000 m^2 per year, with a substantial (> 50%) portion for NASA. One example of an immediate future application is the Solar Probe Plus mission to Mercury, with expected launch in 2017-2018.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The commercial space industry, including future micro- and nano-spacecraft, near-space tourism, very high altitude balloons, large satellites, and possible future manned and unmanned space platforms, could all transition to this variable-emittance technology, displacing extant technologies. It would also give rise to much greater engineering design flexibility in space platforms as well as spacecraft. This may potentially open doors to profound new applications, e.g. in micro-satellites such as the CubeSats which currently have no thermal control means. This would ¿democratize¿ space, allowing small and medium businesses to launch their own, dedicated satellites. Other potential applications of this technology include terrestrial, military IR camouflage/stealth which this firm has been pursuing elsewhere, with an estimated market size about 3 X the space market, and building or shelter cover materials for desert climates with high night/day temperature variations, in both commercial and military applications.

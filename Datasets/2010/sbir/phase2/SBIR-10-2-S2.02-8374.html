		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Using small aperture telescopes for detecting exoplanets could have a significant impact on astronomy and other imaging and space communication systems. In this new generation of smaller, lighter and more affordable coronagraph systems, the starlight is rejected with the aid of phase-based transparent masks capable of transmitting planetary light at small angular separation from the star. These so-called vector vortex waveplates (VVW) are complex optical components wherein the optical axis orientation is azimuthally modulated in space at a high spatial frequency. In the Phase 1 of the project, we showed the feasibility of fabricating VVWs that would meet requirements for astronomy applications due to small singularity size, high topological charge, high contrast, and broadband functionality. The breakthrough polarization conversion and beam shaping technology of printing VVWs developed in the Phase 1 will undergo further fundamental improvements in the Phase 2 of the project along with further optimization of photoalignment materials and liquid crystal polymers to fabricate and deliver VVWs characterized by: subwavelength singularity sizes; spectrally broadband/achromatic functionality, particularly, for infrared wavelengths; stability to radiation and large temperature variations; and functionality at cryogenic temperatures. This will accomplish the project's general objective &#150; development and delivery of VVWs adequate for practical use.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The new generation coronagraphy systems will be of interest for many, small and large, astronomical instruments and observatories, including Palomar observatory, the Very Large Telescope in Chile (ESO), Keck telescope, Large Binocular telescope, European-ELT and the Thirty-Meter Telescope (TMT). A number of Government projects will greatly benefit using these components, among them the ACCESS (Actively Corrected Coronagraph for Exoplanet Space Studies, JPL) and its European equivalent SEE-COAST (Super-Earth Explorer- Coronagraphic off-axis Space Telescope, Observatory of Paris); TPF-C (Terrestrial Planet Finder-Coronagraph); and NASA's recent "Strategic Astrophysics Technology, Technology Development for Exoplanet Missions" project.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High quality achromatic VVWs that allow high contrast modulation of light beams have important applications in many fields of optics and photonics, including optical tweezers, image processing, phase contrast microscopy, electro-optical and all-optical switching, information displays and free-space optical communications.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		3D Flash LIDAR (3DFL) is ideal for determining real-time spacecraft trajectory, speed and orientation to the planet surface, as well as evaluating potential hazards at the landing.  The "framing camera" nature of 3DFL systems makes them well suited as hazard avoidance and docking sensors for EDL and AR&D.  3DFL can provide a direct, real-time measurement of the altitude of the spacecraft during descent as well as surface relative velocity and orientation, while simultaneously mapping terrain topography to identify landing hazards and provide localization information.  ASC has developed the core technology for Flash LIDAR with its 3D-FPA hybrid, but would like to work with NASA to further enhance the functionality of the 3D sensor by adding embedded image enhancement and classification algorithms. For this SBIR solicitation, ASC is developing a new 3D Flash LIDAR camera architecture that allows for embedded processing of 3D Flash LIDAR point clouds.  <BR>Advanced Scientific Concepts Inc. (ASC) is a small business that has developed a number of 3D flash LADAR systems and has twice successfully flown 3DFL cameras (DragonEyes) on space shuttle (STS 127 and 133)  Rendezvous and Docking DTO missions with the ISS; the first 3DFL in space.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		These sensor improvements will increase the success of NASA operations such as:<BR>¿	Mars Landed Exploration <BR>¿	Exploration of Moons (ALHAT, Jupiter Icy Moons) <BR>¿	Asteroid and Comet Rendezvous and Sample Return <BR>¿	ISS Rendezvous and Docking <BR>¿	Space Situational Awareness <BR>¿	Rock Abundance and Distribution Maps <BR>¿	Topographical Mapping <BR>¿	Rover Mobility and Navigation <BR><BR>NASA Langley Research Center has purchased three of ASC's existing 3DFL camera systems for performing laboratory, field, and airborne test and evaluation of this technology for use on the ALHAT program.  The system has been deployed for EDL helicopter experiments and has shown excellent results.   NASA LaRC has supported an effort to produce high density arrays for increased area coverage for the ALHAT mission by funding ASC under a NASA NRA.  Under a LaRC sponsored SBIR ASC has developed unit cells and ROICs that show a 3-10 times increase in sensitivity. ASC currently sells  and has customers for a very competitively priced ISS Rendezvous and Docking sensor, the DragonEye.

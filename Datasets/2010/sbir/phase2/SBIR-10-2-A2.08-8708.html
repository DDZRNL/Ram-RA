		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		As NASA modeling efforts grow more complex and more distributed among many working groups, new tools and technologies are required to integrate their efforts effectively. This project will build on Phoenix Integration's current product suite (ModelCenter, Analysis Server, and AnalysisLibrary) to create a collaborative modeling and execution environment for large system models. The project will involve many interrelated elements: 1) The use of reference components, which are pointers to sub-models that reside elsewhere, are managed independently, and are updated automatically in a master model, 2) The use of a model library such that collaborators can share their efforts in a centralized network-based repository, 3) An execution manager that can distribute and parallelize runs efficiently among several available compute resources, 4) The separation of models, data, and links such that they can be managed independently and reused effectively, 5) The simplification of model building efforts by providing debugging and diff tools to developers much like those that exist in the software industry, 6) User interface features that make model building easier, such as quick validation of model correctness, the ability to create sub-models from assemblies, etc. These elements will be developed with and tested against real modeling efforts taking place at NASA Langley.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology will combine with previously developed NASA SBIR technology and other NASA funded technologies to directly support the goals of the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Program (FAP) and the Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) programs by giving NASA engineers the tools that they need to efficiently develop more comprehensive and accurate MDO system models. The end result will be a shortened design cycle, a reduction in errors and rework, increased innovation, and ultimately better aircraft designs. The need for a comprehensive and flexible MDO design tools extends beyond aeronautics and also encompasses other important NASA activities. For example, the framework will also benefit engineers in the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) and the NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD), as they develop the next generation of space vehicles and systems. Several NASA sites use Phoenix Integration's products and would benefit from the technology developed here such as JPL (new space mission concepts), Glenn (propulsion system design), Johnson (mission analysis), Ames (multidisciplinary systems analysis), and Kennedy (space mission in-situ resource utilization).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Beyond NASA, the proposed technology will benefit a wide range of high-tech organizations involved in the design of complex vehicles and systems. These organizations include other government agencies such as DoD, DOE, and DOT/FAA, as well as commercial aerospace and defense organizations such as BAE, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Pratt and Whitney, and Raytheon. Many of these organizations already use Phoenix Integration's products and would benefit from an enhanced collaborative integration and trade-study environment. Other markets include the automotive, green energy, electronics, process, energy, heavy machinery, and shipbuilding industries.

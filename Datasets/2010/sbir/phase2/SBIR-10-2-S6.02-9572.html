		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The innovation aims to develop the tools for multiple geobrowsers to communicate over the Internet to create a real collaborative experience over computer desktop virtual globes when dealing with any type of geospatial information.  These functions are especially important when dealing with decision makers, who frequently are non-GIS experts that require visualizing their own assets on a map, like their firefighter engine positions, combined with external expertise and other relevant datasets, like NASA MODIS wildfire hotspots, creating actionable geospatial information to make better informed and timelier decisions.<BR><BR>The ultimate objective would be a fully interoperable multi-platform collaborative decision environment that delivers accurate information on emerging situations while collaborating with distributed partners, advisors, specialists and authorities in various jurisdictions, regardless of the virtual globe, hardware or operating systems used.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA would greatly benefit from the future development of a multi-platform virtual globe collaboration tool in everything related to intra-agency and inter-agency collaborations dealing with Earth Science Research Data and any geo-collaboration requiring a common operating platform (COP).<BR><BR>NASA applications include, but are not limited to:<BR>- Supporting operational agencies such as NWS, DHS (Federal, State and Local levels)<BR>- Natural resource management and policymaking;<BR>- Emergency Management Real-Time Collaboration and Decision Support; from pre- to post-disaster;<BR>- Earth Science Research Data Presentations;<BR>- Aviation decision support and assessment (i.e. volcanic ash detection and coordination);<BR>- Earth observation science training and outreach<BR>- Data integration with other agencies and partners (Domestic and International)
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The solution would be designed with both open standards and popular commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components for rapid deployment, early adoption and innovative growth in support of cross agency information sharing.  The core of the system would deliver the ability to distribute information in a way that allows end users access to relevant knowledge in a timely manner when it is most needed. The solution will deliver the "last mile" of information directly into user's hands for immediate assessment and decision support.<BR>The solution would be designed to assist in all aspects of the disaster management cycle operation; from pre to post disaster, including rapidly deployable distributed networks to support larger geographic areas of first responders.  These networks are critical to coordinate situational awareness and decisive actions in order to save lives and protect property. <BR><BR>Non-NASA applications include, but are not limited to:<BR>- Improving the usage of earth science data for disasters prediction, identification, assessment and/or mitigation.<BR>- Weather briefings and associated hazards;<BR>- Events that require coordination at multiple levels and would benefit from a Common Operating Picture (COP) such as crime tracking and positioning of emergency vehicles;<BR>- Fire and Rescue services; Search and rescue<BR>- Enhancing decision support from a tactical and strategic perspective

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Deployable Space Systems (DSS) will focus the proposed Phase 2 SBIR program on the hardware-based development and TRL advance of a highly-modularized and extremely-scalable solar array (Mega-ROSA) that provides immense power level range capability from 100kW to many Megawatts in size. Mega-ROSA will enable extremely high power spacecraft applications, including: Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) spacecraft, SEP space-tug, and large-scale Planetary and Human Exploration missions because of its ground-breaking stowed packaging efficiency, high deployed stiffness / strength, low-cost and straightforward ground test capability. The innovative and synergistic Mega-ROSA solutions, to be validated to a TRL 6 level during the proposed Phase 2 program, will enable future high power missions through low cost (25-50% cost savings depending on PV and blanket technology), high specific power (>200 W/kg to 400 W/kg BOL at the wing level depending on PV and blanket technology), extremely compact stowage volume (>50 kW/m3 for very large arrays), high deployment reliability, platform simplicity (low parts count and reduced potential failure modes), high deployed strength/stiffness (>5X stiffer and stronger than rigid panel arrays of similar sizes), high voltage capability, scalability to ultra-high power (100kW to several Megawatts), and operability in unique environments (high/low illumination, high/low sun intensity and high radiation).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA space applications are comprised of practically all Exploration, Space Science, Earth Science, Planetary Surface, and other missions that require photovoltaic power production through deployment of a lightweight, modular and highly scalable structural system.  The proposed technology is particularly well suited for ultra-high power applications including, but not limited to, high power spacecraft, Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) spacecraft, space-tugs, and large scale Planetary Science applications.  Because the Mega-ROSA technology can package much more power into a given launch vehicle envelope than any other solar array it potentially enables future cost-constrained NASA SMD/ESMD (and other) missions because the stowed-package of an ultra-high-power array actually can fit within the designated compact stowage volume of a smaller, less expensive and more readily available launch vehicle.  Mega-ROSA's ability to potentially reduce launch vehicle needs could literally provide a step function in large NASA SEP / Exploration mission cost savings.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA space applications are comprised of practically all missions that require photovoltaic power production through deployment of a lightweight and modular structural system.  The proposed technology is particularly well suited for ultra-high power applications including: high power spacecraft, space-tugs, power station applications, and other large scale applications.  Mega-ROSA is well suited for applications requiring affordability, lightweight, scalability/modularity, compact stowage, operability within high radiation environments, high voltage operation, and operation in LILT and HIHT environments.  Applicable non-NASA space missions include: LEO surveillance, reconnaissance, communications and other critical payload/equipment satellites, LEO commercial mapping satellites, MEO satellites & re-supply space-tugs, and GEO commercial communications satellites. A strong commercial infusion path has been identified for the Mega-ROSA technology and the proposed Phase 2 program.  DSS has a formed strategic relationship with Orbital Sciences Corporation and Space Systems Loral for this program and the Mega-ROSA technology to help expedite commercialization / technology infusion into their high power applications.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The goal of this Phase II SBIR program is to demonstrate the application of Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM) solid state metal 3D printing to create new and innovative of metal matrix composites for selective reinforcement and lightweighting. Our intent is to enable Space Launch System structures with superior mechanical properties and increased reliability, and validate these advancements with third party testing. Specifically, this effort will develop lightweight and multifunctional composite components in aerospace aluminum alloys, selectively reinforced with metal matrix composite, and study the effect of embedding on structural integrity using UAM-embedded mechanical strain gauges.<BR><BR>With NASA guidance, the project team Phase II plan is to select and develop functional prototypes of Space Launch System structures to illustrate efficient space vehicle concepts. A demonstration unit will be delivered to NASA for testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The project team intends to develop Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM) manufacturing processes supporting the Space Launch System to create structures with superior mechanical properties and increased reliability. UAM-enabled structures are an important enabler for minimized touch labor and final assembly steps, increased reliability and reduced cost. UAM, by its nature, enables improved lead times by directly printing parts in one machine at one time, eliminating part movements from process to process (and vendor to vendor).<BR><BR>The solid state UAM bond in conjunction with an additive / subtractive system allow for custom structures to be manufactured with reinforcing members in any three-dimensional configuration. These composites can be created directly on existing structures manufactured through other processes, resulting in launch structures with lower mass and improved process lead time.<BR><BR>The solid state nature of the UAM bond allows for combining any metal combination without formation of brittle intermetallics. This enables layer by layer material changes for complex graded metal structures. This can directly lead to lighter structures with increased structural efficiency by combining multiple functions in one component. <BR><BR>The UAM application has potential for manufacturing in space. Processes that melt the substrate material are dangerous for the operator especially during long-duration space flight. UAM has no high energy beams, splatter, or molten metal.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The initial application of high performance UAM-enabled structures will likely be in NASA, defense and commercial space structure programs, in that order. This estimate recognizes the high performance technology leading nature of the organizations and their missions. The project team already services aerospace customers. Agreements with these customers uniformly prohibit publication of the details of our work with them.

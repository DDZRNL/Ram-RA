		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We have demonstrated the ability of our Dynamic Monitoring and Decision Systems (DyMonDS) framework to structure a systems approach to the modeling and control of aircraft electric power systems. To begin, we selected two example aircraft power systems and developed dynamic models for those systems within the DyMonDS framework.  Next, we derived optimized sets of control set points for the power systems.  Each set of set points constituted an optimized allocation of resources under an assumed aircraft operating condition.  A separate set of control set points was derived for each assumed operating condition.  To do so the selected aircraft electric power systems were first mapped into equivalent terrestrial power systems. The NETSS optimization software for terrestrial electric power systems was then applied to optimize the aircraft power systems.  Finally, we developed and stabilizing controllers for electric power system operation around each set point set.  To do so, critical, and potentially unstable, aircraft electric power system dynamics were first identified for closed-loop control.  Finally, the required controllers were designed and simulated to show that they indeed stabilized the dynamics around the prescribed set points. All accomplishments were greatly facilitated by the DyMonDS framework.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The design and power-electronic control of individual aircraft energy system components is well understood today. Less consideration has been given to integrating these components into electric power systems that operate in adaptive conditions-driven ways to ensure fault-tolerance, stability and efficiency. The DYMONDS framework developed here directly addresses this systems-thinking need.  It introduces a multi-layered interactive approach to nonlinear power-electronically-switched control of AC-DC and DC-AC converters so the desired power is provided in transiently stable ways in response to varying aircraft situations. The approach can be extended to controlling electric power systems for single vehicle and future multi-vehicle manned deep-space missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The non-NASA commercial applications primarily concern the operation of terrestrial electric power systems such as utility systems, �smart� grids and micro-grids. The proposed DYMONDS framework enables a significantly new approach to the modeling and control of future electric power systems. These systems in particular will require the systematic integration of diverse energy storage and intermittent resources, which is directly addressed by the DYMONDS framework. For example, in parts of the Texas power grid today, wind power plants involving doubly-fed induction generators connected via a weak power-electronically controlled transmission line have experienced oscillations. Advanced digital control is required to prevent the oscillations, and such controls could be naturally developed within the DYMONDS framework. It is our belief that pursuing the modeling and control of complex NASA energy systems will contribute greatly to the process of modeling and controlling future terrestrial electric power systems. In this way the results of our Phase I project have the potential for major non-NASA impact as well.

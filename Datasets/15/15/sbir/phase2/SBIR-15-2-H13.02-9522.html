		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		As a result of an extremely productive Phase I program, SPEC has designed and built a pre-prototype of a 1.5 U CubeSat format LIDAR, with class 1 eye-safe lasers for space structure inspection applications.  The Space Vehicle Inspection High Range Resolution, Raman Spectral LIDAR provides both Raman Spectra for determination of the surface chemical content and precision imaging consisting of high range accuracy 3D LIDAR and RGB camera images fused to give an HD resolution image.  Range accuracy for the high range accuracy 3D LIDAR is 15 microns out to a range of 6 meters.  This capability is achieved by adapting a SPEC part inspection LIDAR with the high framing long range SPEC LIDARs.  The chemical detection capability can interrogate a molecule one layer thick adsorbed on the surface determining chemical content and allowing detection of leaks or contamination in pressurized or vacuum conditions.  The LIDAR provides both ultra, high resolution imaging of surface imperfections and holes caused by micro meteor or debris, and the chemical content map of the 3D imaged area. Maximum range for the Raman LIDAR is 300m at 3mm resolution and 6 meters at 15micron resolution.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA commercial applications for the High Range Resolution, Raman Spectral LIDAR are primarily for satellite inspection and repair and commercially with life extension packages for geosync communication satellites. Additional applications include space junk removal, operation of air and space platforms, 3d multispectral mapping and high speed descent landing for missions, such as the Mars, Venus and asteroid missions. Additionally, rendezvous and docking missions, such as with the space station, are supported. Other NASA commercial applications include long range acquisition, navigation, inspection, and robotic control of space platforms and satellites.  Future uses would support non-GPS assisted navigation and optimal route planning for virtually every air platform from small UAVs to large airplanes.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA commercial applications of the High Range Resolution, Raman Spectral LIDAR include intercept and docking missions for communications satellite life extension satellites and can be used for vehicle inspection missions by commercial and DoD customers. The Raman Spectral capabilities allow both multi-dimensional surface mapping and chemical analysis of surfaces for superior navigation, flight control, landing operations, docking, satellite inspection and maintenance.  Critically needed structural inspection of commercial space assets is a direct spin off.  Other commercial applications include: remote sensing of chemicals in the environment, monitoring of crops, forests, and urban areas; detection of explosives, bio toxins: and detection and monitoring of radioactive containers by the nitrous oxide adsorbed on the surface. Other applications are in waste stream monitoring, pollution and leak detection, and multi-dimensional imaging.  Airborne applications can be eye-safe on the ground with ranges up to 3km.  Ultra-high range accuracy applications include high resolution 3D imaging of complex, multispectral scenes.

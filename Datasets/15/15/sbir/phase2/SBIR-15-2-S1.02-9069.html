		<BR>
		To meet the needs of future NASA Earth science objectives, significant advancements in the overall level of integration and functional density that is achievable in multi-band microwave radar and radiometer instruments are proposed. The targeted system is the Wideband Instrument for Snow Measurements (WISM), which is a technology development effort to measure Snow Water Equivalent that targets the requirements of the proposed Snow and Cold Land Processes Mission. During Phase I, we developed concepts for enhancing the WISM by incorporating signal multiplexing and active devices in the PolyStrata antenna feed that are not present in the baseline version of the instrument. On the Phase II program, we propose to demonstrate these enhancements to the WISM with deliverable hardware prototypes of such active multi-band feed antennas. Drastic improvements in system noise figure and overall size are made possible by integrating the first stage of LNAs into the PolyStrata feed antenna, eliminating additional cable and diplexer losses that occur in the current modular system.

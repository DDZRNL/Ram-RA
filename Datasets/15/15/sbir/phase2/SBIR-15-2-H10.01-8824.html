		<BR>
		As the price of helium has increased substantially in recent years, the interest in finding an efficient and economical method of helium recovery has never been more important.  One method that can reduce the cost of rocket test operations is to recover hydrogen and helium gases using an electrochemical process.  Sustainable Innovations is developing a commercial electrochemical platform that separates and compresses hydrogen using Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) technology for industrial applications such as metals and electronics processing. A Helium Recovery System (HRS), based on the same platform and constructed by Sustainable Innovations, selectively removes hydrogen from the mixed H2/He stream, leaving behind the high-value helium.  The system then removes residual water vapor from this helium and compresses it to commercial storage pressure.  This system featured a subsystem that captured the vented hydrogen and helium gas mixture, an electrochemical separation subsystem that purified both hydrogen and helium streams, and a compression subsystem that permitted high pressure gas delivery. A critical next step in the advancement of the HRS design is proving the scalability of this technology.  The innovative step in this proposal is to increase the gas capacity capability of the electrochemical separation system while maintaining optimal operating efficiency and durability.  It is expected that at least a doubling of throughput capacity per unit cell area ? largely driven by the amount of current that can be practically applied to an individual cell area without hindering longevity of critical components, can be achieved. This performance will be validated by cell durability tests. The innovation will be scaled in Phase II and integrated into a low-cost, scalable, modular package that will be delivered to SSC.

		Hydrogen/Helium Separation - (SSC, KSC, MSFC) SSC has significant needs to separate and recover hydrogen and helium from its large rocket engine test stands. Hydrogen Separation for Resource Recovery ? SI is working with MSFC on a system that can separate and compress hydrogen from  CO along with other reactive gases including methane, acetylene, ethane, and ethylene.    This research project has shown that electrochemical hydrogen separation and compression is an enabling technology for the Carbon Dioxide Reduction System, facilitating closure of the oxygen loop in an Advanced Life Support System. Pressurization for Mechanical Actuation ? (JSC) The In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), group at JSC is interested in the use of hydrogen as a working fluid for mechanical actuation.  In this application, hydrogen would be compressed electrochemically, using the core architecture of the HRS.    Reformate Separation ? (JSC, MSFC)   There is a need to separate hydrogen from CO, CO2, and excess fuels in processes such as reformation of methane and other fuels.  The HRS being developed here provides the necessary technology base to support efficient separation of these constituents.Fuel Cell Energy Storage ? (GRC, JSC, JPL) Hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell systems are being carefully examined by NASA as a means of providing efficient energy storage for many different NASA missions.  Long-term missions are hampered by helium in hydrogen tanks. An HRS can alleviate this problem.

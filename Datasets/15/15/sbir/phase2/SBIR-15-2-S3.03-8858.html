		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The technical approach proposed in the Phase II program builds on the encouraging results of the Phase I program, in the excellent energy storage performance over a broad temperature range.  In this Phase II program, the proposal nanocomposite films will be feature as high energy density (>12 J/cc), dielectric breakdown strength (>600 MV/m), high wide operating voltage (hundred volt to kilovolt), high power density (>4 MW/cc) as well as high energy storage efficiency (>96%).  The capacitor energy storage module fabricated from the developed films will be feature as high energy density (>5 J/cc), high wide operating voltage (hundred volt to kilovolt), high power density (>2 MW/cc), high radiation environment, high shock (up to a 1000Gpeak) and vibration (up to 60 Grms) resistance, safe and long cycle life of 1,000,000 cycles at room temperature and more than 100,000 cycles at 400?C for future NASA scientific mission in harsh environment. The This continued development will further prove feasibility of this technology and move the technology from space TRL level 3/4, demonstrated in the Phase I, to a TRL level 5/6 at the end of the Phase II, with parts that could be tested in NASA ion thruster propulsion discharge power system (4 kW, 200 VDC and 20 amps) by the end of the two-year Phase II if an applicable system is found for testing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA Aerospace Market: The express purpose of the Phase I development nearing completion and our vision for Phase II development activities is to finalize the design and production of high performance capacitors working under extreme environment for aerospace exploration that will ultimately aid the NASA Mission in the following functional areas.<BR>1. High voltage, radiation hardened, high temperature power passive components and energy storage device.<BR>2. High power density/high efficiency power electronics and associated drivers for switching elements.<BR>3. NASA systems ion thruster propulsion power supply as well as energy storage device.<BR>4. NASA solar power system backups<BR>5. Seeker, detection systems and other remote anti-personnel<BR>6. Vehicle power assists<BR><BR>This advanced nanocomposite capacitors can be widely used in advanced power electronic and energy storage devices required by NASA for aerospace exploration, such as Titan missions, Lunar Quest, Advance aeronautic equipment and so on. The proposed nanocomposite capacitors can work at various operating temperature and voltage with high energy and power density where tradition power and energy storage device cannot be applied in. The high energy density capacitor will also make miniaturization of NASA power management systems and make the launch more efficiency.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		For the secondary military application, Powdermet's capacitor has wide applications in the fuzing system and pulse power devices, such as rail gun, laser, high power microwaves, electric vehicles and electromagnetic armor. The Air Force specifically has applications for high temperature capacitors to extend the temperature range of power electronics equipment.<BR>For other industry applications, consumer electronics and wind turbines make up the other significant opportunities. There is an urgent need for new energy storage materials capable of absorbing and delivering large amounts of energy in short periods of time for pulse-power devices. The high energy density capacitors also have huge potential in defibrillators and X-ray generators, energy conversion in photovoltaics and integrated circuits. Downhole power electronics in oil and gas industry need to work at high temperatures.

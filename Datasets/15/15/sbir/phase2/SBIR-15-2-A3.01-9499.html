		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We developed a EFB Data Communication Network (EDCN) concept that offers a more capable air-ground communications architecture. The solution takes full advantage of emerging communications technologies to integrate AOC/FOC and flight deck capabilities and leverage existing system integration between the AOC/FOC and TFMS to fully close the loop between controllers, traffic managers, pilots and dispatchers on tactical reroutes. Closing the loop between these four key stakeholder groups is an essential element for the extension of Trajectory Based Operations (TBO) and User Preferred Trajectories (UPT) into the enroute domain including NAS Oceanic airspace. This approach offers a more robust, extensible architecture that can be tailored to an individual airline's operational model while simultaneously offering an upgrade path for adding more capability over time. Our solution aims to combine the best features of recent NASA research products including DWR, DAR and TASAR, and adds more capability via enhanced data communications and connected cockpits. The solution is centered on both integration with AOC/FOC systems and the EFB  and integration of AOC/FOC systems, to provide full access to superior information. This enables our architecture to use the best available data, allocate data processing and analytical functions to where they can be performed most efficiently, and allows the stakeholders to collaborate and make the best operational decision for the users as well as ATC.<BR>Robust Analytics will developed and flight test a prototype of the EDCN with matched AOC and EFB applications to support uploading of graphical weather and exchange proposed flight re-routes to avoid weather and other NAS constraints.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are five immediate NASA applications:<BR>1.	The SMART NAS Regional Trajectory Based Operations Sub-project is directly relevant to this effort. Under Regional TBO, NASA will develop and test concepts for TBO in the New York metroplex. Our prototypes provide two direct applications:<BR>a.	Concepts to test<BR>b.	AOC-aircraft communications and application testing infrastructure to install and evaluate new TBO-related algorithms<BR>2.	TASAR operates in the EFB and would benefit from data that EDCN can receive from the AOC.<BR>3.	Dynamic Weather Routing (DWR) is a TMU-AOC decision support tool that currently operates outside of the airline IT security firewall. This severely limits is usefulness to dispatchers, especially during weather events when they need it most. Our EDCN applications work within the firewall and exchange data with AOC system continuously, provide a seamless decision support capability.<BR>4.	Real-time System-wide Safety Assurance in a strategic thrust that aims to provide prognostic risk tools to better identify hazards and precursors. Our EDCN offers a platform to gather and disseminate flight deck data for use by RSSA models.<BR>5.	Thrust 1 � Safe, Efficient Global Aviation � develops new concepts and tools to improve operational efficiency.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Airlines are eager to find ways to gain operational advantage from the availability of high bandwidth, reliable, low cost data communications. This provides a timely opportunity for both the EFB app and AOC app, and more generally the EDCN concept in the immediate future and as TBO evolves. Our concept can be deployed immediately using existing airline systems, while offering an upgrade path to support desirable new concepts including trajectory negotiation. Improved AOC access to aircraft state information will improve airline ability to predict aircraft flight times and benefit network performance.<BR>The principal mechanisms for offering our EDCN applications to airlines will come from our partnership with Sabre Airline Solutions and sales to other vendors and airlines. Our product will be attractive and add value to both AOC system vendors and EFB vendors. Airlines are also a direct sales channel, as they can add 3rd party applications to their EFBs, depending on the EFB OEM (Airbus, for example, does not allow 3rd-party apps on the EFB it sells with new aircraft purchases, which greatly reduces the value of their EFB in the view of many airlines.) <BR>Business aircraft will provide another early opportunity as they are typically more willing to experiment with new technologies and quicker to deploy it when receiving value.

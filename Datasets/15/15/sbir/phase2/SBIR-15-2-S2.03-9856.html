		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Next-generation telescopes need mirrors that are extremely stable, lightweight, and affordable. Semplastics has developed a novel, innovative ceramic material which is lightweight, low-cost, and ideal for application as a mirror substrate. High-thickness, high-stiffness objects with excellent dimensional stability, low density, and low coefficient of thermal expansion can be manufactured in one piece through our energy-efficient process. Semplastics is proposing to extend prior research and manufacturing process development to produce larger-scale circular mirrors. This innovation will reduce mirror costs per square meter by an order of magnitude over current approaches based on glass or glass-ceramic solutions. As a part of the Phase II effort, Semplastics will deliver to NASA four large mirrors (up to 0.6m in diameter), sealed to address the residual surface porosity using one of two different coating systems, with ground and polished surfaces. At the end of Phase II, we will have matured and developed our production processes such that we are ready to establish the capability to produce mirrors of one meter diameter or larger.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Several NASA activities benefit from improvements in mirror performance as well as a significant reduction in areal costs. Earth-observing and space-observing telescopes that are either balloon-borne or on-orbit have a constant need to reduce the cost and mass of their optical systems. In NASA?s search for extraterrestrial life, the mission is to locate stars with planets similar to Earth. Mirror technology is a significant key in determining whether an exoplanet's atmosphere has atmospheric water vapor or carbon dioxide as well as measuring other atmospheric chemicals. Other NASA programs with interest in improved mirror technology include the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractory Observatory (CLARREO), and the European Space Agency (ESA)/NASA dark-energy mission Euclid. WFIRST is a NASA observatory designed to perform wide-field imaging and surveys of the near infrared (NIR) sky. The CLARREO effort is a future Earth-observing mission that will establish climate benchmarks in order to assess optimizing strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change. The Euclid space observing mission will address questions related to the fundamental physics and cosmology on the nature and properties of dark energy, dark matter, and gravity. Reduced mirror areal costs translate directly to cost savings on these projects, increasing chances of success.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications for this technology outside of NASA are numerous. In the short term, direct application of the process developed under Phase II to create optics can be used to manufacture mirrors for professional and amateur astronomy / telescopes, as well as adaptive mirrors for military, medical, and automotive applications. We have also identified a number of markets and customers for which there are longer-term applications of our ceramics and mirror technology, following some additional development after the end of the Phase II effort. Our lightweight, high stability materials technology has the potential to supplant older materials technologies (such as carbon fiber and heavier ceramics) in a number of industries, such as energy, automotive, and aerospace, in addition to potential military applications.

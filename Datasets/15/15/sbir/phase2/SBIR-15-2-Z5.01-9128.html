		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Energid Technologies will develop a lightweight robot arm for attachment to new Assistive Free-Flyers (AFFs). The arm leverages Energid's existing hardware designs to reduce weight and improve performance. It enables novel modes of maneuvering and control. The arm includes a sensor suite that enables precise control of the arm and will serve to support a variety of other applications. Multiple arms may be attached to one AFF and cooperatively operated. To control the arms and base, Energid's Actin software toolkit will be extended and applied to enable use of the arms in perching and acrobatic modes, with one end-effector fixed in perching mode and momentum conservation integral to the control during acrobatic mode. Included will be powerful simulation software that, by leveraging Energid's commercial Actin software, will be cross platform, fast, and feature rich. The simulation, modeling both the AFF and the arms, will support design validation efforts as well as mission planning and testing. It will seamlessly transition between simulating terrestrial test beds and fielded AFFs in a microgravity environment. The simulation will include articulated dynamics, contact dynamics, sensors, and the aerodynamics of the AFF and arm. The full system will be validated using a custom hardware testbed.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The arm Energid proposes will advance the application of AFFs by enabling them to both sense and manipulate the environment. The ability to perch will save power and extend the life of the AFF. The simulation software, which includes both vehicle dynamics and sensors will support NASA and other researchers in exploring algorithms and missions before fielding those plans. The value provided through these applications will lead to additional work for Energid from NASA. Energid will provide support for the arm and simulation software's application on upcoming missions both as a prime contractor and as a supporting subcontractor to large NASA prime contractors.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Energid, through its Robai subsidiary, manufactures and sells the Cyton robots on which the new arm for AFFs is based. These robots are bundled with the Actin software underpinning the control and simulation software used for this project. Energid has sold approximately 300 Cyton robots to customers in many fields and markets. This contract will enable Energid to extend the Cyton into new markets, particularly for use with terrestrial quadcopters, where the lightweight low-power design will find wide application. In addition, Energid will license the control and simulation software improvements made to its Actin software toolkit. Actin is delivered as libraries and header files that can be compiled into new software.  This form of Energid's technology has found application in software for space, manufacturing, entertainment, agriculture, and oil exploration.  Energid will license the new software and provide services to support it.

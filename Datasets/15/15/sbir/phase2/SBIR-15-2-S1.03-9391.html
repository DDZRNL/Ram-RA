		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase II SBIR proposes to further develop high performance (low dark current, high quantum efficiency, and low NEdT) infrared epitaxy materials based on Type II Strained Layer Superlattice (SLS) for large format space-based sensor applications. The epi materials will be grown with Sb-capable multi-wafer production Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) reactor at IntelliEPI IR. The initial goal includes achieving QE of at least 40% with LWIR spectral wavelength band near 12 um. The SLS detector design will be developed in consultation with the infrared detector group at JPL to ensure that this effort addresses NASA needs. In the superlattice engineered structure, many detector properties are determined once epitaxial growth is completed. The technical approach will be to develop improved epitaxial stack design with a goal to dramatically improve detector properties. This is based on existing high performance GaSb-based type-II SLS detector growth technology, with novel design, development of MBE growth to implement the design, and fabrication and characterization of devices from the epi grown material. The objective is to dramatically improve quantum efficiency in the detector structure. The Phaqse II effort will focus on FPA demonstration.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Improved Type II SLS technology offer thermal imagers at higher operating temperature, uniformity, and sensitivity from mid wave to long wavelength infrared based on scalable GaSb substrates. This opens the door for more military vehicles/platforms to be outfitted with these high performance cameras. Commercially, environmental or gas sensing can benefit from competitive cost scaling.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Type II SLS technology can serve as a platform for the next generation of space-based high performance and large format infrared FPAs. This will be a materials evolution of the on going SLS technology being developed at JPL. This SLS technology offers a unified platform for high-performance 5-14 um detection wavelengths. Substrate size scaling will support large format infrared imaging NASA needs with high sensitivity and high operating temperature sensors for space-based applications.

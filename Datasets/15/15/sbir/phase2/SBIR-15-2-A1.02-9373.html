		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase II SBIR project deals with advancing the design, development, and testing of an innovative drag reduction concept named ?Smart Longitudinal Instability Prevention via Plasma Surface? using a new revolutionary plasma actuator technology developed at the University of Notre Dame (UND). During Phase I, Innovative Technology Applications Company (ITAC), LLC and researchers from UND developed and demonstrated drag reduction of more than 65% in turbulent boundary layers using the SLIPPS approach. This approach intervenes in the Streak Transient Growth Instability mechanism which is a dominant mechanism in the production of drag in turbulent boundary layer flows. In Phase II, we will investigate and test the use of SLIPPS concept at both higher Mach number and Reynolds number flows, as well as build an improved understanding of the physics in order to make even further efficiency gains possible. Phase III will advance the TRL to a level suitable for flight tests and integration into production systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		When fully developed, the SLIPPS technology would be widely applicable within NASA. Any system with significant contributions to drag from attached turbulent boundary layers could potentially benefit from this approach. This would include not only flight vehicles, but also test facilities, which could take advantage of the reduced power required to maintain test conditions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Since fuel costs have historically been the largest single cost of airline operations, any technology which offers significant drag reduction (and thus fuel savings) will be of great interest to aircraft manufacturers. Other potential areas of application include high speed rail (and also normal passenger rail). Operators of ground test facilities outside of NASA (whether DoD or privately held) might also be interested in this technology.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal is submitted to develop and validate the innovative concept for the affordable conductive thermal control material systems that are proven feasible during phase I efforts. The reproducibility and optimization of the material processing, the space environment stability, of the affordable multifunctional thermal control material system (TCMS) that can be applied to space hardware and can enables the hardware to carry higher leakage current  are planned to receive attention in phase II study. The suggested efforts emphasize developments in two material science areas: the first one considers the development of intercalated  boron nitride nano structure that includes nanotubes and nano mesh and the second area proposes the synthesis and processing of various compounds with proton and electron conductivity along with its plasma sprayable versions. The matured material system that integrates these technology aspects can allow higher leakage currents at affordable costs. Thus the envisioned affordable material systems validation efforts can provide the needed reliable TCMS in typical space environments in (LEO), (GEO) & beyond. The reliability goal for the affordable conductive TCMS are: a design life of > 10 years in LEO and > 15 years in GEO, and we anticipate the developments to mature by end of phase II ready for the hardware demonstration.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Phase II can have greatest impact on the NASA missions that need white (low aS/eT) conductive TCMS coatings with needed current carrying capability. The candidate missions that can benefit from this technology uniquely are: Cube Sats Program, W-FIRST, DAVINCI, PACE, LANDSAT 9. It may also provide unique benefits to future missions like Europa and Mars 2020. Its affordable contributions to Cube Sat program can be timely and significant.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The DOD and Commercial missions need products that can benefit from this technology uniquely are: <BR>DOD Cube Sats Program for High Radiation Environments, Survivable Second surface mirrors and TCMS that meet NRO hardening goals. Its affordable contributions to DOD and Commercial Cube Sat program can be timely and significant

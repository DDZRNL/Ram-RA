		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Orion Launch Abort System (LAS) utilizes attitude control motors (ACM) with advanced ceramic composite components that function as a valve control system to allow for safe maneuverability away from danger.  This system is made steerable due to the valve controlled thrusters which utilize advanced ceramic pintles made of 4D C/C-SiC that are attached to metallic structures and actuated.    <BR><BR>During the Phase I effort, an innovative technique to join metallics with the advanced ceramic composites was demonstrated.  Detailed characterization confirmed the deposited metal (Inconel 625) produced during this investigation had good adherence to C-C/SiC pintles and no interfacial reactions occurred during deposition or elevated temperature exposure.  In Phase II, the joining interface will be optimized and pintle assembles will be produced for hot fire testing with Orbital ATK. Additional CMC materials and components will also be developed.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Results of the Phase II will support the insertion of the joining technology of metallic to ceramic composite hot structures in the Attitude Control Motor of the Launch Abort System for SLS/Orion.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Joining advanced composites to metal structures is applicable to existing and future NASA programs including the ACM motors of Orion MPCV�s Launch Abort System, human Lunar ascent/decent, and the Commercial Crew motors; Nozzle extensions of upper stage engines for nanosatellite launch (e.g. ORBITEC�s vortex liquid rocket engine) and ISS resupply (e.g. SpaceX�s Merlin Vacuum liquid rocket engines); and RL10 engines, upper stage nozzle extensions; Nosetips, leading edges and control surfaces for hypersonic vehicles; turbine engine components, and exit cones and control vanes for tactical missiles.

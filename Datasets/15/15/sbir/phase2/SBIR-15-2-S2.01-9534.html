		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A 32x32-channel multiplexing Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) driver, which can hold a voltage signal with a 16-bit resolution or beyond, is proposed. Such a driver will greatly reduce the operation power, and are compact and reliable. When the ASIC driver is vertically integrated with a Deformable Mirror (DM), the potential wiring failure will be eliminated. Furthermore, radiation resistance will be emphasized during ASIC design. During Phase I period, we had (1) verified the concept of the proposed floating driver for controlling an HV switch configured by a pair of transistors, (2) developed a high-voltage unity-gain buffer for tracing an isolated voltage signal, which is an essential tool towards developing switch arrays with high quality, (3) established the test methods for measuring switch parameters that directly impact the performance of a DM, (4) identified the main switch parameters, feedthrough and leakage, which are the primary impediments causing the drift of a stroke. All of the above made it possible for us to focus on (1) screen HV IC processes to find a qualified IC process with which a switch featuring low leakage can be fabricated, (2) apply decoupling technique to eliminate feedthrough, (3) manufacture an advanced 32x32 switch array with a voltage-resolution of 16-bit or beyond in Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed ASIC driver, featuring a voltage-resolution of 16-bit or beyond, is specifically designed to drive a stacked DM, which NASA has been qualified in ground. It could provide a reliable, low power, monolithic DM driver that can be used by an exoplanet-imaging coronagraph. Thus, it could be found valuable in applications on those missions, such as ATLAST and WFIRST-AFTA. <BR>Future space missions require more advanced DMs that the current market cannot supply. With the scalable ASIC drivers available, more advanced DMs could be produced in aspects of (1) higher actuator count to 128x128, (2) higher actuator count DMs with better yield, controllability, and reliability.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The first beneficiaries of the ASIC drivers are the DM manufacturers. With a vertically integrated ASIC driver, the fabrication of a DM will be greatly simplified as thousands of wire bonding and cabling will no longer be required. Thus, the yield and reliability will be improved. Furthermore, with a simplified architecture, DMs with tens thousands of actuators will become possible. Another main potential non-NASA application is the scanning microscopic fidelity imaging where a compact DM is used to correct optical aberrations in the field of bio-science. Non-NASA applications for deformable mirrors also include laser beam shaping, laser communication in free space and retinal imaging.

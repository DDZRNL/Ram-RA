		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase II program will develop novel laser transmitters needed for planned airborne and space-based active remote sensing missions. This program will build on successful Phase I work to provide a Technology Readiness Level 4 (TRL-4) laboratory brassboard demonstrator of a new laser source for Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) measurements of atmospheric water vapor with secondary capability for methane characterization as well. Accurate measurements of both atmospheric constituents are critical to the understanding of global energy transport and climate change. Under our Phase I program, Fibertek successfully demonstrated the capability of a new laser source, a diode-pumped frequency-doubled Er:YAG laser to generate millijoule output near 823 nm that was tunable through water-vapor absorption lines for DIAL measurements. The new laser system offers simplicity and efficiency that will reduce risk for future airborne and space-based missions. Significantly, the new laser approach offers an upgrade path with reduction in size, weight, and power (SWaP) consumption over current state-of-the-art DIAL based on less-efficient non-linear parametric conversion of diode-pumped Nd:YAG lasers. This new-generation technology reduces the size and weight of flight hardware to make it compatible with affordable, more capable airborne and satellite payloads. In Phase II we propose to build on our successful Phase I demonstration to develop a full scale water vapor laser transmitter source, meeting or exceeding requirements for planned DIAL instruments.

		Fibertek is working closely with NASA LaRC and the Earth Sciences Technology Office (ESTO) to develop reliable, efficient laser sources meeting the requirements for advanced instruments for remote sensing of the Earth's atmosphere on a global scale.  The data provided by these sensors is critical in supporting and validating climate modeling. The novel near infrared laser with frequency conversion will enable lidar systems to be based initially on research aircraft and high-altitude UAVs for global sensing of the atmospheric water vapor and methane. The LaRC/ESTO HALO instrument planned for initial deployment in 2016 is an example of an opportunity for transition of the new technology into a fielded system.   We anticipate partnering with NASA on future IIPs, ACT and EV programs to fully develop the high-performance systems built around the laser transmitter delivered under this SBIR program.

		<BR>
		Long-range lidar systems are entering production in all branches of the military.  Increasingly these active systems require higher power for greater range and sensitivity.  The requirement for eye safety dictates that these 3D imaging and range finding systems operate in the near infrared between 1450 and 1700 nm.  The Er:YAG source with fundamental wavelength at 1645 nm developed under this SBIR program is well matched to requirements of planned 3D imaging lidars and rangefinders.  With average power greater than 10 W, diffraction-limited beam quality and nanosecond pulse width, the proposed laser system has high utility for lidar systems for aircraft, ship and ground vehicle installation.  Space-based lidar systems for DoD are also in the planning stages, and will benefit from the availability of the technology being developed under this program.

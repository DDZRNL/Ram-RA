		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A Phase II SBIR transition of NanoSonic�s high flex HybridSil space suit bladder and glove materials will provide a pivotal funding bridge toward Phase III maturation of this very promising lightweight, self-healing pressurized space suit assembly technology. Based on highly encouraging Phase I results indicating 1) its self-healing bladder composites instantly repair after puncturing with a 2 mm probe in vacuum at 10-5 torr to maintain stable operational bladder pressures of 4.3 and 8.1 psi and 2) HybridSil armor array padding provides increased abrasion and puncture resistance at lower weights than currently employed glove padding while meeting established adhesion and modulus metrics, NanoSonic envisions significant Phase III transition potential into next-generation EVA space suit ensembles. <BR><BR>To meet its proposed technical objectives, NanoSonic proposes an aggressive 24-month Phase II SBIR research program to further optimize its high flex HybridSil space suit bladder and glove materials and demonstrate their manufacturing compatibility. Upon Phase II completion, NanoSonic will provide NASA with operational lower arm bladder and TMG glove softgood prototypes integrating its optimized high flex HybridSil self-healing composite and armor array padding respectively.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		By providing unprecedented self-healing multifunctional performance along with a litany of environmental durability benefits over legacy multilayered space suit materials, NanoSonic�s high flex HybridSil bladder and armor array glove padding materials will have immediate utility within a broad spectrum of NASA applications. Near term applications will include use within current and next generation space suit bladder and glove ensembles. NanoSonic�s self-healing HybridSil bladder composites will provide previously unavailable, immediate bladder repairability while weighing less, affording increased flexibility, and providing increased puncture resistance. Additional NASA applications will include utility within inflatable habitat structures, protective jumpsuit garments, and higher performance, more durable interior materials within spacecraft.<BR><BR>NanoSonic�s HybridSil armor array padding may be immediately integrated into current and future glove ensembles to provide increased environmental durability over legacy silicone padding while weighing less and having increased flexibility.  Therefore, HybridSil armor array padding has the immediate potential to provide enhanced astronaut hand protection with less torque, reduced hand fatigue, and increased dexterity while affording improved astronaut safety.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NanoSonic�s high flex, high durability self-sealing bladder and armor array padding materials will have significant non-NASA commercial applications. Immediate secondary applications will include a broad spectrum of military and civilian protective garment and equipment applications. Considerable utility is also envisioned within inflatable aerospace structures, military / civilian inflatable boats, and military / commercial diver drysuits.

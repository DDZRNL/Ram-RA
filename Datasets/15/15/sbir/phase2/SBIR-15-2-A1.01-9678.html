		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA�s Advanced Air Vehicles program seeks to improve safety and efficiency through exploration of the value of hybrid composites, guiding utilization of the materials by industry. Cornerstone Research Group Inc. (CRG), University of Dayton Research Institute (UDRI), and NanoSperse LLC have formed a team of experts in the aerospace composites industry to demonstrate, financially justify, and quickly transition hybrid composites into commercial aircraft markets.  In Phase I, the team demonstrated a scalable, qualifiable hybrid materials solution using stitched CNT yarns capable of exceeding the performance of toughened prepregs using infusion grade materials and compatible manufacturing methods.  Phase II efforts will further validate the financial and functional viability of the hybrid composite system through identification of relevant applications, optimization of stitched laminate designs, evaluation of multifunctional properties, and scale-up of hybrid composite manufacturing methods enabling the fabrication and evaluation of a component prototype.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Supporting NASA's Advanced Air Vehicle Program, this project's technologies directly address requirements for acceleration of development and certification procedures for composite materials. This project's technologies provide an objective, value-driven roadmap for the development and integration of hybrid composite materials, leveraging scalable, certifiable design and manufacturing practices. This technology could be used by NASA to design, build, and test future aerospace research vehicles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed multifunctional hybrid composite technology has high potential for application in public and private sector commercial aircraft systems. This project's technologies, developed for NASA systems and programs, would directly apply to aerospace systems designed, manufactured, and operated by other government and commercial enterprises.<BR>Government systems, such as the B1-B, currently utilize multifunctional nanocomposites to simplify manufacturing processes and reduce maintenance, contributing significantly to life-cycle cost savings. Additional systems that would benefit from this incorporation of this technology and other hybrid composites would include fighters, bombers, transport aircraft, unmanned air vehicles, missiles, spacecraft, satellites, and marine systems operated by the Department of Defense.<BR>This technology's attributes enable multifunctional structures and coatings which should yield a high potential for private sector commercialization within commercial aviation platforms through increased efficiency and safety. With sufficient reductions in materials and manufacturing costs, these materials could also be adopted by the automotive, marine, and civil infrastructure industries.

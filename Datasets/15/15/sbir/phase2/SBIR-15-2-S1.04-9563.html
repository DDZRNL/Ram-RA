		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial silicon carbide (SiC)-based photonic sensors typically use p-i-n photodiode and reversed-biased Avalanche Photodiode (APD) detectors. These state-of-the-art SiC photodiodes use the wafer substrate as one node of the device, thereby making monolithic integration of the device with control or analysis circuitry difficult, if not impossible.<BR><BR>In Phase I, Ozark IC demonstrated that its new (patent-pending) photo detecting devices are suitable for integration in SiC-based low-voltage integrated circuit processes.  By virtue of their construction, the photo-generation occurs efficiently and with very high gain, and the devices have been shown to operate over a wide voltage (10-15 V) and temperature range (-170 C to 400 C measured).   Ozark IC's extensive library of SiC analog and mixed-signal IP and its expertise in extreme-environment IC design have been used to create the world's first fully integrated 2-D UV imager (up to 192 x 128 at > 10 frames per second); ready for fabrication in Phase II.  The imagers will be tested across a wide range of temperatures to demonstrate their applicability to planetary exploration, earth observation and astronomy applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The first obvious application of this technology is to one of NASA's many current and planned earth science missions that require space-borne instruments capable of measuring light in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum. <BR><BR>1) For the Geo-CAPE mission, recommended by the NRC for the Decadal Survey, tropospheric ozone measurements in the UV range of 290 nm-340 nm are required. An instrument based on the proposed technique is very feasible and would offer significant advantages in performance, size and weight over a discrete SiC diode-based approach. <BR><BR>2) For planetary composition experiments such as ATLAS and NOW, an instrument capable of generating a faint object spectrograph in the 115 nm - 350 nm UV range is also possible using this technology. <BR><BR>3) For planetary exploration experiments such as the proposed Discovery and New Horizons missions which intend to image planets from orbit or as landers; such as those proposed for Venus, where the high temperature operation of the imager would be desirable.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Other non-NASA markets include Machine Vision, Disinfection, Industrial Controls, Safety, and Diagnostic/Inspection Systems. Deep UV imaging is of particular interest to semiconductor and scientific imaging markets.  UV imaging for LAr neutrino detectors is also being investigated.<BR><BR>An Innovation for Manufacturing:  The application of the proposed imager to Machine Vision has major implications for increased automation of inspection tasks that are critical for nanoscale manufacturing.

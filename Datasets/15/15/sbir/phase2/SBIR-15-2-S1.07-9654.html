		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The overall goal of this Phase II SBIR effort is to develop a three-wavelength, backscatter transceiver for in situ validation of ongoing High Spectral Resolution Lidar measurements.  The key innovation in the effort is the use of a multi-element, non-linear waveguide for highly efficient, three wavelength generation in a collinear geometry ideally suited for use in the backscatter nephelometer at the HSRL wavelengths currently under development with NASA Langley�s Aerosol Research Group Experiment.  Developing an in-flight, backscatter measurement at the three HSRL wavelengths is a critical acquisition for the LARGE program in order both to validate and to establish a direct link between the existing suite of instruments flown to determine of the microphysical properties of aerosols and the remote HSRL measurement.  The proposed in situ instrument will validate ongoing remote sensing measurements while further informing climate models through more accurate estimates of atmospheric aerosol distributions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		AdvR is planning to continue developing the technology in close coordination with the NASA LARGE team.  AdvR is targeting infusion with LARGE scientists in coordination with the HSRL program.  The proposed transceiver is well suited to provide the link between remote Lidar measurements and existing in situ instruments.  Missions similar to SABOR or NAAMES are suitable fits for the technology demonstration.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		AdvR is targeting commercialization in two segments: OEMs and researchers from university and government labs. AdvR will focus efforts on delivering prototype transceivers to OEMs for eventual integration into their nephelometer product lines. Supporting revenue will come from direct sales to researchers developing their own in-situ measurement systems. Other applications potentially interested in the 3 wavelength source are environmental and pollution monitoring and laser inspection and diagnostics.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The technical objectives of the phase II effort include the fabrication of  precision DBR lasers and the prototype of compact hybrid optical module.<BR><BR>Task 1. 828nm DBR laser fabrication.  Based on the performance of qualified epi material, the 828nm DBR architecture will be optimized. We will proceed to laser fabrication with current best practices. Task 2. Device reliability and lifetime testing We plan for accelerated lifetime testing of up to 128 devices to obtain the various activation energy describing device performance under different conditions. Task 3. Hybrid optical module design. Photodign will work with a subcontractorto to develop hybrid optical packaging. The optimized design will integrate the DBR laser with collimating lenses, built-in isolator and fiber coupling into a custom hybrid housing. Task 4. Hybrid optical module evaluation Primary characteristics of the  hybrid optical module include high optical efficiency and narrow linewidth, which will be evaluated upon the delivery of prototype units. Task 5. Additional 815nm ? 820nm DBR laser fabrication. DBR laser fabrication is proposed at this wavelength for offering prototype devices for air borne LIDARs. Task 6. Prototype delivery and production readiness. Deliverables will include three prototype 828nm hybrid packaged DBR laser modules and three prototype 815-820nm DBR laser devices.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's primary application for the compact integration laser module is the deployment in the autonomous field DIAL sensor networks for mapping atmospheric water vapor with high spatial and temporal resolution. This application is well aligned with the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) instrument development program through the implement of smaller and more affordable DIAL transmitters. Follow-on development of 815nm -820nm lasers shall enable the deployment in airborne and space-based Lidars.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		)<BR>The miniature integrated laser module would be the most compact DBR laser with embedded optics in the market. The narrow linewidth and high power laser module finds applications in spectroscopy, atomic physics, and fiber amplifiers. Its spectral stability is desirable in resolving hyperfine structures and in providing long coherent length. Its compactness is suitable for handheld instruments.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Crown Consulting, Inc., proposes a new method of verification and validation for autonomous operations by using cloud computing resources for massively parallel execution of National Airspace System (NAS) simulations. This method increases by an order of magnitude the number of Monte Carlo simulation runs that can be executed in a given time, enabling assessments of safety and performance across thousands of scenarios. Uses of this innovation include verification and validation of concepts for autonomous UAS operations, validation of advanced NAS concepts, and development of SMART NAS. Phase II will develop and demonstrate the concept by creating a sUAS SMART NAS Testbed simulation running thousands of cases simultaneously, along with automated system performance and safety assessment. Applications to NASA needs include analysis of concepts for UAS operations, prognostic safety assessment, NAS performance assessment, exploring applications of autonomy, and real-time evaluation of traffic flow strategies.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA commercial applications include licensing results for the following uses:<BR>*	Developing UTM and other concepts for UAS operations<BR>*	Prognostic safety assessments and concepts and NAS performance assessments<BR>*	Amplifying the capabilities of existing simulation models.<BR>*	Exploring applications of autonomy.<BR>*	Real-time evaluation of traffic flow management strategies
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA uses of this innovation include:<BR>*	Concept evaluation by FAA and system developers<BR>*	Validation and FAA certification of new concepts for prognostic safety assessment<BR>*	Development of a system-wide prognostic safety assurance system<BR>*	Evaluating tradeoffs and alternative designs of automated or autonomic systems<BR>*	Exploring applications of autonomy, including safety issues

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A laser based terminal descent sensor is proposed that will provide real-time ground-relative altitude, attitude, and vertical velocity at high data rates to a navigation computer of a vehicle during landing on a near earth object or planetary body.  The operational range of the sensor in Mars, for example, can exceed ten kilometers through touchdown, and may conceivably be a low mass, volume, and cost replacement for the Terminal Descent Sensor (TDS) on missions like the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL).  The sensor is compact, rugged, and can be easily integrated with other NASA smart sensor systems coming of age, such as the Autonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) project or JPL's Lander Vision System (LVS). During Phase I we propose to detail the complete system design, model the transmitter laser, and test key components that will benchmark our model in preparation of a full system development in Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Terminal Descent Lidar System and components thereof can be used in many NASA missions serving various tasks. As proposed, the sensor would be an integral part of the navigation suite of sensors needed to provide precision landing of payloads at locations of high scientific value, for human and robotic missions.  In addition to navigation state estimates during the terminal descent phase, the sensor may provide terrain maps from high altitudes, used for terrain relative navigation.  From Earth orbit, a modified version of this sensor would be ideal for precision altimetry missions like ICESat, ICESat-2, or GEDI.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications of the sensor and/or sensor components include services sought out by other civilian local, state, or federal government organizations such as NOAA, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, to name a few, for topographical mapping, vegetation coverage, wildlife conservation, or organizations in DoD for applications such as smart weapons terrain relative navigation, or aircraft navigation in GPS deprived environments.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Energid Technologies proposes a game-theory inspired simulation tool for testing and validating robotic lunar and planetary missions. It applies Monte Carlo simulation within a multi-optimization environment tailored to the needs of NASA. Stochastic optimization is combined with randomized simulation to maximize multiple statistical measures of performance and calculate the parameters giving the extreme scenarios. The tool works with continuous parameters, such as mass and terrain properties, and with discrete parameters, such as lighting selection, gearing selection, and navigation parameters. It includes accurate modeling of sensors and terrain interaction using calculations performed on Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). The technique proposed is computationally expensive, but highly parallelizable, and the approach includes a design for distribution of computational burden over multiple computers, GPUs, clusters, and cloud configurations. The proposed combination of fast algorithms and game-theory-inspired statistical optimization will provide a powerful tool for NASA's use in planning missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The tool Energid proposes will reduce cost and improve schedule in NASA's lunar and planetary missions through digital testing throughout mission conception and planning.  It will also support automation of robotic systems through real-time randomized optimization during mission execution.  The value provided through these applications will lead to additional work for NASA. Energid will provide support for the new software's application on upcoming missions both as a prime contractor and as a supporting subcontractor to large NASA prime contractors.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		To its commercial customers, Energid licenses its software technology through its Actin toolkit and integrated robotic products.  Actin is delivered as libraries and header files that can be compiled into new software.  This form of Energid's technology has found wide application in software for space, manufacturing, entertainment, agriculture, nuclear energy, and oil exploration.  Energid provides services to support the application of Actin.  The advanced level of simulation-based testing provided by the new software developed during this SBIR project will enhance these commercial activities.  Energid will license the new software and provide services to support it. Energid will additionally provide the software as a supporting tool for tasking its integrated robotic products.

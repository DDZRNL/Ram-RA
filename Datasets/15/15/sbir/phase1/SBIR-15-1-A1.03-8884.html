		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to introduce a unifying physics-based framework for modeling, simulating and digitally controlling the aircraft turboelectric distributed propulsion (TeDP) systems. The proposed modeling is sufficiently flexible and capable of zooming in and out to a different level of granularity necessary to capture the relevant dynamics at both component levels and interfaces.  Particular emphasis is on ensuring fast transiently stable responses to major changes in aircraft system conditions, both nominal and off-nominal. At present such models do not exist, and are essential for designing control for provable performance. This approach promises to overcome today's disconnect between the aircraft dynamics and electric power system dynamics which we view to be the key roadblock to cleaner and efficient power production, delivery and consumption in future aircraft electric power systems. An Aircraft-Dynamic Monitoring and Decision Systems (A-DyMonDS) framework will be introduced and simulated for several candidate aircraft electric power systems architectures. A higher-level coordinating optimization software will be used to coordinate set points of controllers within the electric power system, and embedded nonlinear digital control for power electronics will be proposed to ensure flexible and reliable power provision over the wide range of aircraft operating conditions, both nominal and off-nominal.

		The proposed framework is potentially a game changer for the digital control of energy storage and, more broadly, energy system management in aircraft electric power systems. The objective is to introduce a multi-layered interactive approach to nonlinear power-electronically-switched digital control of AC-DC and DC-AC converters so the desired power is provided in transiently stable ways in response to varying aircraft control requirements. The approach can be further extended to controlling electric power systems for single vehicle and future multi-vehicle manned deep-space missions. Presently much is known about the design and power-electronic control of individual energy system components (loads, batteries, flywheels), but there is very little systems thinking about integrating these different modules to operate in adaptive condition-driven ways to ensure fault tolerance, stability and efficiency. This project will demonstrate a possible approach in Phase I using simulations, while Phase II will use test beds agreed on with the NASA Glenn team.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		These are primarily for terrestrial "smart" grids, micro-grids in particular, and for ultimate new ways of operating electric utility systems in general. The proposed DYMONDS framework provides a paradigm change for future grids since these too require a systematic integration of diverse energy storage and intermittent resources. Notably, in parts of the Texas power grid doubly-fed-induction-generator-controlled wind power plants connected via a weak power-electronically-controlled transmission line has experienced oscillations; adequate digital control is needed to prevent this from happening. Our basic premise is that pursuing similar operating paradigms for complex NASA energy systems may go a long way toward gaining understanding and confidence, and ultimately changing today's operating paradigm. This way the proposed project has the potential for major non-NASA economic regional impact as well.  This is one of the reasons for our excitement to pursue this venture with NASA Glenn.

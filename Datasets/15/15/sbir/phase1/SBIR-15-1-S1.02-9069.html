		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In recent years, Nuvotronics has developed state-of-the art antenna array and SSPA technologies at microwave and mmW frequencies with NASA funding through the SBIR programs and other technology development sources for remote sensing applications. Examples include a broadband aperture for measuring snow water equivalent for the Snow and Cold Land Process (SCLP) mission, and active electronically scanned array modules at W-band for characterization of cloud properties for the Aerosol, Cloud and Ecosystems (ACE) mission. At the core of these innovations is the Nuvotronics' proprietary PolyStrata&#174; additive microfabrication process, which is tailored specifically for meeting modern day needs for highly integrated, low-loss interconnect technologies. The overall program goal is to provide a new set of PolyStrata interconnect solutions for active arrays with applicability from DC through THz. Interconnect solutions will be developed with a clear path forward for inserting the developed technologies into instruments for future NASA missions for which hardware is presently being developed which leverages the PolyStrata technology. Proposed solutions will enable highly integrated, low loss feed networks that integrate microwave passives in a compact package to support the desired capabilities. Robust interconnects with broadband performance and high power handling will be developed to enable high-yield antenna array assemblies with increased functional density. Interconnect solutions for interfacing T/R modules with radiating arrays in both slat-style and panel-style architectures will be explored. An emphasis will be placed on manufacturability as well as thermal characteristics for high-power transmit applications. Designs will be validated with prototype hardware fabricated during Phase I in the PolyStrata process. PolyStrata test articles will be tested at high power levels with a thermocouple for temperature monitoring during RF test.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed interconnect solutions apply to future Earth science remote sensing missions including: cloud and precipitation radar systems for the proposed Aerosols/Clouds/Ecosystems (ACE) mission and the Cloud and Precipitation Processes Mission (CaPPM) for vision beyond GPM; and the Snow and Cold Land Processes (SCLP) mission. This technology also has applications in planetary landing radars such as what is used for the Mars Science Laboratory mission.  Additionally, the CubeSat platform can leverage the size, weight, and performance advantages of the PolyStrata technology.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A wide variety of military and commercial antenna array applications, including: microwave and mmW active electronically scanned radar systems for rotorcraft landing in degraded visual environment (i.e. brown-out conditions); guided missile seekers; non-lethal active denial directive energy systems; unmanned aerial system collision avoidance; and high-bandwidth point-to-point datalink systems.

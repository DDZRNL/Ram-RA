		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address NASA's need for miniature optical isolators in atom interferometry applications, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a miniature optical isolation technology based on magnetic photonic crystals optimized at wavelengths in the visible and NIR range. The proposed optical isolator design is based on enhanced magneto-optical effects in photonic crystals. With the proper lattice parameter and magneto-optical material, high optical transmission and large Faraday rotation can be achieved simultaneously at a target wavelength. A proposed device, occupying <0.1 cc, is expected to achieve high optical transmittance (forward loss <2 dB) and excellent optical isolation (extinction >40 dB); therefore, it is suitable for applications in various compact atom interferometers. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technology in the visible spectral range and provide a Phase II prototype design. In Phase II, the technology will be further optimized and tested in operational environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary NASA applications of the proposed MOI system are in metrology, magnetometry, and inertial navigation. NASA applications inherently require miniaturization of all system components. Frequency stabilized lasers are currently used in atomic clocks. Next-generation magnetometers and inertial navigation sensors also need optical isolation of the laser sources. In any NASA application that requires frequency stabilized lasers, MOI devices can replace bulky optical isolators to reduce the volume by a factor of >100.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Metrology and inertial navigation are important in various military and civilian applications. Laboratory demonstrations already have shown that cold-atom systems are superior to any other technologies for navigation and timing applications. However, the biggest hurdle in transitioning this technology into field-deployable units is quite often the sheer volume and weight of the system. To take full advantage of the extraordinary performance of cold atom systems, miniaturization of individual components is necessary. Other than metrology and navigation, optical isolators also have significant commercial applications in diverse fields, such as optical telecommunication, magneto-optic imaging, and gas sensing.

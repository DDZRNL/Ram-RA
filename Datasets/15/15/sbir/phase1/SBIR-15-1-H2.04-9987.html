		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		GTL proposes a dramatic improvement in launch and space vehicle technology for NASA space and exploration missions.  The modified BHL (mBHL) technology provides significant reductions in weight while exceeding the helium permeability requirements needed to meet NASA long term cryogenic propellant storage requirements.  <BR>The proposed effort builds upon a substantial DARPA investment in BHL cryotank technology for shorter storage duration mission applications and takes the next step, extending the technology to long-term storage cryogenic propellant applications.  The phase I effort conducts trade studies to identify and define the optimum metal laminate coating technology that can be incorporated into a BHL cryotank composite.  <BR>The proposed effort will also evaluate several lightweight multifunctional insulation design concepts synergistic with mBHL technology and identify optimum solutions to be incorporated in the phase II program. With the proposed development of mBHL, the advantages of the technology will be achieved for long term cryogenic propellant storage, providing the means to significantly lower cryotank mass, reduce permeability and provide a significant improvement in propellant tank insulation performance reducing propellant boil off, thereby enhancing NASA's ability to achieve its exploration and science mission goals for less cost.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The successful development and test of the mBHL composite tank system would provide significant weight and cost savings for cryogenic propellant tank applications. The mBHL technology offers a four times weight improvement over metal isogrid cryotanks. When fully qualified for use in long-term cryopropellant storage requirements, mBHL technology could be used for space propellant storage tanks, Mars missions and space/launch vehicles.  The mBHL could be applied directly to all NASA launch vehicle initiatives including the Space Launch System development and commercial space transportation initiatives. Including the commercial cargo and crew program and space exploration programs.  NASA would reap significant benefits from supporting the implementation and commercialization of the mBHL technology into the commercial US launch vehicles industry. Including systems built by Lockheed, Boeing, Orbital Sciences and Space-X.  Incorporating mBHL into NASA space vehicle systems would achieve significant performance and cost advantages that support NASA exploration requirements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA commercial applications for the mBHL composite technology includes both storable and cryogenic spacecraft propellant and pressurant tanks, including commercial and DoD vehicles and applications.  The mBHL technology provides a dramatic weight reduction over existing metal isogrid cryotanks resulting in a significant performance and cost advantage. The mBHL could provide significant advantages to Atlas, Delta, Falcon, Virgin Galactic and Stratolaunch launch vehicles.  DOD applications include pressurant, storable and cryogenic propellant tanks for planned spacecraft systems. <BR>The Army, Navy and Air Force could apply these technologies to enhance the US tactical and strategic weapon systems capabilities and performance.  The DOD has a significant need to extend the stand off distance and reach of weapon systems aka tomahawk, boost glide vehicle and future hypersonic missiles.  These commercialization applications represent the largest potential market for the mBHL technology.

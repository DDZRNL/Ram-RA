		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		According to the decadal report titled, Life and Physical Sciences Research for a New Era of Space Exploration, a Report, "&#133;the AHB Panel would be remiss if it did not strongly recommend an animal centrifuge capable of accommodating rats/mice at variable gravity levels."  In response, Techshot proposes to develop a Rodent Centrifuge Facility (RCF) that utilizes eight EXPRESS Rack locker locations.  Requiring only minor assembly on orbit, the large Techshot rodent centrifuge will consist of two separate four-locker pieces called quad housing units. The centrifuge rotor will accommodate as many as 14 modular rodent cages, which can be customized to accommodate either grouped (28 rats- 200 gram animals, 42 mice- 25 gram animals) or 14 individually-housed rats (up to 400 gram) or mice.  Each cage will include ad libitum feeding, automated ad libitum water, LED day/night cycling, forced-air waste collection and environmental control, and continuous video monitoring. Animal access will be accomplished by the removal of individual cages, which will fit into a portable glovebox that can be installed on the front of the rodent centrifuge facility or at the ISS Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG).  The facility will be designed for a minimum of 30 days of unattended operation, and the accommodation of experiments lasting up to 90 days.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Rodent Centrifuge Facility (RCF) offers the largest diameter centrifuge research tool flown on ISS.  The RCF is a very unique instrument capable of novel life and microgravity science research. Therefore, Techshot's initial targeted application of the proposed innovation is an offering of both the equipment and services associated with flight hardware and integration activities, which are highly desired by NASA-funded scientists as well as other governmental agencies. Techshot is uniquely qualified to provide these space flight services, just as the company has done for numerous PI's on a variety of flight experiments for the past 25 years. Techshot is currently preparing to support future ISS experiments for NASA-funded PI's utilizing the Bone Densitometer flight hardware that Techshot developed and integrated in 2013-14, just as we did for two NASA-funded (i.e. NRA) scientists during the initial experiments on our Avian Development Facility (ADF), which was a key payload of the Space Station Biological Research Project.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Techshot sees tremendous potential commercial applications for the Rodent Centrifuge Facility (RCF) in biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies where life science research holds promise for cell replacement therapies for bioregenerative diseases.  Techshot already has been in talks with U.S. biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies regarding long-term rodent research aboard the ISS.  Furthermore, the company has begun to establish international connections with commercial entities, where strong interest has been expressed in buying microgravity research tools and opportunities.  Just as exciting, Techshot expects to commercialize the RCF by incorporating it into the company's spaceflight services program it offers to other Government agencies like NIH, NSF, and DoD.  In combination with the long list of other proven flight hardware developed by Techshot, the facility is expected to greatly expand the company's range of services. More importantly, its unique large radius centrifuge capability should further enhance Techshot's competitive position.

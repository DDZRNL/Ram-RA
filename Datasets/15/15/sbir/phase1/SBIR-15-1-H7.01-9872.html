		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Typical existing infrared (IR) focal plane arrays (FPAs) have high spatial resolution over large areas due to their high pixel counts, however they can only continuously operate at frame rates below 50 kfps.  Such FPAs could be redesigned to achieve MHz frame rates by redesigning the read-out integrated circuit (ROIC) and reducing the format.  By reducing the pixel count and increasing the pixel size, and by increasing the degree of parallel access to pixels, a high speed data link can be established for every pixel, allowing continuous operation at frame rates up to 1 MHz.  A proof of concept architecture in the LWIR band has been demonstrated with off-chip room temperature read out electronics of 8x8 format.  In this proposed effort, we will improve upon this design by demonstrating it for a larger format and a different IR band, and by increasing the signal to noise in the read-out electronics.  In pursuing this path, we expect to establish in a Phase II effort a foundation for redesigning the traditional IR FPA, focusing on the ROIC.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase I effort is focused on existing NASA test facilities related to re-entry vehicle testing, ballistics imaging, and hypervelocity imaging, which run experiments with knowledge to be gained at microsecond timescales through temperature mapping and trace gas species sensing in the short medium and long wavelength infrared (SWIR, MWIR and LWIR) bands.  For example MHz shock front thermal emission, and trace gas sensing of ablation could be application topics for the proposed effort.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA applications can also apply to non-NASA topics such as imaging of hypersonic ballistics in test environments, temperature mapping hypersonic craft, and active imaging of trace gas species.  In addition the proposed work may benefit infrared laser range finding and velocimetry systems by enabling them to collect series of frames with microsecond precision with no on-chip memory maximum.

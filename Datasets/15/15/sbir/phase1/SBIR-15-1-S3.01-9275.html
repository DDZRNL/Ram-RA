		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In the proposed effort, MicroLink Devices develop an ultra-lightweight, high-efficiency, GaAs-based, multi-junction solar cell that will be suitable for use in future platforms requiring very high specific power (>2.0 kW/kg) and very high areal power density (>370 W/m2) such as power generation and conversion for robotic science mission applications, and in particular solar electric propulsion (SEP). In addition to drastically reduced mass the highly flexible nature of our ELO solar cells would allow for novel compact lightweight array designs that take full advantage of the unique properties of ELO solar cells.  We will achieve this result by reducing the metal content of MicroLink's current inverted metamorphic (IMM), epitaxial lift-off (ELO) solar cell and replacing the metal with robust, low-density, space qualified Kapton&#174; that will retain the flexibility and durability of ELO solar cell at a fraction of its present weight.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential commercial applications for NASA include satellite applications requiring low weight with high specific power requirements such as small satellites and CUBESATs.  Additionally, SEP space craft could benefit in several areas, reduced solar cell mass could result in lighter weight solar arrays leaving valuable mass for scientific instrumentation and added fuel.  Further, light weight atmospheric aircraft or other HALE type applications would greatly benefit from reduced power production masses.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		These ultra-lightweight high-efficiency flexible solar cells additionally have great potential for non-NASA commercial type applications such as UAVs used for surveillance, security monitoring, and HALE applications where high specific powers are necessary for long endurance missions.

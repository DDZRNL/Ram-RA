		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Abstract<BR>Deep space radiations pose a major threat to the astronauts and their space craft during the long duration space exploration expeditions [1]. Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibers apart from possessing radiation shielding properties by the virtue of the high hydrogen content are known for extraordinary properties. To prevent the deleterious effects of secondary neutrons, targets such as Gadolinium are required.<BR><BR>The objective of the proposed research is to develop Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) Fiber Epoxy Composite Hybridized with Nanoparticles of Gadolinium for Radiation Shielding Application.<BR>Experience gained in the proposed study could be used to design light weight radiation shielding structures for aerospace application.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		One of the commercialization strategy that will be adopted would involve licensing the technology that will be developed to produce Epoxy/UHMWPE Composites Hybridized with Gadolinium Nanoparticles.<BR><BR>Alternatively, spinoff of AmChemteq Inc. will be established with the sole objective of perfecting the production of Epoxy/UHMWPE Composites Hybridized with Gadolinium Nanoparticles for domestic and international market. State of Pennsylvania will match every dollar invested in the spinoff company to encourage the job creation in the state.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The nanoparticles with high neutron adsorptions are not readily available in the market, therefore the proposed research entitled "Epoxy/UHMWPE Composites Hybridized with Gadolinium Nanoparticles for Application in Space Exploration Vehicles" will not only provide means to produce light weight radiation shielding materials but also offer technique to process nanoparticles with high neutron adsorptions in a cost effective manner.<BR><BR>The Epoxy/UHMWPE Composites Hybridized with Gadolinium Nanoparticles will not only be very handy during a nuclear but also used by workers who are routinely exposed to nuclear radiations at their work place.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR Phase I effort will demonstrate and scale up an innovative manufacturing process that yields aerospace grade shape memory alloy (SMA) solids and periodic cellular structures.  Bulk-sized SMA components and structures are extremely difficult to fabricate as castings due to the compositional sensitivity of these alloys.  Remelting also leads to brittleness from the presence of deleterious phases and precipitates that form upon metal solidification.  For cost effectiveness, structural integrity, and shape memory and/or superelastic behavior, SMA castings with the requisite composition-microstructure-properties are needed and will be developed in this work.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA commercial applications include aeroengine and airframe structural components, particularly those requiring aeroelastic behavior, light weight, acoustic dampening, and impact resistance.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA commercial applications include armor applications, automotive and land vehicle components and structures, shipboard structures, sporting goods, biomedical implants, and building structures. Essentially, a practically limitless list of potential applications could be made if large-sized structure with the requisite aeroelastic properties can be manufactured affordably.

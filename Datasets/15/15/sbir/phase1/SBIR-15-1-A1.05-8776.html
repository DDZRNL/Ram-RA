		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Research in Flight is proposing to develop a fundamentally new, lower order, high fidelity solution approach for the aerodynamic analysis required for engine integration studies.  This new approach is based on a new tool known as Flightstream.  Flightstream is a surface vorticity based solver which uses an unstructured surface geometry, and a correlation for skin friction which is based on the surface vorticity.  For lift and induced drag calculations, Fligthstream makes use of the Kutta Joukowski Theorem.  The Kutta Joukowski Theorem has proven to be a remarkably accurate method for calculating loads for essentially all lifting configurations in which the flow is attached to the surface.  Research in Flight has demonstrated many compelling capabilities of Flightstream to accurately predict the aerodynamic loads on a range of geometries including high lift configurations.  This fundamentally new approach to aircraft outer mold line evaluation offers the speed and fidelity required for even optimization based design.  The speed of Flightstream is comparable to traditional panel approaches yet the fidelity in calculating loads has been shown to be comparable to high fidelity CFD solutions.  To further compliment the utility of FLightstream as a compelling design tool, Flightstream has been configured to operate seamlessly with NASA's Vehicle Sketch Pad (VSP) software.  The primary function of the proposed activity will be to develop an automated approach to engine integration by coupling the compelling capabilities of Flightstream with optimization tools, rudimentary engine performance tools, and automated grid generation using VSP.  The goals for the optimization will be related to aerodynamic performance and will include lift to drag and moment calculations in consultation with the technical point of contact at NASA. A report on the progress during Phase I will outline the process and will include preliminary results.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Research in Flight has been working with NASA Langley to demonstrate the capability of Flightstream as a design tool for subsonic aircraft.  Fligthstream has been used to predict the high lift performance of the D8.5 geometry.  The clean configuration of this geometry was tested at NASA Langley in wind tunnels.  Both the clean configuration and the high lift configuration were analyzed by Research in Flight using Flightstream. This included the validation of Flightstream for similar geometries using the High Lift Prediction Workshop data for the DLR wind tunnel model.  The fidelity of the solution for this data set was remarkable and demonstrated the baseline applicability of Flightstream to complex subsonic aircraft configurations.  NASA Langley is now using Flightstream internally with confidence for geometries similar to the DLR including compressible flight regimes.  The proposed activity will substantially enhance NASA's ability to robustly analyze and design a range of subsonic aircraft outer mold lines to include engine integration directly in the design process.  This capability will substantially improve the speed and fidelity of the preliminary design process at NASA.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The traditional approach to aircraft design involves the development of a concept, initial analysis of the concept using lower order tools which include for example vortex lattice or panel approaches for aerodynamics.  The fidelity of these tools is not always at a level which is sufficient to direct a trade study toward optimal configurations.  Nevertheless, the results of these lower order studies are generally used to direct geometry development and higher order solutions are developed using Euler codes and Navier Stokes solvers.  These higher fidelity solutions offer much more than just loads to the designer but often the higher fidelity solutions reveal inadequacies in the load calculations and some redesign work is initiated.  To streamline this process, a tool is needed which can provide high fidelity load calculations at the speed of the lower fidelity tools.  Flightstream offers this capability but does not yet have the capability to automatically optimize and engine integration into candidate designs.  This proposed activity would provide this capability, working seamlessly with NASA's Vehicle Sketch Pad (VSP) to dramatically improve the efficiency of the commercial aircraft design process and offering, on average, better final designs.

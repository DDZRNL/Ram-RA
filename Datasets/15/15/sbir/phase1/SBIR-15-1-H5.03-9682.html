		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The goal of this Phase I SBIR program is to demonstrate the use of Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM) solid state metal 3D printing to manufacture multifunctional structural components with embedded sensors such as strain gauges, break wires, and thermocouples. Specifically, this Phase I SBIR effort will demonstrate technical feasibility and test proof of concept for:<BR><BR>**  3D printing structural aluminum components with embedded thermocouples;<BR>**  3D printing structural aluminum components with embedded strain gauges for structural health monitoring;<BR>**  3D printing structural aluminum components with grids of break wires for damage sensing and tracking.<BR><BR>Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing has potential to uniquely advance technology readiness levels of multifunctional materials for structural components with embedded capability for sensing strain, damage initiation and propagation, and temperature. By combining two functions (structure/sensing) it will be shown that a lighter weight, higher performance solution can be built in a shorter time period.<BR><BR>Successful proof of concept of these innovations and elevation of one specific application to TRL 5 will be accomplished in Phase I. With NASA guidance, the project team Phase II plan is to select and develop functional prototype structures with the Phase I results that best increase mission capability with decreased mass. A demonstration unit will be delivered to NASA for testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.

		<BR>
		The project team intends to develop Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM) manufacturing processes to create multifunctional structures that increase mission capability with decreased mass. UAM has a number of important benefits in the direct manufacture of launch vehicle and space structure parts, specifically:<BR><BR>1.  The solid state nature of the UAM bond allows embedding of all manner of wires, fibers and sensors into a solid metal part. Since the metals do not have to be heated for bonding, electronics can be embedded without damage.<BR>2.  3D printing, by its nature, enables design and manufacturing flexibility. Single sensors can be added to an existing component for measuring surface effects. Additionally, full components can be 3D printed with embedded sensors allowing for complex sensor networks through an entire structure.<BR>3.  The UAM process occurs within a large (2 meters x 2 meters x 1 meter) part envelope appropriate for space structures. The technology has been adapted as an end effector of large industrial robots for even larger/complex geometries.<BR>4.  High deposition rate several orders of magnitude greater than traditional metal additive systems such as laser based additive systems results in rapid fabrication;<BR>5.  UAM machines are hybrid systems including both an additive weld head as well as a subtractive Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) mill so that parts come out to print with no post-processing required;

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The initial application of high performance UAM-enabled structures will likely be in NASA, defense and commercial space structure programs, in that order. This estimate recognizes the high performance technology leading nature of the organizations and their missions. The project team already services aerospace customers. Agreements with these customers uniformly prohibit publication of the details of our work with them.

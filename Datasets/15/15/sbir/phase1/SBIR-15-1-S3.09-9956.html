		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Every CubeSat design is different with different requirements.  However the number of similarities between CubeSat designs is greater than between any two larger spacecraft. Leveraging these similarities and by applying a modular design approach we can develop a small family of motherboards that can fulfill the needs of any CubeSat mission.  The computing elements of a 1-3U motherboard and a 6U motherboard are the same.  The differences between these CubeSat bus architectures exist outside the computing element.  Thus, we can move the computing elements off of the motherboard and into a self-contained Compute Module (CM).  The CM contains all the elements needed for a self-contained computer.  The CM is attached to an Application Specific Daughter Card (ASDC).  Together the CM and ASDC provide the capabilities needed for a specific task.  This standard module will consist of a physical form factor, electrical connections and design specifications for the ASDC.  The initial Compute Module (CM) design specifications will utilize SST' modified ARM&#174; Cortex&#174;-M0 microcontroller, motherboard for the 1-3U and a 6U CubeSat bus configuration.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		As the CubeSat markets and their applications increase the need for similar components will continue to increase to keep these projects affordable. This proposal leverages the similarities in most CubeSats by applying a modular approach to the spacecraft main electronics, the motherboard. By designing this Compute Module (CM) approach NASA can fulfill the needs of any CubeSat mission.  The real power of this modular design concept is in giving the engineer as many design options as possible with a single development environment.  By providing a CM that is self-contained and has a standard interface, the engineer can add a radiation hardened, secure, and robust computation element to any subsystem or payload.  This modular approach shall significantly reduce development time and increase reliability.  Future deep space missions such as NASA's SIMPLEx or Biosentinal will not be capable without radiation hardened electronics such as these.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		SST's extreme environment technology and products are suitable for most space and mil-aero applications owing to the generic, unmet need for simultaneously hardened components to radiation and temperature without onerous SWaP penalties or trade-offs.  These circuits have been demonstrated to be radiation tolerant well over 1 Mrad and function at temperatures up to 250?C for over 1250 hours with no change in leakage or operating currents.  Integrating this technology into the Compute Module and Application Speciffic Daughter Card (ASDC) provides for a variety of commercial application such as, high energy scientific applications, nuclear disaster recovery electronics, high energy medical imaging equipment; medical device sterilization, aircraft engine control systems, oil and gas exploration, power grid, automotive, rail & trucking-related industries, chemical, petroleum, and other high temperature processing applications.

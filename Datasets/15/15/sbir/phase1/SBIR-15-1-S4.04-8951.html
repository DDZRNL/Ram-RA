		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		FastCAP proposes a novel solid state ultracapacitor ("ultracap") capable of reliable operation from 0&deg;C to 300&deg;C, with survival at a temperature range of -55&deg;C to 350&deg;C. When complete, the device will exceed FastCAP's current world record as the highest temperature ultracap in the world. The proposed ultracap will enable significant strides forward in design paradigms utilized in deep space high temperature environments&#150; enabling reduction in the weight, volume and complexity of energy storage systems, while relaxing design constraints on scarce candidate high temperature battery technologies. Importantly, the device will not exhibit the typical volatility and toxicity associated with traditional electrolytes present in current aerospace battery technologies. <BR><BR>During Phase I, we will demonstrate an ultracap comprising a high temperature ionic liquid-doped polymer electrolyte paired with binder-free carbon nanotube electrodes capable of operating at 0&deg;C-300&deg;C. At the end of Phase II, this device will exhibit a high power density (1kW/kg and 1.4kW/L), 10-15X the power density of Sodium Sulfur batteries, and a high energy density (0.7Wh/kg and 1Wh/L), 10,000X higher than ceramic capacitors. The prototype will have a cycle life of more than 1,000,000 cycles at room temperature and below, and more than 100,000 cycles at 300&deg;C. We will leverage our experience in the development of extreme environment ultracaps for oil & gas industry applications to engineer a device able to withstand high shock (up to a 1000Gpeak) and vibration (up to 60Grms) conditions, as well as high pressure differentials (up to 100atm).

		<BR>
		FastCAP has identified a variety of applications where this disruptive technology will have a significant impact in energy storage weight/volume reduction, complexity reduction and life extension. They include: Energy Storage for deep space exploration missions with extreme temperature requirements (i.e. Venus Missions, Sun Missions, Lunar Quest Missions), Electric Propulsion Systems; GPS/Guidance; Deep Space Transponders and Radars; Satellites; Cube-Sats; Payload Operations; Exploration Vehicles (landers, rovers); Pyro Initiators for the stage separation of the rockets; Flight Termination Systems (FTS); Emergency Detection Systems (EDS); Peak Power harvesters from power sources such as PVs.<BR><BR>In addition, there are specific applications suggested by FastCAP's aerospace industry partners for the proposed technology: Power optimization for Launch Vehicle (LV) applications for pyro initiators; Hydraulics power augmentation for the Next Generation Launch System (NGLS) program; Power optimization for Integrated Vehicle Fluids (IVF) system for the Common Upper Stage program; Power optimization for Lite and Heavy Electric Propulsion Upper Stages utilizing Hall Effect Thrusters to enable heavy USG spacecraft to GSO and NASA Interplanetary Missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		FastCAP is currently developing a breakthrough geothermal drilling tool under an EERE Geothermal Technologies Program grant, incorporating its world record breaking 250?C ultracap technology. This system is the first of its kind in the world, and is expected to enable directional drilling techniques in geothermal wells rated 250?C or less. This is a significant first step in enabling this vast energy resource, but a new generation of higher temperature tools, including higher temperature energy storage will be needed to develop the most economically viable geothermal wells, many which exceed the 250?C mark. The technology developed under this proposal will be directly applicable to FastCAP's work in enabling geothermal energy drilling and production.<BR><BR>In addition to geothermal energy applications, the proposed technology will be broadly applicable in a large variety of high temperature defense applications (i.e. missile and fire control systems), consumer electronics and vehicles applications, commercial avionics applications and Uninterruptable Power Supplies (UPS).

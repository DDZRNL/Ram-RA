		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Fibertek proposes to design, develop, and test a spaceflight prototype 2051 nm thulium (Tm)-doped fiber amplifier (TDFA) optical master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) suitable for NASA spaceflight and long duration unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) missions. The proposed spaceflight TDFA MOPA technology is new, higher efficiency, and not available from any other known source. The amplifer provides high-power, high-performance, and high-reliability continuous wave (CW) operation at 2.051 ?m.<BR>NASA and the 2007 National Research Council (NRC) Earth Science Decadal Study1 have identified carbon dioxide (CO2) light detection and ranging (lidar) as a key technology needed to address global change research. The study identifies 2 ?m laser technology as critical to CO2 studies as well as for measuring three dimensional (3D) tropospheric winds.<BR> <BR>The proposed TDFA technology also supports lidar technology needed to fill Strategic Knowledge Gaps (SKG) for Mars science, aerocapture and planetrary science sensors.

		Carbon Dioxide Lidar<BR>This SBIR matures thulium fiber MOPA technology for NASA Space based  measurements of carbon dioxide using methods developed for NASA ASCENDS program. Lidar offers the vertical resolution and can make measurements in daytime and nighttime conditions to complement passive optical spectroscopic measurement being made by the NASA OCO mission.<BR>??	<BR>The Thulium MOPA amplifier can also operate on water vapor lines for IPDA lidar for Earth, Mars and Planetary bodies. Strong water vapor lines exist in the same general 2050-2070 nm region for earth science lidar and can all be reached with this TDFA approach where the absorption lines are strong and isolated from other species and the spectroscopy is well characterized with acceptable thermal broadening. For planetary or asteroid-type missions, where very low or trace concentrations of various species are expected, the TDFA can reach the 1.8-2.1 ?m range where very strong absorption lines are available.<BR><BR>The 2um thulium amplifier also supports lidar technology that can measure Mars atmospheric density, winds needed to understand the planets evolution and data needed for EDL aero capture landing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The core technology developed as part of this SBIR can address a large market for eye-safe lasers and lidars particularly with Fibertek's DoD customers. There are no ubiquitous laser transmitters at 1.5 ?m that are comparable to an Nd laser at 1.06 ?m. This SBIR offers an opportunity to change that. Applications for eye-safe long-distance free-space lasers include coherent lidar for wind or hard-target velocity detection, range resolved target or atmospheric detection using a chirped pulse seed laser and receiver; infrared countermeasures (IRCM) DoD market; coherent imaging; and frequency conversion into the 3.3 ?m range for methane and numerous other trace gasses such as CO and other carbon compounds in the 3-5 ?m region.

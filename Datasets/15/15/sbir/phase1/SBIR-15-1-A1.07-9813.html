		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		CFDRC proposes to develop, validate, and demonstrate a variable-fidelity multi-physics framework for AeroPropulsoServoElastic (APSE) simulations of supersonic vehicles. The proposed effort will leverage previously developed AeroServoThermoElastic (ASTE) framework that will be advanced with newly developed non-intrusive efficient software integration methodology, and extended with the addition of an aircraft engine propulsion module to create an APSE analysis tool for next generation supersonic vehicles simulations. The developed framework will be verified against benchmark cases for accuracy and efficiency. Demonstration of the full capabilities of the technology will be conducted for a representative supersonic transport configuration in a supersonic flow environment. In Phase II, the capability of the framework will be extended by integrating additional NASA and industry preferred computational tools (both high fidelity and reduced order) to the framework. The usability of the framework will be improved by supporting NASA preferred input/output data formats, adding non-linear material models, support for NASA's open Multidisciplinary Design Analysis and Optimization (openMDAO) scripts and further improving the accuracy of the fluid and structure coupling. Validation and demonstration of the framework will be conducted on selected APSE problems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology will provide an accurate and comprehensive analysis tool for coupled AeroPropulsoServoElastic (APSE) simulations of supersonic vehicles especially for the next generation and beyond (N+2) supersonic transport aircraft. The APSE tool will help in the design of supersonic aircraft that are safer, have better ride quality, and easier to fly. It will enable NASA to analyze interaction characteristics of fluid, structural, thermal, propulsive and controls fields of aerospace vehicles. NASA direct applications include supersonic vehicles, hypersonic re-entry vehicles, inflatable aerodynamic decelerators, hypersonic aircraft and spacecraft (X-51), NASA's Orion crew exploration vehicle, the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) vehicle, and many others. Ultimately, the framework will lead to improved performance and safety of aerospace vehicles and significantly reduce the dependence on flight tests and wind tunnel testing thereby reducing the time required to certify new NASA, military and commercial aircraft and spacecraft.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA potential customers and applications include DoD agencies such as U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, DARPA, U.S. Army and Missile Defense agencies and contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing for application involving development of flexible supersonic manned and unmanned air vehicles as well as global strike hypersonic vehicles. Other commercial applications include general multi-disciplinary analysis problems such as heat exchanger vibration, panel flutter of aerospace vehicles, turbo-machinery blade vibrations and many others.

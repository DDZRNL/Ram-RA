		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		SynaptiCAD proposes to adapt a commercial digital design simulator for use by complex NASA space systems and missions. The simulator is based on SystemVerilog, an IEEE-standard language with a long pedigree in the electronics world. Digital simulators offer the potential to scale to very large systems since they are already being used to model circuits with millions of events. SystemVerilog, additionally, can easily connect with continuous simulation and engineering analysis tools. Conventional commercial simulators lack this scalability. SynaptiCAD will demonstrate how its own implementation of SystemVerilog, encapsulated in a product known as Verilogger Extreme, can be generalized by creating appropriate APIs and model libraries for satellite, robotics, and science mission simulation. SynaptiCAD will further demonstrate that the simulator can connect readily to other engineering environments such as Python and Phoenix Integration's ModelCenter. A synthesis step will also be illustrated at a basic level, where a hardware design is derived from the resulting simulation. Synthesis is common in the electronics industry and carried out at a highly sophisticated level. A path toward evolving this initially rudimentary synthesis capability will be laid out. The new proposed simulator will demonstrate a realistic NASA problem and show how it can be applied to the full design lifecycle, involving multi-fidelity and multi-disciplinary models. The new simulator will eventually allow for a "digital twin" of a flying spacecraft that can be used for realistic validation both during the design and after launch.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A major benefit of the proposed simulator is that it can be applied throughout the design process for complex projects across NASA Science, Human Exploration and Operation, and Aeronautics Research Mission Directorates. The proposed technology will provide for realistic simulation, integration with common engineering tools, management decision support, verification and validation, and the use of standardized engineering model libraries. Initial applications will be in the science mission area dealing with advanced telescope systems, satellites, or robotic exploration. Additional applications will be pursued within NASA directorates as case studies and models are developed. In particular, since this work will require a partnership with Phoenix Integration, NASA locations that use ModelCenter would be natural candidates for further commercialization. JPL, for instance, has heavily invested in both ModelCenter and MBSE technology and is thus a strong candidate for the proposed simulation technology. NASA's Fundamental Aeronautics program has been a strong user of ModelCenter and would also benefit from the development work advocated here.  In general, satellite programs, space transportation, and air vehicle technologies can benefit from this technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Beyond NASA, SynaptiCAD's commercialization efforts will be focused primarily on the aerospace and defense sector where companies such as Lockheed Martin are already using both SynaptiCAD's digital design simulator and Phoenix Integration's ModelCenter product. SynaptiCAD is well positioned to introduce this technology to leading organizations in this business sector such as BAE, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Pratt and Whitney, and Raytheon since they already utilize both company's products. By leveraging this existing installed base, it will be possible to quickly achieve initial sales and establish a core user base for the new technology. After establishing penetration in aerospace and defense, SynaptiCAD will build upon these successes to pursue secondary markets such as automotive, heavy equipment, green energy, shipbuilding, transportation, and process industries. Some of these industries are also already users of SynaptiCAD's products. Interest in more realistic simulation technology has been robust and bodes well for future development.

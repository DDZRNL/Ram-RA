		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has a need for electronics that can support proposed flagship missions such as a Venus surface lander.  Devices that can operate at temperatures of up to 500?C are desired.  Ozark IC and its partner, the University of Arkansas, have created the world's largest known library of CMOS silicon-carbide (SiC) analog and mixed-signal circuits, intellectual property (IP) and packages that can operate at very high temperatures. The key next component is a general-purpose SiC microcontroller to provide real-time  programmability for these SiC support circuits.<BR><BR>This Phase I proposal will use the extensive Ozark IC SiC library to develop a self-contained general-purpose SiC-CMOS microcontroller.  When combined with data converters, gate drivers and other analog/mixed-signal circuitry, this microcontroller could serve in any number of high-temperature sample acquirement and analysis instruments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has demonstrated a resolve for a flagship mission in the coming years to revisit Venus, and land instruments on the surface. Venus has a corrosive, high-pressure (~100 bar), high-temperature (up to 500?C) environment.  <BR>NASA experts have stated that the single greatest challenge to providing devices operable at the Venusian surface is the availability of high-temperature digital, analog and mixed-signal electronics. <BR><BR>The SiC integrated circuit technology that Ozark IC is actively commercializing could easily meet NASA targets of 5-10 hours at 500?C with proper packaging.  <BR>By demonstrating the feasibility of a SiC microcontroller, this proposal represents a major step in creating a general-purpose SiC-based chipset that will support a majority of functions required by a Venus lander
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Other non-NASA applications are relatively obvious &#150; they include any market that needs a programmable (radiation-hardened) microcontroller that will operate over a wide temperature range. These markets include, but are not limited to, Military Aerospace, Military/Non-Military Space Applications, Commercial Aviation and Oil Exploration, among others.<BR><BR>Ozark IC is continually being contacted by companies in these areas asking for these types of components that will operate over wide temperature ranges.

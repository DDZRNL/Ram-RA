		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Design of an advanced 3D LIDAR Receiver is proposed which enables low SWaP LIDAR systems with significantly increased numbers of detectors allowing 3D imagery to be obtained over large areas,  with high resolution (cm),  high sensitivity (near single photon counting capability),  high dynamic range ( 10^5) and high sample rates (GHz) when operated with high pulse rate fiber lasers.  These characteristics enable accurate robotic operations under conditions of uncertainty.  Operating in SWIR will permit LIDAR operation without inducing noise effects in Vis/VNIR passive sensors which may be operating simultaneously and near the LIDAR.  The technical approach will support a wide ,UV to MWIR,  spectrum of operating wavelengths by change out of photocathode and optimization of the subsequent amplification and readout parameters.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed LIDAR is directly applicable to deep space missions that involve planetary, asteroid, or comet autonomous landings and missions that involve operations near small extraterrestrial bodies.  In addition to these primary mission candidates, the LIDAR technology can be exploited to aid operations of Unmanned Air Vehicles in the National Air Space and for precision wide area 3D mapping missions that can exploit the high resolutions and high sensitivities provided by the technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The principal attribute of the proposed LIDAR system is its significantly increased area search rate capability while simultaneously achieving very high resolution and very high sensitivity.  Military, Civil, and Commercial interests can directly be served by exploiting this to improve surveillance and protection of critical infrastructure.  Extension of video surveillance to 3D with associated enhanced analytics can improve probabilities of detection and correct activity interpretation thus enhancing critical security.   Further the SWIR LIDAR is fully eye safe and can be safely operating any areas with people present.  The 3D SWIR LIDAR, unlike most current video surveillance cameras, will provide 24/7 operations and because of the wavelength provides operations in degraded visual environments as well.  This technology opens a major market and a major transition opportunity.

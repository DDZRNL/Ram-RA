		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA requires advanced power electronic and energy storage devices that can work at various temperature (-100 degree Celsius to 400 degree Celsius) and high operating voltage with high energy and power density where traditional power and energy storage device cannot be applied.  The current state-of-the-art of the capacitor suffers from temperature reliability, especially at high temperature, as well as low-energy density, making them bulky and costly.  Power systems for NASA mission must be operated efficiently at high temperatures to eliminate the need for on board cooling systems. The high performance capacitor (temperature reliability and high energy density) will save space, reduce weight, and improve reliability.  The proposed Phase I SBIR program will demonstrate Powdermet Inc's ability to produce an advanced nanocomposite capacitor can be applied in harsh and extreme environment as required by NASA aerospace exploration.  This novel capacitor will feature as wide operating temperature (-100 degree Celsius to 400 degree Celsius), high operating voltage (>kilovolt) and high-energy density (>4 J/cc) and high powder density (>MW/cc) as well as operating in radiation environment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This advanced nanocomposite capacitors can be widely used in advanced power electronic and energy storage devices required by NASA for aerospace exploration, such as Titan missions, Lunar Quest, Advance aeronautic equipment and so on. The proposed nanocomposite capacitors can work at various operating temperature and high voltage with high energy and power density where tradition power and energy storage device cannot be applied in.  The high energy density capacitor will also make miniaturization of NASA power management systems and make the launch more efficiency.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed novel nanocomposite capacitor can be directly benefit for future advanced pulsed-power electronic devices and electric power systems, such as lasers, radar, pacemakers, electromagnetic armors, defibrillators and high power microwaves. Capacitors are also finding uses in the renewable energy generation market or in alternative energy sources, such as hybrid and plug-in electrical vehicles as well as solar system.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) proposes to develop an advanced ocular imaging platform for comprehensive examination of the eye posterior segment (retina/choroid) based on non-invasive multimodal optical imaging techniques including Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and PSI's proprietary confocal line-scanning ophthalmoscopy (LSO). Software control of scan patterns and data processing and display/segmentation algorithms will accommodate a variety of novel approaches within a single optical platform, and enhance diagnostic capabilities to standard OCT and LSO-based techniques. In addition to structural information such as retina and choroid thickness maps and volume, quantitative and scalable tools for wide dynamic range blood flow metrics will be designed in Phase I and demonstrated in human volunteers and animal models in Phase II.<BR>Examining the retina and the choroid from a bulk perspective could provide important insights for elucidating short and long term effects of microgravity and fluid shifts specific to long duration space flights. Degenerative diseases of the eye often have either hemodynamic consequences or causes, though many mechanisms remain unknown. Microgravity-induced ocular functional and structural alterations have been experienced by several astronauts involved in long-duration space travels. Consequently, there is a clear need for advanced imaging modalities to monitor these effects. Improved blood flow imaging diagnostics will aid the detection and management of many eye conditions, and foster research on retinal function.<BR>The team assembled at PSI for the proposed research has extensive experience in developing ophthalmic instrumentation based on OCT and line-scanning techniques. Our skills cover all aspects of OCT imaging, image segmentation, layer thickness maps, visualization of retinal and choroidal vasculature, Doppler OCT, large-area line-scanning retinal imaging and Doppler flowmetry.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The auto-regulation of blood flow and fluid transport in the eye is exquisitely sensitive to many neurovascular and metabolic signaling systems. Though the effects of glucose, oxygen, and carbon dioxide (fuel, oxidizer, and waste) are the most commonly studied, there is also evidence that the fluid shifts and intraocular /intracranial pressures changes observed or inferred in the microgravity environment likewise produce responses with potential long-term consequences for ocular health. An advanced multimodal diagnostic imaging platform which can accurately track multiple anatomical and physiological changes in the eye over time is therefore fundamental to understanding and mitigating these effects. Such a flexible device may offer significant advantages to NASA research facilities which would otherwise need to adapt multiple single-purpose commercial clinical devices to NASA applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		PSI has a long and successful history in developing advanced ophthalmic imaging instrumentation. The main objective of the proposed research is development of multimodal platform that can non-invasively and non-mydriatically characterize the posterior segment of the eye both structurally (thickness maps and volume of retina and choroid) and hemodynamically (blood flow in the retina and choroid). A novel imaging system combining Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) with PSI's proprietary Line-scanning Doppler Flowmetry (LSDF) near 1050nm will provide 3D structural information and local flow parameters while semi-quantitative LSDF flow visualizations will aid in characterizing global blood flow patterns. Such a unique platform capable of generating structural and functional maps of the eye will have immediate clinical applications for a broad range of eye diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma age-related, macular degeneration, and other conditions.

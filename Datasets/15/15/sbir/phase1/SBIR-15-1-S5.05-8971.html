		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Odyssey proposes a new fault management planning and design tool and methodology that uses state-based simulations with programmable dynamic state definitions to provide early assessments of fault management system scope and cost.  The tool will utilize models developed in SysML to capture system characteristics and relationships between system components as well as mapping of functionality to requirements and mission objectives, and a probabilistic state-based simulation to determine requirements compliance, fault probabilities, and the number of fault paths in the system.  The tool will provide useful visualization of the FM design and fault paths, including the dynamic aspect of the system, as well as visual representations of system complexity.  In addition, the tool will provide automated means to estimate the complexity of the FM design based on system characteristics and simulation results.    The tool will provide engineers and managers with the ability to scope the fault management (FM) effort from requirements development through verification at a point early in the design process.  Phase I will focus on proof of concept and demonstration of key aspects of the tool, with full tool development and scaling to complex systems in Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This tool is specifically targeted to support projects that involve complex spacecraft and/or complex missions involving a fairly high level of automation and a requirement for fault tolerance and associated fault management. Projects Odyssey currently works on, including Orion and Commercial Crew and Cargo vehicles, are prime candidates for this tool, along with other complex spacecraft for which NASA is involved in the development.   The proposed fault management and planning tool has application for both manned and unmanned missions for which fault tolerance is required for safety or reliability reasons.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This tool would be highly useful to other complex system developers including the DoD, starting with spacecraft and expanding to other systems such as launch vehicles, aircraft, ground systems, and naval systems.  This tool could also be folded into a commercial reliability or quality management suite of tools as a module/plug-in. It can be expanded to include customers in the manufacturing and plant management (oil, chemical, etc.) industries through coordination with these software suite developers or as stand-alone tool to support these industries by teaming with an organization with domain expertise.

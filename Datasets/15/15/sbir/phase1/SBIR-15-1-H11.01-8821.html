		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In Sub-topic H11.01, NASA has identified a need for advanced radiation-shielding materials and structures to protect humans from space radiation during NASA missions.  The radiation species of greatest interest are light ions (particularly protons), heavy ions (such as iron-56) and neutrons.  International Scientific Technologies, Inc., in conjunction with The College of William and Mary, proposes the development of hydrogen-rich interpenetrating polymer networks as radiation shields. The program Technical Objectives include selection and design of interpenetrating polymer networks for use in radiation shields, synthesis of interpenetrating polymer networks tailored to function as radiation shields as well as structural components, and measurement and test of interpenetrating polymer network materials for radiation-shielding effectiveness and other multifunctional properties.  The innovation is the development of interpenetrating polymer networks for structural radiation-shielding materials to protect humans on NASA missions.  The anticipated result is a combination of high-performance aromatic polymers with hydrogen-rich aliphatic polymers to create composite materials that combine the structural properties of the high-performance polymers with increased shielding effectiveness of the hydrogen-rich polymers.  The proposed materials have multifunctional properties of radiation shielding against galactic cosmic radiation, neutrons and electromagnetic radiation, and structural integrity to permit use in flexible and rigid structures and habitats.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed multifunctional high-performance polymers will find application in NASA missions in protecting astronauts and sensitive optical, electronic, thermal and acoustic components from space hazards, including radiation, dust and thermal transients, while, at the same time, providing lightweight structures for planetary rovers and habitats.  It is expected that these interpenetrating polymer network systems will provide a high-performance-to-weight radiation shield that can be used within human habitats, spacecraft and protective apparel.  Other missions supported by NASA could also make use of the multifunctional materials for the International Space Station or in other orbiting vehicles involving long-duration small dose exposure.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Lightweight multifunctional radiation shielding will find application in the commercial sector in reducing collateral damage from heavy charged particles emerging as a therapeutic approach in nuclear medicine.  The shielding will lead to decreased fatigue among medical personnel required to wear heavy protective garments during radiological procedures.  Workers in industrial facilities using radiation for materials processing and in nuclear power facilities will also benefit from more-comfortable garments having reduced weight and thermal stress.  The Departments of Defense and of Homeland Security will find applications that include protection of soldiers, first responders and emergency medical personnel against high energy gamma radiation and neutrons resulting from so-called dirty bombs as well as from hazards brought about through accidental release of radiological materials.

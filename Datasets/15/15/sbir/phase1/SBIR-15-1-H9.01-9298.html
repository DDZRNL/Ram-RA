		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this effort, the Optical Sciences Company (tOSC) and Raytheon Vision Systems (RVS) will team to provide NASA with a long range laser communications system for spacecraft in the solar system. The ultimate product will be two components: (1) a spacecraft-based transceiver that uses small Size, Weight, and Power (SWAP) components to generate signals that can be detected at Earth; and (2) a ground-based transceiver system that uses Laser Guide Star (LGS) Adaptive Optics (AO) plus Linear Mode Photon Counting (LMPC) Avalanche Photo-Diode (APD) detectors to sense the incoming laser communications signals. tOSC has multiple contracts in laser communications technology, and has developed numerous AO systems for the USAF, while Raytheon is the world's largest producer for advanced sensors, including photon counting technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The results from this SBIR effort will demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that we can detect incoming laser communications signals from distant spacecraft, while also transmitting lower-information content back to the spacecraft, if necessary. The principal application will be to receive the signals from space for processing on the ground. As a consequence, NASA will be able to communicate with these distant spacecraft using very small SWAP systems, which can enable larger payloads for experiments other than communications. The commercial implications are significant, as the transceivers can be used in terrestrial applications involving aircraft, where communication through significant atmospheric turbulence is required.

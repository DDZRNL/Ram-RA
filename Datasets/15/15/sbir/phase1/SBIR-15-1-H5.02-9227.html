		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Currently, advanced ceramic composites are state-of-the-art for hypersonic airbreathing and space propulsion applications. The Launch Abort System (LAS) of the Orion Multi-Crew Exploration Vehicle (MCEV) will provide a safe escape for the crew in the event of an emergency during launch.  A key component of the LAS is its Attitude Control Motor (ACM) containing numerous advanced ceramic composite subcomponents. To fully utilize the high specific strengths and temperature capabilities of these composites, reliable high-temperature joining techniques are needed for attachment to metallic structures. Typical joining technologies such as epoxy, brazing and soldering are not useful in high-temperature applications. Currently, pintles and hot structures are mechanically fastened through highly stressed joints to metallic rods and actuators.  Mechanical fastening is not an ideal solution since it causes stress concentrations and destruction of continuous fibers by through holes and threads reducing the mechanical properties of the composite structure.  A solution that will resolve joining of numerous composites to metallic components is being pursued.  During Phase I, techniques to join metallic structures to advanced ceramic composites will be investigated resulting in structural qualification testing for the ACM pintle assembly. During Phase II, ACM hot gas components will be fabricated and hot fire tested.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Plasma's targeted NASA application is the Orion ACM program and launch abort systems for current and future missions.  Other NASA applications include In Space Propulsion components for attitude control, orbit maintenance, repositioning of satellites/spacecraft, reaction control systems, hypersonic vehicle hot structure control surface actuation rod/support attachment, descent/ascent engines, nuclear power/propulsion, and reusable launch vehicle propulsion applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Both government and commercial entities in the following sectors use advanced high-temperature materials for the following applications: coatings, defense, material R&D, nuclear power, aeronautics, aerospace, propulsion, and automotive.  Plasma's targeted commercial applications include joining composites to metals for aircraft composite components, thermal protection systems, rocket nozzles, heat pipes, and propulsion subcomponents.

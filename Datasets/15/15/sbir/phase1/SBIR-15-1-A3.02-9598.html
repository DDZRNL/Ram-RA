		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This project addresses three modeling elements relevant to NASA's IADS research and ATD-2 project, two related to ramp operations at primary airports and one related to departure status at secondary airports.  Departure scheduling requires departure status information from secondary airports that lack surface surveillance.  We propose a method using aircraft transponder activation and data science modeling to estimate earliest takeoff time and runway.  Fast-time simulations of IADS concepts require models of how ramp controllers manage near-gate aircraft movements; and how flight operators will interact with collaborative departure scheduling concepts.  We propose to develop a model, with defined interfaces to be usable in any NASA simulation platform, for conflict/congestion-free aircraft movements in alleyways, coordinated to allow efficient, simultaneous movements.  We will also offer a model for flight operator's swapping gate delays to free needed gates and prioritize their schedules.  These models are also relevant to NASA's SARDA and SMART NAS projects.  We will document the model designs, deliver all source code, and, in Phase 2, publish models under and Open Source license.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed SBIR will complete work that is highly beneficial to NASA, work that can directly benefit NASA's IADS research, ATD-2 project, SARDA research, and SMART NAS goals.  The method for estimating departure times and runways at secondary airports could be used at airports near DFW to support NASA's IADS research.  It could also be used as part of the ATD-2 project, wherever NASA chooses to focus that research.  The modeling of ramp operations and flight operator behaviors can be used to improve fast-time simulation capabilities that are used to study ATD-2 and other IADS concepts and by NASA's SARDA research.  Furthermore, these models can be included in NASA's SMART NAS model repository, to benefit any SMART NAS users that require high fidelity models of these aspects of NAS operations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary potential application for this work outside of NASA is with the FAA.  The method for providing departure status information from secondary airports could be deployed NAS-wide.  Every large airport is surrounded by smaller airports that increasingly are placing demand on shared departure resources.  Whatever IADS technologies the FAA deploys beyond IDAC, they will benefit from having the information provided by this concept.  Like NASA, the FAA must study and evaluate IADS technologies.  The models of ramp operations and flight operator participation in airport collaborative surface/departure concepts will enable higher-fidelity simulation studies, reducing concept risk and providing more accurate benefits estimates.  Other research organizations conducting IADS research will also benefit from these modes, which we intend to offer under an Open Source license in Phase 2.  The models of flight operator behavior could lead to commercial products to aid flight operators in interacting with surface CDM systems.

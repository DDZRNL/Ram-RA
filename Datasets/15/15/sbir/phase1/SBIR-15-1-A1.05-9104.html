		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Operating costs and fossil fuel consumption of civil transports can be reduced through use of efficient counter rotating open rotor (CROR) propulsion systems, thereby addressing both key industry needs and long-term NASA technical goals.  To develop such next-generation systems, multiple design variables must be assessed and optimized efficiently within a conceptual design software environment.   A blend of physics-based, low- and mid-fidelity tools featuring rapid turnaround time and ease of setup can provide this capability; implementation represents a serious technical challenge, though, and there is a high premium on developing tools that are both sufficiently accurate to capture current technology performance metrics while permitting the rapid re-calculations necessary for design trades.  The proposed approach centers on a blend of enhanced features and novel departures for two complementary aeroanalysis methods: an evolved version of an established subsonic lifting surface free wake mdoel for propellers as a fast,'low-fidelity' tool; and a more computationally intensive, fully compressible Cartesian Grid Euler model as a 'mid-fidelity' tool.   The projected Phase I will implement and test key modeling and formulation improvements for these methods to enable them to support the design of multi-stage open rotor configurations to meet current and projected performance targets.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed effort directly responds to NASA's SBIR solicitation goal of investigating the potential of advanced, innovative propulsion concepts to improve fuel efficiency and reduce the environmental footprint of future commercial transports. Propulsion systems such as open rotors can help meet aggressive, long range emission reduction targets in support of initiatives such as the Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) project.   The proposed effort will also enhance analysis and conceptual design tools that can support support assessment of novel air vehicle designs using CROR propulsion.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The enhanced fast-turnaround, physics-based analysis and design tools will also be of great use to both civil aircraft manufacturers and DoD.  The US Air Force is actively seeking more efficient future transport aircraft designs, and the proposed models can support those initiatives.  Airframers and private industry can also utilize these tools in designing more efficient fxied wing aircraft.  In addition, spinoffs to support design of propulsion systems for compound rotorcraft and UAVs are also possible.

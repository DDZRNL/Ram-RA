		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In the crew compartment of a spacecraft, dust that is self-generated or from other activities pose a respiratory irritant, especially within a small, confined space. Therefore air cabin filtration technologies should be improved for future spacecrafts to efficiently remove the range of particulate matter sizes (nano to micron size). It is also desirable to have the new particulate air filters that can be efficiently remove volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and self-regenerated. This will reduce the logistics burden of carrying additional replacement filters on-board. In the proposed Phase I effort, smart fibrous filters with both particle and VOC removal capacities will be developed. The new particulate filters will be much more efficient than the current HEPA filters and also capable of self-regenerating. The Phase I effort will focus on demonstration of the 'proof of concept' that fibrous filters can filter and remove the ultrafine (<0.5 &#956;m) particulates and destructively adsorb organic chemicals such as acetone. The technical approach will also involve regeneration of filters using a low-energy process. In the Phase II project, selective filtration membranes will be designed and modified to fit the NASA's current cabin air filtration systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Air-borne particulates and toxic organic chemicals pose a threat to the crew members' lungs and can also damage sensitive equipment. The proposed technology can efficiently remove  particulates and volatile organics encountered in a spacecraft cabin from the atmosphere. The air filters developed in this project can be incorporated into NASA's next generation "Indexing Media Filtration System" for Long Duration Space Missions and Orion space crafts.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Proposed air filters can find applications in a wide range of fields trapping particles including home land security (radiation particles), bioterrorism (Chemical/Bio agents),  medical (aviation flu), industry (diesel filter) and domestic (Air filters).

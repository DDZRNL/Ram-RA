		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The vibroacoustic characteristics of structures are vital in determining the operational envelope and mission feasibilities. The sources of vibroacoustic excitation are mainly due to noise generated by the launcher during ignition, lift-off, and atmospheric flight.  Typically, foam or fiberglass claddings and cores or acoustic liners which incorporate resonating chambers are used to prevent the transmission of sound through such structural locations. However, this approach is found to be ineffective for vibroacoustic sources with dominant frequency content below 400 Hz.  It is proposed to develop a metamaterial-inspired composite structure incorporating low-frequency vibro-impact resonating elements coupled with conventional high-frequency acoustic absorbers. The idea is to employ structurally-integral tuned resonators to pick up energy from incident low-frequency sound waves and utilizing the mechanism of frequency up-conversion via impacts, transfer the energy to higher modes in the sandwich primary structure for subsequent dissipation with conventional acoustic absorbers. The advantage of the proposed structure would be in reducing the transmitted pressure of low frequency waves, for which conventional methods are ineffective.  Our initial bound for the attachment mass is within 5 to 10% of the baseline structure to show significant peak pressure reduction for LF waves. The state-of-the-art conventional absorbers provide about 10-20% sound transmission loss (STL) in the 100-150 Hz range. Our performance objective is to achieve STL of about 50-60% in frequency range below 400 Hz with 5-10% mass increase without deteriorating stiffness response of the structure. Successful completion of Phase I work will result in a "proof-of-concept" MIAS unit cell. In Phase II, detailed design and fabrication of the MIAS prototype panel will be completed.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA applications primarily include launch vehicles. The proposed solution can be used in primary and supporting structures to reduce the transmission of vibroacoustic energy to subsystems and payloads. In case of manned flights, the transmission of acoustic and vibrational energy to modules accommodating astronauts has to be minimized. The proposed MIAS panels directly integrated into module structure is highly desirable as long as weight and size constraints are satisfied.  Aeronautical applications to increase fatigue life and quieten the internal space are also aggressively pursued by NASA.  The proposed concept is equally applicable to aeronautical structures.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Obvious commercial and general aviation applications to increase fatigue life and reduce internal noise level has the largest potential for commercializing the technology. The defense aerospace applications will also benefit from the technology. As cost of technology is reduced, it opens up limitless applications in all ground and ship transportation market sectors. Structural cladding for protective packaging systems and civil infrastructural partitions where low frequency acoustic insulation is critical can be the next potential market. As multifunctionalities are incorporated into the technology, energy harvesting for field-deployed equipment in remote locations where ambient low frequency acoustic environment is prevalent can be a niche market for the technology. As cost of technology is reduced, office buildings, factory buildings as well as housing market will be interested in the technology.

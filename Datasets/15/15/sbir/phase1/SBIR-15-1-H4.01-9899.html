		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		An advanced, lightweight inflation system is proposed that will reduce weight to at least 1/2, and down to 1/10 that of current inflation systems.  A novel ingress system is also proposed that will greatly aid the boarding of survival rafts especially stressed, injured, frightened or otherwise complromise people in the water.  Weight losses and fabrication advances in the inflatable portion of a raft package, being developed under a separate effort, promise to reduce overall package weight to a total package reduction of 2/3, with a goal of 12 pounds or less for a 6 person raft.

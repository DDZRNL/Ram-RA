		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Radiator panels are the baseline approach for rejecting waste heat from NASA Fission Surface Power (FSP) systems.  The required panels are very large, which makes them challenging to launch, deploy, support, and move.  Panel performance may also be degraded by dust, radiation, insolation, and micrometeorite impact.  In response, we propose to develop an ultra-compact heat rejection system for use on Mars and other planets and moons with atmospheric gas.  This system will rely on forced convection rather than radiation heat transfer.  It will decrease power system size and mass dramatically, which will make FSP more affordable and practical.  Creare is well suited to succeed because we have a long history developing advanced turbomachines, heat exchangers, and thermal systems for challenging spaceflight applications.  During the Phase I project, we will optimize design trades, complete a preliminary design, and conduct bearing evaluation tests.  We will then fabricate and test a prototype system during the Phase II project.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Compact, reliable heat rejection systems are needed on Mars and other planets and moons with atmospheric gas.  Notable applications include FSP systems, manned rovers, in-situ resource utilization systems, and unmanned exploration landers.  Secondary uses for the technology elements include compact, reliable air handling systems for manned spacecraft and space stations; reliable, high-speed bearings for energy storage flywheels, turbomachines, and gas turbine engines; and compact heat exchangers for a broad array of applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Earth-based versions of our heat rejection system can be used to provide cooling for military and civilian applications.  Military applications will likely focus on mobile platforms that value compact size, low mass, and maintenance-free reliability.  Mobile electric generators, aircraft, land vehicles, and watercraft all have high potential.  Civilian versions of these applications can also be improved with our technology.  The most attractive market is HVAC systems, which has military, industrial, commercial, and home opportunities.

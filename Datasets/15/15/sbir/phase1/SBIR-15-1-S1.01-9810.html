		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is actively pursuing guidance and control light detection and ranging (lidar) systems for upcoming exploration missions including asteroid, comet, planet, and planetary moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Fibertek proposes to develop a scanning 3D imaging photon-counting cubesat lidar capable of topology and rendezvous over ranges from 1 to >100 km range at a fraction of the power, mass, and cost of the Mercury Laser Altimeter.<BR>2U cubesat subsystem that exceeds all topic S1:01  performance requirements. <BR> <BR>The lidar provides unprecedented range (>100 km), range resolution, (~ 15cm) and 10 degree scanning angle in an ultra low size (10x10x20cm), mass (4kg) and power (14.3W) in a 2U size suitable for Cubesat, Small Sal or Orion sized vehicle. The lidar can support Proximity Operations & Formation Flying in the future with minor hardware changes, software updates. Optical satellite to satellite communications can be added to the lidar in the future under Phase IIE or Phase III support.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		?XThe core lidar technology developed has applications to numerous NASA and DoD instrument needs. Because the lidar uses readily available laser diodes and the diode laser can be digitally controlled unlike a solid state laser the system can be reconfigured to more than one application. The approach uses very straightforward, high-TRL component technology; does not require specialized lasers, laser scientists, or advanced focal plane technology; and can support 5- to 15-year mission lifetimes. <BR>The 2U cubesat form factor means the lidar can be incorporated into a 3U or 6U cubesat that includes the flight avionics and solar panels. The lidar's NASA applications include 3D imaging lidar for asteroids, comets and planetary bodies proving topology, ranging and mapping. Can be used for center of mass determination, obstacle and surface texture identification, rendezvous and slope determination for landing. The core lidar technology can also be adapted for measuring a column content of CO2, methane, water vapor and ice detection.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		DoD customers are interested in space ranging for most of the applications above. Ranging and 3D imaging of objects in space are important for identification. We are confident that the successful outcome of this SBIR would spur use in satellite servicing. There appears to be an emerging as a commercial services market and several companies are in contact with Fibertek about proximity operations lidars. The proposed RZPN lidar may have been the preferred choice for these systems if the technical maturity existed. The DOD has numerous battlefield application for airborne and ground based ranging and target ID. The LIDAR design envisioned by Fibertek allows long range 3D imaging in a small, light weight, simple, robust package to be carried to forward areas by a dismounted soldier or deployed in a small transportable UAV yet powerful enough to map the battlefield from outside the range of enemy fire would be an invaluable tool for the battlefield commander

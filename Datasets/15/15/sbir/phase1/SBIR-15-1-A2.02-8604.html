		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Optimal Synthesis Inc. proposes to develop a formal verification and validation approach to small-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) autopilots. The UAV autopilots are modeled as hybrid systems and further abstracted into a finite state machine to which a computational model checking tool is applied to verify the safety property of the autopilot. The abstraction is performed by rechability computation. While traditional reachability computation has been limited to low-dimensional systems, the abstraction approach developed by Purduer University approximates the hybrid system and exhibit significant improvement in computational efficiency. This forms the basis for onboard model-checking for safety. The proof of concept is planned to be demonstrated in the Phase I using simulation studies, and ensuring hardware-in-the-loop simulation and flight demonstration are planned in the Phase II research.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The V&V technology is a key component in many NASA programs. In particular, the developed tool directly supports the NASA strategic thrust of Assured Autonomy for Aviation Transformation. As specific programs, the V&V tool supports the UAS integration into the National Airspace System (NAS) in the Integrated Aviation Systems Program (IASP) by reducing the barriers associated with the safety assurance and certification for UAS operations in the NAS. The real-time V&V features of the developed tool also support the Flight Demonstration and Capabilities Project (FDC). The V &V is also a technical challenge in increasingly autonomous operations in the NAS that is a concern in the Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP). In particular, the V&V is targeted for demonstration with small-scale UAVs that has direct relevance with low-altitude UAV operations and their traffic management.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The developed V&V will have direct impact on certification practice and standard by FAA. These days, many small-scale UAV accidents frequently show up in the public media, raising a public concern for the safety of UAV operations in the civil airspace. The concern for UAV safety has also grown in parallel with ever-increasing demand for allowing UAVs into civil airspace driven by UAV markets and economic potentials.  The V&V tool will help to establish the standards and certification methods for those newly emerging UAVs, and hence benefits the regulation agencies of the government as well as UAV industries aspiring access to the commercial markets. As dictated by UAV mishap rate that remains much higher than manned counterpart, the safety assurance and reliable UAS operations has a high priority in military domains. Therefore, the developed V&V tool will greatly benefit the military V&V domains.

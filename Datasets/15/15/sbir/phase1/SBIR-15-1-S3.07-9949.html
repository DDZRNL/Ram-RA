		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The development of advanced small spacecraft with increased capability and performance requires new technologies and approaches to thermal management.  Newer and more complex integrated electronics add to mission capability but also produce more waste heat.  Traditional methods of metal heat pipes or structures have issues when scaling to accommodate higher thermal loads, especially in the vacuum and extreme conditions of space.  Eotron has developed a 3D silicon front end to a fluid pump loop cooling system that offers improved performance in a compact light-weight form factor.  The proposed Silicon Cold Plate makes direct contact with high thermal flux devices and removes waste heat through a series of fluid channels internal to the silicon.  The Silicon Plate is bonded to the system PCB at thermal Via points to remove additional heat and provide electrical and system connection to other electronic components.  Fluid, moving through silicon's internal channels is then moved to another area for thermal radiation by a system pump.<BR><BR>In this proposal, the company outlines its plans to design, fabricate and test a prototype to prove its capability to remove a typical high thermal load from a compact system along with basic reliability testing on the fluid system.  Silicon's advantages of light-weight, high thermal conductivity and non-reactive nature to liquids make it ideal for this application.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)

		Potential NASA Commercial Applications (?)<BR><BR>In addition to CubeSat/SmallSat applications, this technology is suitable for removal of waste heat in advanced electronic systems where high system performance is required in a compact format or where environmental conditions prohibit the use of larger conventional thermal management systems. As an example, concentrated photovoltaic systems, or airborne systems such as UAVs or other autonomous vehicles and robots.  This technology also has the potential to eliminate the need the for expensive and bulky integrated circuit packaging like column grid arrays, while at the same time providing superior thermal management performance.

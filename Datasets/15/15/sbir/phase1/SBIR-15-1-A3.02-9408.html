		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to develop a Convective-Induced Turbulence (CIT) hazard detection system for Oceanic Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO) based on satellite-based observations of lightning and other supporting data.  The system is based on total lightning sensing as an indicator of the location and severity of in-cloud CIT.  Total lightning activity will be measured over oceanic airspace at high temporal resolution from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-Series (GOES R) in 2016.  This opens up a unique research and business opportunity; we seek to investigate the relationship between CIT and total lightning measurements, and determine the skill of total lightning as an indicator of CIT. We will be able to provide turbulence estimates for oceanic flights and automatically warn airline dispatchers of upcoming weather hazards in TBO over oceanic airspaces.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP) will benefit from this innovation:<BR><BR>*  Promote autonomy of the NAS by providing timely data processing of CIT hazard detection and proximity warnings relative to a 4-D Trajectory (4DT) in Oceanic TBO<BR><BR>*  Create a shared situational awareness between the flight deck, dispatchers, and air traffic control on the dynamically changing CIT weather hazard<BR><BR>*  Promote weather-integrated tactical flight rerouting by automatically providing information about the lateral and vertical options for finding clear air safe from CIT hazards<BR><BR>Several NASA projects can benefit from this SBIR effort: Weather Integration, Weather Hazard Modeling (Oceanic CWAM), TASAR, Oceanic In-Trail Procedures (ITP), and ATD-3.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		FAA Command Center and Flight Information Regions (FIRs) controlling Oceanic Airspace in the Atlantic and Pacific will benefit from this SBIR.<BR><BR>Airlines with Oceanic flights in the Atlantic and Pacific can integrate our data into their Airline Operations Center (AOC) workstations.

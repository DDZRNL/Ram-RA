		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		San Diego Composites has developed a game-changing concept for the in-situ manufacture of advanced composite structures from aboard a spacecraft.  This concept uses a combination of proven composite manufacturing processes, such as filament winding, pultrusion, and UV curing resins systems.  The system has the capability to "print" advanced composite truss (ACT) structures from raw materials carried up during launch.  This concept minimizes launch volume allowing for space for other mission-critical equipment, and allows for the deployment of much larger structures than the current state-of-the art.  Deployed structures using SDC's continuous Advanced Composite Truss (ACT) printing system would be limited in length only by the ultimate structural capabilities of the material and truss structure.  While the application addressed for this particular proposal deals with structures in the hundreds of feet, this concept could be extended to create structures in excess of 1000s of feet if tailored for a different given integration platforms.<BR>There are many advantages to this methodology.  First of all, the entire produced structure is load carrying without fasteners, joints, or secondary materials.  Secondly, high modulus fibers can be used as the primary load carrying material creating the efficient structure from a stiffness/weight perspective.  Another advantage of the process is that it can be programmable for "printing" the optimized structures.  Also, the structures are manufactured and cured in space after all of the high vibration loading associated with launch are over.  SDC's continuous ACT printing method can also be integrated with the deployment strategy for a solar sail or array.  This would maximize the use of the hardware and help to justify the light-weight machine.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The SBIR Phase I project focus is on the near-term Asteroid Redirect Mission which requires deployable structure capabilities. SDC will demonstrate feasibility of continuous ACT structure printing for use with deployable structures based on the ARM system design and mission objectives. The ultimate intent of the Phase I project is to develop and evaluate a new, novel deployable structure mechanism with mission and structure tailorability. <BR>SDC has aligned the schedule and scope of the SBIR project with NASA's proposed ARM development roadmap. A Phase II SBIR will develop the continuous ACT printing process by developing a prototype machine to perform the manufacturing.  The Phase II will also see improved analysis and design techniques with the manufacturability, strength-to-weight ratio, and structural capabilities of the structures at the heart of the development effort.  According to NASAs current plans for ARM, the mission will be developed in the early 2020 decade, for which SDC is confident that working continuous ACT printing machine will be available for deployable structures.  Further development plans for continuous ACT printed structures include all space missions that require deployable structures for SEP, as well as in-situ structural repairs for any and all spacecraft such as the ISS.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The need for a low-cost, light-weight, space deployable structure is far broader than the proposed scope of this Phase I project. SDC recognizes the high potential for continuous ACT structures to be an enabling technology for future satellite and ISS or other future space station structures.  Long-term low-earth orbit satellites could utilize these structures minimize launch volume/weight. This type of deployable structure could be applied and tailored to each mission's specific structural needs, with the process being easily scalable and reprogrammable.  Continuous ACT printed structures could be used as in-situ structural repairs for the ISS, additional deployable structure for solar arrays for all types of space crafts, as well as numerous other structural applications.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To enable future robotic exploration systems to have greater mobility capabilities on difficult terrain such as craters, cliffs, gullies, and skylights, Tethers Unlimited proposes to develop the "Advanced Regolith Anchoring for Cable-assisted Mobility" (ARACMO) Anchor.  This device can launch hundreds of meters from a rover vehicle, self-right, autonomously anchor, and support high loads through the attached tether.  This will enable the rover to rappel, climb, or maneuver over otherwise insurmountable terrain utilizing the stability that a strong anchoring point affords. The proposed technology is part of the ARACMO System (developed in future efforts) which in addition to the aforementioned ARACMO Anchor, may include a launcher, winch, and gimbal. The unique design of the orbital winch accomplishes cable winding and deployment without rotating the spool, thereby minimizing mass and power consumption, while eliminating the need for electrical and optical slip-rings, which are a major risk in dusty environments. The launcher can be incorporated into the design of the which, keeping mass and volume at a minimum.  This technology will enable dozens of new applications for planetary exploration.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The ARACMO Anchor will allow NASA planetary exploration missions to extend scientific investigations in previously inaccessible terrain.  It will enable rovers to explore craters, cliffs, caves and gullies that are of significant geological interest.  Other applications may include in situ resource acquisition, erecting structures, anchoring aerobots to planetary surfaces, astronaut mobility, and anchoring/sampling operations on microgravity bodies.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The ARACMO Anchor technology could be very instrumental for search and rescue operations, soil stabilization needs, or response to natural disasters.  It could provide greater mobility for military and recreational vehicles.  It could also be used in the construction industry to quickly set-up anchors to stabilize structures.

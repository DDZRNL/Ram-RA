		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this proposed research and development project, we investigate and design an innovative system that solves the key problem of multi-vehicle cooperation and interoperability. Our approach is based upon the principles and techniques of Performance Based Navigation (PBN) and Required Navigation Performance (RNP) concepts and is adjusted for other separation, safety, and weather effects.  We design the architecture for a system that simultaneously maintains the efficiency and success of a multi-vehicle mission while also detecting and resolving potential loss of separation and conflicts within the NAS. The challenge is that for a variety of missions, teams of unmanned vehicles can perform the mission efficiently in particular configurations, but simultaneously the team of vehicles must be aware of and accommodate themselves, external traffic, potential intruders, environmental constraints, terrain, and so forth. Our software based system, UA-Teamer, provides the architecture and solutions to achieve mission success and the efficiency promised that multi-vehicle teams can accomplish while maintaining system safety. Our primary technical objectives are: i) Demonstrate a common set of flight path planning parameters built using PBN and other constraints enabling UA to interoperate and cooperate as a team; ii) Produce an algorithmic software approach that selects a best fit flight path set for a UA team mission that involves heterogeneous UAs; and iii) Show that the planners can response to conformance monitoring needs for re-planning and contingencies. The project includes a feasibility demonstration and human factors research into the display of optional trajectory sets for the UA team.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The multi-UA planner, UA-Teamer, could provide great value to the R&D efforts of NASA in the Integrated Aviation Systems Program and vehicular autonomy programs, specifically in the areas involving multi-vehicle cooperation and interoperability. Additionally, the final product may aid programs under aerospace safety and integration, UAS in the NAS, and programs which may someday utilize multi-UA missions, such as hurricane surveillance. The UA-Teamer system allows for simultaneously maintaining the efficiency and success of multi-vehicle missions while also detecting non-compliance of mission plans and resolving potential problems such as loss of separation and conflicts within the NAS through mission replanning. This system is critical to facilitating the safe use of multiple UAVs in the NAS. UA-Teamer provides essential developments in the areas of algorithms/control software systems, telemetry tracking, and air transportation safety.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The UA-Teamer system has application to UAVs that are used or could be employed in the following market sectors: Defense/military (all Services), Government Agencies (e,g., as Homeland Security, FBI, Forestry Department), Law Enforcement Sector, First Responders, in addition to commercial companies with services that may involve future multi-UA missions.  Potential applications for the UA-Teamer system include agricultural applications, disaster response (e.g. fire mapping), wildlife surveys, forest health monitoring, oil spills monitoring, mine exploration, remote imaging and mapping, and reconnaissance.   UA-Teamer may have use in low attitude traffic management as well as by approaches in high density small aircraft that are envisioned under an air taxi or personal vehicle concepts.

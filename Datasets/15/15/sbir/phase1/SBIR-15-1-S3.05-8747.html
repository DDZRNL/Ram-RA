		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this program, we propose to develop a new photonic-integration platform that incorporates optical gain in resonant waveguide optical gyroscopes.  This new photonic integration platform is based on our existing low-loss SiN/SiO2 PLC photonic integration technology and incorporates a doped Aluminum Oxide layer for gain. One key resonant waveguide optical gyro design constraint is the relationship between the waveguide length, which can increase the Sagnac effect, and waveguide loss, which decreases the gyro resolution. Freedom Photonics'  low loss SiN PLC platform is clearly an adequate path forward for record-breaking Gyro performance.  With introduction of gain into the PLC, new possibilities arise for enhanced sensitivity, simplified control electronics, and ultra compact and robust designs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary focus of this program is to provide high-performance low c-SWaP optical gyroscopes to NASA for evaluation on the ISS. The program goal is the integration of these small and lightweight sensors into space subsystems, pico satellites, and space vehicles.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Interdisciplinary Consulting Corporation (IC2) and in partnership with the University of Florida (UF) propose a microfabricated, dynamic piezoelectric pressure sensor array with sub-mm spacing to enable high temporal and spatial resolution measurements of cross-flow transition in swept-wing, supersonic aircraft research.  The proposal is in response to Subtopic A1.08 Ground Testing and Measurement Technologies, whereby the primary objective is "to develop innovative tools and technologies that enhance testing and measurement capabilities&#133;"  More specifically, the proposed innovation addresses critically unmet measurement needs of the Commercial Supersonics Technology (CST) Project of the NASA Advanced Air Vehicles Program (AAVP).  <BR><BR>The proposed innovation is a highly miniaturized, dynamic piezoelectric pressure sensor array with sub-mm spacing for high bandwidth, high spatial resolution measurements of cross-flow transition.  High-spatial resolution pressure sensors with sub-mm spacing provide a much-needed capability that does not currently exist among state-of-the-art offerings, enabling dynamic wall pressure measurement and identification of traveling and standing cross-flow modes.  The proposed concept extends the basic design to high bandwidth, high-spatial resolution, dynamic pressure sensing via reduction in sensor geometry and integration of multiple sensors arrayed on a single chip.  The end result is a miniaturized, highly-compact array of dynamic pressure sensors with backside contacts to enable a truly flush-mounted, smooth interface for flow measurement applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed instrumentation technology has the potential to be transportable across multiple NASA facility classes as well as implemented across government-owned, industry and academic institution test facilities.  The target market is the research-grade instrumentation and measurement shear stress sensors market for the aerospace research and development industry.  The target application for entry into NASA Aeronautics Test Program is as ground test wind-tunnel instrumentation for turbulent skin friction measurements and separation detection and control. cross-flow boundary layer transition measurements for swept wing models, such as is performed at NASA Langley. These measurements are critical to the proper design of swept wing geometry for the next generation of civilian supersonic aircraft.  The design and operating conditions of these aircraft expose the vehicle to cross-flow instabilities that complicate the prediction and control of laminar flow and transition to turbulence.  Accurate measurement of these cross-flow instability modes is not currently possible with existing technologies due to limited spatial resolution and sensor spacing constraints. Our proposed technology surmounts the constraints of existing technologies, enabling the required sensor spacing and resolution, thereby directly addressing the previously unmet need.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		External customers for dynamic pressure measurements include universities and industry aircraft manufacturers such as the Boeing Company.  Particularly, those customers seeking or currently designing next generation, civilian or defense supersonic aircraft have an identical unmet measurement need as NASA Langley.    Furthermore, in-flight flow-control (a rapidly growing area of research and development) requires compact accurate measurements of key fluid dynamic parameters such as wall shear stress and dynamic wall pressure.  This is a potentially larger volume market with relatively high ASP but will require more development time to meet the tighter space constraints, tougher operating conditions and unique target specifications that such an application entails.

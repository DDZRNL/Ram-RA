		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The overall objective of this work is to develop a radiation shielding material system that is sufficiently strong to serve as a load bearing structure. Such a materials system does not currently exist.  The ideal shielding material for space applications should preferably be light weight with good mechanical strength and good thermal conductivity.  We propose a novel approach to fabricate reinforced composite materials for radiation shielding applications using a powder metallurgy approach with sintering via the innovative Field Assisted Sintering Technology (FAST). The composite materials that we propose include various compositions of boron carbide (B4C) and tungsten carbide (WC) in either an aluminum matrix or in a polymer matrix of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). FAST (also called spark plasma sintering- SPS) is an innovative process that sinters powder with near 100% theoretical density and very limited to no grain growth. FAST is a one step process that is highly flexible and robust, with short processing cycles (100-1000 times faster).  It is much more cost effective in comparison to conventional compaction and sintering methods, and it is also amenable to large scale production.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Lightweight innovative radiation shielding materials are needed to safeguard humans in next generation exploration. Furthermore, the energetic particles encountered in space can destroy or cause malfunctions in spacecraft electronics.  The targeted application for the proposed materials that will be developed during this STTR work is radiation shielding to shield humans in aerospace transport vehicles, large space structures such as space stations, orbiters, landers, rovers, habitats, and spacesuits. The material is expected to be multi-functional by also providing structural support while still maintaining weight requirements. The materials will also provide radiation shielding to the electronic components on board the space vehicle.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed materials have potential military applications as well as commercial applications such as in the medical industry and for the nuclear energy industry. Along with NASA, potential customers include DoD and DOE as well as first responders, nuclear energy providers and medical personnel.

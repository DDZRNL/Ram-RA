		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Systems & Processes Engineering Corporation (SPEC) proposes .65 U cubesat format LIDAR, with class 1 eye-safe lasers for space structure inspection applications.  The LIDAR provides both Raman Spectra for determination of the surface chemical content for leak detection and HD6D imaging consisting of ultra high range accuracy 3D LIDAR and RGB camera images fused to give an HD resolution image.  Range accuracy for the HD6D is 15 microns to a range of 3 meters with a maximum range of 300m.  This capability draws on SPEC part inspection LIDAR.  The chemical detection capability can detect one molecule thick layers adsorbed on surfaces determining chemical content, allowing detection of leaks in pressurized or vacuum conditions with a range of 30m.  The 3D imaging allows surface imperfections like micro meteor or debris holes to be highlighted, and the chemical content map to be draped on the 3D display.     The 3D imaging rate is from 3.2Mpps.  The laser transmits an FMCW modulated signal allowing the extreme range accuracy.  The 3D imaging uses a 1550nm 2 stage EDFA, while Raman Spectral uses a unit diode, wafer laminate laser at 532nm, induced to operate in a Q-switch mode by modulating the pump.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Raman Spectra, high range resolution LIDAR can be used for chemical detection, structural defect mapping and navigation for free flight inspection robots.  The combination leak detection, surface integrity mapping and navigation capabilities make the instrument useful for a number of space instrument applications in addition to space structure inspection applications. The chemical detection payload can also be used on other missions where standoff sensing of composition is of interest.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Military space asset structural inspection is a direct spin off.  Areas of interest already explored for the chemical detection are explosive detection, bio toxin detection and remote detection of radioactive containers by the nitrous oxide adsorbed on the surface. Other interests are in pollutions and leak detection and tracking.  Airborne applications can be eye-safe on the ground with ranges up to 3km.  Ultra range accuracy applications include complex part inspection.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Trex proposes to demonstrate a novel ceramic joining technology (solid state bonding) for CVC SiC&#174; that allows "seamless" joining of smaller, easily manufactured, and simply shaped components to produce large mirrors and telescope structures, a type of Additive Manufacturing.  Trex CVC SiC&#174; is a directly super-polishable mirror substrate material that does not require a silicon cladding, and it has tremendous thermal diffusivity for passive dimensional stability. Such an Additive Manufacturing process minimizes schedule intensive machining processes, labor hours, polishing time, and metrology, which in turn dramatically decreases the cost of the mirror.  Our Phase I objective is to optimize the solid state bonding process (make it 100% pore free) and to fabricate a subscale monolithic mirror substrate from hexagonal panels which have been solid state bonded together.  Phase I will demonstrate traceability to multi-meter class mirror substrates. Trex CVC SiC&#174; represents an extraordinary technology investment opportunity for NASA with respect to near-term balloon-borne stratospheric telescopes for Astrophysics and Planetary science, and farther term EUOVIR telescopes such as ATLAST observatory.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Astro 2010 clearly states the need for large aperture, lightweight mirrors for future UV/Optical telescopes, andrecommends NASA invest in this need during the next 5-years. Table S2-C2 of the 2012 National Research Council report entitled "NASA Space Technology Roadmaps and Priorities: Restoring NASA's Technological Edge and Paving the Way for a New Era in Space", calls for a new generation of astronomical telescopes that enable discovery of habitable planets, facilitate advances in solar physics, and enable the study of faint structures around bright objects by developing high-contrast imaging and spectroscopic technologies to provide unprecedented sensitivity, field of view, and spectroscopy of faint objects. The common need cited is a mirror technology that is lightweight, dimensionally stable, high performance, and above all else, cost effective. One of these potential future observatory missions is the Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST) (Marc Postman et.al., SPIE Journal of Optical Engineering, 51(1), 011007, January 2012).

		<BR>
		Low cost, lightweight, dimensionally stable SiC mirrors have use in complex telescopes for Astronomy, Imaging and Remote Sensing applications, including optical instruments/telescopes which enable imaging, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions for police and paramilitary units, fire fighters, power and pipeline monitoring, search and rescue, atmospheric and ocean monitoring, imagery and mapping for resource management, and disaster relief and communications. The dual-use nature of complex telescopes will bring affordability to national defense missions as well.

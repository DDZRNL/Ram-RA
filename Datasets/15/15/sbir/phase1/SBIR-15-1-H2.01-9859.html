		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Given increasing interest in high-performance, Methane-fueled reaction control engines in the 5-100lbf thrust class, Ventions proposes the design, fabrication and hot-fire testing of a nominal 50lbf engine that is batch fabricated in a low-cost manner using a novel manufacturing process.  The proposed approach leverages several years of DARPA and NASA funded work by Ventions in the successful development and ground / flight testing of such configurations, and allows for the realization of complex regenerative cooling passages and injector geometries previously unattainable by conventional fabrication methodologies.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The 50lbf reaction control engines proposed herein can readily be scaled up or down to thrusts in the 10-250lbf range, hence, it is expected to have numerous applications for NASA missions.  This is particularly true if the primary propulsion for the spacecraft is also LOX / Methane based, thereby allowing for the secondary RCE propulsion to tap off the main tankage and / or residuals. Specific examples of these applications are likely to include reaction control for human-rated spacecraft, and for lander and ascent vehicles for planetary or lunar missions (either human or large science spacecraft / rovers).  Additionally, the technology is also suitable for primary ascent or descent propulsion for smaller spacecraft missions such as lunar landers, Mars hoppers, or the like thereof.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Beyond NASA missions, one can envision several non-NASA applications in the ever-growing world of commercial space. Specific examples of such commercial space missions are likely to include reaction / attitude control for large booster stages and nano launch vehicles, as well upper stage or orbit insertion propulsion.  Additionally, beyond space applications, the proposed technology is also applicable in terrestrial energy markets utilizing LNG in "closed" LNG / Oxygen cycles to eliminate NOX production and simplify CO2 capture and sequestration.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal is for the development of conductors with improved electrical conductivity and/or ampacity better than copper or aluminum.  Electrical conductors are key components for just about every power device or system. Copper is presently the conductor of choice, based on high performance, low cost, and ease of use. However, increasing demands for power and data push the need for more capacity, and the total contribution of electrical conductor weight to the system has become significant in aircraft, ships, rail, and automobiles. Thus, the development of a commercial, low-cost, light-weight, highly conductivity wire is an important objective to improve energy efficiency and reduce the weight/amp of power.	In this Phase I and eventual Phase II we propose the development for carbon nanotube (CNT) metal based current carrying composites.  We will focus on CNT additions to two base metals, Cu and Al, and the composites made with them as base metals.  We will focus on composites that have a high density of carbon nanotubes.  Our objective is developing methods to functionalize the connection between carbon nanotubes such that the connections have low resistance. We will focus on the properties of conductivity, and ampacity (maximum current which can be carried per area of cross section).   Our focus will be demonstrating methods of improvement in Phase I and optimization of the best options in Phase II and also fabrication of long length wires in a Phase II effort.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Improved conductors that have a better amp/gm capacity can benefit many NASA applications where light weight power components are required such as generators, motors, transformers, inductors, power conditioning equipment, wiring for data transmission, actuators, MHD magnets, propulsion engines, magnetic shielding, and magnetic launch devices.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The high performance (Amp/gm)  carbon nanotube wires that can be developed in this SBIR Phase I and II will initially be more expensive than Cu and Al wires until the technology is fully developed and large scale manufacturing is put in place. The initial market applications will be where weight is at a premium and electrical wiring is needed. These include obvious industries like aircraft, outer space and military hardware, transportation (ships, trains, and autos), and wind turbine generators on tall towers. The secondary industries that are addressable include where high current densities are needed to obtain higher magnetic fields (above 2 tesla) which is similar to the market for superconductors that Hyper Tech is presently marketing and selling. Present superconductor wire applications are some of the early market applications where these high performance CNT wires could penetrate the marketplace. Such applications include motors, generators, fault current limiters, transformers, transmission cables, MRI, and High Energy Physics type applications.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA desires new phase change systems to regulate heat transfer among components within a CubeSat small spacecraft. The temperature variation within the small spacecraft often leads to large temperature spikes that may be detrimental to onboard unit components. Temperatures can often range from -40 ?C to +80 ?C. InnoSense LLC (ISL) will develop an ionic liquid-based heat transfer fluid for use within the CubeSat. Our method will be to control the functional groups attached to an ionic liquid to tune the melting point and reduce electrical conductivity of the material. The proposed technology will be tailored for use with a variety of different components within the CubeSat. In Phase I, ISL proposes to synthesize a functionalized ionic liquid and test its thermal properties. The proposed material is expected to have high thermal conductivity, high heat storage density, and melting point with range of component operation. During Phase II and follow-on phases, the proposed technology will be refined, optimized, and scaled to larger size production. The proposed materials will also be tested in various environments. Packaging methods will be investigated and the final product will be integrated into working CubeSats with the assistance of a CubeSat design company.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		As spacecraft's size reduces, damage resulting from the effect of thermal fluctuations becomes increasingly detrimental. When components turn on and off, the temperature of the spacecraft interior can rapidly rise, damaging critical components. By including a phase change material that can be integrated into a variety of components, shapes and orientations, the temperature of the spacecraft can be readily regulated. Through such temperature regulations, critical device components will be maintained at optimum operational temperatures.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial uses of the proposed ionic liquid heat transfer fluid will include extreme environment vehicles. The performance of these vehicles will be improved by the addition the ionic liquid phase change material that will regulate internal temperatures, reducing energy use within the vehicle. This will, in turn, also reduce the size of heat exchangers leading to more open, workable space within the shelter or vehicle.

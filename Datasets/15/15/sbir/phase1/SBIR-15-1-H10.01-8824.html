		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Ongoing rocket test operations at NASA Stennis Space Center (SSC) result in substantial quantities of hydrogen gas that is flared from the facility in addition to valuable helium gas that is vented to the atmosphere. One method that can dramatically reduce the cost of test operations is to recover these gases using an electrochemical process.  A Hydrogen Recovery System (HRS), which has recently been the subject of a highly successful Phase II SBIR conducted by Sustainable Innovations, LLC, selectively removes hydrogen from the mixed stream, leaving behind the high-value helium.  In 2014 a prototype unit was successfully delivered by Sustainable Innovations to SSC to demonstrate the ability to capture, separate and compress helium from a mixture derived from test operations.  The innovative step in this Phase I proposal is to increase the gas capacity capability of the electrochemical separation cell while maintaining optimal operating efficiency and durability.  This will be achieved by:  Implementing high electrical conductivity, high durability coatings on cell components that support operation in the hydrogen environment; Evaluating and demonstrating robust, high strength, high conductivity proton exchange membrane materials that support the separation process; and Integrating all elements within a one-piece flow field structure to minimize interfaces and facilitate coatings.    It is expected that these innovative steps will allow for at least a doubling of throughput capacity per unit cell area.

		Hydrogen/Helium Separation &#150; NASA has significant needs to separate and recover hydrogen and helium from its large rocket engine test stands. <BR><BR>Hydrogen Separation for Resource Recovery &#150; Sustainable Innovations is working with Marshall Space Flight Center on a system that can separate and compress hydrogen from a mixed stream containing  CO, methane, acetylene, ethane, and ethylene.  An SBIR Phase I research program has shown that electrochemical hydrogen separation and compression is an enabling technology for the Carbon Dioxide Reduction System that facilitates further closure of the oxygen loop in an Advanced Life Support System. <BR><BR>Pressurization for Mechanical Actuation &#150; The NASA In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) group is very interested in the utilization of hydrogen as a working fluid for mechanical actuation.  In this application, hydrogen would be compressed electrochemically using the core architecture of the HRS.  <BR><BR>Reformate Separation &#150;There is a need by NASA to convert carbon dioxide to fuels as well as convert fuels to hydrogen.  As part of this collection of cycles, there is a need to separate H2 from environments containing CO, CO2, and excess fuels.  <BR><BR>Fuel Cell Energy Storage &#150; Hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell systems are being carefully examined by NASA as a means of providing efficient energy storage for many different NASA missions.   Residual helium often exists in the hydrogen tanks of these energy storage systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Sustainable Innovations is commercializing its electrochemical hydrogen separator and compressor technology for hydrogen under the trade name H2RENEW&#153;.  Target markets for this product are:<BR>	Process Hydrogen Markets: Hydrogen used as process atmosphere in industries such as metal heat treatment, electronics and semiconductor manufacturing, float glass production, and electricity production (for electric generator cooling.) <BR>	Hydrogen Fueling Markets: Hydrogen used as fuel in a variety of fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) (forklifts, scooters, passenger cars, ships, etc.), stationary power and research markets. <BR>	Hydrogen Tri-Generation: Separation of hydrogen from stationary fuel cell reformate, and compression for fueling (such as FCVs) applications.<BR>	Hydrogen Production: Captive production, merchant production and delivery, and distributed production of hydrogen from natural gas or methane via reformer, or via electrolysis.

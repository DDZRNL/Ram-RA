		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial silicon carbide (SiC)-based photonic sensors typically use p&#150;i&#150;n photodiode and reversed-biased Avalanche Photodiode (APD) detectors. These state-of-the-art SiC photodioides use the wafer substrate as one node of the device, thereby making monolithic integration of the device with control or analysis circuitry difficult, if not impossible.<BR><BR>Ozark IC's new (patent pending) photo detecting devices are inherently suitable for integration in SiC-based low-voltage integrated circuit processes. By virtue of their construction, the photo-generation occurs efficiently and with very high gain. This proposal uses these high-gain photonic devices to construct the world's first monolithic SiC UV pixel sensor array. Also key to this proposal is Ozark IC's extensive library of SiC analog and mixed-signal IP and its expertise in extreme environment IC design.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The first obvious application of this technology is to one of NASA's many current and planned earth science missions that require space-borne instruments capable of measuring light in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum. <BR><BR>1) For the Geo-CAPE mission, recommended by the NRC for the Decadal Survey, tropospheric ozone measurements in the UV range of 290 nm-340 nm are required. An instrument based on the proposed technique is very feasible and would offer significant advantages in performance, size and weight over a discrete SiC diode-based approach. <BR><BR>2) For planetary composition experiments such as ATLAS and NOW, an instrument capable of generating a faint object spectrograph in the 115 &#150; 350 nm UV range is also possible using this technology.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Other non-NASA applications include machine vision, industrial controls, safety, diagnostic/inspection systems. Deep UV imaging is of particular interest to semiconductor and scientific imaging markets.  UV imaging for LAr neutrino detectors is also being investigated as a scientific application.<BR><BR>An Innovation for Manufacturing:  The application of the proposed imager to machine vision has major implications for increased automation of inspection tasks that are critical for nanoscale manufacturing.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A flexible, lower cost approach to the rapid manufacture of high power electric propulsion components is desirable. Today's near-net fabrication technologies are extremely limited in terms of design flexibility due to reduction-based fabrication approaches. While modern additive manufacturing approaches show great promise, these still require significant development for use with higher temperature materials such as refractory metals. Considering this need for design flexibility as well as shorter development cycles, reduced costs, and minimized variance in making high power electric propulsion components, an innovative technology for rapid manufacturing that can be used with high temperature materials will be demonstrated in this work. Specifically, an additive manufacturing/metal injection molding manufacturing technology will be developed to produce a protoytpe article for a high power electric propulsion component made from a refractory alloy.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA Commercial Applications of this technology include launch, in-space and air-breathing propulsion system components, especially those requiring sophisticated internal passageways, made from high temperature materials such as refractory metals.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential Non-NASA Commercial Applications of this technology include military and commercial launch, in-space, and air-breathing propulsion system components, especially those requiring sophisticated internal passageways, made from high temperature materials such as refractory metals. Other possible applications are components and structures for power generation (industrial gas turbines and nuclear reactors), industrial pump and valve for corrosion resistance (petrochemical industry), and biomedical implants.

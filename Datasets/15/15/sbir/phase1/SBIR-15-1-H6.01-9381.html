		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Robotic systems in space carry a lower risk tolerance than robotic systems on earth. Humans require faster learning curves for introduction of more complex robotics in space, but the only way to accomplish this is to acquire open source software on easily adaptable hardware. This will enable astronauts to perform multiple design cycles while they are in space, such as on the ISS. Swift Engineering is proposing a lightweight surround visual and sensory feedback system for robotic pilots that can easily be transferable, and is modular and scalable to any robotic system. Using 360 degree cameras, LIDAR, and a Myo armband, the robotic pilot will be able to quickly adapt to any environment from anywhere, including mission control. The key is that all of this work is being built from open source platforms so that nothing becomes overly proprietary, and astronauts can perform design cycles in space quickly and efficiently.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Swift Engineering's solution to robotics development in space will provide astronauts with a surround sensory feedback system that can be modified to adapt to any challenge that is presented. The missions that are in NASA's technology roadmap that will benefit from this technology include collaborative manipulation of robotic arms in extreme environments. This technology will allow the robotic pilot to be stationed on Earth or inside a spacecraft and have a fully immersive experience while the robot is outside in space, on a foreign planet, or dealing with a hot/cold/caustic environment that humans cannot be exposed to. In addition, this technology opens up multiple doors for gesture control of devices such as scooping up dirt from a rover or grabbing items next to a spacecraft and moving it on-board the spacecraft.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Swift is interested in exploring robotic assistance inside autoclaves, freezers, cutting rooms, and on the factory floor. Swift would like to understand the impact that human assisted (and ultimately autonomous) robotic arms can have on the factory floor, but also investigate what problems can be solved when placed in environments that humans cannot withstand, such as autoclaves, ovens, and freezers. This will be completed while utilizing both hand layup composite processes and resin infusion processes (out-of-autoclave). A fully surround feedback system allows an engineer to remove material from the freezer while sitting at his desk, have it laid out on the cutting table, and subsequently cut. It also would allow modification of items placed inside an autoclave such as thermocouples and vacuum ports. This would save immense amounts of time for pre-preg composite lay-ups, which is directly transferrable to NASA and other terrestrial programs.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Solar array systems currently under development are focused on near-term missions with designs optimized for the 30-50 kW power range.  However, NASA has a vital interest in developing much larger solar arrays (up to 1 MW of power) for Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) missions.  Scaling to this size will require fundamental changes in many aspects of the solar array system design as embodied by NASA's Compact Telescoping Array (CTA) reference configuration.  To address this emerging need for larger scale practical solar array systems, and to evolve NASA's CTA design into a design that is practical to manufacture and flight qualify, Roccor proposes the mega-watt-class ROC-Array.  The ROC-Array is a CTA-derivative design that yields improved packaged volume and deployed frequency through a tension-stiffened hierarchical structure.<BR><BR>Exploiting structural hierarchy through the use of tension guy wire elements and next-generation deployable boom systems will afford an improved packaging efficiency, increased stiffness, and reduced mass.  Performance enhancements will be achieved by replacing the solid wall telescoping mast in the CTA reference design with a deployable tension-stiffened boom structure.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The value proposition for the proposed ROC-Array technology is to enable the next-generation of large-scale space deployable solar arrays with considerably higher performance (e.g., reduced mass, increased mechanical properties, increased packaging efficiency and increased scale-ability) at reduced system complexity and cost.  Of critical importance to NASA, the proposed technology could enable future space exploration missions in which Solar Electric Propulsion is a key element of mission design.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		While the proposed ROC-Array technology is tailored to best serve the needs of horizon missions for high-power NASA and military satellites, scaled versions of the proposed technology have broad applicability within the space deployables market. Specifically, the proposed technology could enable larger-scale systems that may otherwise not be achievable using conventional space deployable technologies, and scaled versions can bring value in reduced cost/complexity over competing designs for lower-power applications.

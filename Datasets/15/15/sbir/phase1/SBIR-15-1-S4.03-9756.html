		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		ASTS is pleased to propose to demonstrate the feasibility of using an aerospike nozzle to provide a dramatic increase in payload capability to the two-stage, all-solid-propulsion Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV).  The aerospike features a well-known altitude compensation capability, but the MAV operates in near-vacuum conditions so cannot take advantage of that aspect.  Instead, the aerospike nozzle, at a comparable ~200:1 area ratio as is currently baselined for MAV, will be considerably shorter than a traditional bell nozzle.  Thus, for a fixed motor length, a shorter aerospike nozzle will allow us to lengthen the motor case itself, thereby enabling us to load a substantial amount of additional propellant than the baseline.  The resultant improvement in propellant fraction will provide significantly higher payload performance compared to the baseline--our preliminary calculations show that up to 40% additional propellant can be added to the each motor.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The MAV is our primary technology insertion opportunity, but an aerospike nozzle, particular on solid rocket motors, is applicable to a wide variety of NASA propulsion systems.  Our ATK Elkton teammate, currently responsible for the MAV motor design, is also developing the pintle-controlled launch abort system (LAS) for the SLS program.  A pintle-controlled aerospike may provide a positive impact to the LAS design as well.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The U.S. missile defense shield could benefit greatly from our technology development.  Specifically, we have targeted the Missile Defense Agency's Common Kill Vehicle (CKV) program as our primary non-NASA technology insertion opportuniy.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR project aims to develop a helium recovery system based on high-performance proton exchange membranes (PEM).  The PEM will be fabricated based on Amsen's existing technology.  Membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) will be fabricated using the high-performance PEM.  The processing and interfacial microstructure of the MEA will be optimized to minimize electrode overpotentials.  Based on the optimized MEA, breadboard cells of the helium recovery system will be built and tested with pre-mixed helium/hydrogen mixtures in laboratory environment or relevant environment.  Performance of the new helium recovery system will be contrasted with a baseline system based on the commercial Nafion membranes.  The technology readiness level (TRL) by the end of Phase I is expected to be 4-5.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The outcome of the innovation has the potential of providing NASA with high-performance helium recovery system showing enhanced power efficiency, helium recovery production rate, and life span of the system.  Because of helium shortages and rising prices, cost-effective recovery and reclamation of helium from hydrogen/helium gas mixture is of great economical significance to NASA and to the nation.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology will find wide applications for helium recovery in many industrial sectors.

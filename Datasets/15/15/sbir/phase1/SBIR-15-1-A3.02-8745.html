		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		ASC has developed non-scanning 3D Flash LIDARTM imagers for UAS situational awareness and autonomous landing.  This sensing technology is the most advanced LIDAR technology available for UAV guidance and landing site determination.  ASC's array technology has allowed for compact LIDAR cameras that collect full frame 3D point clouds in a single FLASH (Flash LIDAR).  The 3D days will improve the mobility, efficiency and safety of air transportation systems.  ASC's Flash LIDAR is the LIDAR in the Autonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) for Morpheus.   The 3D Flash LIDAR captured the 3D data used in landing site selection and hazard avoidance during the Morpheus autonomous landing demonstrations.  <BR>ASC will use a miniaturized version, of the core 3D Flash LIDAR technology used for ALHAT, to develop an autonomous landing and hazard avoidance sensor for UAVs operating in national airspace.  The sensor will be capable of a number of autonomous navigation functions, but the Phase I effort will focus on demonstrating unique functions of the sensor.  The first demonstration will address safe Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operation in the first and last 50 ft under diverse weather conditions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced Scientific Concepts, Inc. (ASC) has been developing 3D Flash LIDAR for space applications.  The commercial versions of the sensor has be used in docking applications with the International Space Station (ISS) and space qualified versions are under development for the OSIRIS-REx asteroid rendezvous mission as well as the Commercial Crew Transport Capability (CCtCap). The Autonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) sensor used ASC's 3D Flash LIDAR for the autonomous landing demonstrations with Morpheous.  Potential NASA Applications include:<BR>-Airport Safety<BR>-UAV autonomous landing and collision avoidance<BR>-Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM)<BR>-Commercial Resupply (CRS) to the International Space Station<BR>-Commercial Crew Transport Capability (CCtCap) <BR>-Planetary Entry Decent & Landing and ALHAT<BR>-Rover Mobility and Navigation <BR>-Space Situational Awareness

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced Scientific Concepts, Inc. (ASC) has been developing 3D Flash LIDAR for many commercial applications for autonomous vehicles and collision avoidance. Commercial applications include collision avoidance to save pedestrians and prevent vehicle damage, Mid-Air Refueling, Surveillance, Terrain Mapping, Autonomous Navigation for unmanned ground, air and surface vehicles.  The 3D maps created by the system will be useful to avoid automobile accidents and guide robots for Hazard Material Detection and Handling.

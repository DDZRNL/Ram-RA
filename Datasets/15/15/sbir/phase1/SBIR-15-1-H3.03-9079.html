		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The efficient thermal control of vehicles is essential to the success of every single NASA mission. All vehicles have very tight requirements for the thermal control systems while simultaneously placing incredibly stringent demands upon them. These demands are getting even more intense given the shift towards variable heat rejection, which is essential in missions reaching beyond the lower earth orbit. Specifically, the thermal control fluid must maintain excellent thermal properties for heat rejection under peak conditions while at the same time remain liquid at extremely low temperatures down to -90 Celsius. Currently used fluids either do not meet the low temperature requirement (glycol/water mixture) or do not have thermal properties conducive to a compact, efficient system (Galden). Mainstream has identified several promising next generation thermal fluids using computation chemical techniques. In the Phase I, Mainstream will experimentally evaluate the thermal properties of promising single chemicals and chemical mixtures. These data will be used to determine the overall benefit to a thermal control system in terms of thermal performance and pumping power. In Phase II, Mainstream will perform more long term durability, compatibility and performance studies in a simulated test-loop representative of conditions encountered on NASA spacecraft.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This program will result in a fluid or family of fluids providing a significant benefit to NASA in enabling efficient variable heat rejection thermal control systems. The fluids will be formulated at Mainstream complete with any necessary additive packages to ensure stability, materials compatibility and safety. The commercial market for these fluids within NASA is immense and includes essentially every spacecraft which would require a single phase thermal control loop.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to an attractive market with NASA as a customer, these fluids will have far reaching effects in other commercial markets as well. These applications include freeze protection, process cooling, refrigeration coil defrosting and sub-ambient dehumidification.

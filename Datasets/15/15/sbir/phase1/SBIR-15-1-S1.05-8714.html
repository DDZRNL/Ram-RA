		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Twinleaf proposes to develop a compact, low power consumption, accurate and high precision magnetometer that can operate in both vector and scalar measurement modes. It will be self-calibrating, with 1 nT accuracy and 5 pT/sqrt(Hz) sensitivity. The magnetometer will be suitable for installation on spacecraft.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Magnetometers have a rich history of enabling discoveries in space. From studies of the Earth's magnetic field, and the paths of charged particles in it, to gathering information about the deep interiors of other planets with remote measurements, magnetic field sensors have been key to NASA missions for decades. Early work in atomic magnetometer development was driven by NASA requirements, and the opportunity remains today to drive progress towards more useful magnetic field sensors. These could be used in CubeSat or SmallSat heliophysics or Earth science missions, or in more distant magnetic field mapping endeavors.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Sensitive magnetometers are used in the petroleum and mining industries as well as infrastructure maintenance, harbor management, and pipeline management. Commercial applications for sensitive magnetometers include earthquake and volcanic eruption prediction, space and satellite measurements, space-based kHz-band radio telescopes, ionospheric fluctuations research, as well as magnetic surveys for geology, archeology, unexploded ordnance, and mineral and petroleum prospecting. Defense applications include monitoring and anti-submarine warfare. Security applications include explosives detection and identification.

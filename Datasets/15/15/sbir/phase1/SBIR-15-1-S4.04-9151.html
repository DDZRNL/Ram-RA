		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's Exploration road map contains an expanded portfolio of destinations including asteroids, comets, Phobos and Deimos, Titan, Ganymede, Mars and the Moon.  The environmental volatility of these locations is extreme, yet the fiscal challenges to explore these remote celestial landmarks suggests that traditional support systems and spacecraft architecture are not available and only through the development of more environmentally robust and survivable subsystems can these exploration goals be achieved. <BR><BR>Large temperature swings are commonplace in these environments and seeing extreme cold environments of -180 degrees C or beyond can be expected at the surface of asteroids, comets, the moon, and Titan.  While the objective is to gather science, NASA's spacecraft and probes need to have lightweight, compact, smart, radiation tolerant, motion control power electronics that enable scientific discovery and maximize the data returned during what are often very small windows of opportunity.       <BR><BR>The Dual Axis Controller for Extreme Environments (DACEE) addresses these challenges for future remote space exploration.  Leveraging almost a decade in the area of architecting low temperature operating electronics and mechanisms for programs like MUSES-CN and MSL's cold actuator electronics technology development program, Greg Levanas will design a dual brushless/stepper, 30V, 3A motor drive system inclusive of a RS-485 communication channel and capable of delivering moderate health status including onboard voltages, current and temperature.  By leveraging primarily 3.3V/5V CMOS 100krad tolerant elements, the DACEE will fit a compact form factor of approximately 2"x3"x0.5".  This system will be able to start up from cold soak at -180 degrees C and survive operation thru  +100 degrees C.<BR><BR>The Phase I activity will conclude with a design, parts list, build documentation and analysis for an article ready to be produced and tested as part of a Phase II activity.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The applications for the DACEE within NASA's exploration roadmap are numerous.  While each investigation has its own unique observation instrumentation needs, the operations contained within those instruments share commonality.  For operations which adjust lenses, open covers, pan and tilt, deploy hinges, etc., a stepper or brushless motion control drive capable of delivering between to 1-3 amps @ ~30V covers a broad spectrum of applications.  Coupled with the benefits of small form factor and low power means the DACEE can be mounted in or near the instrumentation itself simplifying system level interfacing and control needs.  With an expanded operational thermal range the DACEE preserves valuable spacecraft resources by not consuming excess power for heaters or requiring extra mass for protection.<BR><BR>The DACEE can operate on weather balloons where temperatures tend to become very cold and challenge typical electronic operational ranges.  The DACEE can also be operated in in-situ operations for instruments that may be deployed by future Mars rovers.  Again the small size is conducive for space station observatories that need to perform scanning and tracking operations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Outside of NASA's interest, creating a low power, small form factor dual axis controller is very attractive.  GEO communication satellites maintain a large number of control interfaces for the ever evolving complicated deployment schemes developed for extending antennas and supporting a variety of hosted payloads.  Some of the existing control systems are very outdated and the cost of maintaining legacy electronic systems is becoming increasingly expensive.  Providing a robust, rad tolerant, low power commercial control solution based upon the DACEE development could save manufacturers a reasonable amount of cost, power, and mass which could better be allocated for providing additional data services.

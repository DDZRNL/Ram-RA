		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Plasma Controls, LLC will develop hollow cathode electron sources based on a novel inorganic electron emitting material. Current state of the art cathodes include barium oxide based cathodes, which are susceptible to contamination, and lanthanum hexaboride cathodes, which must be operated at very high temperatures. In contrast, electride cathodes may provide equivalent emission to existing hollow cathode insert materials at lower working temperatures and lower powers, possibly extending cathode life and simplifying cathode construction and operation. In addition, a modified hollow cathode design will be used to facilitate rapid plasma ignition.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Hollow cathodes are used in electric propulsion devices, including ion and Hall thrusters, to sustain discharge plasmas and neutralize ion beams, and in plasma contacting devices to neutralize spacecraft charge. Both ultra-long-life and high-power cathodes are needed for ambitious deep space missions, and low-power cathodes for cube-sat missions. An electride hollow cathode has the potential to be both robust (chemically stable) and operate at low temperatures compared to existing long life cathode options.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Hollow cathode electron sources are commonly used as components of ion and plasma sources in materials processing applications, including ion etching and ion assisted film deposition. Electride based cathodes may also be advantageous electron sources in traveling wave tube amplifiers and gas/liquid/solid material analysis equipment.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Florida Turbine Technologies' (FTT) proposes an Additively Manufactured Modular Pump (AMMP) to provide a major leap forward in the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of combined Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies to dramatically reduce the cost, development lead time and subsequent deployment of a scalable, modular turbopump for rocket engine developers. This Phase I program will take the initial steps that will result in a test-ready, 10,000 pound thrust (10k) class LOX-Methane turbopump by the end of Phase II.  Not only will this design demonstrate the significant savings in cost and time that can be realized with AM technologies, the proposed concept is designed to be inherently throttleable, will demonstrate high speed, high margin impellers, eliminates many traditional sources of leakage, and operates with propellant lubricated bearings.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA application include all future and existing liquid propellant engine turbopump including those for boosters and upperstage engines.  Specifically the technology could be applied to a new upperstage engine for the new SLS Use Upperstage. Application of AM based turbopump designs developed as part of this SBIR will provide increased performance and reliability with reduced cost for future turbopumps.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications include not only all turbopumps for other agencies such as the Air Force (Next Generation EELV vehicles), DARPA (XS-1), etc., but all pumps used in industrial and commercial applications. The AM based design solutions identified for turbopumps can be leveraged into commercial pump applications with similar benefits of increased reliability and performance with reduced cost.

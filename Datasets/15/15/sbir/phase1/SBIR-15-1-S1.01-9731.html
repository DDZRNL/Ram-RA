		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to demonstrate a compact integrated laser module structure that addresses the requirements of the laser source in a water vapor differential absorption Lidar (DIAL) system.  Our approach, with the development of the high performance DBR laser diode and the engineering of miniature integration technology, will provide narrow line-width and high power laser modules for numerous Lidar applications with the advantages of reduced size, weight and power (SWaP). Under this Phase I SBIR program we would demonstrate the operation of the compact integration laser modules, both on an optical bench and in a miniature housing, with output line-width and power at desired levels. In the Phase II program, Photodigm will continue to build the laser modules into compact, hermetic packages to achieve high reliability and manufacturability. The laser modules will be further integrated with monolith or discrete master oscillator (MO) power amplifier (PA) designs suitable for the next-generation Lidar instruments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's primary application for the proposed compact integration laser module would be the deployment in the autonomous field DIAL sensor networks to map atmospheric water vapor with high spatial and temporal resolution. This application is well aligned with the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) instrument development program objective through the implement of smaller and more affordable DIAL transmitters. The compact integration technology applies to the full spectrum of the GaAs material based DBR lasers that Photodigm offers, leading to potential applications in sensing of ozone and other trace gasses. Follow-on development of the laser systems through rugged packaging and further integration of monolithic or discrete MOPA design shall enable the deployment of the DBR laser transmitters in numerous airborne and space-based platforms.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The miniature integrated laser module proposed would be the most compact and high power DBR laser with embedded optics available in the market. In addition to NASA's use in a number of LIDAR systems, a narrow line-width and high power laser module finds applications in various areas of spectroscopy, atomic physics, non-linear optics, and fiber amplifiers. The high spectral stability is desirable in applications resolving hyper-fine structures and applications demanding long coherent length. The size and weight reduction and fiber connection is suitable for handheld instrumentation. Photodigm recognizes the fastest commercial growth lies in gas sensing, aerospace metrology and medical tomography.

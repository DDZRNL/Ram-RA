		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is interested in Lidar technologies that will enhance the measurement of atmospheric and topographic parameters of the Earth, Mars, the Moon, and other planetary bodies. Compactness, efficiency, reliability, and long MTBF values are required in order for the instrument to be deployed on unconventional platforms such as balloon, small sat, CubeSat, and ground-based exploratory systems (rovers) as well as more conventional airborne and ground-based platforms. <BR><BR>The design and implementation of a coherent Lidar (for wind measurement) for airborne and particularly for spaced-based measurements is a balance between several opposing factors if it is to operate affectively on small, unmanned platforms, whether they are space-based or not. The system must be: <BR><BR>Compact &#150; in order to meet restrictive size and weight requirements<BR>Efficient &#150; limited power will be available for operation<BR>Reliable &#150; missions are expensive and time-consuming on a graduated    <BR>  level from manned airborne, to unmanned terrestrial, to space-based <BR>  platforms.<BR>Powerful &#150; high-energy performance will be required for long range <BR>  measurements.<BR>Eye-safe &#150; for many Earth observation missions<BR><BR>In order to meet these criteria Sibelloptics proposes a Phase 1 SBIR to perform a conceptual design of an adaptation of the Windimager ground-based system to a compact Lidar system for initial deployment on airborne platforms and eventual deployment on satellite systems and planetary rovers for future NASA missions. In addition, the output of the final fiber amplifier will be nearly doubled to a targeted energy (per pulse) of 600 mirco-Joule (at maximum pulsewidth) with a goal of 1 mJ.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal describes the Windimager's potential to detect and measure 3D winds, aerosol density and to perform range-finding on hard targets in anticipation of future NASA missions. Missions that would benefit from this work include:<BR><BR>3D Winds &#150; equipped with Doppler Lidar to study tropospheric winds for  <BR>   weather forecasting and pollution transport.<BR>Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons <BR>   (ASCENDS) &#150; multi-frequency laser (DiAL) will make global <BR>   atmospheric column CO2 measurements that are unaffected by diurnal, <BR>   seasonal, or latitudinal changes using laser remote sensing. <BR>Aerosol-Cloud-Ecosystems (ACE) &#150; equipped with backscatter Lidar to <BR>   study aerosol and cloud types and properties.<BR>Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation Lidar (GEDI) &#150; laser-based  <BR>   instrumentation to study a range of climates to understand changes <BR>   in natural carbon storage and climate variations.<BR>Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow On (GRACE-FO) &#150; will <BR>   require Laser ranging instrumentation.<BR>Lidar Surface Topography (LIST) &#150; Lidar instrument to measure land <BR>   surface topography

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The development work that would be performed during this effort has a wide range of commercial applications.<BR><BR>Wind Energy<BR>Lidar technology is gaining a great deal of momentum in the wind energy market as a means to assess potential wind farm sites, optimize the performance of current facilities, and to protect expensive wind turbines from damage. <BR><BR>Gas Leak Monitoring<BR>Detection and measurement of gas leaks from wells is critical to assuring proper and efficient operations. An airborne DiAL system equipped with wind measurement capability is the ideal tool for monitoring a large number of wells in a very short time. <BR><BR>Pollution Monitoring<BR>Countries with very serious air pollution problems are beginning to make devoted efforts to greatly reduce air pollution in major cities. Measurement of wind speed and direction is essential to the monitoring and tracking of all air-born pollutants.<BR><BR>Meteorology<BR>Environmental scientists have successfully used Lidar to accurately track the direction and dispersion of dust, particulate matter, and volcanic ash as well as typhoons over the Pacific Ocean.  <BR><BR>Emergency Services<BR>Wind speed and direction are among the most important environmental influences on large scle fires.  The ability to quickly deploy and reposition make a fiber Lidar an ideal firefighting tool.

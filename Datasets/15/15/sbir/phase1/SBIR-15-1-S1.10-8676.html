		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Topic S1.10 of  NASA 2015 SBIR solicitation calls for "Low current superconducting magnets (3-4 Tesla at temperatures > 15K". This proposal is a response to the technological challenge of design and manufacture of such superconducting magnets. Considering the inherent properties of high temperature superconductors (HTS), design and construction of multi-stage ADRs providing cooling from about 70K to less than 15K appears as feasible. If a multistage ADR system could reject its heat at about 30K or above, the approach of passive radiative cooling can come into serious consideration whereby mechanical cryocoolers can be totally removed from the overall cooling system. <BR>We propose to produce a comprehensive design and build a demo partially shielded 3 T HTS ADR magnet. In this project our technical objectives will be: <BR>1.	Maximizes the current density of HTS coils<BR>2.	Study and resolve quench protection and coil-to-coil quench propagation <BR>3.	Optimize the coil dimensions for maximum heat lift<BR>4.	Study the effect of the enclosing iron to find the optimum thickness of iron, and its location <BR>5.	Build and test a demo 3T HTS ADR magnet operating at 30-40 K

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to ADR systems, other NASA applications include efficient motors and generators, MHD propulsion, high precision sensors and actuators, electromagnetic launch, and magnetic resonance imaging in space.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The applications of superconducting coils manufactured with HTS tapes and operating at 30-40 K for NASA and other industries are numerous. Applications include efficient motors and generators, MHD propulsion, high precision sensors and actuators, electromagnetic launch, and magnetic resonance imaging in space. Larger efficient motors and generators may have applications in the power generation, and transmission industries. Applications in vehicle and appliance industries can be envisioned as this technology advances towards more powerful wires/cables that can operate at even higher temperatures with simpler and lighter cryocoolers.

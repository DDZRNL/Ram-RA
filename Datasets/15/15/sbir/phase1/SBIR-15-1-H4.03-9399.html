		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Extravehicular Activity (EVA) systems are critical to every foreseeable human exploration mission for in-space microgravity EVA and for planetary surface exploration. Innoflight proposes developing a Compact Wireless EVA Communications System (CWECS) as a replacement and advancement of the Space-to-Space EVA Mobility Unit (EMU) Radio (SSER).  <BR><BR>The CWECS goals are to: (a) provide backward-compatibility with the existing SSCS network and SSER; (b) provide enhanced communication between the EMU and space vehicle (or ISS or future space habitat) via 802.11n, including high-speed telemetry from the EMU to the spacecraft; and (c) provide personal area network (PAN) coverage for wireless biomed devices and sensors within the EMU.<BR><BR>The Phase I will leverage Innoflight's DeSCReeT IF-SDR, which uses cutting edge radiation-tolerant components as the foundation of a software-defined radio, and transform it into an integrated unit supporting SSCS, 802.11n and PAN.  The end result of the Phase I will be a system-level design for the CWECS that meets all SWaP, radiation and waveform requirements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The current SSER is provided by NASA as GFE.  To provide back-compatibility to EMU / EVA space suits efforts that use the GFE SSER Innoflight proposes build an SSER-compliant variant of CWECS.  This will enable consideration in upcoming EMU block upgrades for ISS operations, and using the ISS and the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) as enabling capabilities for a Mars surface mission.  Furthermore, for advanced EVA concepts, including the Exploration EVA, the CWECS will be repackaged into smaller form factor and weight.  Deep-space high-speed wireless capabilities will be of interest to the Jet Propulsion Laboratories (JPL) and their robotics efforts.  <BR><BR>The NASA SBIR program is ideal vehicle to provide cost savings and/ or cost avoidance for an EMU program overdue for innovation but with budget constraints that prohibit a large scale program to advance the space suit design.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Innoflight will work with JSC to understand the opportunities to pursue opportunities to offer EVA technologies to commercial spaceflight companies, such as Virgin Galactic, and international space agencies, such as ESA or JAXA.<BR><BR>Furthermore, deep-space high-speed wireless capabilities will be of interest for autonomous spacecraft.  Innoflight has experience with Air Force Research Laboratories, Space Vehicles (AFRL/RV), and Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), and Innoflight will pursue these customers interested in wireless network capabilities for fractionated and swarming spacecraft concepts.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Flight Works is proposing to expand its work in micro-gear-pumps for hypergolic and "green" propellants and team with Aerojet-Rocketdyne in order to develop and demonstrate a micropump for MON-25 and mono methyl hydrazine (MMH) bipropellant thrusters. MON-25, with 25% of nitric oxide (NO) and 75% nitrogen tetroxide (NTO, N2O4), allows lowering the oxidizer freezing point to -55 C, which is a close match to that of the fuel, MMH (which is around -51 C). While toxic, this propellant combination is hypergolic and allows operations over a wide range of temperatures, particularly in extremely cold environments as those envisioned for many future missions. <BR><BR>The introduction of a micropump in the propulsion system provides many benefits, including the elimination of the pressurization systems; lighter, cheaper, and conformal tanks; improved system packaging; removal of propellant cross-contamination in the pressurization system; and long term storage for extended duration missions (since the loss of helium is no longer a concern). <BR><BR>Under a Phase I SBIR, Flight Works Inc. is prepared to develop and characterize a micropump suitable for both MMH and MON-25, initially sized for 22-30 N (5-7 lbf) class thrusters with approximately 2.5 MPa (365 psi) inlet pressure, with the goal of demonstrating the technology with pump-fed MMH/MON-25 hot fire tests by the end of Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology offers the means of drastically reducing the mass, complexity and cost of space propulsion systems to be used in over a wider range of temperatures than what is currently available. The propellant combination MMH/MON-25 allows for an increased operational temperature range, decreasing it to close to -50 C. With the addition of a micropump also able to operate at these temperatures, the technology allows eliminating the propulsion pressurization system altogether and transform it into a low-pressure, low cost, more compact and lighter system while allowing compact, high performance thrusters. As such it has applications in any missions, manned or unmanned, with propulsion needs, particularly where it is desired to operate the propulsion system over a wider range of temperatures. These include cargo and crew capsules as well as most other spacecraft. The technology, while developed for MON-25 and MMH, could equivalently be applied to NTO which broadens even more the range of potential applications.<BR><BR>Flight Work's strategy is to work closely with other component manufacturers and system integrators during the development phases so as to seamlessly transfer the technology into operational products, at NASA or elsewhere.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology is applicable to propulsion systems in general, such as those on commercial spacecraft (e.g. telecommunications market), for DoD spacecraft and missiles including in Divert Attitude Control Systems, and to on-orbit propellant management.

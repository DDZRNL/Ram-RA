		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA seeks to develop technologies for aircraft drag reduction which contribute to improved aerodynamic efficiency in support of national goals for reducing fuel consumption, operating costs, and emissions. The most significant opportunity for efficiency improvement is the reduction of turbulent skin friction drag. NASA research into the microblowing technique (MBT) has been shown to reduce skin friction drag by 50 to 70 percent in subsonic flow and 80 to 90 percent in supersonic flow, which can translate into significant fuel savings. While small-scale wind tunnel testing has been performed to prove the potential benefits of the MBT, additional research is required to develop a complete understanding of boundary layer dynamics, conduct large-scale experiments, and estimate system weight, efficiency, and cost impacts of implementing the MBT on an actual aircraft. Cornerstone Research Group, Inc. (CRG) will address these challenges and mature the MBT with the goal of significantly reducing skin friction drag for aircraft at both high subsonic (0.7 < M < 0.9) and low supersonic speeds (M <  3).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Supporting NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) and the Fundamental Aeronautics Program, this project's technologies directly address requirements for materials and structures technologies contributing towards aircraft aerodynamic efficiency. These requirements fall within NASA's strategic goals to reduce the impact of aircraft on the environment.  The MBT offers the potential for significant fuel savings and reduced emissions for commercial and DoD aircraft operating in both subsonic and supersonic flight regimes.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This project's technologies, developed for NASA systems, would directly apply to systems operated by other government and commercial enterprises.<BR>Government systems that would derive the same benefits would include aircraft operated by the Air Force. Initially, implementation into transport aircraft such as the C-17 Globemaster III and tanker aircraft will provide the Air Force with the greatest opportunity for fuel savings, as these systems consume the majority of the fuel used by the Air Force. In addition, implementation would be the most similar on these aircraft as integration on commercial aircraft.  The technology could also be used on future tactical, bomber, and reconnaissance platforms to extend range or increase payload weight fraction.<BR>This technology's attributes for reduced aircraft fuel consumption through turbulent skin friction drag reduction should yield a high potential for private sector commercialization for passenger and cargo aircraft. In addition, the MBT may apply to wind turbines, automobiles, and marine vehicles to improve energy efficiency.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this proposal, AlphaSense details the development of a novel laser ultrasound visualization system non-destructive evaluations of composite aircraft structures. The key innovations of this proposal include the following: a) Defect detection and identifications based on direct visualizations of the ultrasound propagation characteristics in the testing articles, b) The application of laser generated ultrasound signals for damage detection and structural integrity evaluations, and c) The implementation of a fully integrated and self-contained portable sensor system. With such innovations, the merits of the proposed sensor and its advantages over other techniques are listed below: a) Compact, lightweight, and portable, b) Capable of detecting a wide variety of defects, c) Compatible with complex shapes and configurations, d) High sensitivity and good spatial resolution, e) High measurement throughput, and f) Easy and safe to the operators.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		used in various NASA aeronautical test facilities to collect the needed structure integrity information to safely expand the flight and test envelops of various aerospace vehicles and components.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Military market sector: used by military overhaul facilities and maintenance depots for defect detection and structural integrity evaluations.<BR> Commercial market sectors:  used in the automobile, aerospace, heavy machinery, power and construction industries for defect detection and structural integrity evaluations.

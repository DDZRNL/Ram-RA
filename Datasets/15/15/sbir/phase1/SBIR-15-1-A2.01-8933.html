		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this program, we are proposing to develop a key optical element that is of interest for enabling next generation of miniaturized, low-cost NASA's FOSS interrogator systems. Through innovative photonic integration of key functions, the size and cost of the existing system will be reduced by an order of magnitude. This, in turn, will fulfill one of the key requirements of the solicitation, yielding a miniaturized fiber optic measurement system with low power suitable for migration to into platforms spanning from rockets, to small business class jets or UAS platforms.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA seeks advanced Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) sensor systems with advanced processing and displays to provide reliable assessments of the location and severity for large, complex structures. The use of composites in aircraft manufacturing is growing dramatically. The assessment of structural integrity of composite materials after automated manufacturing becomes vitally important for the safety of the aircraft and its crew members. Conventional NDE methods, e.g., ultrasonic C-scan and tap test, use point-by-point scan scheme, which is labor intensive and time consuming. New NDE sensor systems that can quickly scan defects in large, complex composite structures are highly desirable.To address this critical need, X-wave Innovations, Inc. (XII), teaming up with Prof. Fuh-Gwo Yuan at North Carolina State University (NCSU) proposes to develop an innovative Automated Ultrasonic Imaging Technique system, which is called AUIT system, for rapid inspection of large-area complex composites. In Phase I we will prototype an AUIT system and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technique. In Phase II, we will focus on refining the prototype system design and development with improved hardware and software. In Phase III, we will focus on transitioning the AUIT technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has been of great interest in various nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and/or structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques to detect damage in vehicle structures and airframe components. NASA is specifically interested in the areas of NDE/SHM sensor development, data/information processing, prognostic algorithm development, and integration of diagnosis and prognosis, which can improve safety and lower the life cycle costs of assembly, test, integration and processing of the ground and flight assets at our nation's spaceports and propulsion test facilities. The technology developed in this effort will directly benefit NASA's Vehicle Systems Safety Technologies (VSST) Program.  This low cost, light weight, highly automated and reliable NDE system that can provide rapid detection and imaging of various defects (such as cracks, corrosion, delamination and disbond) and damages (e.g., fiber breakage and impact damages) for various complex structures and bonded assemblies should be extremely valuable to advanced mechanical components and systems. This new NDE system could significantly extend an aircraft's service life, reduce maintenance costs, and protect platforms' and crews' safety.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed NDE system has many market applications in different industries such as the air and space, defense and energy sectors. Other government agency, including DOD, DOE, DOT, etc, and commercial sectors will benefit from this technology. NDE and SHM technologies are constantly being sought for age-related degradation in complex materials and structures. Innovative and novel approaches to using NDE/SHM technologies to measure properties related to manufacturing defects, flaws, fiber buckling and breakage, etc. in complex composite material systems, adhesively bonded/built-up and/or polymer-matrix composite sandwich structures are of particular interest in many industries.  The AUIT system can be readily extended to inspect the bridges, nuclear power plants, pipelines, machines with adapted frequency ranges of excitation signals.

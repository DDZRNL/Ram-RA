		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Innovation Laboratory, Inc., proposes to build a tool to estimate airline costs under TBO. This tool includes a cost model that<BR>explicitly reasons about traffic demand and weather conditions in the<BR>National Airspace System (NAS), mathematical models for weather<BR>translation and ATM-impact, line of flight impacts of delay propagation,<BR>large quantities of historical NAS and airline data ("Big Data"), and fixed and variable cost accounting.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA can use this cost estimation tool to address the cost/benefits of TBO.  Also, it can be linked to traffic flow management (TFM) optimization algorithms to assess the costs to airlines of TFM strategies.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Many forms of government and industry must work together in NextGen investments. Our cost models transform historical and current<BR>weather data into ATM impacts for the purpose of cost estimation.<BR>Additionally, airline customers can use our cost estimation models to make informed decisions on the routing, diversion, or cancellation of flights.

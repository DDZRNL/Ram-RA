		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		S. D. Miller and Associates proposes to investigate a new class of thermal insulations that will enable thermal protection systems (TPS) on ceramic matrix composite (CMC) hot structures and Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerators (HIAD).  One insulation will embed silicon carbide aerogel in silicon carbide fibers to create a super-efficient, flexible insulation optimized for use at temperatures of 3500F and pressures >10 Torr.  Another will demonstrate a lightweight, load bearing insulation that has borosilicate microballoons embedded in a borosilicate fiber matrix.  The research team has prior experience developing a family of thermal insulations that have opacifiers embedded in a flexible fiber matrix.  Testing has proven that these opacified fibrous insulations (OFI) are twice as efficient as unopacified insulations at temperatures >2000F and pressures <10 Torr.  The proposed work will build on that proven concept by developing super-efficient, flexible insulations with aerogels, intumescents and microballoons embedded in silicon carbide, zirconia and silica fiber matrices.  This will significantly reduce the weight of TPS on future NASA missions, reducing the cost of missions to Mars and other planets.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Research at NASA by Walker et al. "Preliminary Development of a Multifunctional Hot Structure Heat Shield" indicates that the TPS on the SpaceX Dragon could be reduced by 151 lbs. if super-efficient flexible blanket insulations are used in combination with a CMC hot structure.  It is predicted that weight savings could be even greater on Mars entry vehicles, depending on the size of the vehicle and the entry trajectory.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Army, Air Force and DARPA have strong interest in long range, high speed vehicles.  The proposed class of insulations will make those vehicles more efficient, more reliable and more effective.  The methods of making these materials are expected to be lower than some less effective alternate materials, which may enable industrial applications in oil refineries and automobiles.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Human exploration requires new technologies for advanced in-space propulsion systems. Improvements in cryogenic propellant storage are a critical need. NASA's Technology Roadmaps call "Zero Boil Off storage of cryogenic propellants for long duration missions" the #2 technical challenge for future NASA missions.  <BR><BR>Quest Thermal has developed several innovative, advanced thermal insulation systems, offering high performance for specific applications such as on-orbit (IMLI), in-air (LRMLI) or launch ascent (Launch Vehicle MLI). Quest Thermal proposes to design and develop an innovative, multifunctional thermal insulation system for cryogenic propellants on launch vehicles operating during launch ascent, while on-orbit and when in-air/on-Mars surface. Launch Vehicle &#150; Load Responsive MLI (LV-LRMLI) should provide unique properties, including ability to withstand direct exposure to aerodynamic free stream during ascent, high performance in-Mars atmosphere and very high performance in-space/on-orbit.<BR>A novel system integrating durable Launch Vehicle outer layers (for high performance on-orbit) with Load Responsive inner layers (for high performance in-Earth atmosphere and on-Mars), could withstand launch profiles and achieve both 0.5 W/m2 on-orbit and 5 W/m2 on-Mars surface performance goals.  <BR><BR>LV-LRMLI Phase I would review aerodynamic and aerothermal data and determine requirements. Structural/thermal modeling and analysis of LV-LRMLI will be done. Test fixtures will be designed and built that simulate launch loads. LV-LRMLI prototypes will be fabricated and tested with simulated aerodynamic loads and heat flux measured.  This Phase I program would model, design, build and test a prototype LV-LRMLI system, validating aerodynamic durability and high thermal performance both on-orbit and in-Mars atmosphere, and demonstrating feasibility.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has a high priority need for a lightweight, multifunctional cryogenic insulation system (including attachment methods) that can survive exposure to the free stream during the launch/ascent environment in addition to high performance less than 0.5 W/m2 on orbit or <5 W/m2 on Mars surface (with a warm boundary of 220 K).<BR><BR>Improved cryogenic insulation for launch vehicles, that can withstand direct exposure to the free stream during launch ascent, and can provide higher thermal performance to reduce boiloff losses of cryogenic propellants, is both an immediate need for current launch vehicles (e.g., Atlas and Delta) as well as a future need for new launch vehicles (Space Launch System) and cryogen storage for In Situ Resource Utilization derived cryogens produced on Mars.<BR><BR>The novel Launch Vehicle &#150; Load Responsive MLI (LV-LRMLI) insulation system proposed here might offer durability to the free stream, SOFI replacement, high thermal performance in-air prelaunch, high performance in-Mars atmosphere, and very high thermal performance in-space/on-orbit.<BR><BR>LV-LRMLI could help meet cryogenic fluid management goals, reducing propellant boiloff and enhancing the capabilities of current space transportation systems as well as future systems (LH2 storage for SLS for chemical propulsion for future Nuclear Thermal Propulsion vehicles), and insulation for future ISRU derived fuel storage.

		<BR>
		Ball Aerospace & Quest are discussing with Boeing & ULA application of advanced insulation on their launch vehicles, including using Cellular Load Responsive MLI or Vacuum Cellular MLI for SLS. ULA is interested in development of LVMLI for use on the Delta cryogenic second stage, a reduction in LH2 boil off in half is needed for certain missions.  LVMLI needs technology maturation before implementation and integration into ULA platforms.<BR><BR>Boeing, Ball and Quest are discussing using Load Responsive MLI to insulate Boeing's Phantom Eye LH2 fueled vehicle, and to insulate LNG fuel tanks for aircraft.<BR><BR>LV-LRMLI could significantly improve upper stage insulation, reducing cryopropellant boiloff losses and increasing payload capacity for commercial missions with long coast times.  A high performance insulation to replace SOFI would be of interest to Prime contractors, enabling improved performance for Atlas Centaur, Delta and SLS cryogenic upper stages.<BR><BR>Advanced insulation technology for space cryogenic applications has relevance to terrestrial commercial/industrial applications.  Reducing thermal conductivity and heat leak could have significant impact on commercial and home appliances, dramatically reducing energy use for high energy efficiency. One early focus market is refrigerator-freezers, where Quest Superinsulation could provide novel design concepts such as thin walls allowing a fresh design and look; increased interior space; and much lower energy usage.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Radiation shielding materials are necessary for protecting astronaut crews from the hazards of space radiation during future NASA missions.  Although polyethylene based materials and composites are attractive for radiation shielding due to high hydrogen content, the poor thermal performance has limited its use as a "parasitic", nonstructural material.  Further impeding use of this material is its inherent flammability.  Accordingly, thermally stable structural materials having low flammability combined with radiation shielding are necessary for the development of next generation aerospace structures and vehicles.  It would be further desirable that the non-parasitic material has excellent damage tolerance to mitigate impact events in operation.  Applied Poleramic, Inc. proposes to develop a new generation of structural high hydrogen content matrix materials which will be combined with an interlayer modification approach to result in fiber reinforced composite materials having enhanced radiation shielding combined with excellent damage tolerance and improved flammability resistance.  This will be achieved through development of high hydrogen content bismaleimide resins followed by fabricating carbon fiber composites having nuclear grade boron carbide or boron nitride micro-particles in the interlayer region.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Composite materials having enhanced radiation shielding and multifunctional characteristics can provide design advantages for future spacecraft, large space structures, space stations, orbiters, landers, rovers, and habitats.  Some vehicles include the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCW) and future Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicles (MMSEV).  The developed technology may also find use for radiation shielding of cargo transportation vehicles and unmanned space vehicles to protect sensitive electronics and instruments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications come from NASA funded crew and cargo space transportation partners including Dragon, SpaceX, Dream Chaser, Sierra Nevada Corporation, Crew Space Transportation-(CST)100, The Boeing Company, Crew Transportation System, Blue Origin, and Cygnus, Orbital Sciences Corporation.  Other applications may be found in DOD applications involving high altitude reconnaissance aircraft, satellites, and other aerospace vehicles.  Other commercial applications could be found in commercial satellites and manned and unmanned aircraft to protect sensitive electronic equipment and instruments.

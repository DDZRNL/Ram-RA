		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal is responsive to NASA SBIR Subtopic S1.02: Microwave Technologies for Remote Sensing, specifically the interest in frequency multipliers that can work in the 200-400GHz range (output frequency) with better than 30% efficiency and input powers up to 1W. <BR>VDI will employ three specific innovations to achieve the power and efficiency goals described in the solicitation.<BR>1)	Optimization of the use of diamond heat spreaders to achieve improved thermal management and therefore lower diode operating temperatures. <BR>2)	Development of a practical method of four-way, in-phase power combining within the multiplier housing.<BR>3)	The use of active biasing technology to ensure that the diodes are automatically at their optimal bias point even as the source frequency is rapidly tuned across the operating band. <BR>Additionally a prototype amplifier-multiplier chain will be delivered to NASA JPL, demonstrating the feasibility of these innovations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Heterodyne receivers have been demonstrated to frequencies as high a 4.7THz. These are generally used for radio astronomy from airborne or space platforms. A specific requirement for these systems is the local oscillator sources used to pump the frequency mixer. A present goal is the development of array receivers, which greatly increase the data collecting capabilities of observatories, but also require more power than can be generated with present solid-state sources. The development of higher power sources in the frequency range around 300GHz is a critical step that is required to enable the development of array receivers for astronomy in the terahertz band.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA commercial applications include the NMR-DNP and EPR measurements for chemistry and high power sources for reflectometry measurements for plasma diagnostic systems for nuclear fusion experiments. More commercially, higher power solid-state sources can be used in imaging systems; for portal security, collision avoidance radars, fire-fighting, and industrial process control and monitoring. Higher power sources in this frequency band are a critical step in achieving a technology that will allow the full use of the terahertz frequency range for scientific, defense, security and industrial applications.

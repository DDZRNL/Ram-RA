		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal is submitted to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of processing the space environment stable, multifunctional thermal control material system (TCMS) that can be applied to space hardware and can enables the hardware to carry higher leakage current through engineering the high electrical conductivity at affordable costs. An innovative efforts for the space environmental stable TCMS is suggested for leveraging IR&D at AMSENG for the multifunctional, low (?S/?T) material systems that can meet these aggressive goals in cost reductions in reliable manner. The suggested efforts emphasize developments in two material science areas: the first one considers the development of intercalated  boron nitride nano structure that includes nanotubes and nano mesh and the second area proposes the synthesis and processing of various compounds with proton and electron conductivity along with its plasma sprayable versions. The material system that integrates these technology aspects can allow higher leakage currents at affordable costs. Thus the envisioned affordable material systems can provide the needed reliable TCMS in typical space environments in (LEO), (GEO) & beyond. The reliability goal for the multifunctional conductive TCMS is to have a design life of > 10 years in LEO and > 15 years in GEO, and we anticipate the developments to mature by end of phase II ready for the hardware demonstration.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The success in the proposed developments will contribute uniquely to the survivable material systems. The NASA Science missions that can benefit from its applications are the missions that need the affordable conductive TCMS coatings: JUNO, MAVEN, GOES-R, LADEE, GRAIL, JPSS, & SAA as well as the unique planned Missions for nano satellites and small satellites. The testing innovation will have unique returns on risk reduction for the missions at lower costs

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The DOD & commercial industry has plans for several satellites for the communication activities, and need to overcome the technology gap for the conductive TCMS with high leakage currents. The TCMS that provides space stability, flexibility & affordability still demands innovations. These platform hardware can also benefit form the fulfillment of this technology gap

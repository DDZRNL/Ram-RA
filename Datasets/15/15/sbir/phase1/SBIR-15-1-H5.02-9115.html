		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase I SBIR contract will apply the principles of integrated materials computational engineering the the design and fabrication of a integral thermal protection system cyrogenic storage tank.  ANSYS modelling will be carried out to sub-optimize the materials properties necessary for an integrated structure-insulation-thermal protection system using miltilayered thermally insulating syntactic foams core structure.   By combining structural and insulation performance in a high temperature structure, a 65-100% reduction in parasitic thermal protection weight can be achieved.  multilayer sandwich panel coupons will be fabricated and characterized for cryogenic to high temperature properties and thermal cycle response to validate the model, and manufacturing pathfinding efforts will be conducted for production of curved multilayered sandwich panels. structures.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The development of an integral structural-insulation-TPS cryotank can reduce parasitic insulation requirements by early 10,000 lbs for a shuttle tank equivalent for future launch vehicle systems.  The addition of validated ICME for closed cell foam-core multilayer structures can speed insertion of multifunctional hot structures for a variety of applications, ranging from hypersonic acreage structures to low boil-off cryotanks and dry bay structures.  Integrating structural cryogenic insulation into a sandwich panel construction can be enabling for zero boil-off storage systems for interplanetary missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Improved cryogenic structures, including structural cryogenic insulation can reduce the cost of commercial space launch services.  reducing heat losses in low and high temperature storage and piping systems can result in improved economics and safety for liquified natural gas (both large scale and transportation tanks), and improved geothermal and offshore energy pipelines.

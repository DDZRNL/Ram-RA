		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In recent work for the Air Force, Ultramet demonstrated nearly one thousand restarts with repeatable pulse performance and steady-state burn characteristics using AF-M315E monopropellant and a novel ignition system. Based on the results of that project, Ultramet received a Rapid Innovation Fund (RIF) award from the Air Force to further develop the technology into a flightweight system, including qualification testing of a 22-N AF-M315E thruster by Moog-ISP to bring the technology to TRL 8. Leveraging the previous and ongoing Air Force work, the proposed NASA project will scale the igniter and thruster technology to enable sizing of propulsive capability to a level appropriate for secondary payload satellites, i.e., 1-N and 5-N green monopropellant engines. In Phase I, Ultramet will design and fabricate a 5-N AF-M315E thruster and igniter and hot-fire test it at Pennsylvania State University. Phase II will further miniaturize the thruster and igniter to the 1-N level and bring the technology to TRL 8. Potential Phase II teaming partners include propulsion system integrator Moog-ISP, satellite integrator Ball Aerospace, and Aerospace Corporation for technical oversight.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology will eliminate the catalyst degradation and washout issues plaguing AF-M315E catalysts, make hydrazine systems more robust, and/or simplify ignition/restart of non-hypergolic propellants. Potential applications will be numerous as it will enable use of advanced monopropellants that offer performance beyond that of monopropellant hydrazine and bipropellant NTO/MMH. The ignition system can be used in attitude control and apogee engines on NASA spacecraft. Potential NASA applications for the foam igniter system include orbit transfer, maneuvering, station keeping, and attitude control for satellites. Any satellite employing hydrazine propulsion will benefit. Promising near-term applications are attitude control systems for planetary spacecraft. The thermal igniter can be used with any monopropellant including hydrazine, thereby removing concerns over catalyst life and inability for cold starts. The technology can be used in virtually any NASA flight mission because the igniters can be used with hydrazine or higher performance advanced monopropellants (e.g. ADN and AF-M315). Using AF-M315 monopropellant can increase specific impulse relative to hydrazine and deliver higher performance, reduce cost, and increase flexibility beyond that of NTO/MMH.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed ignition system can be used in attitude control and apogee engines for commercial and government satellites and divert and attitude control system engines for kinetic kill vehicles. The use of toxic propellants such as hydrazine will be eliminated in gas generators on military aircraft and fuel pressurization systems for tactical missiles. Because such a fast ramp rate and high ultimate temperature can be achieved, it may also be applicable to use in divert and attitude control systems for kinetic kill vehicles and other missile defense systems. Potential military space applications for the foam igniter system are orbit transfer, maneuvering, station keeping, and attitude control for satellites. Any agency with satellites employing hydrazine propulsion will benefit. Promising near-term defense applications are divert and attitude control systems for kinetic energy interceptors and gas generators for auxiliary power units and tank pressurization systems.

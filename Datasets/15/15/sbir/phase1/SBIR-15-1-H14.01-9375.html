		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed innovation aims at using Electrical Capacitance Volume Tomography sensors (ECVT) for decomposing components of a multi-phase flow into separate phases, electronically. Here, each phase would be imaged and measured independently for accurate assessment of phase boundaries, phase velocity, and phase hold-up or distribution. This innovation is based on exploiting the dependence of electric properties of several materials on excitation frequency at which electrical capacitance is measured. Dielectric and conductivity values of liquids often undergo changes as the excitation frequency used in acquiring capacitance values is changed. For example, previous studies quantified the change in dielectric constant and dielectric loss of aqueous liquids, including de-ionized water, under different frequencies. Their findings show that such liquids often undergo significant changes in electrical properties with varying excitation frequencies. Typically, ECVT sensors are excited at frequencies in that range of tens of Khz to tens of Mh. At those frequency ranges, the electric properties of materials, especially those that contain water in multi-phase flow mixture, undergo significant changes.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The first potential targeted application of this proposal is its transition to NASA applications that already apply ECVT for imaging multi-phase flows, and are actively seeking increased resolution and capabilities with respect to the current state of the art. Particularly, the Packed Bed Reactor Experiment (PBRE) project and the Two Phase Separator Experiment (TPSE) project will be the first immediate applications. Both of those applications involve requiring advanced flow visualization techniques that can be used in the International Space Station. They both have also used ECVT technology in ground testing's. Moreover, ECVT technology can be extended to other potential applications in combustion or life science. ECVT exhibits favorable features of low power consumption, light weight, high imaging speed, and safety. Once the proposed innovation is developed, it will be feasible to extend the developed sensing method to new frontiers. This is possible due also to the flexible and non-invasive nature of capacitance senors.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The multi-phase decomposition system for multi-phase flow reactors can be applied to energy systems that rely on 3-phase interactions. Specifically, the Oil industry relies heavily on 3-phase reactors and is actively seeking advanced instrumentation that can address this application. The competitive advantage of our product is that it will help control advanced refineries and biofuel reactors by providing real-time readings of gas, liquid, and solid circulation rates based on detecting 3-phase concentrations and their velocities in obscure and hard to reach locations of the reactor. This will help reactor operators optimize operations for higher efficiencies and better control of emissions. Our competitive advantage is achieved by implementing novel multi-phase separation technique that enables addressing each phase in the flow system individually using ECVT sensors, for the first time.<BR>Our cold flow ECVT has been adopted globally. The system is currently operating in Australia, India, and Japan. We anticipate multi-phase decomposition system to have more potential in terms of global sales. Phase decomposition based on ECVT provides an industrial instrumentation that can be deployed in the field, not just in laboratories.

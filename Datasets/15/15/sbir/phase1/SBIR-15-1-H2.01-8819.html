		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Special Aerospace Services (SAS) is proposing a new and innovative ascent/descent engine using methane as its propellant. This engine will utilize the concepts of the Oxidizer Rich Staged Combustion (ORSC) cycle of the RD-8 to improve on performance over existing hardware. This SBIR program will leverage existing work SAS has done in conjunction with DARPA to on the RD-8 preburner to design and analyze a new engine with the benefits of the RD-8, but being able to use methane as the propellant. Additive manufacturing will be used to build the components of the engine to reduce cost and limitations in design.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has the opportunity to support the development of an ascent/descent methane engine for use in exploration missions that will greatly expand the capability for the agency. Opportunities for NASA include small autonomous and rendezvous space tug engine for orbital debris removal, Mars sample ascent and descent engine, micro-lander applications, and other interplanetary missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications include research by DARPA and other government agencies such as the U.S. Air Force. Interests may include providing an upper stage for Super Strypi, or as an application with DARPA's ALASA program. Additional Non-NASA commercial applications include micro-lander applications, orbit debris removal systems, and exploratory interplanetary missions.

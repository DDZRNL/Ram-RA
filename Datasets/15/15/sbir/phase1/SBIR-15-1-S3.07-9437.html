		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The innovation proposed is the unification of existing and operational high fidelity simulation software tools into an integrated framework with which to predict aero-heating, ablation, thermal response, and structural integrity for re-entry vehicles (RV) under a full range of trajectory conditions from rarefied to continuum.  Virtually all software components necessary to achieve this goal are available within the CRAFT Tech suite of simulation tools which have a range of modern day capabilities and features.  Many of the capabilities have already been directly applied to reentry flows, such as ablation and regression modeling, transition to turbulence modeling, advanced chemistry and ionization modeling, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium modeling, and a hybrid coupled continuum-rarefied simulation framework for steady and unsteady flows.  Other features, such as aero/thermo/structural coupling, also exist but have not been directly applied to reentry type flows so the Phase I effort will demonstrate them in both the rarefied and continuum regimes.  Our hybrid continuum-rarefied framework presently contains only information exchange from continuum to rarefied regions.  For reentry applications, especially for non-traditionally shaped vehicles, this assumption is no longer valid, so a proposed developmental task will implement a rarefied to continuum information exchange within our existing hybrid continuum-rarefied solver framework.  Finally, a plan of action for the Phase II effort will be elaborated to define a common Application Program Interface to couple the various existing components, including software packages outside the CRAFT Tech toolset, into a single unified framework.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA applications include the design and analysis of any reentry vehicle technology.  The generalized nature of the proposed toolset means it is not restricted to Earth based reentry but can include any other planetary systems for which atmospheric characteristics can be defined.  Although a significant amount of toolsets exist for reentry prediction, what our method will provide is a unified framework based on high-fidelity, first-principle numerical analysis.  Our current high-fidelity numerical tools for reentry will be integrated in an uncompromising manner using an Executive Controller to allow for the analysis of more generalized conditions, whether they be flowfield related, such as mixed continuum-rarefied flows, or geometry related, such as non-traditionally shaped reentry vehicles.  Since each component is already based on a parallelized framework, the final unified toolset will also be highly parallelized and can take advantage of the new parallel hardware paradigms, such as Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) usage for which some of our tools have been ported.  In addition, since the final toolset will be based on an Executive Controller utilizing an Application Program Interfaces (API) approach, the ability to link any existing software package is also possible.  So either existing or future NASA tools could potentially be used in-lieu of those already proposed.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		CRAFT Tech currently licenses its commercial software CRUNCH CFD to various organizations outside of NASA including the commercial pump community and liquid rocket propulsion entities.  We also support design optimization efforts of large scale industrial systems.  We have a partnership with the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, with approval from the U.S. State Dept via a Technical Assistance Agreement, to develop software tools to support critical design analysis, especially for cryogenic pump systems and reentry analysis.  Related to the present effort, we are developing tools to predict HTV reentry trajectories and vehicle integrity using our hybrid methodologies in order to reduce the safety zone for splashdown and thus reduce costs associated with securing a large safety zone.  Our hybrid continuum-rarefied simulation tools are also utilized by International Launch Systems to perform critical component integration analysis during payload separation maneuvers.  Our tools are also being used for design at Blue Origin while interest in many of our programs has come from SpaceX.  Through the proposed effort, we foresee a tremendous potential in our simulations products to further strengthen these ties and make new ones, especially considering the current proposed efforts by SpaceX to recover as many components for re-use as possible requiring reentry analysis of non-traditionally shaped vehicles.

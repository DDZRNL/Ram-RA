		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Conventional solar cells are limited in efficiency, require heavy weight for high power applications, and tend to degrade rapidly in the harsh radiation environment in space. nVizix LLC proposes to demonstrate a novel concept for high-efficiency solar cells (patent pending), based on the phenomenon of vacuum photoemission (with thermionic enhancement). Recent advances in the technology of optical detectors for high-energy physics (such as photomultiplier tubes), together with manufacturing techniques for flat-panel displays, have enabled a breakthrough in microfabricated solar cell arrays that are broadband and highly efficient, extremely lightweight, as well as extremely resistant to radiation damage and degradation with time. Efficiencies up to 50% are expected (80% theoretical) for space-based solar power. A prototype array of solar panels is proposed, consisting of 8 panels, each the size of a 3U nanosatellite (10 cm x 30 cm). Such an array would provide 150 W of power, while weighing only 100 grams, and being easily stowed, before deployment, inside a small portion of the 3U package. Phase I will demonstrate efficiency and low weight in a small research-scale cell, and project a deployable design for a 120 W array. Phase II will fabricate a prototype array and demonstrate performance at an appropriate NASA laboratory.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The nVizix solar cell array could revolutionize applications of solar cells. The radiation-hardness combined with flexibility, high efficiency, low weight, and long lifetime will enable widespread NASA ground and space-based applications. Every mission will see its lifetime extended, eliminate the sensitivity to radiation of the power generating solar panels, and significantly enhance energy efficiency.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The learning curve associated with cost-efficient manufacturing should lead to mass production of solar panels for a wide variety of energy conversion applications on earth and on mobile systems (including aircraft), especially where space is at a premium. Applications range from handheld devices (mobile phones), wearables (smart watches), automotive (hybrid and electric solar-powered cars), to the standard rooftop and solar farm applications. Platforms heretofore not practical because of low efficiency (such as solar powered smart phones and solar cars) will be enabled.

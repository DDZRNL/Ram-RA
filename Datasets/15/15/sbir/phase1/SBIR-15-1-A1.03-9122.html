		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A design iteration of ESAero's ECO-150 split wing turboelectric distributed propulsion (TeDP) concept is proposed to incorporate recent lessons learned in synergistic configuration opportunities, propulsion and thermal management system research and tool development, and aeropropulsive benefits reported by Lockheed Martin. Non-cryogenic and cryogenic/superconducting components will be included in three separate propulsion system architectures: one cooled via conventional "warm" coolant, one cryogenically cooled with a cryocooler system, and one cryogenically cooled with a liquid hydrogen blow-down system. The effort will begin with an interagency collaborative "Brainernet" brainstorming session to identify and assess technology and concept drivers and opportunities. Detailed configuration, aerodynamics, performance, and mission analysis will complement the effort, culminating in three flagship TeDP or hybrid electric distributed propulsion (HEDP) concepts which embody the propulsion-airframe-thermal integration (PATI) paradigm. A 2D and 3D CFD evaluation of the integrated propulsor will validate the physics-based aerodynamics and propulsor analysis tools. The lessons learned from the effort will establish a conceptual design roadmap for HEDP aircraft that are sensitive to PATI factors while also identifying path-critical technologies and design driving parameters for the propulsion and thermal management systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The ECO-150R configurations, with all the solicited NASA, Industry, and AFRL involvement, will have high visibility. This has unquantifiable benefits to commercialization, exposure, and business growth. ESAero's objective is to create a "poster child" for tube and wing TeDP/HEDP for themselves, but it is possible that this vehicle could be adopted by NASA. By updating the ECO-150 to the level of other concepts such as the N3-X, which has fostered immense research and development from all sides of the industry, ESAero will secure itself as a vital partner for follow-on research. Many aspects of the synergistic concept still wait to be investigated and introduced to the conceptual design process, including performance requirement relaxation opportunities and propulsion-aided control algorithms (PACA). The design effort will also promote ESAero's design tools, particularly PANTHER, both in publicity and reputability. The conceptual design roadmap and component technology requirements will impart immediate and recurring value.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		ESAero will leverage the resulting configurations and the applied design process and tools to support conceptual design groups  in their research and development of HEDP aircraft. This effort will demonstrate the utility of ESAero's latest tool development endeavors, which contribute to a more efficient conceptual design process with consideration of PATI factors. The tools and design process can guide aerospace primes and AFRL toward the identification of feasible HEDP configurations and support component manufacturers interested in how their technology would affect the leading edge in HEDP design and performance. AFRL would benefit as they are conducting in-house studies and supporting ESAero in other related areas. IARPA and the FAA will also benefit, as the lessons learned will be distributed within the government FOUO. ESAero has indentified the government and industry partners to develop this type of technology near term (Boeing, General Electric, Lockheed Martin) and longer (NASA, AFRL, IARPA etc).

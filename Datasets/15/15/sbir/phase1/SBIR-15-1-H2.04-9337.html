		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Paragon Space Development Corporation (Paragon) and our subcontractor, Thin Red Line Aerospace (TRLA) propose a unique solution for an inflated shroud system that provides launch, ascent, on-orbit, and transit protection to a large cryogenic tank.  The system consist of an outer inflated shroud that surrounds nested, concentric integrated ballistic/radiation shields separated by a series of loops via tension that are deployed by gas released between the perforated layers causing gentle inflation upon reaching the vacuum of space.  Battens within the shroud maintain its form even when unpressurized, and the frustum is protected with soft-goods thermal protection; the shroud is not jettisoned but rather carried into space to act as the outer micro-meteoroid orbital debris (MMOD) bumper and insulation layer.  The tension based loop system allows tailored separation of the layers for optimal MMOD and thermal protection.  The loops support small tensile loads and have a high length-to-cross-sectional-area ratio reducing conduction between layers for performance near idealized MLI; improving on foam spacers, scrim, or other compression standoffs.  Tank supports and plumbing pass through cutouts in the deployed system with little effect to thermal or ballistic protection. The architecture can encapsulate a tank or support deep space radiation cooled conical or complex geometry shields.  Paragon and TRLA are confident this unique multifunctional system concept will lead to a higher performance, lower cost, and lower mass solution than is currently possible with existing shrouds, MMOD, and insulation systems.

		<BR>
		The proposed system will allow less that 0.5 W/m^2 of heat penetration to a cryogen enhancing the prospect of passive zero-boil-off cryogenic propellant tanks while providing launch tolerance and integrated MMOD protection.  Successful development results in a low risk, low mass, shroud solution that can be applied to nearly any mission and is especially useful in support of soft or hard sided habitation modules or propellant tanks, including cryogens, to protect them from the thermal and MMOD environments of space. Compared to existing systems, this technology reduces the cost, schedule, and risk associated with the MMOD and thermal aspects of space operations. The system will be mature enough to be considered for future propellant depots, on-orbit storage of upper stages, space stations, and manned habitats both in space and in near-vacuum planetary missions such as a return to the Moon, Mars orbit, Phobos/Deimos or asteroid missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The United Launch Alliance has already expressed interest in this concept both as a stand alone inflated payload shroud and as an enabling technology for on-orbit assembly or propellant storage for large cryogenic systems for exploration class missions. Additionally, the proposed system would be ideal for inflatable on orbit tourist habitats, as protection of interstage propellant tanks and commercial satellites and for storage of collected insitu resources in commercial lunar or asteroid resource gathering operations.  It also may have applicability to provide self rigidized structures with integrated ballistic protection for the Department of Defense (DoD).

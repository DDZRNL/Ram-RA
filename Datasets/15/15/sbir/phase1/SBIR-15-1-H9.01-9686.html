		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is seeking innovative compact, lightweight, space-qualifiable vibration isolation platforms for payloads massing between 3 and 25 kg that require less than 5 W of power and mass less than 3 kg that will attenuate an integrated angular disturbance of 150 micro-radians to less than 0.15 micro-radians (1-sigma).  ATA has a long track record of producing stabilized platforms to host small optical payloads.  Building on a previous NASA SBIR, ATA now produces the stable platform used in NASA's Lunar Lasercomm Space Terminal (LLST) and Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD) programs.  ATA will create a Stable Platform for Optical Communications (SPOC) that could host the laser communications collimator telescope and provide a stabilized platform to prevent the 150-microradian spacecraft disturbance environment from reaching the laser communications terminal.  Advances in the suspension flexure, the platform structure, and actuators will be required to meet the size, weight and power requirements.  One challenging requirement is that an angular-motion sensor is required for the control system.  Gyros exist that can measure adequately but they are too heavy, too large, and use too much power. ATA will develop a small, lightweight, nanoradian-noise class angular rate sensor based on our proven MHD technology to meet the challenging angular disturbance attenuation requirement.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		ATA's proposed Stable Platform for Optical Communications (SPOC) and Magnetohydrodynamic Low-Frequency (MHD-LF) precision angular rate motion sensor package could host the laser collimator for NASA's Deep-Space Optical Terminal (DOT) program, which seeks to implement beacon-aided or beacon-less laser communication to and from Mars and beyond by the next decade.  Beginning with a NASA-funded Phase I SBIR, ATA developed the stable platform concept that serves as the basis for the lasercomm terminal that NASA will be flying on the Lunar Laser Comm Demonstration (LLCD) on the LADEE spacecraft and is planned for the Laser Comm Relay Demonstration (LCRD) program that will be hosted on a Loral communication satellite.  Similarly, under this NASA SBIR the SPOC could be developed to meet the need for long-range precision optical pointing and propel NASA to the forefront of laser communication.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		ATA is committed to commercializing NASA SBIRs, as evidenced by our recently delivered space-qualified inertially stable platform to a government customer for a laser communication application.  The original NASA SBIR program was called Magnetohydrodynamic Stable Reference (MSTAR) and was designed to provide a stable optical reference for line-of-sight jitter removal.  Multiple commercial and SBIR awards matured the technology.  ATA is on contract to deliver an additional seven units for that program.<BR><BR>ATA has been active in discussions with numerous primes for their DoD programs and with other organizations for laser communications programs to advocate the technology and performance aspects of the ATA SPOC and stable platform developments. Near term opportunities to commercialize and apply the ATA with the following programs:<BR>? Space Laser Communication Terminal (SLCT) &#150; Air Force<BR>? LWSM (Laser Weapon System Module) &#150; DARPA<BR>? SpOT (Space Optical Tracking facility) &#150; Lockheed Martin<BR>? LaWS (Laser Weapon System) &#150; Navy

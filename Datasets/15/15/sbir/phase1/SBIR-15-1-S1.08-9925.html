		<BR>
		Climate change is a growing concern, leading NASA to the need to track concentrations of such greenhouse gases as CO2 and CH4, including the need to detect them daytime, nighttime, and all year.  To achieve this, NASA has proposed such projects as Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE), and Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS).  In support of these programs, and in particular ASCENDS, Luminit, LLC, proposes to develop the innovative Multiwavelength Greenhouse Gas Lidar (MUGGLE).  The MUGGLE is a high-resolution spectroscopic measurement system that can detect and measure CO, CO2, CH4, and H2O (vapor) with great accuracy and speed.  The MUGGLE will be fully automated, using only eye-safe laser wavelengths and powers, with tunability and real-time calibration.  Through the use of cavity dumping, the MUGGLE will achieve laser linewidth <50 MHz for the best resolution, and significantly improves on existing greenhouse gas measurement technology.  During Phase I we will begin this research by studying the methods of measurement, designing a system, and fabricating a laboratory breadboard prototype, ending at TRL-4.  In Phase II we plan to further develop the MUGGLE, resulting in a TRL-6 engineering prototype that can be commercialized into both the specified device for NASA and an accurate system for measuring methane leakage.

		NASA is seeking methods of measuring greenhouse gases at or below the surface of the Earth.  Luminit proposes to change the paradigm with a new technology and strong existing position on the manufacturing aspect of the equation with our >$12M annual commercial sales.  Our new technology leverages our manufacturing experience to develop inexpensive methods of manufacturing the MUGGLE.<BR>Systems like ASCENDS, OCO-2, GPM, GEO-CAPE, etc. will immediately benefit from MUGGLE technology. Other fielded projects will follow, e.g., ocean biology and biogeochemistry. NASA scientists and NASA-funded researchers in these fields routinely measure in-water IOPs and the target market for sensors is extremely broad. The NASA Glenn Chemical Species Gas Sensors Team is developing gas sensing technology for aeronautic and space applications which can be addressed by the MUGGLE, especially if we consider that the laser rods can be changed to other materials in order to reach different spectral regions.  NASA is presently developing an Advanced EMU (AEMU) for exploration missions. These missions will require a robust, lightweight, and maintainable Portable Life Support System (PLSS). The PLSS attaches to the space suit pressure garment and provides approximately an 8 hour supply of oxygen for breathing, suit pressurization, ventilation; humidity, trace-contaminant, carbon dioxide (CO2) removal; this is an ideal application of MUGGLE technology, which can be miniaturized for this lower-power need.

		<BR>
		Gas detection has a vital role in reducing the global effects of climate change (greenhouse gas measurement). Gas sensing technology has also become more significant because of its widespread and common applications in areas like industrial production (methane detection in mines); automotive industry (detection of polluting gases from vehicles); medical applications (simulating the human olfactory system); indoor air quality supervision (detection of carbon monoxide); environmental studies (greenhouse gas monitoring), etc. Multiple examples are found in carbon monoxide detection applications (gas detection equipment in enclosed parking structures, ambulance bays, fire halls, warehouses, loading docks, ice arenas, maintenance facilities and municipal works garages); and in detection of other gases such as ammonia and sulfur dioxide. Gas sensing is also important in industries like brewing and bottling and food aroma detection. Other Governmental Agencies are already and will become bigger actors in this market with the incorporation of gas sensors in unmanned aircraft systems (NSF, NRL, ONR, NOAA, DOD, as well as state environmental agencies), e.g., in ocean science and coastal monitoring.  There is also a large market for methane detection, to enable leak location from natural gas pipes and to probe output of oil refineries and other fossil fuel processing plants.  All these are direct applications of the MUGGLE.

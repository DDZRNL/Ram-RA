		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		CoolCAD Electronics, LLC, is proposing the design and fabrication of silicon-carbide based active pixel sensor, comprising a very LARGE AREA SiC UV photodiode (>4mm2 in Phase I and >4cm2 in Phase II) with a monolithically-integrated readout circuit.  SiC photodiodes offer advantages in sensitivity, low dark current, high temperature operation, and higher UV responsivity compared to other commercial UV detector technologies such as GaP.  These sensors have applications relevant to Earth and planetary sciences and heliophysics-focused NASA missions.  Our technical objectives are the fabrication of very large area SiC photodiodes, in fact larger than what is currently commercially available, and monolithically integrating them with readout circuit components to extend the manufacturability benefits of Si CMOS to the SiC UV sensor arena. As deliverables, we propose to fabricate and deliver large area photodiodes, readout circuit components such as JFETs, and an integrated large area sensor/readout active pixel.  We will design the photodiode and other circuit components from the ground-up, with process and electrical performance simulations forming the bases of the structural and fabrication step design, including the development of models for use in circuit simulators.  We will optimize and perform the fabrication steps, and electrically and optically characterize the fabricated components using our in-house UV test system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed work is to advance the state of the art in UV and low energy particle sensing similar to those used in (potential) missions that are part of the Earth Observing System (EOS) project, such as include the Global Atmospheric Composition Mission (GACM) and the Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE) mission. Other uses could be as part of the Geostationary Operational Environment Satellite (GOES) system, especially for solar flare and similar observations. In general, deep UV detectors can find extensive usage in the next generation of hyperspectral remote sensing experiments, for ozone and hydrogen detection and similar uses. Solar system exploration missions such as the Europa Clipper or Uranus orbiter would also be able to utilize UV detectors.  Potential and planned missions such as the Jupiter-Europa Orbiter (JEO) and the Jupiter-Ganymede Orbiter (JGO) and their successors have requirements in the EUV-FUV and the FUV-MUV ranges.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Military and Commercial Uses: Deep UV detectors are important for the semiconductor industry for lithography applications. For next generation deep submicron devices, deep UV detectors and instruments are necessary to achieve feature sizes that are comparable or less than the photon wavelength. This capability leads to further commercial applications, such as defect detection in manufacturing and fatigue detection in transportation or similar arenas.<BR>Communication: Deep UV detectors are also one of the enabling technologies for UV Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) communication networks that have the added benefit of data security. Additionally, these detectors can be used as jet engine flare detectors in military applications.<BR>Biosensing: We have also identified a unique market potential for CoolCAD's technology in the bio-analytical arena. There are several novel technologies that make use of spectral analyses in the UVC band to accurately and specifically identify pathogenic bacterial species.

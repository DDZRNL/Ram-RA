		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed SBIR program targets the development of Rad-Hard by Design (RHBD), 1200 V-class SiC (planar) vertical DMOSFETs and power Schottky rectifiers for future NASA space missions. Single die ratings of > 1200 V, > 75 A, > 225?C and compliance to a NASA-certified radiation hardness assurance program are targeted for the proposed SiC power devices. The target application for these devices involves a 30 kW power processor unit (PPU) on-board a Hall Thruster Propulsion System operating at a 300-400 V (average) DC bias with a peak voltage of 600 V.  Several innovative device designs and process steps for fabricating RHBD SiC power DMOSFETs and Schottky rectifiers will be developed during Phase I. Building on the device development conducted during Phase I, the design and fabrication of traveled guided 1200 V/75 A SiC DMOSFET and Schottky rectifier wafer lots will be conducted during the Phase II program. The existing packaging techniques will be modified for meeting the required radiation standards from NASA. Selected die from both phases of the proposed program will be packaged in appropriate headers for controlled dose radiation testing as per NASA requirements. A rigorous space-level (JANS) qualification will be conducted on the fabricated devices during Phase II. Phase II will culminate with the insertion of the SiC power DMOSFETs and Schottky rectifiers into a 30 kW power processing unit (PPU) relevant to a NASA electric propulsion system and demonstrating stable operation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The SiC RHBD power devices developed during this SBIR program is fundamental to a wide range of NASA PMAD and motor control applications. For DC-DC converters, the SiC power devices will connect power sources in a wide variety of NASA mission with various loads like electric propulsion, communications systems, instruments and actuators. The radiation-hardness, high-temperature capability, fast switching speeds, compact form factor and low mass offered by the proposed SiC MOSFET power converters will be invaluable for future NASA science missions. Switchmode power supplies improved by high frequency, high temperature power switches developed in this program are critical for NASA synthetic aperture RADAR's (SAR) antenna array T/R modules. T/R modules typically operate in a pulsed mode, drawing current pulses from a power supply on a periodic basis determined by the operation of the overall RADAR system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Air-Force propulsion system externals like actuators, pumps, and starters, weapons ejection, fuel transfer, lighting, avionics, RADAR, landing gears & breaks, steering, powered doors and ramps, gun drives, anti-icing, environmental control and auxiliary emergency power systems. The realization of a high power density switchmode power supplies and DC-DC conversion circuits will benefit Army's Future Combat System (FCS) by offering it an important part of the subsystem. An integrated electric power system made using SiC high power devices will increase component placement flexibility within vehicles, double fuel economy by continuously operating smaller engines under optimum conditions, and reduce armor protected volume.  It will also enable an increased acceleration and maneuverability due to immediate torque to the wheels or tracks, reduce vehicle thermal and acoustic signatures and reduce system cost and logistics requirements. Commercial switchmode power supplies will also benefit from the development of such components.

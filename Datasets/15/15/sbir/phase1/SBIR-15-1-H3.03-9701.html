		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A Nautilus Centripetal Capillary Condenser (NCCC) is proposed for the microgravity compatible removal of water from a saturated air stream.  Successful development of this technology will result in a device that effectively dries a hot, moist airstream to a dew point of no more than 10 degrees Celsius with no entrained water droplets in the dry air effluent.  Non-mechanical inertial forces are employed to collect liquid water condensate via centripetal action along a spiral flow path.  A continuously varying groove shape along the outer edge of the spiral geometry uses capillary forces to assist liquid transfer to a collection region near the device center.  The proposed technology is an integration of conventional finned condenser operation combined with static phase separation and capillary transport phenomena.  Droplet entrainment is prevented via surface adhesion and reduced exit gas velocities. Condensate and dry air exit along separate pathways, each orthogonal to the spiral flow plane.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA application will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future manned missions.  Separation and recovery of the valuable water resource from Environmental Control and Life Support process air streams is required to extend mission durations and help make feasible crewed space exploration beyond low Earth orbit.  Low power, microgravity compatibility of the NCCC technology is of fundamental importance in various manned exploration mission phases including Mars transit.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Condensate collection from saturated gas streams is a unit process widely employed throughout various industries and laboratory environments.  The efficient capture of high value or potentially hazardous liquids from process gas streams or air exhaust is required for profitable and/or environmentally friendly operations.  Here NCCC technology may find application for primary condensate recovery.

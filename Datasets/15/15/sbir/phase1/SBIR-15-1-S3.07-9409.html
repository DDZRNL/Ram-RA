		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In response to NASA SBIR Topic S3.07, "Thermal Control Systems", Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) proposes the development of an active Two-phase Thermal Management System (TPTMS) that relies on a single-phase liquid pump to drive two-phase flow through multiple heat sources and sinks distributed in parallel and in series while providing phase management using the momentum of the working fluid.  This system is designed to address challenges discussed in the NASA Thermal Management Systems Roadmap, Technology Area (TA) 14.  The use of a liquid pump to drive the system allows the working fluid to overcome large pressure drops with low power consumption.  This feature, in turn, provides the ability to transfer waste heat over large distances, which is defined as a top technical challenge in TA14, Section 1.4.  Additionally, flow can be driven through multiple heat exchangers or cold plates to either collect or release thermal energy.  Arranged properly, this feature allows for heat load sharing, which is also defined as a top technical challenge.  Added to these benefits are those intrinsic to two-phase heat transfer: near-isothermal operation, a two order of magnitude increase in the heat transferred per unit mass (TA14) and the ability to handle high heat fluxes with the appropriate heat exchanger design.  Lastly, Section 2.2.3.2 of TA14 discusses the need for microgravity separators, which is an integral part of the proposed TPTMS.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary application is spacecraft thermal management.  If the program is successful, the TPTMS proposed here will provide a two-phase thermal management solution for spacecraft that is versatile with respect to heat load requirements and location, allows for efficient use of available mass, volume, and power budgets, can handle heat load transients, and is capable of scaling heat rejection with cooling demand through control of accumulator pressure.  In addition, these functions are accomplished using relatively simple, low-cost components, such as a single-phase pump and the accumulator design.  Applications for this thermal management system would include spacecraft with thermal demands beyond the capabilities of capillary systems and those interested in low-cost alternatives to conventional thermal management systems.  In addition, since the TPTMS aims to provide gravity-independent and acceleration-resistant operation, ACT will also investigate potential aircraft applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In Phase II, ACT will develop two additional test systems.  The first will demonstrate an on-demand TPTMS using a dynamic, automated control system.  The second will demonstrate reduced gravity operation aboard NASA or private test aircraft.  During this phase, ACT will investigate application with the growing commercial satellite and spacecraft market.  Depending on the phase separation performance of the MVS integrated with the TPTMS, ACT will also consider military and commercial aircraft applications.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this program, Freedom Photonics will develop and build a robust, low C-SWaP laser source with improved performance over current technology, to be incorporated into improved FOS interrogator systems. The laser will be 40nm continuously tunable around C-band, with fast sweep rate. The laser interrogator module to be developed will be based on our advanced monolithic, fast-tunable laser and receiver technology, leading to ultra-low SWaP with smaller FOS laser interrogator module, two orders of magnitude smaller than existing technology, and interrogator mass less than 100 grams. The configuration will be rugged, compatible with fuel, fuel vapor, shock, and vibration.

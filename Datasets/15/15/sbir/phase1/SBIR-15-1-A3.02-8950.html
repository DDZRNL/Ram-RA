		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The objective of this research is to create a generic advanced Flight Management System (FMS) platform that could be used for evaluation of autonomous trajectory-based operation concepts. The research addresses the following deficiencies: most FMSs have limited advanced features; are specific to a single aircraft type; expensive and protected by FMS manufacturers. The proposed FMS platform will enable users to deploy a wide array of autonomy enabling FMS features by the click of a button. Some of the proposed features include: (i) air-ground & inter-aircraft trajectory negotiation, (ii) 4D Trajectory-Based Operations (4DTBO), (iii) high-fidelity wind modeling for improved predictability, (iii) trajectory planning options based on environmental and efficiency considerations, and (iv) advanced guidance modes such as Required Time of Arrival (RTA) and 4DFMS. A key feature of the proposed research is the integration of this platform and its features with NASA's Multi-AirCraft Simulation (MACS) platform.<BR><BR>Phase I research will identify the complete array of features for possible inclusion in this platform. Moreover, Phase I will demonstrate select features through the interface to MACS. Phase II research will elevate the technology readiness level suitable for deployment in Human-In-The-Loop simulation pilot stations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed FMS platform can be used in the following NASA applications: <BR>- Networked cockpit management<BR>- Autonomicity (or self-management) -based architectures for the entirety, or parts, of airspace operations<BR>- Verification and validation tools for increasingly autonomous operations.<BR>- Autonomy/autonomous technologies and concepts for trajectory management and efficient/safe traffic flows.<BR>- It can be used to augment the capabilities of NASA's Multi AirCraft Simulation (MACS). New features such as RTA, 4DFMS, and High-Fidelity Wind Models will enhance the suite of FMS features available for evaluation in HITL simulations.<BR>- It can be used for shadow mode evaluation of NextGen FMS concepts under the SMART NAS project.<BR>- FMS features such as Interval Management (IM) enable self-separation and contribute towards autonomous National Airspace System.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed FMS platform is ideal for experimental FMS testbed. As such it could be of interest to Universities, research labs, and other small businesses pursuing research in air-traffic management. It could also be of interest to Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) operators for simulating the interactions of UAS with other aircraft in the National Airspace System. Trajectory-Based Operations realized by autonomous cars could be the answer to congested city traffic. The concepts, architectures, and evaluation tools developed under this research would be very much applicable to futuristic road traffic management system.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed work will develop a reliability analysis tool consistent with conceptual-level design for ceramic matrix composite (CMC) turbine blades and vanes. The analysis software will comprise a suite of physics-based discipline specific analysis code modules and NASA's Fast Probability Integrator (FPI). The objective of this analysis tool is to develop optimal material properties, internal and external geometries for a cooled vane/blade using aerothermal, and structural (including creep) analyses.  Structural constraints in the form of allowable mechanical/thermal stresses and material constraints in the form of minimum wall thickness and minimum bend radius will be applied. The structural stress analysis will be augmented with a creep module to determine an estimate for part life. The suggested benchmark system problem is a multi-disciplinary analysis of a NASA C3X turbine vane, 2 or 3D versions of the discipline specific models will be taken from the open literature and implemented as plug-in modules for NASA's Open MDAO framework. It is not the intention of this program to develop new MDAO architectures, rather the optimization drivers built into Open MDAO will be used.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate has programs and projects regarding subsonic aviation and with goals of improved efficiency, emissions and noise are potential consumers of this effort from a technology development standpoint. Specifically, the development of a reliability analysis tool consistent with conceptual-level design for ceramic matrix composite turbine blades and vanes will facilitate the aforementioned NASA goal.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A ceramic matrix composite blade leads to gains in specific fuel consumption by allowing higher operating temperatures, reductions in required cooling, and reductions in vehicle weight. A reliability analysis tool for CMC turbine blades has a high probability of being implemented by aero-turbine gas engine manufactures, such as GE Aviation, Pratt &Whitney, Rolls-Royce and Honeywell.

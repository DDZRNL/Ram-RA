		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Systems & Processes Engineering Corporation and Texas A&M University propose a miniature, long range, LIDAR for navigation and rendezvous. The HD6D imaging consists of high resolution, rapid framing 3D LIDAR and RGB camera images fused to give an HD resolution image.  The LIDAR output and RGB camera output feed TAMU feature tracking algorithms which give 6DOF relative pose information to all bodies in the FOV.  The images are fused into rigid bodies continuously updated as the imaging continues.  The 6DOF relative pose information simplifies navigation and rendezvous activities and greatly reduces HD6D image transmission, as the up dated Voxels (volume pixels) of each body can be sent at longer intervals.  Range resolution for the HD6D is 3mm at close range, 28mm at acquisition range.  Maximum range for the HD6D LIDAR is 30Km.   The 32 channel receiver 3D imaging rate is range fold over limited to 12.8Mpps to 375m varying to 160Kpps at longest range.  The laser transmits a phase coded pulse train which allows a 13/1 pulse compression increasing signal to noise level by 13x and reducing peak power by13x for a given joule transmit.  This lower peak power avoids nonlinear effects in the gain fiber allowing higher joules.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Long Range HD6D LIDAR with TAMU feature tracking and navigation software allows accurate rendezvous operations for Space station docking, satellite life extension missions, and space junk removal operations.  The LIDAR is also useful for landing missions on planets and small bodies.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications include satellite life extension docking missions, spacecraft inspection missions and long range intercept missions.  Non space missions include UAV navigation, through foliage imaging and animal counting and forestry foliage mass estimation.  UGV and under sea navigation applications are also possible.

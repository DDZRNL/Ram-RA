		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are routinely used by NASA to optimize the design of propulsion systems. Current methods for CFD modeling rely on general materials properties to determine fluid structure interactions. This introduces uncertainty when modeling extreme conditions, where materials degrade and properties may change as a consequence. This also limits the use of CFD as a modeling tool to assist in material selection and specification. CFDRC in partnership with Sandia National Laboratories proposes to develop a computational materials model to simulate degradation of a ceramic matrix composite material under the high temperature, high velocity flow conditions of the propulsion environment.  The objective is to provide a computational tool to assist NASA in the selection and optimization of propulsion system materials and to predict material degradation and failure throughout the service life in extreme conditions. During Phase I the team will demonstrate a mesoscale materials model based on peridynamics, a theory of continuum mechanics that can describe fracture and defect progression at the level of the microstructure. Peridynamics provides a theoretical framework to dynamically simulate fracture and mechanical erosion at the mesoscale, where properties such as tensile strength and toughness are affected by features of the microstructure and composite design.  The proposed modeling scheme use CFD to establish the thermal-mechanical stresses imposed at the boundaries of the structure.  Peridynamics simulations will be used to determine the evolution of the macroscale properties as a function of microstructure, damage and boundary conditions. Methods to link time and condition dependent materials properties with the CFD system will be evaluated.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) has been identified as an enabling technology to both advance the development of new materials and to accelerate their incorporation them into commercial systems. The proposed modeling product falls within the scope of ICME as a means to link material features to product performance. This work product can be transferred as a modeling tool to assist material selection in any application where mechanical degradation limits performance such as ablative and high temperature materials for hypersonic environments.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		DoD supported programs such as the development of hypersonic systems involve the selection and incorporation of materials for extreme environments. Performance of energy systems for power generation and fossil energy extraction involve applications where material degradation limits the performance. The work established in this project can be transitioned to support these other applications. A reasonable extension of this model would be to model accumulated damage in cyclic fatigue applications which could substantially reduce maintenance cost of aircraft.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NanoSonic has recently developed a hydrogen (H2) dispenser hose to realize H2 as a safe, reliable, and cost competitive replacement for gasoline.  NanoSonic's ultra-low glass transition temperature (Tg of -100 ?C) is expected to meet the service requirement of 25,550 fills/year (70 fills/day for 2 years) at a combined ultra-high pressure of 875-bar and very wide service temperature range of -50?C to +90?C.  This state-of-the-art lightweight hose (0.99 g/cc) is based on a unique fiber reinforced, high performance, cryogenically flexible polymer designed to resist hydrogen embrittlement, survive the Joule-Thompson effect thermal cycles, and endure mechanical wear and fatigue at the pump.  This system is offered herein as large area panels that may be seamed via RF welding with our space partner, ILC Dover, to form inflatable habitat bladders.  This superior class of low Tg polymers exhibited ultra-low air and H2 permeance (0.31 cc/100in2?Atm?day - post triple cold flex) before and after being subjected to the harsh, triple fold (180?) cold flexure (-50 ?C) test.  Here, this non-electrically conductive polymer shall be reinforced herein with an engineered fiber design to dissipate static electricity and provide multifunctional radiation shielding.  Additional multifunctionality shall be built in via NanoSonic's self-healing microspheres, while meeting the goal of < 6 oz/yd2 for a triply redundant bladder.  NanoSonic shall work with our STTR partner, Colorado State University (CSU), Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LM SSC), and ILC Dover to qualify the advanced bladder material for space habitats.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NanoSonic's Thoraeus Rubber&#153; materials will be primarily developed as the bladder assembly for inflatable, life-critical, NASA space habitats.  The advanced lightweight bladder material offers superb cold temperature flexibility and durability to maintain low air permeability during handling and deployment in space.  The puncture resistant material will be transitioned as the multi-layer, self-healing bladder system to ensure limited repair and maintenance.  The multifunctional TR&#153; materials formed via NanoSonic's ESA process offer EMI and radiation shielding for enhanced long-term high altitude and space durability.  Additional NASA platforms include Lunar systems, exploration vehicles, and satellites in LEO, GEO, and HEO.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications for the low Tg TR&#153; inflatables include ultra-lightweight deployable polar habitats, high altitude airships (HAA), and rapidly deployable and reusable shelters.  Additionally, the self-healing component within the multi-layer bladder will be transitioned as long-term H2 hoses, protective storage liners for food or other sensitive materials, self-sealing tires, anti-ballistic fuel tanks and life critical personnel protective equipment (PPE).  The H2 hoses shall serve as a new standard for high-pressure hoses with the additional benefits of fire resistance and self-healing.  These fuel, corrosion, ozone and UV-resistant, non-offgassing, non-metallic, yet grounding hoses shall also serve as a new class of materials for wiring and conduit for construction, aerospace, and space systems in need of all temperature, mechanically durable solutions to long-term survivable platform needs.  It has the potential to revolutionize H2 as a green alternative energy source to gasoline and diesel fuels.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Laser transmitters operating at a pulse repetition rate of 20 Hz to 50 Hz and with pulse energy from 30 - 50 mJ have been considered to be an enabling technology for CO2 measurement and optical communications. PolarOnyx proposes a novel approach targeting to make reliable high energy ultra large core fiber amplifier at 1.57 micron and employing our proprietary technologies in specialty fibers, spectral shaping and pulse shaping techniques. At the end of Phase 1, and simulation study will be carried out and feasibility experiment will be demonstrated in laying out the pathway towards over 30 mJ high energy. A prototype will be demonstrated at the end of Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed high energy fiber amplifier approach is applied to CO2 measurement. It can also be used in other applications, such as space, aircraft, and satellite applications of LADAR systems and communications. PolarOnyx will develop a series of products to meet various requirements for NASA deployments.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Other commercial applications include<BR>- Material processing. This includes (1) all types of metal processing such as welding, cutting, annealing, and drilling; (2)semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturing such as lithography, inspection, control, defect analysis and repair, and via drilling; (3) marking of all materials including plastic, metals, and silicon; (4) other materials processing such as rapid prototyping, desk top manufacturing, micromachining, photofinishing, embossed holograms, and grating manufacturing.<BR>- Medical and biomedical instrumentation. The high power laser can be applied to ophthalmology, refractive surgery, photocoagulation, general surgery, therapeutic, imaging, and cosmetic applications. Biomedical instruments include those involved in cells or proteins, cytometry, and DNA sequencing; laser Raman spectroscopy, spectrofluorimetry, and ablation; and laser based microscopes.

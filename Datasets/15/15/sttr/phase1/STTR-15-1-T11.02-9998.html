		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A comprehensive model-based approach will be enabled for space systems design via the work started on Phase I of this project.  The OpenMETA toolkit is a cyber-physical modeling tool for the design and virtual integration of complex systems, developed under the DARPA AVM Program.  OpenMETA will be leveraged and extended to support NASA/JPL goals for multi-physics, multi-domain modeling, analysis, optimization, and uncertainty quantification of spacecraft and space systems.  Specific extensions include supporting preferred CAD tool (Siemens NX), FEA Meshing (FEMAP), and IMUQ uncertainty quantification. In addition, the use of external, configuration-managed databases will be supported to track design parameter evolution.   The tool's utility will be evaluated and demonstrated via a set of use cases and end-to-end experiments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are a number of potential NASA applications for the optimization framework: <BR>Rover Design and Optimization. Modeling of NASA extra-planetary explorer subsystems. Rapid evaluation of system architectures and parameters.  Rapid assessment of system for requirement feasibility.<BR> Satellite Systems Design. Evolution of a systems concept, based on requirements to a fully detailed system design.  Analysis and optimization of all performance aspects of the design prior to construction, reducing overall system design time and cost. <BR> Uncertainty quantification: UQ is needed for any critical system that NASA operates.  Extending UQ in a cost effective manner to all designs will improve confidence for mission critical systems.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Aerospace: Rapid analysis of mission requirements and mapping to feasible aircraft architectures can help to reduce system costs for commercial aircraft.  The tools support rapid design progression from concept to prototype, allowing optimization of subsystems and systems at a much earlier phase in the design cycle. Full model-based analysis and sensitivity analysis prior to build will improve prototype quality and reduce development iterations.  Uncertainty quantification methods will be applied to a wider range of systems, improving overall safety of life-critical systems.<BR>Automotive: Modeling of product line architectures and optimizing system design to marketplace requirements will be a valuable addition to automaker's toolbox.  Reduced cost of sensitivity analysis will allow the technique to be applied across the board, helping to avoid manufacturing quality issues.  Full uncertainty analysis to reduce black-swan errors and costly recalls.<BR>Electronics: Metamorph is already working modular mobile phones and configurable/modular phone components.  Optimization and system modeling will help to rapidly tune systems against the highly constrained power/mass/performance requirements for commercial portable devices and assess deployment across mobile infrastructures and the impact of 3G&#8594;4G&#8594;5G changes

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		M4 Engineering and Missouri S&T propose to investigate the viability of creating a multidisciplinary analysis and optimization architecture for analyzing spacecraft system models.  The current approach will utilize commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software to alleviate acquisition hurdles for NASA (and public) technical monitors/reviewers.  Next, a preliminary set of analysis modules will be developed including a CAD-based Geometry component capable of generating parametric geometry.  Once the analysis modules are completed, integration within the OpenMDAO framework will commence.  The MDAO tool will be developed to address the issues of being generic and scalable to larger spacecraft systems.  Validation of the modules and the prototype tool will be carried out by constructing model problems to test various capabilities as well as a complete spacecraft system demonstration application with optimization of integrated multidisciplinary performance models.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA applications will include the use of the developed software with any complex integrated space system.  Additionally, due to the modular nature of the tool and the use of widely available commercial software many different applications could be studied across most, if not all, of the NASA centers.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		M4 Engineering has active relationships with several prime contractors who are likely users of this technology.  These include Boeing Phantom Works, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon.  These provide excellent commercialization opportunities for the technology.  The development of an integrated multi-disciplinary analysis and optimization tool leveraging commonly used commercial software is expected to find wide application to many aerospace and non-aerospace products.  Examples include aerospace/defense, turbomachinery, automotive and alternative energy applications.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Fibertek proposes a configurable, multi-beam, 1.5 um Doppler Lidar sensor, enabled by high-speed non-mechanical beam steering (NMBS). NMBS uses state-of-the-art, high-speed liquid-crystal based components, to provide wide-angle (up to +/- 45 degree), large-aperture, optical beam steering, at speeds of up to 10 kHz. Furthermore, this is integrated into a very compact optical transmit/receive terminal, designed for coherent lidar operation. The proposed Doppler Lidar sensor is estimated to be 4X lower SWaP, and have 3X-5X improved range performance over the current design for entry, descent, landing (EDL) sensors under development at NASA.<BR> <BR>In addition, the configurable, high-speed, beam-scan pattern provides enhanced functionality for velocity/range/attitude estimate, and even for terrain mapping. The Doppler Lidar landing sensor model will be developed by our Research Institution partner, leveraging their related work on 3D-imaging ladar.<BR><BR>The proposed effort targets a space-qualifiable roadmap, as we will leverage ongoing inter-disciplinary engineering development and qualification at Fibertek, for high-reliability, high-power, fiber laser transmitter and transmit/receive optical terminal for deep-space mission.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		(1) Compact Doppler Lidar as a precision Entry, Descent and Landing sensor, for planetary/ lunar/asteroid missions.<BR>(2) Configurable, rapid-scan, multi-beam capability enabled by NMBS technology, provides for  enhanced EDL sensor functionality, e.g. for terrain-mapping, hazard avoidance, and hazard relative navigation.<BR>(3) Relative navigation sensor for spacecraft constellation flying, enabled by lidar ranging  sensors with NMBS technology<BR>(4) Laser beam pointing, stabilization, and scanning of any Lidar/Ladar based sensor, including for  mosaic-tiled 3D-imaging ladar.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		(1) Agile, compact optical terminal for laser communication for hosted-payloads, small-satellite,  and CubeSat platform, that are of interest to AF and NRO missions.<BR>(2) Enables space optical networking, and autonomous communication links for satellite constellation mission.<BR>(3) Enables optical time-transfer for accurate navigation, with potential for optically aided GPS<BR>(4) Precision steering for mosaic-tiled 3D Imaging Ladar application, for ISR missions.<BR>(5) Laser beam-steering, tracking and stabilization for directed-energy laser application.

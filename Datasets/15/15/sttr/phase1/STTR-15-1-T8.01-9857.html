		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to develop a Photon-Counting Integrated Circuit (PCIC) mega-pixel focal plane array (FPA) imager with highest sensitivity, lowest noise and hence highest signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) among all imagers covering the shortwave infrared band, and to incorporate the prototype PCIC imager into a prototype imaging spectroscopy CAMM instrument for real-time operation on a planetary surface to guide rover targeting, sample selection (for missions involving sample return), and science optimization of data returned to earth, thus improving science return from instruments used to study the elemental, chemical, and mineralogical composition of planetary materials.<BR><BR>During Phase I, we will develop and prototype a limited-size array of PCIC detector pixels as well as design and model the imaging spectrometer CAMM instrument.   In Phase II, we will develop and prototype a mega-pixel PCIC focal plane array (FPA) imager as well as the imaging spectrometer CAMM instrument incorporating the PCIC imager.

		<BR>
		The proposed Photon-Counting Integrated Circuit (PCIC) mega-pixel focal plane array (FPA) imager will provide highest sensitivity, lowest noise and hence highest signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) among all imagers covering the shortwave infrared band for a wide range of instruments and missions.<BR><BR>The proposed imaging spectroscopy CAMM instrument will improve real-time operation on a planetary surface to guide rover targeting, sample selection (for missions involving sample return), and science optimization of data returned to earth, thus improving science return from instruments used to study the elemental, chemical, and mineralogical composition of planetary materials.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Besides aerospace and defense applications, the proposed sensor technology also finds commercial applications in security, law enforcement, border patrol, scientific instruments, laser detection, laser eye protection, biomedical imaging, prosthetic vision aid, ecosystem monitoring and protection, manufacturing quality control and consumer electronics cameras. We will concentrate on our commercial medical device products at present.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology builds off GTL's advanced solid ramjet fuel. The method uses additive manufacturing methods to produce an innovative new type of fuel grain that regresses quickly and has a high Isp and combustion efficiency. With this technology, the performance of a liquid rocket engine can be had with a hybrid rocket system. <BR>This technology allows for a simple, low cost, high performance stage that is well suited for a nano-sat vehicle. Reducing complexity and parts count serves to decrease cost and increase reliability.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High performance solid fuels are important in hybrid rocket engines. Hybrids have been selected for low cost manned sub-orbital missions due to their relative safety. A high performance hybrid engine would be of great use to manned missions as well as low-cost launch solutions. Reducing the parts count and complexity will provide significant advantages for low cost launch solutions of nanosat payloads.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology of enhanced fuel grains was developed in response to a Navy need for high performance air-breathing ramjets. This proposal seeks to apply the same technology to hybrid rocket engines which are similar in nature. This technology will impact the development of low cost launch vehicles by providing a high performance and simple alternative to more complex and costly systems such as liquid rocket engines.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose a spectrometer that employs a single room temperature semiconductor detector that can perform both gamma and neutron spectroscopy. The proposed detector is based on the novel mercurous halide materials, Hg2X2 (X=I, Cl, Br).  The mercurous halides are new wide band-gap semiconductor detector materials that can provide radiation detection with low cost, high performance and long term stability.  Despite years of research, no explored room temperature semiconductor detection candidates can satisfy all three features simultaneously. At Brimrose, we have successfully developed the growth procedures for high quality Hg2X2 crystals for long wavelength infrared (LWIR) imaging systems. Recently, we have been able to engineer our growth process toward gamma radiation detection and have demonstrated initial encouraging detector response from Hg2I2 to both gamma and alpha particle incident radiations. The focus will be on the material engineering aspect of the detector material itself (i.e., crystal growth and post growth processing), as well as on the detector fabrication and system design.   The proposed mercurous halides-based nuclear instrument can be used onboard NASA's orbiters and landers for space planetology. Specifically, it can be used to determine surface and sub-surface composition of planetary bodies via both gamma spectroscopy and neutron spectroscopy.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)

		The primary commercial application for the proposed spectrometer capable of performing both gamma and neutron spectroscopy is for NASA's planetary exploratory missions.  Specifically, the proposed spectrometer based on mercurous halides can be used onboard NASA's orbiters and landers to determine surface and sub-surface composition of planetary bodies via both gamma spectroscopy and neutron spectroscopy.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The need for advanced room temperature semiconductor materials has always been of significant interest not only from Federal Agencies such as DOD, DHS, DOE, but also from the private sector. Non-NASA uses for a spectrometer with gamma/neutron detection are numerous and include (1) Homeland security applications (2) Space based applications for military agencies, (3) The medical community (SPECT, PET, Spectral-CT),(4) Various industrial markets (chemical, automotive, pharmaceutical and petrochemical), and (5) The research community. Commercial applications include elemental analysis, explosive detection, medical diagnostics, x-ray imaging, seismic activity detection, and radiation monitoring.  The detection and identification of radionuclides from atmospheric nuclear tests has obvious military applications such as detection of nuclear non-proliferation, treaty verification, and nuclear materials control.

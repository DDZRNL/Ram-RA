		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		For this STTR project, American GNC Corporation (AGNC) and Louisiana Tech University (LaTECH) are proposing a significant breakthrough technology for improving embedded sensing, remote and wireless monitoring, and the capture of data, information, and knowledge (DIaK) at propulsion ground test facilities with the Integrated Monitoring AWAReness Environment (IM-AWARE). This system consists of smart sensors that interface with transducers measuring parameters such as heat flux, temperature, pressure, strain, and near-field acoustics. Low-level fault diagnostic autonomy is granted by advanced algorithms that not only extract features in measured data which are highly correlated with potential failure modes, but also take advantage of the interrelations in a large, complex system. High-level knowledge is infused into the environment with graph-based methods which allow describing cause and effect relationships. These core capabilities are then deployed in an innovative Enterprise networking infrastructure based on wireless and ubiquitous information sharing. Finally, at the front-end of IM-AWARE, graphical user interfaces (GUI) for both PCs and mobile devices deliver a complete picture of the monitored system and associated DIaK with real-time updates.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Integrated Monitoring AWAReness Environment will directly support health monitoring and management within NASA propulsion and testing facilities. The integration of the system into NASA Stennis Space Center's rocket engine test stands will immediately benefit the Integrated System Health Management (ISHM) program by providing powerful embedded sensing with wireless networking. This includes the monitoring of leakage, fire, etc. in propellant or gas delivery systems, cooling water lines, etc. Another example is the remote monitoring of vacuum lines as part of the low pressure and low cryogenic temperature A3 test stand at NASA SSC. Possible applications outside of SSC involve the health monitoring of test facility support systems at Glen Research Center, for example, vacuum line monitoring at the zero gravity research facility, as well as usage in wind tunnel test facilities such as those at Ames Research Center and Langley Research Center.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		One of the main objectives of this STTR is the commercialization of the project's research results and introduction of a commercialized product into the marketplace (both civilian and government). The IM-AWARE will provide an integral solution for embedded sensing and health monitoring for a variety of systems. Specific uses  of the technology include, but are not limited to: (1) heating and cooling systems in large and expansive commercial facilities; (2) support systems in nuclear power plants (cooling lines, gas pressurization lines, and so on) as well as other power plant types (fossil fuels, geothermal power, hydroelectric, etc.); (3) industrial environments that require the proper operation of fluid flow systems (e.g. refrigerant for cooling, hydraulic power systems, etc.); (4) general manufacturing environments; and (5) natural gas pipelines and other gas delivery systems.

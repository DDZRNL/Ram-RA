		<BR>
		NASA's future human exploration missions will include remotely operated rovers performing surface exploration and science, as well as free-flyers to reduce the need for human Extra Vehicular Activity. Technologies are needed for remote operation and supervised autonomy of robots. Consider the Resource Prospector (RP) lunar mission. For RP it will be necessary to accomplish as much as possible in the available time. A key requirement for planning such operations is the ability to accurately predict how much resource (e.g., time, power) is needed to perform planned tasks. More accurate resource estimates can prevent wasting resources trying to complete unrealistic plans. Quick turnaround of plans revisions can minimize the time the robot is idle while its plan is being modified. TRACLabs and CMU propose to develop software for the Adaptive Estimation of Resources (AER) to help build and revise plans for robots performing NASA missions. This software will be used to estimate the duration of planned tasks using information about terrain features combined with historical plan performance. These estimates can be used to assess the feasibility of robot plans when built. And can be used to assess the impact of changes to robot plans during execution. These resource models will be updated during a mission to improve the accuracy of estimates at a site. Providing more accurate resource estimates for building robot plans produces plans more likely to complete within the allocated resources. These estimates give the planner a better sense of what resources are required to achieve objectives, which affects both the selection of which objectives to pursue and the order in which to purse them. When replanning is needed, either due to unexpected opportunities or problems, these estimates can help the team determine whether sufficient time remains to complete the revised plan and, if not, help users perform plan trades to determine which subset of activities should be attempted.

		The proposed project will develop the AER software for estimating plan resources for use when building robot plans that enable variable levels of robot autonomy (NASA Roadmap TA4). The AER software has direct application to NASA's Resource Prospector (RP) mission. An ongoing operational trade during plan execution for RP is whether to spend time analyzing a nearby area or to move on to prospect another area. The proposed resource models have potential to help the science team make better decisions about prospecting by providing more accurate estimates of how long it will take to perform the tasks within a rover plan. This software also has potential use to provide resource estimates for NASA field tests for future human exploration operations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		TRACLabs is commercializing the PRIDE electronic procedure system for use in the oil and gas industry. We currently are deploying PRIDE with an upstream oil and gas company, for use in drilling automation. The PRIDE procedure editing software will be used to build procedural tasks sequences very similar to the robot task plans built using xGDS plan editor providing plans for the proposed project. The AER software can be integrated with the PRIDE editor to provide resource estimates for drilling automation procedures. Much like robot traverse tasks, the resources needed for drilling tasks are impacted by the environment in which they operate. The time to drill through subsurface with different geological structure can vary significantly. The AER software can model drilling times through these structures to estimate resources for planned drilling procedures prior to drilling. The AER software developed in Phase II will be the basis of a new tool in the PRIDE suite of tools for electronic procedures.

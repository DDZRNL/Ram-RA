		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		American GNC Corporation (AGNC) and Louisiana Tech University (LaTECH) are proposing a significant breakthrough technology, the Integrated Monitoring AWAReness Environment (IM-AWARE) consisting of an Enterprise Infrastructure with closely coupled smart sensor networks and Enhanced IT Security to enable: (i) real time monitoring of the distribution systems health; (ii) supporting maintenance operations and configuration management; and (iii) making the system clients aware, in an ubiquitous way, when an entity (sensor, valve, pipeline, motor-pump, etc.) failure is detected. Key components of this infrastructure are: (i) a low level standardized smart sensor network with embedded diagnostics at the sensor and intelligent sensor network coordinator levels and (ii) client-server enterprise infrastructure containing a Database, secure communications, and software applications for smartphones, tablets, and/or ruggedized devices. Key advantages of the system include: (a) novel sensor self-diagnostics with a non-spatial correlation algorithm; (b) novel Timed Failure Propagation Graphs (TFPG) algorithm, for joint sensor/component fault diagnostics; (c) system troubleshooting by stochastic inference that mimics human troubleshooting reasoning; (d) APIs for the TFPGs, Bayesian Networks (BN), and Influence Diagrams to facilitate and expedite diagnostic deployment within custom embedded applications; and (e) ruggedized hardware modules design. Advanced sensing schemes are provided for leakage detection, heat flux applications, and fire detection, in addition to monitoring test facility parameters (flow, pressure, temperature). To provide retrofitting and scalability capability strategies include standardized and scalar smart sensor design as well as software APIs and toolboxes development.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		IM-AWARE enhances NASA's Integrated System Health Management (ISHM) program by providing an Enterprise-based health management system with innovative and cutting edge technologies. Due to a modular and flexible design based on standards as well as Software API and Software Toolboxes, components can be introduced within NASA's ISHM framework without necessarily including the entire system. Potential NASA Stennis Space Center (SSC) use specifically involves: (i) vacuum lines and pressurized systems; (ii) cryogenic test facilities; (iii) propellant delivery systems; (iv) cooling water or gas lines; (v) various facilities and test complexes; and (vi) many other complex systems. These systems can be integrated with either the complete Enterprise-based System or just portions, where retrofitting current devices and adding new devices can both be considered by leveraging the IM-AWARE modular nature. The versatility of IM-AWARE allows it to be also used for a wide range of NASA's space transportation propulsion systems for performing rocket engine ground testing (e.g. J-2X Rocket Engine) as well as health monitoring of any other space, lunar, or planetary vehicle/system of interest to NASA.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Integrated Monitoring AWARness Environment will find a large market in maintenance processes in both the civilian and government markets. System integration (full or partial) and retrofitting current systems is a primary initial strategy for gradual infusion of the technologies into the market. Non-NASA application areas include: (a) heating and cooling systems in large commercial facilities; (b) natural gas pipelines and other gas delivery systems; (c) support systems in nuclear power plants; (d) industrial environments involving fluid systems; (e) manufacturing facilities; (f) testing facilities involving gases and fluids, among others. The IM-AWARE can be also customized for a wide range of machinery application areas. Additional areas of application include the aerospace industry (aircraft engines and turbo-jets), on-ground maintenance, manufacturing, and other applications requiring smart sensors with embedded health monitoring and evolving diagnostic capabilities. Further applications include: (a) health monitoring of steam turbines; (b) intelligent data acquisition systems for machinery health monitoring; and (c) fluid and hydraulic systems (such as cooling systems). The emerging Internet of Things market also opens possibilities to the IM-AWARE system commercialization (e.g. smart home control, smart meters, manufacturing control, asset tracking application, etc.)

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The program is focused on developing high temperature energy harvesting devices that can convert waste energy (primarily vibratory) such as the mechanical disturbance from thrusters as to include waste exhaust created during operational conditions. The program focus is on developing very high performance devices that are extremely robust and that can continuously operate at up to 500 C. The purpose of this program is to develop new high performance energy conversion devices that can act as a localized power generator for sensors and other devices.  The program has already made substantial headway in designing and fabricating simple, rugged, easily installed, high temperature energy conversion devices that can be easily installed on thruster components and other similar high temperature parts.  Fortuitously, these new energy conversion devices can equally function as high performance/high temperature capable vibration/pressure sensors.  Part of this program has been focused on an important development of the first known (low cost) method for non-epoxy/low temperature joining of ceramics to metals. This cold sinter innovation separately has great potential to address a wide range of other NASA applications in potentially critical ways.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The devices are rugged, low profile, non-epoxy, energy harvest or sensor devices that can be easily and directly installed into payload fairings or onto the valve body, injector, thrust controller, or at the nozzle of a thruster unit as to convert kinetic (vibratory) energy directly to electrical energy.  These optionally come electronics pre-integrated in rugged, low profile, formats that make them very easy to install. There are a number of other broad applications in support of NASA missions that this new technology has relevance to include a range of extreme environment missions. These high temperature energy harvester/sensor devices could also find important use for low thrust rocket technology as to include launch vehicle reaction control, attitude control and positioning of satellites, station keeping for geosynchronous satellites, and retropropulsion.  These devices may also have key use in energy conversion or monitoring of energetic fuel fed chambers.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Target commercial applications include aerospace, energy, industrial process, and automotive. The energy sector for example, has operational equipment that with parts that are subject to high temperature where standard transducer technologies cannot operate.  These new high temperature capable energy-scavenging devices can be installed as to make use of the energy of structural vibration from mechanical systems induced by flowing gases and liquids. Self-contained versions of these energy harvester and sensor devices that reduce engineer install needs to just attaching a couple of wires, and similarly and wireless versions have many further opportunities in aerospace, especially aircraft, space propulsion systems, and (ship) steam generator systems. The ability to install-and-forget? high performance/high temperature capable energy harvesting mechanisms and sensors can provide reliable wireless continuous remote monitoring that can improve the reliability of risk based inspection and reduce expensive shut downs of plant and equipment.

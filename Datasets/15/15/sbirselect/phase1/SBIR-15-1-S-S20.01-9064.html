		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The goal of the Phase I program is to demonstrate the potential for our approach and mitigate program risks for future development efforts. To achieve this goal, we will evaluate system level trade-offs, then design and simulate the key components. The system trade study followed by requirement definition will evaluate radiometry architectures and various PolyStrata implementations. Once a temperature detection level is decided upon, PolyStrata options will be evaluated on size, weight and power. Critical components will be designed including full wave EM modeling. Following the design, a filter section of the multiplexer and the LNA module will be fabricated and tested. The filter will specifically be tested for design and process repeatability whereas the module will evaluate LNA integration and mechanical module design features.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Nuvotronics' Compact G Band radiometer is applicable to small satellite or CubeSat applications such as CubeSat Hydrometric Atmospheric Radiometer Mission (CHARM). In this case it is potential that a series of small satellites would operate in a constellation providing increased coverage and revisit time.  Other applications could include missions similar to Surface Water and Ocean Tomography (SWOT) where millimeter wave radiometers provide vital information regarding the water vapor content which is used to calibrate the larger altimetry system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Millimeter wave radiometers are commercially used for security imagining systems.  While the bulk of imaging systems occur at W band frequencies, there is a trend toward utilizing the upper mmWave and sub mmWave regions for increased resolution.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A microgravity-compatible Continuous Brine Evaporation Cartridge (CBEC) is proposed for greater than 95% water recovery from highly contaminated wastewater without concern for precipitation of organic and inorganic solids.  The CBEC utilizes a small, counter flow evaporation chamber and heat exchange technologies, which reduce Equivalent System Mass (ESM) for water recovery via an evaporation system.  A gas phase catalytic oxidizer converts organic contaminants in the moist air stream to carbon dioxide and water.  The CBEC system dramatically lowers consumables and reduces long-term waste storage requirements compared to a traditional wick evaporation system.  Highly contaminated wastewater streams such as urine, hygiene water, and RO brines are major wastewater streams for the CBEC.  The Phase I project will focus on development of the counter flow wick evaporation cartridge and the catalytic oxidizer.  The Phase II will incorporate thermal efficiency and mechanical durability to improve ESM of the CBEC system and result in delivery of 2 prototype systems, one large scale and the other for testing in microgravity.  These efforts will be the foundation for the design and construction of a flight ready prototype for use on the International Space Station.  The CBEC process will exceed the goal of 95% water recovery by 2022 set forth by NASA in the space technology roadmap.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA application for this technology will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future, long duration exploration objectives beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) where efficient, reliable, and low-maintenance water reclamation systems will play a critical role in reducing ECLSS logistics.  The CBEC technology provides a simple, microgravity compatible method to recover water from highly contaminated wastewater and brines without concern for organic and inorganic solids.  The use of a counter flow evaporation cartridge, catalytic oxidation, and heat exchange technology will lower the ESM for this technology compared to conventional air evaporation technologies.  Such a water recovery system will be purchased as Flight Hardware by NASA, or by an aerospace contracting firm on behalf of NASA, resulting in enhanced capability in support of manned missions beyond LEO, where minimization of expendables, reliability, and simple operation are highly valued.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This specialized, innovative technology cannot compete effectively against large-scale distillation or reverse osmosis based desalination processes; however, the CBEC technology is ideal for smaller scale or specialty applications due to its simplicity, small size, and ability to rapidly produce pure water and permanently contain salts.  These applications include routine or emergency water production and the reduction of wastewater disposal volumes aboard ships, at industrial sites, or where nuclear wastes require concentration and confinement.  Other highly advantageous commercial applications include the recovery of valuable salts from concentrated solutions where relatively low temperature recovery is required and the destruction of volatile components is desired.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The QS Team will develop an Innovative Microbial Surface Sampling (IMSS) device design and provide prototype kits for use in the International Space Station (ISS).  The sampler will meet key design characteristics including:  design based on QS?s BisKit macrofoam sponge; able to withstand Gamma irradiation and/or autoclave; allow sampling up to 1M2  in a single sample; contain up to 15 ml of buffer within the sampler and not release buffer during sampling at low pressure (8 psi); designed so as to allow a small sample of buffer to be extracted while in the ISS for local plating; be as compact as possible; have a two year shelf life; easy for ISS staff to use; stable in storage for up to six weeks; certified sterile and have a verified DNA background  ? below 1000 rRNA gene copies.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The intended use of this IMSS device is to sample up to 1m2 surface areas within the ISS.  Device will be configured to allow liquid samples to be taken in the ISS for plating and also retain remaining buffer for transport back to Earth for subsequent analysis. <BR><BR>The IMSS may not replace the existing SSK, but may augment the SSK providing buffer when transported back to Earth which can be used for gene sequencing and indentification of potentially hazardous bacteria, viruses, molds, etc. on surfaces within the ISS.<BR><BR>This has been a general weakness of the existing SSK.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The IMSS device could also be used to Commercial sample clean rooms where stringent sampling requirements call for a very low background of DNA. <BR><BR>The IMSS could also be used by DoD personnel to conduct Sensitive Site Exploitation (SSE) sampling missions.  QS is currently working another SBIR to develop a SSE sampling kit for the Gold Standard US CBRNE Sampling Teams.  These Teams mission includes sites involving high value national security targets.  The IMSS may become a component of this kit.

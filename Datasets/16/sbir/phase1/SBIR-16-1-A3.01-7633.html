		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The chief innovation is the development of a Predictive Query Language that populates databases with future information provided from aviation models, along with integration to social media networking to augment research, with an overarching web-based system for finding and generating aviation-oriented research questions.  The innovation is intended to aid stakeholders in their analysis of current trends and future concepts, and to show its utility we propose using the toolkit to investigate the Trajectory-Based Operations concept, in particular how the future state of the NAS as predicted by the federated models will be different with TBO than without it.  <BR>NASA is interested in enhancing system capacity by using existing aviation assets more efficiently or by expanding capacity through new technology or smart infrastructure planning.  One aspect that is key to this idea is the involvement of the stakeholders, in particular the airlines and the traveling public.  Stakeholder involvement is key to many FAA programs, and stakeholders are often represented during NASA programs.  Increasing stakeholder involvement, and including the traveling public in some of the projects, will help focus NASA research energy towards high-impact areas that are likely to result in earlier concept implementation.    In addition, NASA is interested in using existing models more effectively, allowing past investment on models to yield future returns.  The proposed PQL is a large step in that direction. <BR>The proposed SWIFT program enables answering  vital questions about existing projects as well as providing the stakeholder involvement to enhance new projects.  The concept is to integrated existing models and insights from social media into a web-based tool that allows stakeholders (including NASA) to ask and answer �what if� questions about various topics easily and conveniently.  The insights provided by the answers will help guide stakeholder decision making.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Within NASA, the immediate application is as a useful user interface for the SMART-NAS system.  Imagine a researcher being able to access SMART-NAS from his desktop and generate a useful result from otherwise complicated and hard-to-use models.  Imagine what a game-changer it would be if FAA analysts could run a system-wide study using the NASA-developed ACES model with a few clicks of a button?  <BR>In the meantime, the PQL statements provide a useful common language in which different analysts from different organizations, using both publicly-available as well as proprietary models, can communicate.  A user from the FAA�s Technical Center using their SIMMOD program can generate a PQL statement describing their use of SIMMOD in a way that an analyst at NASA Ames Research Laboratory, who is skilled in ACES but otherwise unaware of SIMMOD, can understand.   In other words, the researcher at the Tech Center has, in a few short lines of text, described completely to the researcher at Ames what s/he is doing with SIMMOD.  The Ames researcher should be able to replicate that analysis within ACES (assuming that the analysis is based on features that are available in both models, even if implemented entirely differently).  In other words, the SWIFT system, with  its embedded PQL, allows communication between researchers to occur in a manner heretofore difficult, if not practically impossible

		<BR>
		Outside of NASA, we imagine that desktop analysis engines would become commonplace in the future.  Database systems will be extended to include whole models to populate tables, and predictive querly languages like PQL will become a standard.  In the future, fast-running (or even slow-running) models will be invoked through web-formatted PQL statements much like extant data can be easily accessed from a desktop using web-generated SQL statements.  Data mining, which for now relies on existing data to predict future trends, will be extended to include model-based future predictions to create future data for which future trends will be uncovered.  Data mining both past and predicted future data will be a burgeoning field that will extend the scope and reach of analysts.<BR>Is this vision too far-fetched?  That beyond NASA, a system such as PQL will become standard and open the door to new horizons?  We believe that this vision, if anything, is too restrictive.  The explosion of computing technology in the future, with the advent of qbit-based Quantum Computers, as well as the under-exploitation of computer technology today, will provide a new platform on which future analysts will be able to conduct research in ways currently unimaginable.  A system like SWIFT will likely exploit these capabilities.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		EPIR Inc. and Brimrose Technology Corporation propose a miniaturized spectrometer covering the 0.35 to 2.3um wavelength range by integrating a Hg1-xCdxTe (MCT) - based photodetector (PD) with an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF). The goal is to achieve 4um spectral resolution with wide dynamic range to measure both the Sun's and the Moon's radiometric characteristics. Currently the best known infrared photon detectors used for spectroscopy are based on MCT. With an adjustable bandgap and little lattice mismatch, MCT photon detectors with high quantum efficiency are sensitive to a very broad spectral range. The proposing company, EPIR, is the leading small business in MCT growth, characterization and focal plane array (FPA) fabrication. The spectroscopic filter is an important component of any spectrometer. Compared with other technologies, e.g. Michelson or Offner interferometers, the proposed AOTF offers high spectral resolution, with the advantages of high speed, programmable waveband selection flexibility, and arbitrary wavelength step size. An AOTF has no moving parts and can be integrated with a MCT photodetector monolithically. The biggest advantage of the proposed spectrometer is its compact system design that reduced size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP), offering significant benefits to the payload as well as in the operation of missions.

		The compact, short wavelength infrared (SWIR) spectrometer, or hyperspectral camera fabricated by integrating a MCT-based PD or focal plane array FPA with an AOTF, has huge potential applications in future NASA missions to Mars, Jupiter, and other space exploration missions. Besides quantitative irradiance or radiance measurements and calibrations of celestial bodies, atmospheric infrared absorption spectra, or the reflectivity of the ground soil often reveal the identity of the atmospheric composition and the mineral structures of an unknown planets, and are of significant importance to study the formation and the history of alien planets as well as monitoring and surveying different characteristics of Earth.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The infrared PDs have applications in threat warning systems, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) ground and airborne, including small to medium size unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and missile threat defense. This technology would also be applicable for various targeting, tracking, active pixel components, countermeasures and proximity fuse applications. Since hyperspectral detection allows for unparalleled target identification, it is expected that this technology will provide a strategic advantage in missile seekers to circumvent counter-measures.<BR>The infrared PDs and FPAs also have a wide range of civilian applications, such as telecommunication via optical fibers, spectrometry, thermometry, high-end industrial manufacturing, and hotspot detection. Larger FPAs, due to their lower costs and lightweight characteristics, will have applications in astronomy, geophysics, geology, law enforcement, remote environmental sensing, search and rescue, and emergency response including firefighting. If multistage thermo-electric coolers are used, the product would also have applications for medical systems, commercial airlines, and ground transportation.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Peregrine proposes the combination and use of of Be-38Al, electroless nickel plating, and single point diamond turning to create precision x-ray grazing optical surfaces. Large x-ray telescopes will demand large, high stiffness, and lightweight substrates to provide rigidity to support the production of nested optical surfaces while requiring accurate alignment through the use of stable support structures. Ideally, these nested x-ray mirrors would be of heavy metal, microns in thickness and be self-supporting through launch, this is currently impractical. However, near ideal x-ray optics can be produced with the low density material of Be-38Al backing a thin layer of electroless nickel with precision single point diamond turned surfaces. The use of Be-38Al can yield lightweight, precise, and stable substrates. Coefficient of thermal expansion matching electroless nickel can be deposited thinly on top of the Be-38Al substrates, and then single point diamond turned to optical finishes. In addition, Be-38Al is a proven structural material that can be readily fabricated into precision members to create support structures to align and create entire large, athermal x-ray telescopes.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The development and verification of the Be-38Al/NiP/SPDT system to yield x-ray optics will enable future NASA large telescopes to be built and launched. Where there may be commercial opportunities, the key focus of this post SBIR activity will be on large next generation NASA x-ray telescopes.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Where this technology is focused on x-ray optics and telescopes, it can be beneficial in regards to commercial scanners and x-ray inspection devices. This proposed material system and processing technology can provide the accuracy needed to improve most scanners and optical x-ray systems used for non-destructive examination. This will be of particular interest in the NDE of semiconductors.

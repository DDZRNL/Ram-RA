		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Avionic for Low Altitude High Density SUAS � Dynamic Configurable Dual ADS-B with Interrogation<BR><BR>Flight Safety in the NAS consists of multiple layers � Flight Planning, routing, Radar coverage, transponder coverage, and Dual band ADS-B are examples.  This proposal will focus on optimization of the existing active RF Dual band ADS-B and transponder system for use with anticipated large numbers of SUAS.  <BR><BR>SUAS will often be operating in areas and at altitudes that will not be visible to the existing FAA infrastructure.  They will also have much higher densities of aircraft than the current infrastructure can handle.  <BR><BR>This Proposal will investigate the use of  very small software defined transceiver technology (under 1 oz)  tri-band avionics  that include  the ability to receive full UAT including ADS-B, ES ADS-B, and  Mode A,C, and S transponder responses that can keep track of all transmitting aircraft.   The SUAS will also transmit low power UAT ADS-B with dynamically configurable time slots allowing very high density of SUAS.  Included will also be the use of a low power �all call� interrogator when the operational area is not already interrogated by a local source.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Small High performance low CSWaP (Cost, Size, Weight and Power)  Avionic systems suitable for use on SUAS will also be useful for manned  aircraft and space platforms.   The performance evaluation of the avionic approaches can be applied to any type of flight vehicle or ground station and used to help determine optimum avionic packages for them.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The performance of small CSWaP (Cost, Size, Weight and Power) avionic systems  has applications to all air and ground vehicles for commercial and military uses.  Full situational awareness with the use of properly configured avionic packages is a universal need for all vehicles, manned and unmanned.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		An instrument is proposed for non-intrusive measurements of velocity in the plume of a large rocket engine of the type used in the first or second stage of a launch vehicle. The method is laser-based and has the potential for standoff distances in the tens of meters, so optical components can be a safe distance from the hot gases. The diagnostic does not require flow seeding, works over the full temperature range, and covers the full range of velocities of a typical rocket engine. The method, hydroxyl tagging velocimetry (HTV), has already been successfully demonstrated on a small rocket engine. The proposed effort will adapt this technique to large engines by minimizing the effects of beam attenuation and beam steering due to turbulence and developing a robust beam delivery and detection system. Because OH molecules survive at high temperatures for appreciable lifetimes, it is anticipated that the HTV technique will work in even the highest temperature rocket plumes. The proposed diagnostic will provide measurements not obtainable by current methods and will enable experimental data that can be used for validating computer models of rocket engine performance.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA?s goals of returning humans to the Moon and sending humans to Mars and beyond present exciting challenges that will require significant advancements in propulsion technology. Current methods for developing hydrogen- and hydrocarbon-fueled engines rely largely on trial-and-error testing. Accurate computer models can significantly reduce the cost of hardware development, but current models are limited by a lack of experimental data needed for validation. The proposed velocity diagnostic would provide crucial data that is needed for the development, qualification, and acceptance process of present and future computer models.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A successful velocity diagnostic for large rocket engine plumes would have broad application across the worldwide aerospace propulsion industry. Military applications include rockets, missiles, scramjets, and turbine engines, as well as new concepts in propulsion such as pulse detonation engines. Commercial applications include the development of new turbofan designs that will require improved diagnostics for achieving increased efficiency. MetroLaser will pursue these military and commercial markets with a commercial version of the Phase II prototype

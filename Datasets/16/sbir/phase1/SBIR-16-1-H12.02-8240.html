		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Crew health and performance are critical to successful space explorations. However, long duration missions present numerous risks to crew health and performance. Human exploration missions beyond low earth orbit (LEO) will present additional challenges. These missions will require technology solutions for crew health care to address physiological, psychological, performance, and other needs in-situ, e.g., self-sufficiency, since real-time medical support from the earth, and emergency evacuation will not be available. Onboard personal health-tracking tools for health monitoring, health risk assessment and management will be needed for the crews in order to predict his/her future health conditions. Therefore, missions beyond LEO will require a new generation of capabilities and systems, which will be built upon existing capabilities and incorporate technologies yet to be developed. Lynntech proposes image-based photoplethysmography, in combination with, smart machine-learning algorithms which will primarily utilize onboard high-quality video cameras. The proposed system will: (1) constantly monitor vital physiological signs data, (2) ensure their acceptability,  (3) identify their unusual or abnormal patterns, (4) perform diagnosis and prognosis, as well as, (5) provide necessary risk mitigation and medical intervention options to maintain crew performance optimal and sustained throughout the mission.

		<BR>
		The proposed technology will utilize onboard technologies (e.g., high quality video cameras, infra-red sensors) to passively monitor NASA crews while they are on exploration mission beyond low earth orbit. This technology will not only monitor vital physiological parameters, but also will provide risk mitigation strategies and required medical interventions. This will especially helpful in situations when there is not be any real-time communication with the ground control, and emergency evacuation is not feasible. The proposed technology can also be used in the International Space Station to monitor crew health, and make them aware of any abnormal pattern, as well as, provide risk-mitigation strategies. This will help ISS crews to stay in good health during their mission.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The passive vital signs monitoring technology to be developed in this project will play a crucial role in healthcare industry. US health care system is struggling with aging population, prevalence of chronic diseases, and accompanying rising cost. It is envisioned that future healthcare system should be preventive, predictive, preemptive, personalized, and pervasive. The proposed algorithm will be capable of processing physiological information collected from other sensor systems (e.g., wearable), and make prognosis and diagnosis, as well as, provide plans for risk mitigation and medical intervention. Therefore, it can easily be a part of healthcare solution for home, sanatoriums, as well as, hospitals. In addition, the proposed technology will be beneficial for those who leave in low-resource settings, where access to healthcare facility is not easy.

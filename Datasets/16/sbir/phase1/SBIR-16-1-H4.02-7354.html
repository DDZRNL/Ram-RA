		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Development of an advanced lightweight Trace Contaminant Control filter will play a critical role in the viability of life support systems for future space and interplanetary missions.<BR><BR>Serionix has developed proprietary adsorptive coatings which can be applied to both porous and nonporous substrates to yield functional composite media capable of rapid, efficient, adsorption of trace ammonia and formaldehyde. In preliminary testing, this flexible system has exhibited 7 times higher ammonia capacity relative to conventional phosphoric-impregnated activated carbon.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this Phase I effort is to design and demonstrate a lightweight, high performing system for removal of ammonia and formaldehyde from next generation spacecraft and space suits. Systems for both vacuum-swing and single use adsorption will be extensively evaluated. Secondary performance characteristics such as pressure drop, flammability, and gravimetric/volumetric efficiency will be quantified internally while media prototypes will be delivered to NASA for evaluation.<BR><BR>Building off of a successful Phase I demonstration, the focus of Phase II will be to optimize the system and prototype components to yield mass and volume savings for NASA life support systems. Parallel goals include demonstration of full-scale manufacturing capability and commercialization into industrial applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Because ammonia and other VOCs pose a great risk to the health of astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), this technology will potentially be of great value to broader NASA missions in addition to the primary focus of PLSS contaminant control.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Army: there is substantial overlap in the performance requirements for military collective protection systems and spacecraft/personal life support systems. We are actively pursuing commercial and demonstration opportunities with the Department of Defense related to our previous Army SBIR contract.<BR><BR>Industrial Application: the single-use media has been successfully demonstrated in a leading chip manufacturer's cleanroom for 6 months. We have received a purchase order for 1200 square feet, and are pursuing related opportunities in a broad range of additional markets.<BR><BR>Residential application: the single-use media is also effective at removing ammonia and other pet odor components in residential settings. The visual indication of filter life has proven to be a great feature for improving customer awareness of air quality and filter performance. Serionix has received tremendous interest and feedback from pet owners, and has decided to actively pursue the billion dollar residential air purifier market.

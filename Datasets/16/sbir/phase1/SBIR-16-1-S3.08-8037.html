		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Future NASA Earth science and Space missions will benefit from spectroscopic measurements made using compact, energy efficient and inexpensive instruments, which do not sacrifice performance compared to today�s instruments, but can be deployed on small-form-factor, energy-constrained platforms such as micro-satellites, airborne vehicles, and planetary rovers. Microtek Inc. will develop a multi-band spectrometer which provides high spectral resolution, comparable to that of a conventional Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, but more than a factor of ten thousand smaller in size and lighter in weight by leveraging recent advances in microphotonics technology, and replace the mechanically-controlled delay element of the conventional instrument by electrically-controlled phase shifters within microphotonic semiconductor waveguides for faster operation by a factor of one thousand. Underlying this device is the concept of slow-light in micro-photonic structures as demonstrated in scientific laboratories.  By leveraging silicon wafer foundry processing, we will leverage scalable manufacturing for integrated photonics, and Microtek has demonstrated expertise in multi-chip packaging design and assembly previously used to develop micro-spectrometers and other compact instruments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed instrument can server as a compact visible, infrared, or multi-band spectrometer with ultra-compact form factor and superior speed, without compromising resolution, in size, weight and power (SWaP)-constrained systems such as micro-satellites, small airborne vehicles or rovers. By using foundry-fabricated silicon-based microchips for parts of the instrument, the manufacturing costs may be reduced through scalable manufacturing of integrated photonics. Miniature infrared spectrometers can be used for monitoring the Earth�s atmosphere, including CO2 and methane, among other important gases, or for future planetary and comet explorers.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed instrument may have applications in breath analysis, medical diagnostics, forensics, rapid disaster recovery and threat analysis, commercial geospatial studies, pollution mapping and environmental quality monitors. Together with compact lasers, micro-spectrometers may be used for ranging and material compositional studies of static or moving targets, both for the civilian and the defense industries. Microtek has previously developed compact spectrometers for commercial companies which have diverse applications in these and other areas.

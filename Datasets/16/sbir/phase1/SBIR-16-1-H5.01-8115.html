		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		CRG proposes to advance the solar sail boom system with a bi-stable, deployable, composite boom which implements a composite electrically activated shape memory polymer (EASMP) to transition the matrix with characteristics representing an elastomer, for storage and deployment, into a thermoset creating a rigid boom. This bi-stable solution will allow for a lightweight, reliable, and controlled solution of deployment while consuming less power upon deployment compared to current metal booms. This technology will not be limited by mission; it is scalable for larger solar sails in future missions and missions with similar applications such as the Lunar Flashlight.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Supporting NASA's materials and structures capabilities, specifically at NASA Langley, this project's technologies directly address requirements for lightweight deployable solar sail booms for cubesats.  The proposed technologies offer deployable booms at a fraction of the weight, with reduced deployment power. Through this project, tailoring EASMP for space applications opens a new frontier for novel material applications for various space systems such as, but not limited to; deployable solar arrays, deployable antennas, micro-actuators, variable vibration dampening structures, and tunable signal cancellation panels. Other NASA applications may benefit from the material?s ability to stay flexible and soft below -100?C, such as seals, couplings, or dampers.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This project's technologies, developed for NASA systems, would directly apply to systems operated by other government and commercial enterprises. Government systems that would derive the same benefits would include deployable composites for satellites operated by the Department of Defense, Department of Interior?s EROS, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Federal Aviation Administration. This technology's attributes for tunable composite modulus should yield a high potential for private sector commercialization for various space materials and systems for companies such as Boeing, Sierra Nevada, SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, and many more.

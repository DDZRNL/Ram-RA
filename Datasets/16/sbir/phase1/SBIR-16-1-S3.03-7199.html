		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Leveraging Tyvak personnel?s extensive experience in end-to-end technology development cycles, we propose to design, fabricate and qualify an EPS system targeting 50 to 100W orbit average power. Fitting within a 6U or smaller envelope, this fault-tolerant electrical power system will integrate mission-configurable deployable solar arrays; ultra-efficient, low-noise peak power energy transfer circuitry; high capacity, high cycle and high power capable energy storage; and high-efficiency power regulation & distribution circuitry.  The Phase-I Option of this effort will involve the design and analysis of these systems adhering to a development philosophy of modularity, scalability and testability.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Completion of the proposed phase-II effort will produce a flight qualified high-power electrical power system (EPS).  This EPS will advance small satellite power capabilities, enabling continuous measurement payloads and the associated high-rate data downlink overhead.  By miniaturizing power capabilities currently only achievable in large spacecraft form factors, full-capability programs may enjoy the low-cost, quick turn benefits currently afforded to NASA InVEST technology demonstration missions.     <BR><BR>The proposed flexible architecture will be adaptable to a variety of Earth sensing missions, conducive to fulfilling a number of NASA?s published strategic goals and science plans, especially those concerned with environment change measurement.  Cost and budgeting uncertainty will be minimized throughout these programs through the proposed architecture of standardized component modules and reconfigurable solar arrays.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed flexible architecture will be adaptable to a variety of commercial Earth sensing missions, especially those concerned with comm., weather and multi-spectral imaging ventures.  Cost and budgeting uncertainty will be minimized throughout these programs through the proposed architecture of standardized component modules and reconfigurable solar arrays.

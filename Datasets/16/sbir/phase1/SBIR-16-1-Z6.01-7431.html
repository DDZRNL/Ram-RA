		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal will provide NASA with a family of UHF RFID sensor tags and system components supporting  very reliable, robust, convenient  and economical  deployment into a range of aerospace and terrestrial systems. We propose designs that can be manufactured in quantity.  Several of these tags have SPI,I2C and other data busses and adequate harvested power to enable on-tag microcontroller and multiple discrete sensors. The Phase1 deliverable systems include passive and semi-passive tags both with an application example precision temperature sensor  and 3-D accelerometer. The RFID sensor tags have as standard SPI, I2C, UART and other busses together with a rad-hard supported on an on-tag MSP430FR5739 microcontroller. The data busses on delivered sensor tags can be used to interface with any bus-compatible sensors of NASA choice. The technology we propose in Phase1/2 work provides NASA with features considerably beyond present day commercial offerings. The  antennas for Phase1 sensor tag delivery utilize  our ultra-long range ribbon antenna design which currently holds the world record for maximum UHF fully passive read-range (150ft). In Phase1 we introduce our patents-pending resonant rectenna  which provides additional passive power for sensors  in addition to our basic  ultra-long range antenna.The UHF transponders ICs selected for NASA from NXP and EM have the best RFID tag security algorithms currently available. In Phase1 we introduce our patents-pending rectenna  which provides additional passive power for sensors continuing to use our basic  ultra-long range antenna (rectenna uses an innovative resonant voltage multiplier circuit). It is our vision that New Jersey Microsystems, Inc and its partners following Phase3 work can earn selection from NASA as a preferred supplier of customized UHF RFID passive and semi-passive sensor tags. During Phase1 we will deliver tags with  demo sensors for precision temperature and 3-D inertial application.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are hundreds of potential wireless smart RFID tag sensor applications at NASA across a wide spectrum including sensing temperature, pressure, inertial vectors, corrosion, tampering, chemical environments and electromagnetic field vectors.  We meet these requirements important to NASA:<BR>1. We design for the temperature range -40 to +85degC and operating voltage 2.0 to 3.6V with standard off the shelf components.<BR>2. The RFID sensor tags we propose utilize mass produced CMOS, capacitors, resistors, diodes, GaAs switches all available from highly respected and qualified manufacturers including Texas Instruments, NXP, EM-Microelectronic and CEL-Renesas.<BR>3. Most manufacturers will provide these components with full harsh environment spec including a -40 to +125degC range which is preferred by NASA for many applications.<BR>4. The proposed RFID sensor tags proposed by NJM can be retrofitted or designed into new systems where the many new nanopower sensors with an SPI or I2C databus are available.<BR>5. These wireless sensors can be installed, moved, and replaced easily making systems test and reconfigurations much easier.<BR>6. A single portable or stationary RFID reader interrogator can be linked into an IEEE 802 xxxx network servicing up to thousands of RFID sensor tags.<BR>7.Phase1 tag delivery will provide sensor tags with maximum energy harvesting capability and nominal volume. During Phase2 we propose delivering a family of RFID sensor tags with volumes of less than 1cm3.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are many applications outside NASA for RFID sensor tags with reduced cost of ownership and improved performance. The proposed RFID sensor tags make possible significant improvements in RFID sensors in addition to opening up entirely new areas of application. In many cases the sensors proposed for this NASA work will retrofit into existing systems. The proposed sensor tags are compatible with  Gen2C1 readers currently monitoring the 2B UHF RFID tags are deployed in the world today. Some key application areas are:<BR>1.Monitoring  goods in transit without data logging. Many commodities including flowers, medical supplies including pharmaceuticals, and the general apps with FedEx and UPS.<BR>2.Monitoring  goods in transit with data monitoring:  Monitoring shipments especially pharmaceuticals, food, certain products that are spoiled by either freezing or higher temperatures.  Monitoring for mechanical shock and drops.<BR>3.Monitoring  farm animals and pets:  Includes monitoring animal  movement, temperature, location, time at specific locations, activity levels<BR>4.Industrial process monitoring:  Lower power requirements, longer life, harsh environment operations, and lower cost makes possible new apps for pressure, temperature, fluid and gas flow, and chemical sensing.<BR>5.Agricultural cropland and irrigation management:  Remote applications for monitoring  and control of soil conditions and water supply equipment.<BR>6.Retail stores: Environmental sensing

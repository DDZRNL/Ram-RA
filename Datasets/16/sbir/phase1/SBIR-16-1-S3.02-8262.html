		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		During this Phase I NASA program, Valley Tech Systems (VTS) will develop an innovative solid Reaction Control System (RCS) architecture concept design that can manage pitch, yaw and roll for the MAV as it ascends, completes stage separation, and performs final maneuvers for linking with the carrier satellite. The innovative design will leverage our advanced, long duration, extinguishable and re-ignitable solid propulsion system, coupled with critical Hot Gas Valve and proportional thruster technologies, to provide an optimal solid rocket motor based control system that acts like a liquid solution. Due to the inherent ability of solid propulsive control systems to accommodate cold space environments, the system requires fewer heaters, therefore improving reliability. Moreover, solid control systems have the ability to meet a higher range of thrust with the same thruster set to minimize inert weight and improve vehicle controllability. The Phase I program will conduct top level system trades, design concept layouts, and perform critical technology testing to yield a smooth and clear transition from the Phase I to a Phase II prototype demonstration program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed MAV RCS propulsion system incorporates new controllable solid propulsion technologies that can benefit NASA objectives for reducing cost and complexity of advanced propulsion systems, while maintaining the storability, robustness and performance flexibility of legacy liquid propulsion systems. The proposed RCS concept uses technologies developed for the DoD for essentially similar purposes, filling critical future gaps for system affordability, while providing the war fighter with advanced capabilities. Additional NASA technology applications include lower cost missile launch boost and post boost (satellite) deployment propulsion systems where life cycle cost and system affordability drive technology selection.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The new long duration extinguishable and re-ignitable solid propulsion technology has been in continuous SBIR DoD (MDA, USAF) development over the past 10 years for advanced missile defense interceptor propulsion and strategic missile Post Booster Propulsion System (PBPS) product applications. DoD production application includes: Standard Missile 3 (SM3) Interceptor SDACS Propulsion, SM3 Third Stage Rocket Motor ACS propulsion, Multiple Object Kill Vehicle Interceptor DACS propulsion, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (Minuteman) Post Boost Propulsion and future Navy Fleet Ballistic Missile (FMB) Post Boost Propulsion.

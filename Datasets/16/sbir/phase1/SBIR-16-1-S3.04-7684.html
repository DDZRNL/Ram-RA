		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Barron Associates is proposing a novel atmospheric sensor platform that fills a gap in current sensing capabilities by providing a low-cost, portable technology that can be used for guided remote sensing applications such as cloud characterization, volcanic plume measurements, and polar atmospheric research. The proposed sensor platform consists of compact, tube-deployed UAVs equipped with atmospheric sensors and a custom launch system. Initial development of the sensor-UAV was performed during a NASA Phase I Contract in 2014. Barron Associates is proposing a development schedule that builds upon the prior Phase I technology to mature the sensor-UAV and launch system in preparation for Phase II cloud measurement tests.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The sensor-UAS provides a low-cost atmospheric sensing platform option that requires minimal training for use. As such, the potential NASA applications include many of the atmospheric research areas of interest, as well as some atmospheric sensing applications. The Phase II demonstration application will be a cloud sensing mission for characterizing the cloud content by pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Hurricane research is a second NASA application, with Barron?s UAS able to provide capabilities for wind and PTH sensing in turbulent environments. A third NASA application is volcanic research, measuring ash and particle concentrations, gas species concentrations and winds.  Another application for NASA is for climate research, in particular the measurement of methane in the Arctic. Satellite calibration/validation campaigns represent an additional NASA application as programs such as OLYMPEX are frequently measuring specific atmospheric properties and coverage could be enhanced with the technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA customers include NOAA, DoD, DoE domestically, and international atmospheric researchers with similar interests to NASA. NOAA is a primary customer with several possible applications. Hurricane researchers at NOAA demonstrated in September of 2014 the use of tube launched, expendable UAVs for atmospheric science in a hurricane. Wildfire monitoring is a second application for NOAA. The DoE desires small UAV methane sensing capability. The DoD has ongoing interest in the use of small, expendable UAVs for reconnaissance, ordinance delivery and battlespace awareness. International agencies conducting atmospheric science for clouds, climate, volcanoes, hurricanes and the arctic would all be potential customers.

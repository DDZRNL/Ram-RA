		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate has declared ultra-efficient commercial air vehicles a strategic area for development in the coming decade. With no foreseeable alternatives, advanced gas turbine propulsion will continue to power future subsonic transport aircraft. As a result, engine manufacturers are devoting significant effort to increasing fuel efficiency and pushing engines toward higher fan bypass ratios (BPRs). With fan speed already limiting allowable fan sizes, higher BPR requires new, smaller engine cores. However, component efficiency tends to decrease with decreasing size due in part to enhanced tip leakage and secondary flows. Many of the existing technologies designed to mitigate losses associated with these flow structures have only been investigated in conventional machines, under steady approximations, and/or in single components or stages. Also, they often address only a particular loss mechanism in a given flow structure. The proposed SBIR project innovates on existing mitigation strategies from a practical, holistic perspective to generate novel aerodynamic devices tailored to improve the efficiency of multi-stage, small-core turbines while also accounting for their inherently unsteady nature. The proposed devices, including tip leakage control and endwall treatments for secondary flow control, will be designed by accounting for each loss mechanism in the targeted flow structure and the device's influence on the unsteady flow field in the current stage and upstream and downstream stages. Successful designs will ensure increases in component efficiency also increase engine overall efficiency by avoiding offsetting reduction in loss in one stage with increased loss in another. In Phase I, numerical simulations will be used to devise and characterize feasible loss mitigation technologies. This foundational work will provide justification for comprehensive analysis and experimental evaluation of the most promising concepts in Phase II.

		<BR>
		Strategic Thrust 3: Ultra-Efficient Commercial Vehicles in the ARMD "Strategic Implementation Plan" establishes specific efficiency levels for subsonic transport aircraft. Key to obtaining these ambitious goals will be development of more efficient, higher-fan-BPR engine architectures, which because of physical limitations on fan size will require more compact engine cores. This need motivates the Advanced Air Transport Technology (AATT) Project's Technical Challenge (TC) 4.2 to investigate materials and concepts for a "Compact High OPR Gas Generator." By developing solutions for mitigating tip leakage and other secondary flows in small-core engine designs, the technologies to be developed in the proposed effort have the potential to make substantial contributions toward realizing the aircraft engine architecture and fuel efficiency targets set forth by NASA. The proposed effort will also be aligned with the objective of TC4.2, developing OPR 50+ gas generators without affecting noise or component life, and well timed with the goal of achieving TRL4 technologies by 2019. In particular, NASA's Compact Gas Turbine Sub-Project has awarded NRA contracts under TC4.2 to Pratt & Whitney and General Electric to begin developing high-pressure compressor technologies and loss mitigation methods. ATA intends to engage both organizations in the performance of the envisioned project to investigate technology transfer opportunities.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The turbomachinery efficiency improvements that may be realized by the envisioned aerodynamic devices (blade tip geometries, rotor casing, and/or endwall treatment) will provide ubiquitous benefit to nearly all turbomachinery applications. In addition to aircraft propulsion applications, the technologies could enable reduced fuel consumption and carbon emissions for a wide spectrum of Brayton-cycle power-generation applications. Secondary applications with similar increasing demands on efficiency include auxiliary power units (APUs), industrial power generation, and turbine-electric transmissions such as those on ocean vessels. Because the tip leakage mitigation mechanisms may have applicability in both the compression and turbine stages of these products, numerous derivative applications may be possible.

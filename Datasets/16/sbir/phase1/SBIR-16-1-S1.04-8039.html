		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The next generation of wide-field survey instruments with improved angular and energy resolution for research into astrophysical transient X-ray phenomena is currently under development. A scalable detector plane architecture has been developed at Harvard using CZT detector arrays for use in high resolution coded-aperture telescopes.<BR>Despite decades of research, the yield of device grade CZT is still quite low. In addition, internal defects cause spatial distortions in images. To meet the needs of hard X-ray astronomy a lower cost, more uniform and more readily available alternative to CZT is desirable.<BR>Thallium bromide (TlBr) has higher density and atomic number than CZT and therefore higher stopping power at hard X-ray energies. TlBr has a low melting point (460 &#8304;C, compared to ~ 1100 &#8304;C for CZT) and cubic crystal structure and can be grown from the melt by low cost techniques. As a result, TlBr has the potential to be a more efficient, lower cost alternative to CZT in the detector plane architecture developed by Harvard for use in high resolution coded-aperture telescopes.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The TlBr based spectroscopic imaging array that we propose to develop should be suitable for the next generation of wide-field hard X-ray coded-aperture imagers currently under development (cf. the ProtoEXIST and HREXI programs). It is anticipated that this technology will eventually be employed as part of a Medium Class Explorer (MIDEX) mission similar to that of the proposed Energetic X-Ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST) and will probe X-ray transient phenomena with an improved sensitivity, energy resolution and angular resolution. This will enable the monitoring of a variety of phenomena, including tidal disruption events (TDE), supernova (SN), soft-gamma repeaters (SGR), X-Ray Flashes (XRF), the mapping of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) distribution out to redshifts exceeding z=10, as well as neutron stars (NS) and black holes (BHs) at all mass scales in a variety of environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to NASA-related space applications, this technology offers considerable potential in other areas, including nuclear and particle physics, nuclear non-proliferation, medical imaging, environmental monitoring, non-destructive testing, and geological exploration. Nuclear medicine techniques such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) would also benefit from the development of this detector technology.

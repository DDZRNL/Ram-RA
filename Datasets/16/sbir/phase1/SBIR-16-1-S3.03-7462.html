		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		APIQ Semiconductor proposes development of a scalable, wide bandgap (WBG) monolithic power integrated circuit (MPIC) technology for power electronic conversion, management, and distribution. The proposed WBG microelectronics are to be based upon low defect, homogeneous gallium nitride (GaN) based materials using native GaN substrates. The technology to be developed will replace silicon power switches and drivers in power electronics systems to yield high efficiency, high density, reliable module based systems. Inclusive in the proposal are devices for 1200 V or more power switching and digital integration. Devices will be evaluated for high temperature and heavy ion radiation hardness, with performance improvements over competing technologies expected from low materials defects and carefully managed electric field profiles.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology for development is intended to apply across multiple NASA mission systems, primarily in power conversion, management, and distribution. Applications include power bus conditioning and management from radio isotope, solar electric, or energy storage sources. The scalable power integrated circuit technology may be deployed within low voltage cubesat/nanosat platforms to large, high voltage, high power platforms and vehicles.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology will benefit applications including whole building DC systems, data center power supplies, energy storage and renewable energy converters and inverters, industrial motor drivers, and electrical traction systems. It is expected that much of the scientific findings and technology from this SBIR will advance important systems in renewable energy and CO2 reduction. The proposed microelectronics can be applied in energy conditioning and integration for wind, solar, and energy storage applications. The technologies are also needed for high efficiency control, conversion, and distribution of electricity to reduce energy demand and consumption. The Phase I study results can contribute to reduction in CO2 emissions by increasing renewable energy generation and by reducing losses and consumption.

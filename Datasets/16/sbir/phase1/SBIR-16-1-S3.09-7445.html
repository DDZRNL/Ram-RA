		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		During space-flight system design, choice in electronic components/devices is an important choice when considering maximum failure tolerance from space radiation effects.  A technology that can provide enhanced reliability of flight electronics by significantly reducing exposed radiation damage with minimum shield mass offers improved chances for mission success, and thus reducing system errors, saving program cost and resources.  Powdermet proposes the development of a gradient-Z powder additive for plastics that can transform them into effective radiation shields.  The elective ease of radiation hardening off-the-shelf electronics with an easily applied shielding encapsulate reduces cost and time to launch.  The technical approach will be in the computational validation and experimental verification of a gradient-Z micropowder composite additive for granting radiation shielding to plastics.  These will be compared to conventional gradient-Z metal lay-up designs.  Additional, the program will demonstrate the additive manufacturing capacity of gradient-Z micropowder composites.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This program proposes the technological advancement in further improving upon radiation shielding efficiency in effective shielding with lower mass and volume.  The academic merit contribution is an experimental approach to understanding the microscale effect gradient-Z type shielding can offer over macroscale lay-up design.  Powdermet and MR&D anticipate publishing these results.  In addition, the design of gradient-Z micropowder additive enables simple and cost/time efficient routs for preparing shielding to harden electronics to radiation exposure.  NASA will benefit from an expanded understanding on the capability of gradient-Z shielding designs and with phase II & III optimization development, have at its "use" an easily applicable effective shielding material for protecting electronics, cargo, and crew during orbit and deep space travels.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Powdermet envisions this radiation shielding powder additive having additional application with non-NASA space application that includes the commercial market satellites in LEO and MEO.  Industries outside space considerations that could use Powdermet's shielding additive include:<BR>1.	Health Industry - radiology electronic components<BR>2.	Department of Defense - nuclear blast radiation shielding<BR>3.	Particle Accelerators - electronic components and tight joints<BR>4.	Nuclear Facilities - electronics and tight joints

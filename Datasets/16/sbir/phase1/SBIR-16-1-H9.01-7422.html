		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		There have been significant interests from NASA in integrated optical transceiver chips for space optical communications, in particular space-qualifiable 1550nm laser transmitter and receiver with optoelectronic laser, modulator, and detector, that are capable of data rates from 1Gb/sec to 200Gb/sec. The power efficiency shall be better than 10W per Gb/sec and weight less than 100g per Gb/sec. In addition, hybrid RF-optical technologies are sought, and technology based on integrated photonic circuit solution is strongly desired.Operational range of -20� C to +50� C unpowered temperature cycling from -40� C to +40� C are also desired.To address the above mentioned interests, our proposed works will focus on realizing 100-200Gb/sec high-data-rate Wavelength-Division-Multiplexed (WDM) photonic transceiver module with the capability to transmit RF signals on optical beam as well that will be able to meet the above NASA requirements, based on a few key technologies we have developed including: (a) WDM Laser Transmitter with Concurrent Wavelength Locking Capability;(b) Ultra-Compact Wavelength Mux/DeMux; (c) Integrated Narrow Linewidth Laser;(d) Integrated 20-40Gb/sec High-Speed Electro-Optic Modulator with Low-Voltage Capability; (e) Polarization-Insensitive Multi-Mode-Fiber-Capable Integrated 100-200Gb/sec WDM Optical Receiver with Fail-Safe Wavelength and Power Recovery Capabilities; (f) Ruggedized Wide-Temperature-Range Chip Packaging Module.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		For Non NASA Applications, the main application area is high-gigabit/s laser transmitter and receiver optical-electronic subsystems: space qualifiable 1550 nm laser transmitter and receiver for data rates from 1 gigabits/s to >200 gigabits/s with power efficiency better than 10W per gigabit/s and mass efficiency better than 100 g per gigabit/s. Technologies for efficient waveform modulation, detection, and synchronization are desired. Integrated photonic circuit solutions are strongly desired. Applications include greatly increasing the data volume returns from space missions in multiple domains.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		For Non NASA Commercial Applications, the main market areas are computer Interconnect and Optical Network.Include Optical Transceiver Modules (OTMs) and �Active Optical Cables� (AOCs), used widely in data centers and networks. AOC market is $500 Mil/yr and the OTM is $4.4 Bil/yr currently. Other applications include coherent communications for network, and chip-to-chip optical interconnects with estimated market size of $300 Mil/year.

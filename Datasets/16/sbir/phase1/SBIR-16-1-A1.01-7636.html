		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA and other government agencies have been plagued by aeroelasticity of aircraft structures for a long time. The traditional approach has been to build stiff structures for suppressing aeroelastic effects. However, the increase in computational technology has enabled a careful analysis of aeroelastic effects, and design of lightweight structures. However, a direct CFD-CSD coupling is still too expensive to be used for control simulations and design. To address this critical need, IAI is developing reduced order models to capture the necessary physics, while enabling much more efficient computation. Our RACA approach will systematically study ROM technology and develop the appropriate methods for our particular application of interest � supersonic low-boom aircraft. We will develop a full-fledged aeroelastic analysis framework as well, to provide simulation-based verification results. The ROMs developed will then be used for control system design and demonstration of adaptive control technologies for advanced flexible aircraft.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed body of work addresses a critical need in NASA�s repository of tools and techniques to develop high performance and supersonic civilian aircraft: a reliable physics-based simulation testbed to test different unconventional and advanced aircraft designs. NASA has been extensively investing in aeroelastic research, through programs such as Active Aeroelastic Wing (AAW), X-56A Multi-Utility Technology Testbed (MUTT), and Aeroservoelasticity (ASE) project in the High Speed Program. The ASE project in particular, has been focusing on development of aeroelastic modules for supersonic aircraft, and will directly benefit from this research. X-56A has also been looking to augment its controllers to incorporate aeroelastic effects, and will be interested in RACA. Moreover, other programs at NASA that are looking at lightweight aircraft configurations will also be able to use RACA in their design and control simulation efforts.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Other government agencies, such as Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) have also been investigating aeroelastic concepts in collaboration with NASA and industry. The AAW and MUTT programs are specific examples of the above. Moreover, aircraft manufacturers interested in advanced aircraft development are increasingly facing the challenges of high aspect ratio, flexible wing aircraft. To design and reliably develop associated controllers for such aircraft, they need tools to allow rapid analysis of concepts across the entire flight envelope. RACA will provide the industry with such a capability. Moreover, the aeroelastic analysis capability could also be integrated in design frameworks for flexible aircraft design. Lockheed Martin has also been investigating the low-boom supersonic demonstrator, and its aeroelastic properties are yet to be understood. RACA is going to directly address this concern as well.

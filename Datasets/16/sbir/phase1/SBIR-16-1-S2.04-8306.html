		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		X-ray-reflective iridium coatings are required for the construction of highly-nested, light-weight X-ray telescopes that are needed for future NASA X-ray astronomy missions. However Ir coatings also have notoriously high stress. Coating stress will deform the thin-shell mirror substrates, degrading angular resolution. While we have previously developed a zero net-stress reflective Ir/Cr bilayer coating, we nevertheless find significant substrate deformation when these coatings are deposited onto thin-shell cylindrical mirror substrates. The source of the deformation from these zero net-stress coatings remains unclear, but is likely related to coating thickness non-uniformities and substrate edge effects. In any case, the low-frequency figure errors that currently result from the deposition of these zero net-stress coatings are beyond acceptable limits for sub-arc-second mirrors. Consequently, the problem of coating-induced substrate distortion from Ir-based reflective films must be solved in order to meet the needs of future NASA X-ray astronomy missions. <BR><BR>The overall goal of our research is the development of zero net-stress, non-distorting Ir-based coatings for thin-shell mirror substrates that do not induce resolution-degrading substrate distortions. Specifically, we propose to develop (a) zero net-stress Ir-based coatings having film thickness that is highly uniform in two dimensions (axial and azimuthal) when deposited onto cylindrical thin-shell mirror substrates, and (b) 2D-uniformity-controlled Ir-based coatings that will be deposited on both the front (reflecting) and back (non-reflecting) surfaces of thin-shell cylindrical mirror segments, in order that the film stresses on either side of the substrate are made to balance so as to mitigate any significant substrate distortions that will degrade angular resolution.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The successful completion of our proposed SBIR activities will result in the development and commercial availability of non-distorting, X-ray reflective iridium coatings for cylindrical mirror segments that can meet<BR>the performance goals of future NASA X-ray astronomy missions currently being formulated. These same uniform, zero net-stress Ir coatings will also be needed for the production of ultra-flat reflection gratings for X-ray astronomy.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The development of non-distorting, double-side iridium coatings may lead to new applications in the microelectronics and flat panel display industries, where distortions due to film stress are becoming increasingly important.

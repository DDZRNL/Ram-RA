		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Special Aerospace Services (SAS) has detailed knowledge and experience in remote and autonomous launch sites, inclusive of foreign launch sites.  SAS will provide NASA with an analysis of the historic and current trending of the launch vehicle to ground and launch vehicle to payload interfaces.  SAS will accomplish this by leveraging its extensive knowledge of domestic and foreign launch vehicles (traditional and ?new space?) and their associated launch sites.  In leveraging this data, SAS will identify candidates for possible standardization, and where candidates are not available, will develop preliminary concepts for considerations of becoming standards.  <BR>As part of the preparation for this effort, SAS has engaged a robotic and autonomy control company (outside the space industry) to advise SAS on new innovative autonomy technology and its applications for developing non-standard approaches to processing and operating spaceflight vehicles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In the space industry, development of common interfaces and modularity allows the development of servicing systems for the launch vehicles and payloads to be outside the confines of their respective designs and facilities.  This has the potential of producing a large economic value.  This development moves such systems upstream in the process and allows the creation of support service companies focused on servicing the space industry.<BR>As terrestrial development continues, extraterrestrial operations benefit.  In developing the architecture for off-planet operations, this modularity (and its robotic connectivity) allows these extraterrestrial modules to be similar to their terrestrial counterparts and to operate remotely, or even autonomously.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In the chemical industry, SAS has identified certain segments suffering similar circumstances related to inconsistent interfaces.  With the space industry closely resembling the chemical industry (especially with fluid commodities), the chemical industry can also benefit from this effort.<BR>Another industry that could benefit from this effort is the energy industry.  There are many similarities with the space industry, especially when considering the severe environments and high-risk ventures involved.  We have identified aspects of this industry having similar issues when systems interface with one another.<BR>The electric car industry is becoming viable and as such, it is ripe for developing standard interfaces as it matures.  This industry has yet to determine the interface requirements for recharging all electric vehicles in a common manner.  Similar to the space industry, they are in a parochial stage where the driver must use equipment produced by the builder of the electric automobile.

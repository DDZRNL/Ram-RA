		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose a Ka-Band klystron amplifier for use in CubeSats. It will operate at 35.7 GHz, have 400 MHz of bandwidth, and output at least 32 watts of saturated power. Small signal gain will exceed 35 dB. In its final form, it will occupy a space 0.4-inch diameter and less than 0.5-inch in length. The combination of small size, high power, and high frequency obviate the use of solid state power amplifiers. Klystrons are the only technology that can be miniaturized to this degree. We propose an innovative construction technology that involves electrostatic focusing, glass insulator fastening of tube elements, a telescoping collector, and a highly loaded scandate cathode with integral focus electrode capable of 50 A/cm2. In Phase I we will build full performance prototypes. e beam inc. is the world's leader in innovative miniature cathode assemblies, electron guns, and vacuum electron devices generally. It has long promoted the transfer of cathode ray tube construction technology to other devices as a way to reduce size, mass, and cost. It has successfully done this with microwave amplifiers, terahertz mass spectrometers, and x-ray tubes. Some of these designs have been deployed in space.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A major objective of NASA's Science Mission Directorate is to use smaller, more affordable spacecraft. Another goal is multiple experiments on the same launch. This lowers cost and risk. The rapid deployment of small, low-cost remote sensing instruments is essential in meeting these objectives. It has an explicit mission to "reduce the risk, cost, size and development time of SMD observing instruments." This invention meets all those requirements and will find a ready market in NASA earth satellite missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		CubeSats are the enabling technology for space research by universities. This device will provide them with remote sensing capability of clouds, the ioniasphere, other satellites, and earth features. The larger commercial application is its potential for communications. Not only klystrons but broadband TWTs can be fabricated at a fraction of the cost of standard TWTs using this construction technology. There is an important market between 100 and 1000 watts not adequately addressed at this time. These are powers too high for solid state to address efficiently. The power is too low for standard ceramic-metal tube construction to address efficiently, the dollars/watt ratio being too high. Glass electrostatically focused TWTs and klystrons with glass rod construction can be manufactured at one-fifth the cost of ceramic-metal tubes. There are 250,000 cell towers in the U.S. Frequency and power need to go up. This technology provides a way forward.

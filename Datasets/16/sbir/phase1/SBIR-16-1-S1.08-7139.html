		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The remote sensing reflectance signal measured by an ocean color satellite is to first order proportional to the ratio of backscattered to absorbed light. Therefore in situ measurements of absorption and backscattering, as functions of wavelength, along with in situ and satellite radiometery, are key to refinement and calibration of legacy ocean color algorithms, as well as development of next generation ocean color products such as phytoplankton functional type. Currently, commercial instruments exist for in situ measurement of the hyperspectral absorption coefficient, but no instrument exists for measurement of the hyperspectral backscattering coefficient.<BR>We propose to develop an active sensor for in situ measurement of the hyperspectral backscattering coefficient. We are considering a design based on a broadband white source (chopped), monochromator for varying the source beam wavelength, and hyperspectral detectors (receiving at 2-3 angles) using spectrometers that track the monochromator. There are several configurations of the source, monochromator, spectrometer, and detector that can be considered the aim of the proposed work is to simulate a number of instrument configurations and assess technical and commercial feasibility of such hyperspectral backscattering instrument.<BR>The proposed instrument addresses a critical gap in the field of currently available systems for measuring hyperspectral IOPs in situ, in support of hyperspectral ocean color missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The novel proposed sensor for measuring hyperspectral backscattering has wide applicability in the field of ocean optics and ocean biology and biogeochemistry. There are currently no instruments available that make this measurement.NASA scientists and NASA-funded researchers,especially those working on risk reduction and optical IOP-radiometric closure studies as well as phytoplankton functional group algorithms, and increasingly complex biogeochemical and ecosystem models are currently hindered by a lack of ground truth hyperspectral backscattering data. Given the current push within NASA programs in preparation for launch of the PACE ocean color mission and EXPORTS field campaign, development of this system is very timely.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Similar to the NASA applications, the target market for the proposed instrument is broad. Government scientists and agency-funded researchers (many federal agencies including NSF, NRL, ONR, NOAA, and foreign space and environmental agencies) in ocean science routinely measure IOPs for ocean color cal/val.

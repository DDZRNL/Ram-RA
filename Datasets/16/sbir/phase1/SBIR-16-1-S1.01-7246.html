		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Beyond Photonics proposes to develop a highly compact, efficient next-generation single-frequency pulsed transmitter laser for current and future NASA missions focused on laser remote sensing in the short-wave infrared wavelength region near two microns.   More reliable and compact sources of this type are required for NASA and commercial/military applications such as terrestrial and airborne Doppler winds, long-range measurement of molecular CO2 and H2O concentrations in the atmosphere, and identification and tracking of fast moving hard targets (e.g. space debris, asteroids, docking).  We will emphasize the use of small but powerful lasers operating near 2 ?m and capitalize optimally on solid-state laser designs recently developed at Beyond Photonics as well as our team?s extensive past experience with this specific laser technology.  Efficient, compact hybrid approaches using bulk solid-state pulsed transmitters followed by doped-fiber amplification will be a focus to reach flexible performance on the order of 200 ?J/pulse, 0.5-8 kHz PRF, which can serve as an effective transmitter for many applications as-is in both coherent or direct detection lidar architectures, or which can be increased via further amplification as needed.  Operationally flexible Q-switched and injection seeded operation compatible with several different applications with differing requirements will be emphasized.  Very compact efficient MO laser technology will also be exploited and a prototype MO delivered in Phase I.  Techniques will be explored to increase output pulse duration to narrow the transform-limited pulse spectra while maintaining very compact laser cavity length.  These innovations will apply directly to current NASA missions and instruments (Doppler lidar, IPDA, LAS) and accelerate commercial development and availability of practical ground-based and airborne systems (e.g. compact airborne CO2 concentration-measuring instruments) at BP and elsewhere.

		<BR>
		Moderate average power, compact, operationally flexible 2 ?m solid-state/fiber hybrid transmitter laser solutions will tangibly and positively impact the readiness of current and future NASA laser remote sensing systems and missions for airborne and in the case of atmospheric DIAL instruments, space-based measurement applications.  Full development, test, and delivery at the end of Phase I of BP?s extremely compact and ruggedized master oscillator source will directly benefit existing NASA programs operating at 2 ?m and will accelerate commercial availability.  Efficient single-frequency pulsed 2 ?m wavelength lasers with variable pulse duration and PRF will greatly enhance the technical readiness of 2-micron wavelength coherent- and direct-detection lidar systems for ASCENDS type missions, IPDA, LAS, and hard-target identification, tracking, and imaging.  Many of the innovations proposed can be transferred to other relevant laser gain media and wavelengths for other NASA applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA commercial applications of the proposed pulsed 2-micron solid-state/fiber hybrid laser sources include DoD hard target and space debris tracking and imaging problems as well as research and industrial applications requiring very compact efficient front-end transmitter lasers in the eye-safe SWIR wavelength region.  Specifically relevant to Beyond Photonics, we will capitalize on past NASA SBIR innovations that produced our initial SWIFT single-frequency solid-state cw single-frequency laser format and apply them to the pulsed single-frequency (injection seeded) transmitter laser design proposed here; we plan to incorporate new design concepts in this master oscillator (MO) laser, and then build, test, and deliver a fully functional prototype of the new MO source in Phase I.  We ultimately envision commercial development of a small, rugged, and compact differential-absorption lidar (DIAL) sensor product for airborne measurement of CO2 and water vapor concentrations in the atmosphere, and other similar laser remote sensing applications.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Spaceflight systems must pass through a complex set of testing and processing before being cleared for launch.  A significant portion of the pre-launch processing involves integration with other flight systems, general ground support equipment, and test equipment.  The process of interfacing this equipment has historically been a source of numerous delays and unplanned work prior to launch.  The proliferation of different interface types, designs, and manufacturers only serves to increase the difficulties associated with pre-launch integration and testing.The development and adoption of improved, standardized interfaces holds the potential of reducing the cost and complexity of the testing and launch processing processes and could provide eventual benefits to autonomous servicing in future space missions.  In-space and surface servicing of multiple types of spacecraft becomes more feasible if a common interface approach can be developed and widely adopted.<BR><BR>In 2012, METECS developed the mREST Architecture and Interface Specification  and began developing software prototypes that could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the standard for the automation of testing in flight laboratories at the NASA/Johnson Space Center.  This specification and the associated software became collectively known simply as "mREST".<BR><BR>The proposed innovation is to expand on the mREST foundational work to design an interface standard that can be utilized to solve the issues associated with test and launch operations.  This will be accomplished by first doing research into the specific issues that typically arise during the pre-launch process and identifying areas where the existing mREST specification should be expanded and/or refined.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The mREST interface specification has the potential to greatly enhance existing flight test and processing capabilities at NASA.  Any facility which requires integration and testing of hardware and/or software elements would benefit.  In addition, development of web-based user interfaces would be streamlined for any mREST element or system.   Systems that utilize common NASA components with existing web-based interfaces such as LabVIEW, the Trick Simulation Environment, and/or EDGE graphics have a greater initial potential for implementation.  Other applications that have potential for NASA are:<BR><BR>1.	Remote data monitoring<BR>2.	Integrated test automation and orchestration<BR>3.	Simulation monitoring and control<BR>4.	Model-based system engineering (MBSE)<BR>5.	Facility monitoring and control<BR>6.	Monitoring and control of environmental control systems<BR>7.	Process management and control<BR>8.	Security system management<BR>9.	Computer system administration monitoring and optimization<BR>10.	Failure analysis and testing<BR>11.     Browser-based graphical user interfaces
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Any object that requires a simple web-based interface would be able to use software designed using the mREST interface specification.  Likewise, any system of disparate elements could easily be integrated using mREST.  Some potential non-NASA commercial applications include building environmental control and monitoring, product verification and validation, hardware testing, remote monitoring equipment, safety and security monitoring systems, and automated processes.  The potential NASA commercial applications listed in the previous section would also apply for non-NASA applications:<BR><BR>1.	Remote data monitoring<BR>2.	Integrated test automation and orchestration<BR>3.	Simulation monitoring and control<BR>4.	Model-based system engineering (MBSE)<BR>5.	Facility monitoring and control<BR>6.	Monitoring and control of environmental control systems<BR>7.	Process management and control<BR>8.	Security system management<BR>9.	Computer system administration monitoring and optimization<BR>10.	Failure analysis and testing<BR>11.     Browser-based graphical user interfaces

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Trace contaminants that are introduced into the ventilation loop of a spacesuit (primarily ammonia and formaldehyde) via metabolic processes, off-gassing of spacesuit materials, and by-products of the amine used in the rapid cycle amine (RCA) system are typically removed using activated charcoal. Although effective, the downside of using these materials is a bulky system with low regeneration capability, a reliance on consumables, significant power consumption, and consequently high associated life cycle operating cost.<BR>Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI) proposes a new material paradigm for the Trace Contaminant Control System (TCCS) based upon its novel adsorbent nanomaterials that have high surface area and can be designed to achieve uniquely-targeted sorbent properties including minimizing competitive sorption with water and CO2 and vacuum regeneration without heating. PCI will apply the developed nanomaterials on ultra-short channel length, lightweight Microlith? support substrates to permit practical implementation of the sorbent for a real-time vacuum swing regenerable TCCS. <BR>Successful implementation of PCI?s modular strategy will increase flexibility of equipment while reducing total volume and material inventory required for TCCS and atmosphere revitalization applications. Additional benefits include humidity tolerance, as well as reduced volume, weight, pressure drop, energy consumption, and reliance on consumables.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Targeted NASA applications will be in advanced spacesuit PLSS with key potential customers include Marshall Space Flight Center, Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, and private sector customers. Additional NASA application includes future ISRU concepts for Lunar or Martian bases, space shuttles, and International Space Station.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Targeted non-NASA commercial application relate to commercial aircraft air purification where the compact size, low weight, durability, and increased operating time of the sub-systems can bring value and for military vehicle cabins such as in aircraft, ships and submarines. One of the biggest markets for this technology would be commercial buildings where it can have significant impact on the demand control ventilation, resulting in significant decrease in associated energy cost.

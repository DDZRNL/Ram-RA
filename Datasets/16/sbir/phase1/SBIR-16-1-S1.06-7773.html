		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this proposal, we demonstrate a new Raman imaging sensor based on a compact, CCD-mounted spectrometer. This enables high sensitivity and specificity for UV-Raman that will be capable of full-frame imaging, thus reducing size, weight, and power requirements, as well as eliminating the need for mechanical scanning and actuators to acquire data across a 2-dimensional image. The proposed program will establish the optical model and tools to estimate system performance, fabrication requirement and tolerance, formulate calibration procedure and evaluation criteria, develop critical optical component fabrication techniques and procedure, and chart the road for a Raman imager with improved performance that can be obtained with the state of the art fabrication techniques. In Phase II we will demonstrate a prototype imaging system and present a plan to infuse the technology into a NASA program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Composition analysis and mapping is one of the central tasks for planetary explorations. The proposed method and rugged instrument can provide fast material identification regarding its molecular composition during planetary and asteroidal exploration missions. New information provided by proposed approach can help understand the history and future of planets/moons/asteroids.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed method and instrument can be used for many applications - security/military: chemical and explosive detection and identification; manufacturing industry: non-destructive detection/evaluation; pharmaceutical: composition analysis, counterfeit detection, compound distribution, powder content and purity, polymorphic forms identification, contaminant detection and identification; Medicine and Life Science: bio-compatibility study, DNA/RNA analysis, drug/cell interactions study, single cell analysis; Geology and Mineralogy: gemstone and mineral identification.

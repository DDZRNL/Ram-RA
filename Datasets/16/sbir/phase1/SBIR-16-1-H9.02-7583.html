		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		SWIFT is a small-form factor, highly-capable software-defined radio (SDR) platform whose strength lies in its flexible and modular hardware and software interfaces. TUI proposes to augment this existing, proven platform to make it compatible with the Space Telecommunication Radio System (STRS) architecture and other open standards. Furthermore, TUI proposes to leverage other ongoing work in the area of high-gain antenna pointing and electrically-steered antenna (ESA) control to augment these existing standards with antenna pointing and multi-antenna abstraction interfaces. The proposed STRS augmentations and ?OpenSWIFT-SDR? architecture will allow them to scale to large, multi-body networked systems, especially systems operating at multiple frequencies with multiple, steered antennas. The large existing code-base, availability of mature hardware solutions, and the ability to operate coherently at S-, X-, K-, and Ka-bands while connecting to multiple antennas makes SWIFT an ideal platform for both TUI and others to develop the next generation of communications architectures and protocols for current and future NASA missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		TUI anticipates the proposed technology will enable the increased use of advanced software-defined radio (SDR) technologies for creating multi-frequency, multi-channel, multi-antenna, and steered antenna communications systems. These features will lower the cost of deploying large constellations of small, mobile air and space vehicles for remote sensing applications where the volume of data necessitates tight-beam point-to-point data exfiltration links. Furthermore, the open nature of the proposed modifications to the proven SWIFT-SDR technologies as well as STRS and other open standards will enable their use in third-party ad-hoc and cognitive networking research simplifying the infusion of these technologies into future mission concepts.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		TUI anticipates the proposed technology enable the increased use of the proven SWIFT software-defined radio (SDR) platform in systems using multiple and steered high-gain apertures. Such systems include any mobile, networked remote sensing system that generate large volumes of data and subsequently require either ad-hoc or tight-beam exfiltration of the data. Separately, the proposed technologies would enable the creation of point-to-point links from low-Earth orbit to users in remote and/or disaster-stricken areas.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In response to NASA SBIR Topic H3.01, Polestar Technologies Inc. proposes to develop a miniaturized sensor array platform for simultaneous monitoring of calcium, conductivity and pH in urine brine suitable for the international space station (ISS). The sensor platform will incorporate three different types of sensors:  i) molecular recognition sensor elements incorporated onto nano-architecture for calcium detection, ii) Doped electronic material for pH measurement, and iii) a suitably designed microelectrode structure for conductivity determination. Phase I project will involve design and fabrication of the first generation sensor platform consisting of an electrochemical part (for calcium studies) and electronic part (for both pH and conductivity measurements). The capability of this platform to measure calcium in the range of 50-400mg/L, pH in the range of 0.5-5.0 and conductivity in the range of 10-250mS/cm will be demonstrated. In Phase II all the three types of sensor modalities will be integrated into a common platform. In addition, a handheld electronic readout unit will also be designed and fabricated in Phase II. This will serve as a basis for the development of a rugged detection system for applications on ISS.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Human space exploration missions require life support systems to sustain and secure crewmembers' health. The proposed detection system will provide a critical technology in the current NASA vision for space explorations. Urine processor assembly (UPA) on ISS is designed to extract around 85% of the water from wastewater including urine and flush water. However, because of lack of suitable monitoring instruments, the recovery percentage had to be compromised to ensure water quality and prevent the release of ammonia. Meanwhile, astronauts have been reported to lose an average of more than 1% bone mass per month spent in space. Hence the proposed approach can not only help monitor crew health but also recover more waste water.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed detection system capable of monitoring calcium, pH and conductivity will have a wide range of commercial non-NASA applications such as marine resource management, environmental monitoring entities, aquaculturist, and fisheries etc. for assessing the impact of ocean acidification and calcification on the health of the marine ecosystem. Other applications could include clinical chemistry monitoring pH and calcium in plasma.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Three of the key abilities needed for making future NASA and commercial in-space transportation systems more affordable and capable are: a) the ability to �live off of the land� via in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), b) the ability to reuse in-space transportation hardware, and c) the ability to leverage continuing advancements in lower-cost earth-to-orbit transportation. All of these abilities require the ability to transfer large quantities of cryogenic liquids (Oxygen, Hydrogen, and Methane) between tanks on separate vehicles. In this proposed SBIR research effort, Altius Space Machines proposes the development of a lightweight, high-flow cryogenic propellant coupling to enable such bulk propellant transfers. This coupling incorporates an innovative new cryogenic sealing architecture to enable a coupling with very low insertion/extraction forces, for both robotic and Astronaut-connected cryogenic propellant transfer operations.<BR><BR>In Phase I, Altius and its team will focus on developing and testing a proof-of-concept of this innovative new cryogenic sealing architecture, including performing insertion/extraction and leak testing, to compare with a more traditional spring-energized polymer seal concept. Altius will then update the coupling design based on lessons learned-from these tests, raising the TRL from 2 to 3 at the end of Phase I.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA applications include:<BR>1- Enabling refueling of the EUS upper stage in LEO or other in-space locations, enabling stage reuse, and/or launch of much larger payloads to deep space trajectories.<BR>2- An integrated T-0 fill coupling for EUS that enables in-space refueling with the same coupling.<BR>3- Fueling of Mars Ascent Vehicles or future fully-reusable Mars vehicles from ISRU production facilities.<BR>4- Distributed launch for very high-energy robotic science missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential Non-NASA applications include:<BR>1- A combined T-0 coupling/in-space cryogenic transfer coupling that can be integrated into future upper stage designs, such as the planned ULA ACES upper stage.<BR>2- Refueling of commercial cryogenic stages in space.<BR>3- Other terrestrial applications that could benefit from a low-connection force cryogenic coupling, such as automated LH2 fueling for fuel-cell cars.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		For small satellite program managers and integrators, who must contend with increasing power consumption of small spacecraft with advanced electric propulsion and/or science instrumentation, the Structural Origami ARray (SOAR) is an extremely high performance deployable solar array system that delivers 200W to 1kW+ power output, while exceeding state-of-the-art packaging efficiencies.  Unlike existing folding panel or rolled architectures, our approach utilizes a simple reliable deployable supporting structure and a two-dimensional origami packaging scheme of the flexible blanket/substrate that exhibits several unique and enabling characteristics. These include a perfect packaging efficiency, equal to z-folding; small stowed square form factor to easily fit into any small satellite; easily scalable to create longer arrays with little impact on stowed height, complexity, and structural performance; uniform folding mechanics for simple electronic harnessing; deterministic folding kinematics that unfold in two dimensions when pulled along its length, which minimizes potential array damage during deployment; and an inherent thickness insensitivity, which allows for the uses of thicker, long lifespan or high efficiency photovoltaic cells.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Future NASA small satellite missions are seeking an order-of-magnitude increase in power generation capability to support solar electric propulsion and other high consumption instrumentation.  Overcoming this need while not consuming a large fraction of the spacecraft volume requires advanced innovative structural solutions. The Structural Origami ARray (SOAR) is an extremely high performance deployable solar array system that delivers 200W to 1kW+ power output, while exceeding state-of-the-art packaging efficiencies. SOAR will enable planned NASA missions and support power demand growth of future missions.<BR><BR>The proposed technology impacts NASA small satellite missions that require increased power for SEP, high power instruments, or increased communications capability. The National Research Council (NRC) Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board (ASEB) identified NASA�s top technical challenges and highest priority technologies across all 14 NASA space technology roadmaps. Based on the 30 identified in the study, increased power or lightweight structures are key, enabling technologies that contribute to the advancement of approximately 30 percent of the top technical challenges and the highest priority technologies.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		SOAR will be of interest to Government spacecraft procuring agencies such as the Air Force, Navy, National Reconnaissance Office, and Operationally Responsive Space Office; as well as, prime contractor spacecraft developers such as ATK, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Sierra Nevada Corporation, and Ball Aerospace.  In addition to spacecraft solar arrays, the SOAR structure will enable other larger small satellites deployable systems such as antennas or radiators.

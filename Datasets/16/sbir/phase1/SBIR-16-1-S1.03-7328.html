		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		There is a longstanding need for a reliable, low-cost manufacturing method for high-density three-dimensional (3D) interconnection of integrated circuits (ICs). This includes assembly of 3D stacked electrical interconnection of dissimilar semiconductors, electrical-interconnection of fine-pixel-pitch semiconductor detector arrays with readout ICs (ROICs) at the pixel level, and interconnection of ICs with flexible organic substrates and interposers.  Such technology will allow for higher-density circuit integration into small-sized packages and enable high-density focal planes to be developed at lower costs. To address the need for high-density three-dimensional (3D) interconnection of circuits and detectors, including those made of dissimilar materials, inkjet-print additive-manufacturing (AM) materials and deposition technologies will be developed. It will be shown that reliable low-resistance electrical connections can be made- in three dimensions- to vertically stacked integrated circuits and interposers. The process is compatible with wafer-to-wafer, chip-to-wafer, and chip-to-chip processing, requires only modest capital investment, and can be performed with high yields at less cost and finer pitch compared to today's indium-bump hybridization technologies.<BR>In Phase I, the ability to produce densely packed conductive sub-1-&#956;m and larger nanometal pillars to form low-resistivity 3D interconnects at a sub-3-&#956;m pitch will be demonstrated. The process technology will be shown capable of forming 2.5D/3D stacked circuits at the chip and wafer levels.  Parts will be electrically characterized over a range of frequencies, and samples will be environmentally and mechanically tested.

		Electronic and optical packaging is at the heart of every electro-optical system application. It interconnects the individual components, protects the electronic systems against vibration and moisture, and dissipates heat reliably. In short, it ensures that electronics continue to function reliably in even the harshest conditions. Clever packaging also reduces the manufacturing costs for complex electronic systems. Based on that, the proposed innovation allows prototyping, small volume, and scaled production of customized 3D systems for industrial applications like medical, automotive, and communications.

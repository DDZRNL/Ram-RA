		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Flight Works is proposing to expand its micropump-fed propulsion technology to the development of a low cost, compact, low tank pressure, high performance LPM-103S propulsion system for secondary payloads. Along with AF-M315E, LMP-103S is a leading green propellant candidate. Both, with their low vapor pressures, are great candidates for pump-fed systems. LMP-103S thrusters have been flying for over three years onboard the PRISMA spacecraft. Recently, NASA MSFC conducted tests of 5 N and 22 N thrusters. Typically, requirements imposed by the primary mission have led secondary payloads to have very limited propulsion capability. For earth orbiting spacecraft, the requirements to reenter within 25 years can be an issue. For lunar or interplanetary missions, lack of significant &#916;V capability limits the science potential. For example, the system in the Mars Cube One 6U spacecraft is only capable of a few tens of m/s. Many such nanosats, including CubeSats slated to accompany the primary spacecraft towards Europa, could greatly benefit from real delta-V capability (> 1 km/s) while reducing risks to the primary payload. Flight Works is proposing to develop that capability by leveraging its experience in micropump-fed propulsion to develop a compact, low-tank-pressure, pump-fed, propulsion system suitable for LMP-103S. With a micropump, the pressurization system is eliminated, the propellant storage and feed system can be designed for low pressures, and lighter, conformal tanks can be used instead of spherical or cylindrical pressurized tanks. This decreases system overall size and mass (and decreases verification costs). Also, many of the (low pressure) components can be made at low cost, for example using additive manufacturing. More generally, the technology is applicable to any propulsion system, whether primary or for attitude control, where hydrazine is currently used, and is competitive with bipropellant systems for microsats due to the reduced system mass.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology offers the means of drastically reducing the risks posed by secondary payload propulsion systems onto primary missions. It also drastically increases their mission capabilities (in terms of delta-V capabilities) by decreasing the mass, complexity and cost of space propulsion systems. As such, it can enable new secondary missions which would not be possible otherwise. This applies to all microsat and nanosat missions which could benefit from high thrust and delta-V around 1 km/s. For earth orbiting spacecraft, the technology allows deployment to the desired orbit, orbit or constellation maintenance, de-orbit. For lunar and interplanetary spacecraft, such as the CubeSats that will fly along with the primary spacecraft towards Mars or Europa, it enhances mission capability and open new avenues.<BR><BR>The technology can also be applied to conventional, larger spacecraft, both for primary propulsion (as it can easily be scaled up well over 100 lbf with very moderate power requirements) and attitude control where a pump can pressurize the inlet of sets of thrusters.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		One area with potential for significant commercialization benefits is the new space industry. Venture capitalists and other firms have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in business plans which rely on constellations of small satellites. Many of these spacecraft will need high performance, low cost chemical propulsion. One such example is SkyBox Imaging which contracted ECAPS to develop a propulsion system based on its LMP-103S thruster technology for its imaging constellation.<BR><BR>For the business case to close with those small spacecraft constellations, spacecraft acquisition costs must be minimized; these companies cannot afford purchasing a Chevy (the bus) if they need to also purchase a Ferrari engine to run it (the propulsion system). Yet, the current path taken by traditional aerospace propulsion suppliers leads to systems which are more expensive than those using hydrazine today. The technology proposed here allows correcting this mismatch. The pump-fed system allows eliminating the pressurization system and transforms it into a low-pressure, low cost, more compact and lighter system. <BR><BR>As such the technology has applications to any mission with propulsion needs, ranging from the small spacecraft where cost is a driver, to the larger buses (e.g. telecommunications) which can benefit from the performance and cost improvements. It is also applicable to DoD spacecraft and missiles including in Divert Attitude Control Systems, and to on-orbit propellant management.

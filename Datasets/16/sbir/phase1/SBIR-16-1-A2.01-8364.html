		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Intelligent Fiber Optic Systems Corporation (IFOS) proposes to develop an effective real-time, in situ damage locating and growth monitoring system of composite structures by optimizing a smart, high-speed fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor and piezoelectric actuator placement strategy.  A new damage identification technique is proposed from which damage in composites such as delamination and impact-related defects can be detected.  The proposed technique utilizes the pitch-catch Lamb wave signals obtained from an FBG sensor and piezoelectric actuator network, without the need of baseline signals from the pristine condition.  <BR>The project goals include designing an ultra-high-speed/high resolution, small footprint FBG sensor and piezoelectric actuator network plus an FBG interrogator, constructing a system model, fabricating a test platform and developing signal processing algorithms to identify and measure Lamb wave signals in the presence of a quasi-static background strain field.  The system model will demonstrate proof-of-principle, and the test results will provide proof-of-functionality of the proposed sensor system as a measurement method for damage identification in composite structures.  The methodology proposed by IFOS includes using advanced signal processing algorithms.  IFOS and its collaborators in this project will develop a Phase II plan that includes a development and integration strategy, potential demonstration opportunities, program schedule, and estimated costs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary application of this technology meets NASA�s requirements for improved measurement and analysis techniques for acquisition of real-time, in-flight data used to determine aerodynamic, structural, flight control, and propulsion system performance characteristics. The technology can also be used to provide test conductors the information to safely expand the flight and test envelopes of aerospace vehicles and components.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Many non-NASA commercial markets exist that can realize significant benefits from this new technology for testing, verification and validation of highly integrated/synergistic structures in the aerospace, automobile, and infrastructure industries.  Commercial aviation, the oil and gas industry, and land and marine vehicles will benefit significantly from this technology.

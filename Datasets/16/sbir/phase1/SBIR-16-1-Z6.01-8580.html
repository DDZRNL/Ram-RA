		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to develop a suite of wireless interconnect modules and the associated technologies.  The interconnect technology will be designed with radiation tolerance in mind for space use but may also be applicable to aviation.  The topology will be flexible enough to support the needs of both low rate, low power nodes, as well as high speed, higher power nodes.  Our proposed architecture is modeled after the Aerospace Vehicle Systems Institute�s (AVSI) Wireless Avionics Intra-Communications (WAIC). Power estimates range from 100 mW while active for those nodes connecting to sensors/actuators, and 1 W while active for those operating as masters on their scatternet.  The volume estimate for all nodes is currently approximately 1.75 cm^3, with a maximum linear dimension of 25 mm, including shielding.  External components are minimized through clever use of printed circuit board technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The key NASA application is adding sensors and telemetry to a spacecraft at a low cost, i.e., avoiding cable runs and connectors to pass data between new sensors and the spacecraft.  WiSPiR will enable better Integrated Health Management and Spacecraft Autonomy functions, which depend on better sensing of spacecraft state and environment.  WiSPiR has a high potential to broadly benefit NASA with opportunities in ascent vehicles; spacecraft management; entry, descent and landing systems; and planetary exploration system.  The benefit to small spacecraft applies to small UAVs as well.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The benefits to spacecraft autonomy is not unique to NASA.  Innoflight has experience with Air Force Research Laboratories, Space Vehicles (AFRL/RV), and Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), and Innoflight will pursue these customers interested in wireless interconnect capabilities for similar spacecraft intra-communication concepts.  In additional Innoflight will apply its cybersecurity expertise for these DoD/IC customers to explore additional methods for securing the wireless communication.<BR><BR>Furthermore, Innoflight will work with STMD to understand the opportunities to pursue opportunities to offer wireless interconnect technologies to commercial spaceflight companies, such as Virgin Galactic, satellite integrators such as Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, and international space agencies, such as ESA or JAXA.

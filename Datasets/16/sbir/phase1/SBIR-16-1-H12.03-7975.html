		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's future manned spaceflight missions will require medical diagnosis and treatment capabilities that address both the anticipated health risks and perform well in austere, remote operational environments. Spaceflight- ready medical devices will need to be capable of an increased degree of autonomous operation, acquiring clinically relevant and diagnosable data by every astronaut, not just select physician crew members credentialed in spaceflight medicine. Ultrasound is a diagnostic and treatment technology that currently fulfills mission medical capability support on ISS and is planned to accompany future deep-space missions. The Flexible Ultrasound System (FUS) is a new platform that is currently being developed by NASA and research partners to support this mission role. We propose three specific aims for this project proposal for methodological development utilizing the FUS platform:<BR>1.)	Develop and implement a group of vascular diagnostic methods related to health conditions on the Exploration Medicine Condition List (Carotid assessments, DVT, Cardiogenic shock, sudden cardiac arrest secondary to traumatic injury) and vascular access procedural guidance (central venous or arterial cannulation) utilizing the exposed API for the FUS platform<BR>2.)	Implement an Augmented Reality (AR) user interface for these vascular methods that provides procedural guidance in acquiring and initially diagnosing sonographic data for one or more ultrasound procedures to enhanced degree of procedural competency.<BR>3.)	Prototype the integration of Volume Navigation on the FUS platform to allow for 3-dimensional ultrasound procedural guidance through the Head Mounted Display.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The envisioned AR procedural guidance tool can be applied to any ultrasound methods to be developed or implemented for FUS. The AR procedural guidance will provide benefits for methods of varying complexity, and will capture guidance support queues from a range or sources such as video, expert instruction and other relevant sources.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Tietronix has already initiated work with Methodist Houston and an NSF sponsored Cyber-systems of the future Operating Room academic/industry consortium (with membership such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Karl Storz) on developing this technology for terrestrial medicine. <BR>Tietronix is successful in bringing SBIRs and other innovative NASA technologies to commercial application. The Tietronix workflow tool, TieFlow, developed under the SBIR program has been successfully commercialized by the company. Tietronix has deployed a document review process based on TieFlow in a Fortune 500 company in New Jersey. Another successful Tietronix SBIR based project is the Software Developer?s Assistant (SDA) which has received Phase III funding and is being used in the commercial world by aerospace and medical device companies.

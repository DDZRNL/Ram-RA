		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Monofilament Vaporization Propulsion (MVP) is a new propulsion technology targeted at secondary payload applications. It does not compromise on performance while using safe, clean, propellant without storage or handling concerns. Potential issues with liquid propellants such as freezing and over-pressurization in the space environment do not apply to MVP as its propellant is a solid. MVP harnesses technology used in 3d printing applications to feed propellant into proven electrothermal propulsion technology developed by CU Aerospace to provide a safe and reliable system with high performance. The MVP concept accepts a variety of filament propellants, the leading candidate being a commercially available polymer. This should provide 900 N-s total impulse with a 1U (10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm) system. This imparts 250 m/s Delta-V to a standard 4 kg, 3U CubeSat. Target power consumption for MVP is less than 15 W, and the target price for MVP is $30K in order to encourage use on low budget missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The MVP thruster system supports the NASA Roadmap for In-Space Propulsion Systems, nonchemical propulsion. MVP offers CubeSats and other small satellites a propulsion capability sufficient for various orbital maneuvers with several millinewtons of thrust requiring minimal thrust-control ACS and a minimal volume and system integration cost. The baseline MVP, occupying a 1U volume, has minimal impact on the CubeSat bus and payload. The solid propellant has no handling, storage, or operational restrictions beyond those of the CubeSat. The ease of handling and storage for the solid propellant can extend operation to planetary missions with no additional monitoring or controls.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The MVP thruster will provide a compact, light-weight, non-hazardous, propulsion technology solution that will be made available in a family of sizes that can meet the differing needs of users in DOD, industry, and academia for CubeSat and small-satellite missions. MVP will require no safety equipment for storage, transportation, integration, and testing, and place no demanding requirements on the launch provider, making it an ideal low-cost solution for industry, research, and academic small-satellite propulsion needs.

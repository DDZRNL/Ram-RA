		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The effects of electromagnetic interactions in electrical systems are of growing concern due to the increasing susceptibility of system components to electromagnetic interference (EMI), use of automated electronic systems, and pollution of the electromagnetic environment (EME) with electromagnetic emissions.  The effects of EMI can be detrimental to electronic systems utilized in space missions; even small EMI issues can lead to total mission failure, resulting in significant mission delays and economic loss.  Additionally, NASA is challenged to find ways of effectively shielding sensitive electronic equipment from EMI without adding significant weight to space flight vehicles and satellites in order to manage fuel costs. The solution for both issues resides in the use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which are advancing as the most promising solution for reducing the weight of spacecraft wires. CNTs are an alluring alternative to conventional conductors used in coaxial data cables because they combine mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and low density. DexMat has developed a novel CNT deposition process for directly applying CNTs onto dielectric materials to produce an electrically conductive EMI shield.  The high conductivity CNT fibers have the potential to replace the inner conductor in cables, improving their mechanical durability and providing comparable specific conductivity to copper. By placing a premium on the quality of raw CNTs, DexMat has created a product which will have increased potential to reduce cable weight while minimizing insertion losses when incorporated into wire. In the proposed research DexMat seeks to increase electrical conductivity of CNT films, produce cost competitive products, develop new quality assurance processes, and determine the long-term product reliability of CNT cables.  Understanding these facets of CNT cable production will lead to enhancements on DexMat innovation and production of a commercially viable product.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Lightweight CNT shielded cables would provide a significant cost-effectiveness by reducing weight in space applications. Given the tremendous costs associated with satellite launches, the NASA will see significant savings from our CNT-based wire.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial and Military aerospace companies are seeking opportunities to reduce weight on their aviation and space platforms to improve range and lower operating costs.  Fuel costs are one of the biggest concerns among commercial airlines.  Reducing exposure to fuel costs is a significant priority for all operators of aircraft and space systems. A large commercial aircraft such as the Boeing 747 uses approximately 135 miles of wire, weighing over 4,000 pounds, about half of this weight comes from wire shielding components.  Significant weight reductions could save millions of dollars per plane over its operating lifetime.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed program will develop a ceramic coating with surface features, ranging from nanometer to micrometer size-scale, that will be optimized to prevent the attachment of biofilm-forming bacteria found in wastewater plumbing in life support systems in space. The coating technology offers several advantages compared to presently available processes, including low temperature deposition, a range of surface feature sizes, strong adhesion, and no toxic waste products. Phase I will deposit the anti-microbial coating on metallic and polymer samples of materials typical of those in the International Space Station (ISS), measure the mechanical and physical characteristics of the coatings, and compare bacterial and biofilm formation rate with uncoated controls. The coating with the greatest anti-microbial activity will also be demonstrated on the interior surface of tubing sections of the same ISS materials. If Phase I is successful, Phase II would expand testing to other biofilm-forming bacterial types and to other organic materials found in wastewater piping, and demonstrate coating deposition on realistic-size plumbing configurations. Phase II would also initiate intellectual property protection and develop partnerships for NASA and commercial applications. Phase III of the proposed program would see strong commercialization efforts, both in-house and through external licensing agreements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Initial NASA applications are in wastewater plumbing and water recovery systems for long- and short-duration life support in ground-based and space-based human habitation. The coating would reduce and/or prevent biofilm formation and subsequent blockage of critical plumbing. It could also be effective on illuminated surfaces that are exposed to contamination from humans and animals.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed coating technology would have immediate biomedical applications in which an anti-microbial, anti-contamination coating could prevent infection and biofilm formation on percutaneous catheters, orthopedic devices such as artificial knees and hips, and percutaneous screws and pins. The photochemical activity of the coating also could be useful as an anti-contaminant on illuminated surfaces of biomedical and other devices.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The development of advanced technologies for flight testing, measurement, and data acquisition are critical to effectively meeting the future goals and challenges faced by NASA and the aerospace industry.  Space systems have become increasingly complex where the development of each system may be geographically distributed across organizations and subsystems.  <BR><BR>When performing an integrated flight test, the main problems that must be addressed are test orchestration and measurement/data acquisition.  The main issue with both areas typically arises from the fact that each system component may employ various disparate interfaces which may be in addition to the direct interfaces used during flight.  Effective flight tests will also likely involve the integration of multiple simulations and other test equipment to provide inputs and feedback for real-world scenarios.  <BR><BR>The proposed innovation is a scalable architectural software framework known as the mREST Automated Test Environment (MATE) which addresses the technical issues commonly associated with flight testing, measurement, and data acquisition by providing comprehensive flight test orchestration and data measurement/acquisition capabilities in both centralized and distributed environments.   MATE has the potential to significantly optimize current flight test methodologies without levying new requirements on each test element.  The proposed software framework is based on the mREST Architecture and Interface Specification  which is a specific implementation of a RESTful web-services architecture  that resulted from research and prototyping efforts performed by METECS for the Johnson Space Center (JSC).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The MATE software has the potential to greatly enhance existing flight test orchestration capabilities at NASA.  Any facility which requires integration and testing of hardware and/or software elements would benefit.  In addition, development of web-based user interfaces would be streamlined for any MATE element or system.   Systems that utilize common NASA components with existing web-based interfaces such as LabVIEW, the Trick Simulation Environment, and/or EDGE graphics have a greater initial potential for implementation.  Other applications that have potential for NASA are:<BR><BR>1.	Remote data monitoring<BR>2.	Integrated test automation and orchestration<BR>3.	Simulation monitoring and control<BR>4.	Model-based system engineering (MBSE)<BR>5.	Facility monitoring and control<BR>6.	Monitoring and control of environmental control systems<BR>7.	Process management and control<BR>8.	Security system management<BR>9.	Computer system administration monitoring and optimization<BR>10.	Failure analysis and testing<BR>11.     Browser-based graphical user interfaces
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Any object that requires a simple web-based interface would be able to use the MATE software.  Likewise, any system of disparate elements could easily be integrated using MATE.  Some potential non-NASA commercial applications of MATE include building environmental control and monitoring, product verification and validation, hardware testing, remote monitoring equipment, safety and security monitoring systems, and automated processes.  The potential NASA commercial applications listed in the previous section would also apply for non-NASA applications: <BR><BR>1.	Remote data monitoring<BR>2.	Integrated test automation and orchestration<BR>3.	Simulation monitoring and control<BR>4.	Model-based system engineering (MBSE)<BR>5.	Facility monitoring and control<BR>6.	Monitoring and control of environmental control systems<BR>7.	Process management and control<BR>8.	Security system management<BR>9.	Computer system administration monitoring and optimization<BR>10.	Failure analysis and testing<BR>11.     Browser-based graphical user interfaces

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed research pursues a path for reducing structural weight, increasing structural performance, and reducing fabrication cost while also minimizing maintainability.  The approach, which is based on selective reinforcement, is a change in the basic design philosophy and will result in the development of a hybrid material form.  The selective reinforcement approach allows the structural design requirements to define the material form.  This method is the reverse of the typical development flow path used for building structures.  This backward path results in more efficient material forms that are of greater value to structural engineers.  Specifically, the proposed effort will combine a metal matrix composite (MMC) prepreg tape with an ultrasonic additive manufacturing process.  The combination of these technologies will lead to enhanced lightweight, cost-effective metallic structures with shielding and thermal management built in.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed effort has broad applications across many NASA missions.  Stiffened structures exist in launch vehicles, especially in their tank structures.  Tanks have to withstand high stress during launch, and provide stability at cryogenic temperatures.  Essentially, any structure that is part of a NASA mission could benefit from new, lightweight structural components.  These include: future launch vehicle, crew vehicle, surface habitats, robotic explorers or cryogenic tank structures.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications include aircraft such as the F-35, CH53-K, V-22, ground combat vehicles, and aluminum ship designs.  Commercial aircraft such as the Boeing 777, Airbus A-380, and Airbus A340-600 could also benefit by adding MMC SR concepts.  Applications in the automotive market include aluminum and magnesium castings, flywheels for hybrid vehicles, liners for lightweight composite tanks used on alternative fuel vehicles, and other types of storage tanks.  Incorporation into golf club shafts, tennis rackets, and bicycle frames for the sporting goods market are also possible.

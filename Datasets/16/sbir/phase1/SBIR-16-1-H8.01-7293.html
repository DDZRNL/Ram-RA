		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A single shaft, low cost, long life, maintenance-free modular turbogenerator scalable from 1 to 100 kWe capacity range for human exploration of the moon and Mars is proposed. Operating at high spin speeds and based on a closed Brayton cycle using a binary He-Xe working fluid, the device combines five key enabling technologies to achieve high cycle and electrical efficiencies.  MiTi's innovation is the seamless integration of 1) MiTi's Fifth Generation low power loss; high load, damping and temperature foil bearings  with high reliability and long life; 2) a modular configuration that isolates the alternator elements from high temperature for improved thermal management; 3) a high efficiency direct drive permanent magnet high-speed alternator; 4) high adiabatic efficiency aero components; and 5) high effectiveness/low pressure drop ceramic/cermet based recuperator.  The specific design has its heritage in an open Brayton cycle turboalternator with a demonstrated specific power 1.6 kW/kg.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology will satisfy NASA's stated need for technology for power conversion from fission to support space exploration applications. The initial technology development will be suitable for space based stationary and transportation power generation systems This effort will lay the groundwork for subsequent scaling to higher power platforms (order of 100 kWe), capable of powering spacecraft on-board power, communication, navigation controls and electronics, life support systems, planetary rovers and machinery, and even planetary human settlements.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Besides space systems a large number of potential military and commercial customers would benefit from use of the proposed technology for microgrid and waste heat applications.  Amongst these are distributed cogeneration from high-grade waste heat recovery (heating exhaust for residential use of the order of 1 kWe) to industrial (process waste heat in the order for generation of 50 kWe and higher) applications. Additionally, the U.S. military could benefit from direct application of the technology (U.S. Nuclear Navy), and from derivative technology for portable power for dismounted soldier and forward operating bases (Army, Air Force) as well as for electric power sources for UAVs.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Systima Technologies, Inc. has demonstrated a low power non-catalytic ignition technology for advanced green monopropellant thrusters operating with HAN-based monopropellant AF-M315E.  This technology is also well suited for other HAN-based or ADN-based monopropellant formulations, such as LMP-103S, and will provide increased performance and new operating regimes for future NASA missions.  The non-catalytic ignition system is a critical component for future high thrust in-space rocket engines operating with Ionic-salt based monopropellants, offering robust thruster design, higher chamber operation pressures, and cold-start capability.  The proposed Phase I and Phase II programs will develop a model anchored with hot-fire test data and optimization of the ignition system and integrated thruster design to achieve performance targets for identified platforms.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA commercial applications for this technology are Earth-orbiting science satellites that require large delta-V maneuvers to reach mission orbit (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite [GOES] spacecraft, for example), interplanetary satellites that need to perform critical orbit insertion maneuvers (NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft and MAVEN spacecraft, for example), and cargo resupply vehicles (SpaceX Dragon capsule, Orbital Cygnus vehicle, and JAXA H-II Transfer Vehicle, for example).  Another potential NASA commercial application for this technology is the growing need for end-of-life controlled deorbit propulsion for Low-Earth orbiting satellites, due to the technology�s high performance and long-term storability.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced green, low-toxicity, monopropellants offer significant advantages in performance and reduced handling infrastructure for commercial and military vehicles and payloads and allow for modular designs for enhanced response capabilities.  Specifically, this technology is well suited for in-space propulsion, missile DACS applications, and auxiliary power units (APUs) among others.  This technology is also ideally suited for military �ship and shoot� propulsion system applications that require safe ground storage and fast turn-around launch readiness.

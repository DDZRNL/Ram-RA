		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A spacecraft's guidance, navigation, and control system needs 3D imagery of proximity objects or surfaces in the targeted space segment. Ideally, this data is obtained using sensors with low size, weight, and power (SWAP). The spatial- and depth-resolution capabilities that can be achieved using laser detection and ranging (LADAR) sensors in a small-sized detector without requiring large processing resources make LADAR a suitable choice for hazard detection, absolute-state estimation, landing/sampling site selection, and/or body-shape characterization.  <BR>To address this opportunity, hardened silicon (Si) Geiger-mode (Gm) LADAR focal plane arrays (FPAs) will be developed. In Phase I, spot-scan, line-scan, area-scan, and 2D-flash LADAR formats will be considered. They will specifically take into account platform SWAP, calibration, deep-space environmental conditions, rigors of landing on planetary bodies both with and without atmospheres, and planetary protection requirements. With a radiometric budget, end-to-end physics-based system models combined with Monte Carlo detector models and numeric receiver circuit simulations will be performed to provide accurate range and range-precision predictions. Candidate silicon single-photon avalanche photodiode (SPAD) detectors and readout integrated circuits (ROICs)integrating time-of-flight (TOF), time-to-digital converters (TDC), time-to-amplitude converters (TAC), and active quenching circuits (AQDs)will be demonstrated in a benchtop LADAR testbed.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications include entry, descent, and landing (EDL), hazard avoidance, navigation, docking, LIDAR, mapping, in situ instrumentation, and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The innovation is well suited for use in automotive advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) systems. Today, vehicles are driven inefficiently, which leads to congestion. Traffic congestion consumes 4.8 billion hours of time and wastes 1.9 billion gallons of fuel. The dramatic improvement in driving efficiency offered by an autonomous vehicle infrastructure stands to increase traffic capacity without building additional lanes or roadways, saving Americans $101 billion in combined delay and fuel costs.

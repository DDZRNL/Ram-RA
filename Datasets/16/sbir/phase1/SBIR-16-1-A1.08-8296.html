		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Subsonic, transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic ground test facilities are used extensively to evaluate forces and moments as well as surface measurements on test articles required to validate computational tools used to extrapolate wind tunnel data to realistic flight conditions and hardware. The development of fast and noninvasive instrumentation and measurement capabilities that can readily be integrated into the extreme environments is one of several major technological challenges associated with the design, building, and operation of these complex test environments.  Accurately mapping velocity flow fields-undoubtedly one of the most critical parameters-remains a significant challenge.  In addition, spatially and temporally resolved measurements of other flow parameters such as density, pressure, and temperature are of paramount importance. This proposal offers an integrated package of truly cutting-edge, multidimensional, seedless velocimetry and multi-flow-parameter diagnostics for wind tunnels and ground test facilities.  The concepts and ideas proposed are ranging from proof-of-principles demonstration of novel methodologies using 10-100 kHz-rate nanosecond (10-100 nsec) duration burst-mode laser sources for measurements in realistic tunnel conditions. The proposed high-repetition-rate Rayleigh scattering which is suitable for any wind tunnel testing involving various gases is a state-of-the-art technique for analysis of unsteady and turbulent flows.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Improvement of high-data-rate multi-dimensional, multi-parameter diagnostics will have wide application in NASA large ground test facilities.  These test facilities play an integral role in the design, development, evaluation, and analysis of advanced aerospace technologies and vehicles. Cutting-edge optical diagnostics and modeling tools are proven to be instructive and will be the basis of such new developments in these fields.  The advanced diagnostic toolkit developed under this SBIR project will be instrumental to fully investigate multiple flow parameters relevant to subsonic to hypersonic vehicles as well next generation airplane engines, and hence will be an invaluable asset to NASA and to the nation.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The advanced noninvasive diagnostic toolkit proposed under the current program will be a significant step forward in using cutting-edge laser technology to address a variety of diagnostics challenges in multiple government and industrial applications.  A major beneficiary besides NASA would be DOD test facilities developing advanced systems such as aircraft engines. The increasing cost of fuels as well as the cost associated with offsetting pollutant emissions requires engine manufacturers to implement onboard nonconventional combustion strategies and diagnostics for existing systems as well as to develop improved engine designs.  Being able to apply well-developed laser-based diagnostic tools in laboratory could be a game changer for commercial users and manufactures of engines.  The impact areas may include aircraft engine manufacturers, stationary power plant operators and owners as well as automotive design engineers.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		ProtoInnovations proposes to research, develop, and validate an innovative retractable robotic anchoring mechanism that works both in hard rock and granular soils permitting anchoring and subsequent repositioning of a lander, rover or other equipment. Our goal is to support a number of mission targets to Mars, the Moon, and asteroids. The technology proposed here is of special value to planetary missions involving extreme terrain mobility, small body/microgravity mobility, and missions that involve forceful interaction with the environment (e.g. drilling, digging, etc.) These missions are all ranked as High Priorities in NASA's Robotics, Tele-robotics, and Autonomous Systems Roadmap Technology Area 04 (April 2012).  The use of retractable<BR>anchors could also benefit missions involving multi-rover exploration, instrument employment,  infrastructure emplacement, etc. <BR>In Phase 1 we will: <BR>1- Research the mechanics of robotic anchoring in hard rock and soft soils;<BR>2- Design and prototype a working robotic anchoring mechanism;<BR>3- Conduct proof-of-concept and performance characterization testing;<BR>4- Demonstrate the weight holding capacity of the prototype anchoring mechanism on a vertical and inverted surface.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A reliable solution to recurring anchoring would benefit various robotic mission concepts that are being developed at NASA. We will work with scientists and technical leads at NASA Centers to promote the proposed innovative robotic anchoring for future NASA missions, including for example exploring the South Pole of the Moon, steep terrain exploration on Mars, sampling missions on asteroids, etc.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The robotic retractable anchor concept could be applied to numerous commercial applications. For example, the ability of a robot or a mechanized system to anchor and hold on steep faces lends itself to a variety of applications including mining, construction, inspection of buildings and bridges, as well as reconnaissance and intelligence. Robotic systems that utilize retractable anchors would facilitate a great deal of prospecting and exploration capabilities and could benefit both commercial and non-commercial scientific endeavors in some of the Earth's most challenging environments.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		There is high value in simulating the nonlinear dynamics of stowing, deploying, and performance of deployable space structures, especially given the profound limitations of physical testing. Dynamic simulation can reduce the risk of developing new deployable space structures, including solar arrays, by predicting transient motions and loads during stowage, deployment, and mission-related maneuvers. Dynamic simulation can also be used to assess the efficacy of using motion control to mitigate the effect of accelerations on the response of the space structure.<BR><BR>The proposed innovations of this proposal are: 1) Development of a general automated process to efficiently take a detailed hinge assembly model and simulate its range of motion while retrieving stiffness information for all degrees of freedom and convert that data to define a simple but accurate nonlinear point-to-point force for use in the solar array assembly model, 2) Development and simulation of a high-fidelity system-level model of the deployment dynamics of an commercial deployable solar array that was designed for use with a 6U cubesat, and 3) Review and evaluation of the hinge assembly simplification process and the modeling approach by an independent resource.<BR><BR>The significance of the proposed innovation is:  1) This work builds upon previous simulation success with a split-tube solar array by adding a new automated method to efficiently develop an accurate but simplified representation of the connections used on rigid panel solar arrays, 2) This is an initial engagement with the products of the smallsat community and a commercial cubesat solar array will be simulated. The successful results may encourage the smallsat community to use this technology, thereby reducing technical risk, 3) The simulation of a commercial cubesat solar array in this project potentially leads to obtaining validation comparisons between the simulation and physical test results during a corresponding Phase II effort.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA commercialization will follow a logical progression. First, the initial application will consist of the six functions to help simulate the nonlinear dynamics of roll-out solar arrays (developed in an earlier Phase I SBIR) and the two functions for the simplified representation of flexible hinges that will be developed in this Phase I SBIR.<BR><BR>Second, the addition of the Phase II capabilities (simulation of lanyards and tape springs) and the integration of functions will result in a software application that will be appropriate to the overall market of organizations that design, evaluate and make purchasing decisions for deployable space structures. A variety of solar array configurations can be addressed as well as deployable antennas. Most NASA Centers could be approached with this application, as well as their contractors.<BR><BR>The necessary documentation, tutorials, marketing materials and application licensing will be developed. MotionPort has prior experience in the development of such materials. The application will be marketed at technical conferences that NASA staff may attend, such as AIAA conferences. Marketing will include having a booth in the exhibition area as well as presenting a technical paper at selected conferences.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The deployable space structure application that is prepared for use by NASA research centers and contractors would also be suitable for non-NASA organizations. A limited market investigation for the application would be done at selected international space agencies in order to understand their needs. The addition of the Phase I and II capabilities will result in a software application that can be sold to an international market of agencies and contractors who work with deployable space structures. MotionPort has working relationships with distributors of MBD software in Europe, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and Taiwan. These organizations have advanced technical skills and customer relationships that can bring this vertical application to the international market.<BR><BR>The application will be marketed at technical conferences that the staff of aerospace organizations may attend, such as AIAA conferences. Marketing will include having a booth in the exhibition area as well as presenting a technical paper at selected conferences.

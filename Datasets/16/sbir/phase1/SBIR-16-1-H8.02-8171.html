		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has a defined need for energy dense and highly efficient energy storage and power delivery systems for future space missions.  Compared to other fuel cell technologies, solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) based systems are better suited to meeting NASA's efficiency targets while operating directly on methane and oxygen reactants.  SOFC power systems for lunar landers and other exploration vehicles are an ideal application for this technology, as well as for power generation on the moon or on Mars.  Nexceris has established SOFC technology that offers high power density and high single-pass fuel utilization, making it uniquely suited for achieving NASA's performance and efficiency requirements.  In this project, NexTech will establish a process model for an externally reformed SOFC system that operates with oxygen and methane reactants, design a reformer and a stack for the system, refine the reformer and stack designs via modeling and analysis, validate the design and performance predictions via catalyst and stack testing.

		<BR>
		Solid oxide fuel cells have promise to meet some of NASA?s emerging power generation system needs.  An SOFC power system using the same reactants as the propulsion system (cryogenically stored oxygen and methane) can provide exceptional energy density.  Lunar landers or other exploration vehicles are an ideal application of this technology.  SOFC systems also may find uses on the moon or on Mars for generating power from hydrocarbons produced from In-Situ Resource Utilization technologies.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The lightweight and high efficiency SOFC technology to be developed on this project is specifically geared toward meeting the demanding requirements of NASA applications, but will have near-term applicability to energy systems for unmanned underwater vehicles.  Meeting the robustness requirements (i.e., thermal cycles and rapid start-up) for NASA applications will make Nexceris' SOFC technology suited for other military applications, such as gen-sets, auxiliary power units for silent-watch vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles.  Additionally, the high efficiency SOFC system technology to be developed in this SBIR project is directly applicable to residential micro-combined heat and power systems.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address NASA's need for advanced nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of complex built-up spacecraft structures, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Penetrating Backscatter X-ray Imaging (PRAXI) system for in situ single-sided, three-dimensional (3D) NDE of the integrity of spacecraft components and structures. The PRAXI system is based on a novel approach for 3D Compton-based structural imaging, which requires only a small number of images for 3D data reconstruction.  These new features enable PRAXI to achieve 10x faster operating speed, smaller form factor, and smaller weight, compared to Compton imaging tomography (CIT), previously developed by POC. The proposed PRAXI system will allow noncontact, single-sided inspection of various spacecraft structures (such as micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) shields, pressure vessels, inflatable habitats, and thermal protection systems), either for in-space NDE or for on-ground material development and quality control. In Phase I POC will demonstrate the feasibility of using the PRAXI system for NDE of spacecraft components by fabricating and testing a TRL-4 prototype, with the goal of achieving technology readiness level (TRL)-6 by the end of Phase II and delivering the prototype to NASA.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary NASA application of the proposed PRAXI system is a compact NDE system that can be used for in situ nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of the integrity of spacecraft components and structures, with the capability to provide reliable, high-resolution assessment of the location and extent of damage within multiwall pressure vessels, batteries, thermal tile, thermal blankets, micrometeoroid shielding, International Space Station (ISS) radiators, and other aerospace structural components. Additional NASA applications include NDE of lightweight spacecraft materials used in the development of advanced aircraft and spacecraft, such as porous ceramics, carbon-carbon composites, metal honeycomb layers, fiberglass, Kevlar, and aluminum alloys, providing accurate identification, localization, and measurements of all types of internal and surface defects.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The commercial applications of the PRAXI system include its use for in situ NDE/NDT of large-area nonuniform multilayer aluminum/titanium/composite structures with complicated geometry (and combined textile polymeric, ceramic, and metal matrix composite structures as well) in aging and modern commercial aircraft, spacecraft, light marine vessels, and any application requiring defect detection for multilayer ceramic, composite, metallic, and plastic nonuniform structures.

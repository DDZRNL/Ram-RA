		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Demand for novel manufacturing methods for space systems brings unique properties of bulk metallic glasses (BMG) into the spotlight. In addition to superior mechanical properties associated with enhanced reliability, BMG technology can offer new manufacturing processes that result in components with higher complexity, eliminate machining, reduce joining, and minimize final assembly. We propose to utilize the unique thermoplastic forming (TPF) ability of bulk metallic glasses to net-shape complex containers and structures with integrated sensors and connectors. These integrated and multifunctional BMG structures range in size from 1 cm to 10 cm and comprise of features with various length scales (1- 5000 microns). The available size range is suitable for small satellites, propellant tanks, and similar components. The fabrication method that we propose to develop for NASA applications will yield shapes and dimensional accuracies that can't be achieved with any other metal fabrication method. In addition, we will demonstrate capabilities of integrating sensors (e.g. pressure sensor) into the skin of the structure and fabricating functional surfaces. The outcome of the project will be a demonstration of capabilities to manufacture multifunctional components with superior mechanical properties for space applications with a novel, low-cost thermoplastic forming process.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Development of novel manufacturing processes for structures with superior mechanical properties has long been identified as some of the critical needs for NASA. This includes multifunctional high-strength metallic components, high level of functional integration, reduction in part numbers, drastic reduction in required machining and welding, increased reliability, lower cost and faster lead times.  Our proposed project specifically addresses these issues. Thermoplastically net shaped BMG structures through blow-molding will fulfill these needs. Furthermore, the net-shape ability allows reduction of components, joints, costs and weight. It also enables multifunctional structures through integration of sensors, keys, and feedthroughs into BMG articles. This is achieved due to exceptional strength and elasticity of BMGs, as well as novel processing methods, developed and patented by Prof. Schroers at Yale and Supercool Metal. Specifically, for Phase I of the project, we will target net shaping and fabrication of multifunctional BMG structures with sizes suitable for small satellites,but this technology has broader implications on structural space applications in general.

		<BR>
		Combining the properties of best structural metals with the processability of thermoplastics brings unique opportunities that will have a vast impact in a broad range of industries. Net shaping of BMGs is highly attractive for electronic casings, defense (armor), aerospace, automotive, watches, and biomedical industries. Currently, Supercool Metals has several contracts with large commercial companies in the watch industry for production of prototype watch movement components based on our TPF net shaping and molding processes. We are also working with electronics companies on development of casings for mobile phones and laptops and with aerospace companies on replacement of Ti-based components.

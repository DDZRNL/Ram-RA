		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		M42 Technologies proposes to develop a RF based crosslink with relative navigation and time transfer capabilities to enable autonomous precision formation flying (PFF) of spacecraft as small as nanosatellites (1 to 10 kg).  The solution consists of a multi-channel software defined radio (SDR), small aperture antenna and innovative signaling and processing to enable CubeSat scaled spacecraft to measure positions with millimeter-level precision positioning thereby providing new capabilities such as autonomous rendezvous and docking (AR&D), and precision formation flying (PFF) both for human and robotic exploration missions. To improve navigation, the system also distributes time and frequency to enable cooperative and collaborative space science missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed system provides improvements in relative PNT with benefits for both human and robotic exploration.  It reduces reliance on Earth based systems thereby increasing system autonomy, reducing cost and enabling new capabilities such as deep space formation flying and autonomous rendezvous and docking. The multipurpose SDR can also change its function with mission phase and requirements, and will be able to sense and adapt to its RF environment to improve communications all within CubeSat compatible size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed solution also has great potential in a variety of military and pure commercial applications and in particular for cluster and fractionated spacecraft.  As an example, this technology enables sparse aperture arrays by enabling them to operate coherently based on the systems time and frequency distribution capabilities.

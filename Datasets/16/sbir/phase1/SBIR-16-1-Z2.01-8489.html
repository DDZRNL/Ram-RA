		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Triton Systems is currently developing an unpowered, switchable emissivity film for application to spacecraft surfaces. We call our approach Phase Change Thermochromic Radiator (PCTR); it self-switches from low to high emissivity above a designed temperature setpoint, causing a surface in space to radiate heat only when it becomes too warm and conserving heat otherwise. Key to the operation of PCTR is the phase change material vanadium dioxide, integrated into a multilayer thin film structure to produce a device which is reflective over the 3-35 um IR band below a transition temperature Tc but strongly absorptive above Tc. PCTR has advantages over competing approaches to dynamic emissivity such as electrochromics, in that it requires no electrical drive power, is relatively simple to fabricate, and contains only stable, rugged, well understood materials. The proposed program will significantly upgrade the performance of PCTR to approach the system requirements of planetary exploration probes and landers, manned and unmanned. Performance targets include high emissivity of 0.9, low emissivity of 0.15, turndown ratio of at least 6:1 and potentially 10:1, and solar alpha 0.1 or less. These advances will be achieved by a new design approach using nanostructural enhancement. Fabrication methods will be developed which can be scaled up to produce 10's of square meters of film. Beyond thermal performance tests (turndown, etc.), key qualification tests include thermal cycling, vibration, peel tests, surface charge and life degradation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The 2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps, TA14, call for thermal systems with reduced mass, reduced power requirements, enhanced performance, and increased reliability and survivability in hostile environments. Area 14.2 relates to Thermal Control Systems able to maintain vehicle surfaces and internals within an appropriate temperature range, and Sub-area 14.2 describes mid-temperature (-150 to 500C) Heat Rejection and Storage. Sub-goals 14.2.3 are to "Vary radiator heat rejection rates to match mission phase requirements" including Variable Heat Rejection Radiator Technology. Active Thermal Control is desired for space station, planetary exploration probes and landers, manned and unmanned.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to NASA applications, possible uses exist within DOD satellite programs, and for thermal signature control for land, water and air platforms. Commercial applications for a switchable emissivity film are likely in industries related to energy conservation and generation including thermophotovoltaics, and for architectural materials for windows or roofs.

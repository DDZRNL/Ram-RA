		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A robust and reliable wireless communication system capable of surviving the harshness and radiation of space is required for future space missions.  Current EVA (Extra Vehicular Activity) communications systems are out dated and in need of an overhaul.  Silicon Technologies Inc. (STI) proposes to design a wireless communication ASIC that will include audio DACs, ADCs, and a Dual-band WLAN as well as speaker drivers for a complete communication solution.  To minimize design and layout time, STI shall use its ADONIS Rad Hard by Design Analog Cell Library (RADL).  RADL contains the basic components required for the design of the ASIC including radiation hardened by design operational amplifiers, voltage references, analog transistors, resistors and capacitors.  STI has developed a revolutionary new design tool, ADONIS, which will be used for this ASIC design. One of the key benefits of using STI's ADONIS technology is that it provides NASA Rad Hard technology that is portable to new processes and will extend the potential life of the program by ensuring that the design can be manufactured in a new fab if the existing fab closes.  Additionally, ADONIS can do this at a lower cost with reduced risk compared to existing design technologies.  In Phase II, STI shall take the feasibility design in Phase I, build a prototype ASIC, and test the silicon electrically before and after radiation exposure.  Other advantages of the patented ADONIS design technology are: (1)Consistent cell structures with Rad Hard design, (2)Reduced mask costs by 80% using conventional techniques, (3)Repeatable structures which control leakage, (4)Interactions between cells are known at design time, (5)Faster design cycle resulting in a savings of more than 2x standard design time, (6)Portability between different CMOS processes (7)Noise and IR reduction due to a proprietary power and ground mesh, (8)1D approach, and (9)Compatible with future Ebeam Direct Write Technology when it is commercialized.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High performance Speaker Driver and Audio ASICs can be used as standalone devices or in CODECs for audio applications.  The market for Rad Hard Audio Speaker Driver include spacesuits, MP3 devices, sound cards, VoIP, telephones, LCD's, and speaker systems.  With the growth in the space market, there is an increasing need of high quality audio systems.  One potential use of the Speaker Driver would be a system for sound cancelation that could reduce the normal noise of a craft and only allow special sounds such as key alarms or voice to reach the user's ears, bringing attention to unusual sounds and/or alarms.  STI has a customer base and is experienced in the manufacturing and selling of their products. In addition to the Space Suit Audio Communications program, the high performance Rad Hard Audio ASICs can be used for sound cancelation systems inside space vehicles and other active audio systems.  When combined with other circuits, the Speaker Driver can be used for a variety of monitoring, telemetry, instrumentation, and controls.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		STI and Northrop Grumman expect to use the ADC or portions of it in the DARPA CRAFT program.  Discussions are ongoing with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), the Air Force, and the Army in a variety of applications, including instrumentation and monitoring.

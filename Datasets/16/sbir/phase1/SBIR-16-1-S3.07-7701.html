		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In response to significant gaps in advanced thermal control systems onboard CubeSats and SmallSats, and building off of the successful development of space-based FlexCoolTM two-phase thermal straps for CubeSats by its affiliated company i2C Solutions, Roccor proposes to develop a comprehensive thermal management component by adding a phase change material (PCM) thermal energy storage (TES) layer to the thin, flexible, high conductivity FlexCool thermal strap technology.  The resulting Flexible Thermal Energy Management, (FlexTherm) product is a single thin flexible component that integrates easily into CubeSat geometries, operates reliably in vacuum, and efficiently serves thermal acquisition, transport, rejection and thermal energy storage functions with a minimum size and volume.  To that end, the main objective of the proposed Phase I program is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of integrating PCMs with FlexCool, a thin, flat, flexible heat pipe technology whose feasibility was previously demonstrated for operation in the space environment.  The PCM layer will include paraffin waxes as the matrix material inside a metal casing with an internal metal woven mesh.  The internal mesh acts as a mechanical load bearing layer, as well as thermal conductivity enhancement material to spread heat into the TES materia

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary NASA target application for the proposed space-rated PCM panel technology is future NASA CubeSat and SmallSat spacecraft for which thermal control of on-board electronics is a major bottleneck in the system design.  In particular, the proposed technology will enable efficient thermal control by maintaining a constant temperature heat sink or heat source for a range of electronic components in rapidly changing thermal environments.  The PCM panel is being designed as a lightweight and flexible component, yet having high thermal capacity, requiring less mass and volume than currently used carbon-fiber and aluminum honeycomb composite panels.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Industry estimates of the small satellite market forecast a significant growth in the segment of nano-micro satellites (i.e., between 1 through 50 kg of weight) during the next few years.  Roccor?s FlexTherm products will be developed with the goal of being off-the-shelf components, available for the growing market of small and CubeSats, beyond NASA missions.

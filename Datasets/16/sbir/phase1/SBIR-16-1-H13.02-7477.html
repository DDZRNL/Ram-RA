		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase I SBIR proposal will address the use of innovative additive manufacturing technologies applicable to Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) and Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) strain and temperature sensors at ultra-high temperatures up to 1000 C. Technologies are required that enable flaw detection on atmospheric and space flight vehicles during deep space missions, hypersonic flight and reentry in harsh environments including high temperatures, combustion, high vacuum, high pressure, vibration, turbulence and cryogenic space conditions. Accurate strain gage readout at high and varying temperatures also requires temperature sensing for calibration. The prior art technologies of making strain gages and thermocouples have distinct limitations in direct application/integration to large 3D parts, cost, weight/resolution/feature size and operation to high temperatures. Direct-write printing has established itself as an enabling technology for production of both circuits and sensors on 3D and flexible surfaces that could not otherwise be fabricated with conventional techniques. This project will develop the specialized inks and deposition techniques necessary to implement additive manufacturing of hardened ultra-high temperature, lightweight strain gages and thermocouples with low profiles suitable for thin components. Fully integrated and modular sensors and arrays can be implemented for NDE and SHM of complex parts and hard-to-address locations that were previously out-of-bounds. Hardened inks may be applied by a variety of additive manufacturing techniques directly onto three-dimensional components or on high temperature substrates that can be adhered to complex components by refractory joining. High temperature stable strain gages will be proven feasible in Phase I to a Technology Readiness Level of at least 3. Phase II work on readout technology will focus on wireless techniques to take data remotely at high temperatures and on embedded components.

		The successful development of high temperature sensors opens new ways to control and monitor thermal and structural loads in high temperature environments. These situations are very critical for the performance of propulsion systems as well as hypersonic and space vehicles. Printed high temperature sensor technology allows the placement of sensors on difficult-to-access areas, on surfaces with single or double curvature, and on places where current technologies are too bulky such as thin blades or thin parts. Furthermore, thanks to their light weight, the proposed printed ultra-high temperature sensors can be deposited on multiple points, creating sensing arrays to monitor large areas without imposing a weight penalty on the system. This is an excellent value proposition for NASA where every ounce counts. NASA applications for integrated high temperature structural health monitoring sensors are extremely varied for both atmospheric and space systems. Some potential applications for the proposed technology include turbine engines, combustion monitoring, rocket nozzles, hypersonic structures, reactor components, pressure vessels, thermal protection systems for reentry, thermal management for space structures, integration of sensing elements on or within 3D printed ceramic structural components and lifecycle management of reusable spacecraft.

		<BR>
		Qi2 has a long history of supplying nondestructive evaluation tools and services to the petrochemical industry. Structural health monitoring (SHM) needs in high temperature environments are currently underserved in refineries, furnaces and other facilities that operate at temperatures up to 1000 C. Such locations are at risk for deformation and failure from creep rupture, creep fatigue at welds, creep fatigue cracking at bends, overheating and environmental attack, e.g., nitriding. Currently examination of such locations requires taking the facility off line for dye penetrant or radiography tests. In situ structural health monitoring would improve up time and minimize catastrophic failure.<BR><BR>Qi2 has an ongoing project for smart sensing of the exterior of aircraft. One significant gap in the current sensing scheme is the jet engines, which are outside the temperature range of current sensors. The proposed high temperature sensing technology will be also  be useful for incorporating strain and temperature sensors in hypersonic aircraft as desired by the U.S. Air Force. The technology will be suitable to instrument not only hypersonic wind tunnel aerodynamic testing models but also to be implemented on hypersonic flying structures.

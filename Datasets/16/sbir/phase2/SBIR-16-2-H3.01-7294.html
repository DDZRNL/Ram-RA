		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Rapid, accurate measurement and process control of silver ion biocide concentrations in future space missions is needed. The purpose of the Phase II program is to complete the development of an Smart Electroanalytical Multi-Sensor (SEMS) device for analysis and process control of biocidal silver in potable water, with the option integrating an Ag+ ion generator. The device will automatically provide continuous and on-demand maintenance of Ag+ ion biocide levels in spacecraft water streams and storage tanks, as well as providing output data for silver concentrations and a profile of total silver added to the system over time. Considerable test work is planned under AES programs and, given silver ion's 'elusiveness' in water systems, the data will be far more reliable if the methodology for adding the biocide and measuring its concentration is performed by a reliable and flight-qualifiable design from the beginning. Phase I culminated in a validated analytical methodology and 4 flight preproduction prototype for measurement and control of silver ion at sub-ppb levels in finished waters. The Phase II Technical Objectives and Work Plan are dedicated to fabrication, test & delivery of 3 flight-qualifiable instruments that conform to spacecraft applications and specifications as defined by NASA. The specific objectives will be to 1) develop a complete analytical characterization of the detection method, inclusive of automated autocalibration and QA/QC functions, 2) develop automated machine-learning capability to support agile & reliable operation in long-duration missions, 3) demonstrate the Feedback Control Function to maintain consistent Ag+ ion concentration in active water systems, and 4) demonstrate all operating parameters required to analyze Ag+ in the ranges of 50-5000 ug/l in potable water.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced Exploration Systems using silver as a biocide in water recovery and water supply systems are the primary focus of this effort. Additionally, the analytical platform can be expanded to provide NASA with an entirely new generation of instruments that will enable a level of agility and in-flight analytical capability that currently does not exist. Application of the SEMS analytical platform to a wide range of organic and inorganic analytes will provide a major new capability in biomedical, advanced life support, plant growth and scientific efforts aboard spacecraft. Examples include automated process control of plant-growth and life support systems, quantification and classification of organic contaminants in air and water, methodologies to support in-flight DNA analysis, mold and mycotoxin detection and identification.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Extensive global applications in environmental monitoring and industrial process control in automotive supply chain, semiconductor, pharmaceutical lighting, mining, energy production and energy storage industries. ELS Technology is already successfully implementing similar technology in industrial environments in Asia, Africa, Middle East, South America and the United States. This program will provide major new updates to the industrial instrument capabilities that have been deployed over the last two decades.

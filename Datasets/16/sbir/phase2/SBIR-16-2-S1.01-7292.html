		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Atmospheric methane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas. The overtone lines of methane at 1.65 micron are well suited for remote sensing of atmospheric methane in the Earth?s atmosphere. NASA have already demonstrated ground-based and airborne methane detection using Optical Parametric Amplifiers at 1651 nm using a laser with a narrow linewidth. In this setup a single frequency pulsed laser near 1 micron wavelength with several mJ pulse energy is needed. We propose to develop a compact pulsed single frequency fiber laser with greater than 3mJ pulse energy and 30ns pulse width using our innovative Yb-doping fiber. Highly efficient Yb doped glasses will be developed, double cladding fibers will be designed and fabricated, the amplifier performance will be characterized. In Phase II we will build a deliverable prototype high energy and high peak power fiber laser system for NASA.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This proposed single frequency high energy and high peak power fiber laser can be used as innovative lidar component for measurements of the atmosphere and gas contents of the Earth, Mars, the Moon, and other planetary bodies. This laser can also be used for other wavelength generation. Because it is fiber based, this single frequency high energy and high peak power amplifier is compact, efficient, and extremely reliable.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are a number of potential non-NASA commercial applications for high energy and high peak power fiber lasers and amplifiers. This laser source can be used to build commercial lidar for ranging and gas monitoring applications, and as the light source for optical sensing and scientific research. This laser can be used to build single frequency green laser.

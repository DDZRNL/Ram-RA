		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		One of the challenges faced by the National Airspace (NAS) stakeholders in general and the Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) i.e., Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in particular is the effective maintenance of safety in presence increasing demand by manned traffic and with introduction of Unmanned Air System (UAS) in the near future. Since there is going to be more traffic within in the same airspace volume some of the current event based, human centric safety mechanisms that are going to be overwhelmed. DAAS architecture addresses the overall requirement for ensuring safe operations in the NAS while embracing its complexity and leveraging the advancements in machine learning through one simple architecture. The single architecture can spawn tools focused at ensuring safety different areas of operation while being able to share information among them. The tools developed using DAAS will provide invaluable support to NASA and industry researchers in identifying, diagnosing and discovering the impacts of NextGen technologies on NAS safety and efficiency.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Our proposed technique can be used for a wide range of remote sensing applications for NASA and other parts of US government including:<BR>-	Safety analytics tool for SAMRT-NAS Test Bed<BR>-	Big data repository for aviation data<BR>-	Decision support tool for controllers and pilots<BR>-	Safety analytics plugin for ACES, FACET and other legacy simulation tools<BR>-	Aviation safety incident discovery tool to search for and prepare use cases
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The most promising Non- NASA commercial applications are:<BR>-	Safety analytics for future technologies<BR>-	Real time assessment of airline network for safety and efficiency

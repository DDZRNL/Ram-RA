		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Eotron has introduced an improved illumination source for 3D IR Laser Time-of-Flight (ToF) systems based on its patented 3D silicon technology originally developed to improve efficiency and power of solid state lasers.  Using proprietary design, fabrication and thermal management techniques, Eotron developed a highly efficient and compact silicon package / assembly for both IR VCSEL and Laser Diode illumination sources that can be modulated in high peak power & high frequency to increase the range and resolution of a 3D IR LiDAR system.  Eotron's 3D LiDAR system overcomes the limiting factors found in complex laser based systems while operating at less power consumption due to improved thermal management and a more efficient frequency driving method.  In addition to these advantages, the 3D LiDAR system can reduce system size and weight by over 50%, while also lowering cost of manufacturing.  Our system is ideal for applications requiring 3D long range, high resolution real time imaging in a light-weight and compact package.

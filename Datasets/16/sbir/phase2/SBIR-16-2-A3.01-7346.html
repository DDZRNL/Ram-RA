		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this SBIR effort, we integrate existing technologies to create an infrastructure that is ready to leverage emerging technologies to realize an oceanic Trajectory-based Operations (TBO) capability with seamless transitions to/from domestic/oceanic airspace. The system includes the processing of all forms of domestic/oceanic airspace surveillance, including the emergence of space-based Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B), FAA Ocean21 processing and dynamic airspace management, weather information from GOES-R satellites facilitating the Offshore Precipitation Capability (OPC), oceanic conflict probing first established in the Oceanic Conflict Advisory Trial (OCAT), Dynamic Airborne Reroute Procedures (DARP), and the use of Trajectory Options Sets (TOSs) facilitated by the Collaborative Trajectory Options Program (CTOP).
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR effort will produce software that can assist NASA?s Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP) and NASA's Airspace Technology Demonstrations (ATDs).  Furthermore, this SBIR effort will develop software components that can potentially assist a number of NASA research efforts in ATM, including but not limited to: TFM optimization, TBO, Integrated Arrival/Departure/Surface Operations (IADS), Weather Integrated Decision Making (Wx Integration), Precision Departure Release Capability (PDRC), Oceanic Tailored Arrivals (OTAs), Network Enabled ATM, and Fully Automated ATM/Airspace Operations System (AutoMax).
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR effort will improve arrival and departure operations for US-based air carriers that perform international flights out of airports near the US coastline.  The effort will additional assist airlines with en route traffic flying over coastal transitions to and from the US Domestic airspace and Oceanic Airspace.

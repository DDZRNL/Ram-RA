		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed project aims to develop a 20GSps 6-bit ADC required for microwave radiometers being developed for space and airborne earth sensing applications and radio telescopes. Aiming to improve performance and to reduce the size of the electronics, high resolution, high-sampling rate, power efficiency and low spur energy are required for ADCs employed for direct digitization. The proposed 20GS/s 6-bit time-interleaved successive approximation (SAR) ADC is intended to achieve >5 ENOB and 20GHz input bandwidth. A number of innovations will be introduced to the ADC in order to combine low power consumption with high signal to noise and distortion (SINAD), and spurious free dynamic range (SFDR). The proposed ADC will employ a novel timing calibration and interleave randomizing techniques which permit minimizing the peak energy of the spurs and increasing linearity. The proposed ADC chip will include a frequency synthesizer and a standard compliant configurable JESD204B interface for data exchange with an FPGA. The ADC will be implemented using a deep submicron CMOS technology. The project's Phase I confirmed the feasibility of implementing the proposed ADC. Phase II will include finishing design, fabrication, testing and delivering the ADC prototypes which will be ready for commercialization in Phase III.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The low-power radiation hardened 20GSps 6-bit ADC with a novel calibration technique capable of suppressing the peak energy of the spurs has great potential in current and future NASA microwave radiometers. In addition to its primary application, the proposed ADC ASIC is directly applicable to systems that require direct digitization of wide bandwidth RF signals, such as deep space communication radios and reconfigurable radios for SDR applications. NASA missions using Ku band, such as OIB (airborne program for precise sea and ice elevation monitoring) will also benefit from the proposed high-speed ADC optimized to be used for direct digitizing purposes.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to its primary application in spectral radiometry systems, the proposed wideband 20GS/s ADC and its building blocks will be targeting other commercial and military related markets which require high speed capture and digitization of wideband signals. Commercial applications include wireless (WiMAX, 3G, 4G) and fiber optic communication (10G Ethernet). The projected ramp-up of 100G Ethernet technologies will raise the industry demand for capable test equipment. High sampling rate provides the flexibility needed for such equipment. Therefore, it has great commercialization potential in this market segment. Potential military applications include high speed, secure communication and data transmission systems, and millimeter-resolution radars. Radiation hardness will secure a great demand for the proposed ADC in high energy and nuclear physics instruments, commercial communication and military satellites and nuclear power facilities.

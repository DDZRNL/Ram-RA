		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This NASA Phase II SBIR program would develop high sensitivity, high frequency nanomembrane based surface sensors for hypervelocity testing and analysis on wind tunnel and shock tube models, using SOI (Silicon on Insulator) NM techniques in combination with our pioneering nanocomposite materials. Such low-modulus, conformal nanomembrane sensors with integrated interconnected elements and electronic devices can be applied to new or existing wind tunnel models for high frequency pressure analysis, as well as for detection of the shock front edge arrival in shock tube facilities. NanoSonic has demonstrated the feasibility of NM transducer materials in such sensors for the measurement of dynamic normal pressure using shock tube facility. Semiconductor NM sensors are thin, mechanically and chemically robust materials that may be patterned in two dimensions to create multi-sensor element arrays that can be embedded into small probe tips.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The anticipated initial market of the NM sensors is for shock front arrival testing in hypervelocity testing facilities. Testing with NASA centers would allow improvements in sensor materials, electronics and packaging, and potentially allow the transition of related products to operational vehicles.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Primary customers would be university, government laboratory and aerospace industry researchers. Distributed pressure mapping on air vehicles as well as in biomedical devices and other systems may have merit. Further, the thin film sensor elements may be used as air flow or water flow devices in systems where either low weight, low surface profile, lack of need for space below the flow surface, or high sensitivity at a low cost are needed.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		With the goal to reduce astronaut time required to operate experiments on the ISS and advance automated and telerobotic technology, TUI proposes to collaborate with NanoRacks to develop a "Modular Advanced Networked Telerobotic Interface System" (MANTIS) that will integrate TUI?s existing KRAKEN robotic arm in a payload on the ISS. The MANTIS payload will reduce crew member burden to operate experiments by enabling automated and/or supervised teleoperation of the Plate Reader, MixStix, and other systems. MANTIS will also give researchers an open software framework based on the Robot Operating System (ROS) environment. MANTIS can also be used in STEM outreach through NASA sponsored competitions. The Phase I effort developed a detailed design for MANTIS payload. The Phase II effort will build an engineering unit of the MANTIS payload, design a unit ready for flight-qualification, and build an integrated test environment to enable NASA and NanoRacks to develop and test procedures for using the MANTIS payload.  The Phase III effort will mature the MANTIS payload to TRL-6 by performing experiments on NanoRacks hardware aboard the ISS. NanoRacks will collaborate with us in these efforts to enable integration with their experiment platform, and will be our transition partner for Phase III commercialization.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The MANTIS effort will deliver to NASA the development and integration tools and open software to enable researchers to develop and validate plans for using the MANTIS system to conduct experiments on the ISS using the MANTIS hardware planned for integration into the NanoRacks NanoLab facility. These tools will enable NASA and other entities to develop, validate, and then test on-orbit new methods for teleoperation and autonomy in the microgravity environment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		TUI intends to transition the MANTIS technology to our commercialization partner NanoRacks, who will use the MANTIS system to dramatically increase experimental throughput on their NanoLabs systems on the ISS.  In addition, the MANTIS platform will give researchers in NASA, academia, and commercial companies the ability to perform experiments with supervised telerobotic operation on the ISS as well as provide the community with development and integration tools, open software, and accessible hardware. The strong potential for successful commercial transition is evidenced by NanoRacks in-kind contributions to the MANTIS effort.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This two-phase SBIR program targets the need for highly integrated SiC-based electronics systems by developing gate drive circuitry that can be fully integrated with 4H-SiC power switching devices, enabling eventual realization of a monolithic power switching platform. Specifically, the final goal of this program is to develop and demonstrate a fully integrated, isolated gate driver architecture, having an integrated SiC power MOSFET. In addition to integrated resistors and capacitors, development of SiC CMOS technology will entail the demonstration of lateral SiC NMOSFETs and the more challenging SiC PMOSFET devices with adequate performance and radiation hardness. During Phase I, an NMOS-only gate drive buffer circuit was designed and implemented on the same host substrate used for fabricating 1200 V SiC DMOSFETs. Phase II will focus on integrating the gate drive buffer IC fabricated during Phase I with a 1200 V rated power SiC DMOSFET. Process and device development of a SiC PMOS technology will be conducted during Phase II, in pursuit of a SiC CMOS gate drive circuit. The fabricated power and lateral SiC devices will be subjected to extensive radiation testing to investigate the degradation pathways of this monolithic power switching device, when exposed to high radiation environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The SiC RHBD power ICs developed during this SBIR program is fundamental to a wide range of NASA PMAD and motor control applications. For DC-DC converters, the SiC power ICs will connect power sources in a wide variety of NASA mission with various loads like electric propulsion, communications systems, instruments and actuators. The radiation-hardness, high-temperature capability, fast switching speeds, compact form factor and low mass offered by the proposed SiC SJT based power converters will be invaluable for future NASA science missions. Switch-mode power supplies improved by high frequency, high temperature power switches developed in this program are critical for NASA synthetic aperture RADAR's (SAR) antenna array T/R modules. T/R modules typically operate in a pulsed mode, drawing current pulses from a power supply on a periodic basis determined by the operation of the overall RADAR system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Air-Force propulsion system externals like actuators, pumps, and starters, weapons ejection, fuel transfer, lighting, avionics, RADAR, landing gears & breaks, steering, powered doors and ramps, gun drives, anti-icing, environmental control and auxiliary emergency power systems. The realization of a high power density switchmode power supplies and DC-DC conversion circuits will benefit Army's Future Combat System (FCS) by offering it an important part of the subsystem. An integrated electric power system made using SiC high power devices will increase component placement flexibility within vehicles, double fuel economy by continuously operating smaller engines under optimum conditions, and reduce armor protected volume.  It will also enable an increased acceleration and maneuverability due to immediate torque to the wheels or tracks, reduce vehicle thermal and acoustic signatures and reduce system cost and logistics requirements. Commercial switch-mode power supplies will also benefit from the development of such components.

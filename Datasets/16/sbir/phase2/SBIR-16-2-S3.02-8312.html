		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		One of the biggest obstacles preventing the widespread implementation of small satellites is the process of actually getting them into space. Current methods include hitching rides as secondary payloads. Although this initiative has provided significant new launch capacity for CubeSat-class spacecraft, it is not without issues, most specifically limited orbits and orbital lifetime. Many missions need higher orbits to perform their missions; and lower orbits are subject to atmospheric drag that may cause premature reentry. Safe and affordable miniaturized propulsion can overcome these limiting factors and is a high-visibility capability sought by the CubeSat community. Even basic capabilities to push in one direction will allow nanosats to remain in orbit longer, or allow a satellite placed into low-Earth orbit to propel itself to a higher or more circular orbit. In Phase I, Plasma Processes designed, fabricated and delivered to NASA a miniaturized propulsion system compatible with non-toxic HAN- and ADN-based green monopropellants for small spacecraft propulsion. In Phase II, the green propellant thrusters will be tested will both monopropellants for pressure fed and pump fed 1U propulsion modules. The use of advanced, non-toxic propellants will increase mission capabilities including longer mission durations, additional maneuverability, increased scientific payload space, and simplified launch processing. Adding propulsion will also enable de-orbiting of the satellite after completion of the mission.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA Applications include small spacecraft and satellite missions requiring Orbit change & Attitude Control, Precision Propulsion, Formation Flying and Target Reentry. Examples of future mission implementation are next-generation Fast, Affordable, Science and Technology Satellite (FASTSAT); Lunar Flashlight; NEA Scout; and SLS secondary payloads.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial application of the technology will provide safe and affordable miniaturized propulsion to support the emerging small, micro- and nano- satellite community; and small satellite constellations to provide global internet and mapping by joint ventures including SpaceX/Google, TerraBella (Skybox), Planet Labs and One Web LLC. The technology will also benefit low cost launch providers, Space-X, Virgin Galactic, Firefly, ULA, and Orbital ATK, with an increase in secondary payload demand.

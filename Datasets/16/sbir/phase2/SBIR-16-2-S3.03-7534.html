		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this proposed Phase II, Scientic and Vanderbilt University will develop a novel vacuum field emission differential amplifier (VFEDA) using low electron affinity nanodiamond (ND) material as electron emitters for high-power electronic application in harsh environments. The ND-VFEDA is a fundamental circuit building block for vacuum integrated circuits (VICs) ideally suited for high radiation and space applications. The proposed high-power ND-VFEDA will be capable of operating over a wide-temperature range (-125&#730;C to 450&#730;C), possess tolerance  to extreme doses of ionizing radiation and deliver the long-term reliability and stability  needed to successfully execute environmentally stressful space science missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The anticipated exceptional radiation hardness, temperature intensity, and performance parameters of the diamond-based vacuum differential amplifiers make them well suited to all space-based applications.   Scientic market research has found a need for high power amplifiers in satellite operations for both NASA and DOD applications.  Low to no impedance high power switching is required in many research areas within NASA, such as electrostatic analyzers (ESA) used in Heliophysics experiments.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Previous experience and research has demonstrated a requirement for extreme temperature and radiation hardened amplifiers for defense and space applications.  Scientic believes multiple programs run by the Air Force Research laboratory and the Air Force Space and Missile Center would benefit from technology utilizing ND-VFEDA devices.

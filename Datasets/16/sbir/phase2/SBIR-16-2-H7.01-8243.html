		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A Phase II SBIR transition of NanoSonic's HybridSil poly(imide siloxane) ablative adhesive technology will provide a pivotal funding bridge toward its Phase III integration within next-generation EDL thermal protection materials. Based on highly encouraging Phase I results indicating HybridSil poly(imide siloxane) adhesives afford an increase in adhesive strength up to 659% to phenolic thermosets and 756% to cyanate thermosets when tested at 125 C while also integrating low Tg (-98 C) polysiloxane domains necessary for desirable low temperature flexibility and impact resistance, NanoSonic envisions significant Phase III transition potential into next-generation aeroshell designs. <BR><BR>During the proposed Phase II effort, NanoSonic will rigorously optimize the high temperature adhesive strength of HybridSil poly(imide siloxane) adhesives to a broader spectrum of aeroshell materials up to 400 C, supply promising adhesives to team partner Lockheed Martin Space Systems for construction and mechanical testing of prototype ablative thermal protective samples, complete a comprehensive analysis of the physical and mechanical properties of down-selected adhesives properties for TPS design engineers, and transition Phase II optimized adhesive resins to 55-gallon batch manufacturing quantities for distribution to NASA and Lockheed Martin groups. Upon completion of the Phase II program, NanoSonic's high temperature HybridSil adhesives will facilitate future reductions in total aeroshell mass for increased payload opportunities by enabling the use less adhesive and reduced thickness TPS.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Primary NASA applications will include entry, descent and landing ablative thermal protection systems for future planetary entry vehicles while immediate secondary applications will include spacecraft aerocapture systems. Additional NASA applications will include utility within a broad spectrum of reentry body heat shield systems.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Broad secondary non-NASA applications exist for NanoSonic's HybridSil TPS tile adhesives. Immediate Phase III transition potential will exist within an array of aerospace heat shield systems, as well as fire protective materials within the aerospace, marine, and automotive industries.

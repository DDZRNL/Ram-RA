		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The goal of these Phase I and Phase II efforts is to develop a micro atmospheric data sensor suitable for planetary entry, descent, and landing (EDL) maneuvers, in response to NASA?s SBIR topic S4.01, Planetary Entry Descent and Landing. Michigan Aerospace Corporation (MAC) is proposing to develop a compact, rugged optical atmospheric data sensor capable of measuring free stream velocity during EDL; this sensor will use a novel microresonator approach as part of its light processing path, allowing unprecedented compactness and ruggedness. Phase I entailed the design and preliminary demonstration of the concept. A prototype atmospheric data sensor will be fabricated in Phase II and tested using a calibrated flow field.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's planetary exploration program will benefit from this effort by having a new, compact method to sense airspeed and atmospheric conditions during atmospheric entry for navigation and scientific purposes. In addition, this compact air data sensor will be applicable to small, unmanned UAVs and aeronautics high-speed programs.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The commercial applications for this compact air/atmospheric data sensor are widespread. Such a small sensor will be usable on UAVs, commercial aircraft, and also hypersonic vehicles where protrusion into the free stream is not an option. Michigan Aerospace Corporation has extensive ground- and air-based LIDAR and optical air data systems programs, which will profit from a smaller, more rugged sensing element.

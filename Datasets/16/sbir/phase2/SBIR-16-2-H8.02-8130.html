		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Lunar, Mars and deep space exploration missions require enhanced mission flexibility (i.e., using whatever resources available at the destination) in order to reduce logistics burden and overall mission cost. Power generation technologies that are fuel-flexible, multi-use (e.g., Moon or Mars), and cross-platform (lander use, rover use or stationary) are critical for mission flexibility.  Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is the most suitable technology for electricity generation from hydrocarbons (including methane) and other fuels.  State-of-the-art SOFCs are based on internal or external fuel reforming cannot function without large volumes of water (such as >300 kg of water consumption per 100 kg of methane) and have low efficiency.  During the Phase I, Lynntech studied five different electrocatalysis concepts with more than 30 different electrocatalysts and identified a class of anode materials that provided direct electrochemical oxidation with high power densities using dry methane (320 mW/cm2) and humidified methane (408 mW/cm2).  During Phase II, Lynntech will further optimize the anode composition and electrode structure, conduct the electrochemical characterization in single cell and short stacks, design and built a 1 kW stack with a hot box module, and show the operational performance for 500 hr using dry methane.

		<BR>
		Future space missions will require a significant degree of mission flexibility (meaning utilize the resources available at the destination).  Power generation devices are one of the critical components that determine the mission flexibility parameter. Generation of electricity via solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology maximizes the mission flexibility and such systems can be used for the following NASA commercial applications:  Mars landers, rovers, and other exploration vehicles, sun-independent electrical power generation for crew transportation systems and surface systems, power generation for surface mobility systems, Lunar landers, and other similar applications. Lynntech?s SOFC technology utilizes an advanced electrochemical oxidation catalyst for direct electrochemical oxidation to get the highest efficiency and provides very high power densities with dry fuels without the complexity of conventional SOFCs with reformers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Solid oxide fuel cell technology demonstrated the highest achievable energy efficiency for electric power generation from hydrocarbon fuels such as natural gas, methane, syngas, and other similar fuels. Carbon coking issue has been very detrimental on the long term durability (which has also affected their commercialization) and a major hurdle to overcome without the use of additional water or oxygen in the fuel stream.  Lynntech?s SOFC technology employs an advanced and cheap direct electrochemical oxidation electrocatalyst, utilizes dry fuels without water, has no carbon coking issues, and most importantly provides very high power densities with high efficiency.  Potential non-NASA commercial applications for this technology would be: commercial and military unmanned underwater vehicles, military tactical gen-sets, auxiliary power units for silent-watch vehicles, commercial and military unmanned aerial vehicles, and residential micro-combined heat and power systems.

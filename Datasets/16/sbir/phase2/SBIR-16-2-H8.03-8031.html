		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Deployable Space Systems, Inc. (DSS) has developed a next-generation high performance solar array system specifically for NASA's future Lander and sample return missions.  The proposed Lander solar array has game-changing performance metrics in terms of extremely high specific power, ultra-compact stowage volume, affordability, low risk, high environmental survivability/operability, high power and growth capability, high deployed strength and high strength during deployment (for mission environments that have high gravity and wind loading from atmospheres such as Mars), high deployed stiffness, high reliability, retraction and re-deployment capability, and broad modularity / adaptability to many missions.  The proposed innovation is a tensioned membrane blanket solar array that stows very compactly with no auxiliary components extending beyond the stowed volume envelope of the stowed flexible blanket assembly, and when deployed becomes structurally pre-tensioned to create a deployed rigid body 'tensegrity-like' configuration that exhibits very high deployed strength and stiffness.  The proposed technology innovation significantly enhances Lander and sample return vehicle capabilities through its enabling performance and by providing a low cost alternative renewable power generating system in place of the very expensive standard RTG systems currently being used.  The proposed innovation greatly increases performance and autonomy/mobility, decreases risk, and ultimately enables missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA space applications are comprised of practically all Exploration, Space Science, Earth Science, Planetary Surface, and other missions that require affordable high-efficiency photovoltaic power production through of an ultra-lightweight, ultra-compact stowage, high strength and stiffness, and highly-modular solar array system.  The technology is particularly suited for Lander and sample return missions that require game-changing performance in terms of affordability, high power, compact stowed packaging, high deployed strength and stiffness, unsupported deployment in 1G, and lightweight.  The technology is suitable for NASA LEO, MEO & GEO, and interplanetary missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA space applications are comprised of practically all missions that require affordable high-efficiency photovoltaic power production through deployment of an ultra-lightweight, ultra-compact stowage, high strength and stiffness, affordable, and highly-modular solar array system.  Potential non-NASA commercial and DoD applications span a broad range of applications that demand ultra-compact stowage and very high strength and stiffness.  The technology is suitable for non-NASA LEO, MEO & GEO missions.  The technology is particularly suited for reconnaissance missions that require game-changing performance in terms of affordability, ultra-lightweight, compact stowage volume, and high deployed strength and stiffness.

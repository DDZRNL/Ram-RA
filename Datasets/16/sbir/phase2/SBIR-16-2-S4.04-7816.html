		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Makel Engineering, Inc. (MEI) working with Ozark Integrated Circuits, Inc (OzIC) and United Silicon Carbide, Inc. (USCI) will develop a high temperature SiC electronics to support chemical microsensors for measuring the atmosphere of Venus at the surface for extended durations (100's of days).  The chemical sensor array for measuring species at the surface of Venus has been developed by MEI.  The Venus Microsensor Chemical Array can operate in a 500 C environment, but currently relies on silicon based electronics for signal acquisition, control, and data transmission. These electronics require cooling for a Venus mission.  Our Phase I program defined approaches for the use SiC electronics to perform the control and signal transduction functions.  A Venus In-situ Atmospheric Measurement Instrument Package (VIAMIP) was defined based on SiC ASICs. In Phase II, MEI and OzIC will develop ASIC designs compatible with the NASA's SiC process flow.   In parallel, MEI and USCI will undertake design and fabrication of designs adapted for USCI?s SiC process to establish a commercial source for SiC ASICs for the VIAMIP and to expanded the uses of high temperature microsensors.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary NASA application of the specific technology will be for instrument development for Venus exploration. Future missions in the atmosphere and surface of Venus as defined by the Venus Flagship Mission Science and Technology Definition Team will require high temperature electronics. The proposed development of high temperature electronics for a chemical measurement instrument supports the Decadal Survey finding that the Venus In-situ Explorer mission to be a New Frontiers high priority mission. The high temperature electronics also have direct applications to on-engine instruments, such as pressure transducers, chemical sensors, and actuators for jet engines.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA commercial applications are related to the use of instrumentation in high temperature applications such as mining, deep oil drilling, jet engine instrumentation and controls, solid oxide fuel cells, monitoring of geothermal wells, and deep underground mining. The use of high temperature, electronics which do not require active cooling can enable operation in environments which exceed the 250 C limit of commercial high temperature electronics.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We offer an ultra-compact klystron amplifier for remote sensing on CubeSats. It will operate at 35.7 GHz, have 400 MHz bandwidth, and output greater than 32 watts with 35 dB gain. It employs a two-stage depressed collector, allowing prime efficiency of 50%. Comparable solid state power amplifiers have 15% efficiency and output only 7 W. klystrons are the only amplifier technology that can be miniaturized to this degree.  Volume with power conditioner and driver is less than 0.500 cm3, half the allowed space. It uses a breakthrough ultra-miniature scandate cathode capable of 100A/cm2 at 1000 degrees C and 5A/cm2 at less than 800 degrees C. At this temperature, life is more than 100,000 hours. The klystron uses cathode ray tube construction, which lowers weight, size and cost (two to five times less than standard brazed ceramic-metal construction). Parts are fastened via glass rods or mechanical capture or by spot welding. Most parts are standard off-the-shelf, which further lowers cost. It uses a glass vacuum envelope, glass feedthroughs, combination RF window-coupler and barium getters to maintain vacuum.  In Phase I we successfully built two beam testers. In Phase II we construct an entire amplifier package in CubeSat volume. E  beam, inc. is a leader in innovative miniature cathodes, electron guns and vacuum electron devices generally. It has long promoted cathode ray tube construction as a way to mass produce medium power microwave tubes.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A major objective of NASA's Science Mission Directorate is to use smaller, more affordable spacecraft.  Another goal is multiple experiments on the same launch.  This lowers cost and risk.  The rapid deployment of small, low-cost remote sensing instruments is essential in meeting these objectives.  It has an explicit mission to reduce the risk, cost, size and development time of SMD observing instruments. This invention meets all those requirements and will find a ready market in NASA earth satellite missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		CubeSats are the enabling technology for space research by universities.  This device will provide them with remote sensing capability of clouds, the ionosphere, other satellites, and earth features.<BR>The larger commercial application is its potential for communications.  Not only klystrons but broadband TWTs can be fabricated at a fraction of the cost of standard TWTs using this construction technology.  There is an important market between 100 and 1000 watts not adequately addressed.  These are powers too high for solid state to address efficiently.  The power is too low for standard ceramic-metal tube construction to address cost effectively.  The dollars/watt is too high.  Glass electrostatically focused TWTs and klystrons with glass rod fastening can be manufactured at one-fifth the cost of ceramic-metal tubes.  There are 300,000 cell towers in the U.S.  Frequency and power need to go up.  This technology provides a way forward.

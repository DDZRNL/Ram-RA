		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		There is a clear need to advance the state-of-the-art carbon-carbon coated Nozzle Extensions (NE) beyond the engine/mission performance currently established by Herakles technology, which is intrinsically limited to about 3000 F. The well-established SiC-based (CVD, pack cementation) technologies currently available also have upper temperature limits around 3000 F, imposing stringent limitations on increased performance and system level changes (i.e. hotter propellant) for future NASA missions. In addition, the intrinsic CTE mismatch between C-C substrate and refractory carbides/oxides further limits the use of many other classical coating technologies. The successful Phase I results established the feasibility of overcoming these limitations through the use of a novel, functionally graded (FGM) coating technology. The proposed Phase II builds on the success of the Phase I program and clearly increases its TRL by offering subscale component testing at representative engine conditions. A successful Phase II program will clearly offer a new dimension in the nozzle extensions by offering different coating systems for multi-cycle capability at temperatures from 3000 F up to 4000 F.  The expected ability of the coating to survive such an aggressive testing combined with the sufficient retention of mechanical properties offers a direct path for a Phase III with many of the commercial space payload companies. The overall approach is based upon a multi-piece C-C NE concept, which focuses the requirements for high temperature oxidation protection to smaller diameters of the nozzle extension (e.g. A cone), allowing the CVD coating technology to remain within current SOTA CVD capabilities. Larger diameter segments, which are exposed to lower temperatures, will utilize non-CVD lower cost technology which is well suited for large diameter components. The direct benefit to NASA is undisputed with direct applicability to several planned future missions, including the very challeng

		High performance domestically produced C-C Nozzle Extensions with reliable higher temperature capable anti-oxidation coating are one of the most critical and enabling technologies for future US launch systems. <BR><BR>Potential applications are identified below: <BR><BR>NASA Space Launch System (SLS) Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) - Upper stage with four RL10C engines is leading candidate (RL10C-1, RL10C-2). <BR>Other engine possibilities: J-2X, ESA Vinci (w/ C-SiC NE), commercial engines. <BR><BR>NASA Robotic Missions - Example: Solar Probe Plus Mission - Orbital ATK Space Systems Star 48GXV solid motor with mid-size C-C exit cone. <BR><BR>NASA Advanced Exploration Systems and In-Space Propulsion - Nuclear propulsion systems. Lunar and Mars lander descent and ascent stages.

Our non-CVD lower cost coating technology can be adapted to the commercial markets quickly with less facility constraints. <BR><BR>Finally, this technology may also be inserted directly into commercial semiconductor applications (MoCVD), where current CVD SiC technology is the norm.

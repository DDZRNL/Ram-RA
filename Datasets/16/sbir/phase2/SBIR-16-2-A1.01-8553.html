		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Clear Science Corp. proposes to develop and demonstrate computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based, reduced-order aeroservoelasticity modeling and simulation technology for fast and accurate predictions of nonlinear flight dynamics, enabling real-time, piloted and unpiloted flight simulations and providing a tool to design flight controllers for highly flexible, lightweight aircraft.  Physics-based, reduced-order models (ROMs) will be developed and demonstrated with data from CFD models of the X-56, an experimental aircraft that NASA and the U. S. Air Force are using to test systems for flutter suppression and gust-load alleviation.  Extended range and low fuel consumption through lightweight materials and large wing spans (high lift-to-drag ratios) are the drivers in next-generation aircraft like the X-56, but these attributes create challenges in maintaining flight safety, ride quality, and long-term structural durability.  The development of flight controllers that can actively manage aeroservoelastic effects (body-freedom flutter, control reversal, gust loading) without compromising safety and aerodynamic performance is a key objective of both the X-56 Program and the proposed project.  Through the proposed technology, nonlinear, aeroservoelastic ROMs can be coupled to other components of a flight simulator (six-degrees-of-freedom flight mechanics models and control software) to improve the fidelity of simulations that support controller design for a wide range of operating conditions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology and its development using the X-56 as a demonstration platform targets key aspects of the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) Strategic Thrust 3A (Ultra-Efficient Commercial Vehicles Subsonic Transport).  The commercial product to be developed is an engineering tool for modeling aeroservoelastic dynamics in flexible air vehicles.  The software will use data generated by high-fidelity aeroservoelastic CFD models to construct efficient ROMs for all phases of the development process from early concept trade studies to flight testing and aircraft certification.  Flexible, lightweight vehicles are an emerging market, promising reduced take-off weight, greater range, and lower fuel costs.  The ultra-efficient designs present safety challenges (flutter, divergence, control reversal, gust loading, structural failure, fatigue), requiring innovative flight control systems to effectively manage aeroservoelastic instabilities.  The proposed technology will enable the design and testing of new controllers for highly flexible aircraft through accurate, low-dimensional aeroservoelastic models capable of real-time predictions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed project will focus on the experimental X-56 program with much broader potential applications relating to flutter prediction and suppression, gust load prediction and alleviation, and active/adaptive aero-structural control.  The modeling technology is an enabler for next-generation fighter aircraft operating over subsonic, transonic, and supersonic flight regimes, commercial launch vehicles, and rotorcraft, all requiring advanced flight control for complex aeroservoelastic environments.  Simpler, currently available models based on inviscid flow and panel methods become insufficient with more complex vehicle geometries, higher speeds, and the presence of complex coupling like shock-boundary layer interactions.  CFD-based ROMs can be game changers in these applications.  The modeling technology is capable of predicting not only six-degrees-of-freedom forces and moments for aeromechanics analyses but also spatially distributed loads, providing close coupling between the disciplines of aerodynamics, aeroservoelasticity, flight control, and structural dynamics during the development of fixed-wing aircraft, launch vehicles, and rotorcraft.

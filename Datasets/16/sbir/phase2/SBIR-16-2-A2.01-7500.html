		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Procedures are critical to experimental tests as they describe the specific steps necessary to efficiently and safely carry out a test in a repeatable fashion.  The procedure process includes creating test procedures, validating those procedures, executing the procedures during a test, and then analyzing and auditing the results. Relying on paper-based test procedures hampers data collection and distributed teamwork during test operations  In Phase I of this project, TRACLabs prototyped a cloud-based electronic test procedure system that provides procedures via web browsers on tablets or laptops and guides the operator through the procedure step-by-step. TRACLabs also implemented a CAN bus interface between its electronic test procedure system and test hardware. This allows data from the test hardware to be displayed in-line with the procedure and for the procedure to send commands to the test hardware. TRACLabs will extend the electronic test procedure system in Phase II and integrate with NASA's AirVolt aeronautics test facility.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Our initial application of this technology will be NASA aeronautics research projects such as the Scalable Convergent Electronic Propulsion Technology Operations Research (SCEPTOR) X-57 project and the AirVolt test facility, both at NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center. Additional aeronautics research projects would follow. The system is being evaluated for use in ground operations for the Resource Prospector robotic mission to the moon being jointly developed by NASA JSC and ARC.  Applications to ISS and Orion mission operations are also envisioned and we are working with NASA Flight Operations Directorate (FOD) personnel at NASA Johnson Space Flight Center. NASA's Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment (SGSS) project that is modernizing the space agency's ground infrastructure systems for their Space Network is evaluating this system as a potential technology for Local Operating Procedures (LOPs).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		TRACLabs is already selling the core technology proposed in this project  as a commercial product with a large oil field services company  as a launch customer.  Field-testing at several sites world-wide is currently underway before deployment in actual operations in mid-2017. TRACLabs expects additional customers in the oil and gas industry will deploy PRIDE  once it has been proven effective by by our launch customer.  Sierra Nevada Corporation has also purchased licenses for use in their Dream Chaser program, which was recently selected to deliver cargo to ISS. TRACLabs is beginning a pilot program with a large chemical manufacturer to explore the usefulness of electronic procedures in their operations. We expect additional manufacturing customers, especially in aerospace, in the future.

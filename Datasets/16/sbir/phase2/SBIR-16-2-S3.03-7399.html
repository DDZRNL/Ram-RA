		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The effects of electromagnetic interactions in electrical systems are of growing concern due to the increasing susceptibility of system components to electromagnetic interference (EMI), use of automated electronic systems, and pollution of the electromagnetic environment with electromagnetic emissions. The effects of EMI can be detrimental to electronic systems utilized in space missions; even small EMI issues can lead to total mission failure, resulting in significant mission delays and economic loss. Additionally, NASA is challenged to find ways of effectively shielding sensitive electronic equipment from EMI without adding significant weight to space flight vehicles and satellites in order to manage fuel costs. The solution for both issues resides in the use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which offer the most promising solution for reducing spacecraft wire weight. CNTs are an alluring alternative to conventional conductors used in coaxial data cables because they combine mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and low density. DexMat has developed a novel CNT deposition process for directly applying CNTs onto dielectric materials to produce an electrically conductive EMI shield. By placing a premium on the quality of raw CNTs, DexMat has created a product with increased potential to reduce cable weight while minimizing insertion losses when incorporated into wire. In the proposed research, DexMat seeks to develop a small-scale CNT Tape production process and continue the development of the CNT separation processes. The need for CNT Tape was discovered while obtaining feedback from potential customers that noted the desire for a product format that allows for quick and easy integration into existing manufacturing processes without the need for outsourcing processes.

		<BR>
		Lightweight CNT shielded cables would provide a significant cost-effectiveness by reducing weight in space applications. DexMat technology offers a significant weight reduction, up to 80%, in these wires resulting in a noteworthy cost savings for launched vehicles. Given the tremendous costs associated with satellite launches, the NASA will see significant savings from our CNT-based wire.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial and military aerospace companies are seeking opportunities to reduce weight on their aviation and space platforms to improve range and lower operating costs. Fuel costs are one of the biggest concerns among commercial airlines. Reducing exposure to fuel costs is a significant priority for all operators of aircraft and space systems. A large commercial aircraft such as the Boeing 747 uses approximately 135 miles of wire, weighing over 4,000 pounds, about half of this weight comes from wire shielding components. Significant weight reductions could save millions of dollars per plane over its operating lifetime.<BR>DexMat technology is extremely versatile and may be applied in a variety of industries and lead to enhancements of numerous products.  After showing successful integration into the aviation manufacturing industry, DexMat plans to expand CNTs into the textile, sensors and medical devices, electronics, energy storage and structural industries. CNTs offer significant improvements to existing technologies in these industries and could outperform current state-of-the-art products on the market.

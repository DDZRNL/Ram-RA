		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Dryden (Armstrong) Flight Research Center has developed a 4-fiber interrogation system for Fiber Optic Smart Structures (FOSS) sensor networks interrogation. Replacing the expensive, bulky, mechanically tuned swept laser technology used in the FOS system will help reduce the system cost, size and weight, and enable massive deployment. In this program, Freedom Photonics proposes to develop a novel, inexpensive semiconductor based widely tunable laser, which can be tuned using simple tuning algorithms and control.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The applications for the FOS technology with NASA: stress and strain monitoring in air and space vehicles; temperature monitoring in air and space vehicles. Structural health monitoring in air and space vehicles. Liquid fuel level monitoring in rockets.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications include temperature and pressure monitoring for oil and gas drilling, monitoring the strain on blades of wind turbines, sensing liquid levels in vats of chemicals, monitoring temperature and strain along the wings or blades of aerial vehicles, and monitoring the interior and exterior structural strain of all sorts of structures, 3D shape sensing. Spectroscopy, instrumentation for spectroscopic measurements.

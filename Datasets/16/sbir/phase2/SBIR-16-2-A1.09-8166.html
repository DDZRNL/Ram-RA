		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed program addresses NASA's need for a new generation of icing mitigation technology for manned and unmanned vehicles. The state of the art active de-icing method on leading edges involves either an electrical, pneumatic or vibration induced debonding of accumulated ice. There is a need for an anti-ice coating that functions synergistically with active de-icing methods. The advantages are reduced power consumption, improved service life of mechanical components, lighter electronics and extra protection in case of failure of active device. The Phase I program has addressed this need and technology gap, and has demonstrated the feasibility of combining a durable anti-ice coating with an active deicing device, thereby creating an integrated de-icing system. Icing tunnel testing results demonstrated that the coating provides improved de-icing efficiency, along with a reduction in power consumption of the active de-icing device. In collaboration with a manufacturer of active de-icing systems and a company developing advanced technologies to enhance aircraft performance and safety, the Phase II effort will refine the coating composition and application characteristics for use on aircraft so as to meet the stringent requirements of the aerospace and aeronautic industry. Further, we will establish a product specification of an anti-ice coating system for use with active de-icing systems and develop protocols for applying the coating at both OEM sites and field applications. The success of the program will lead to prevention of ice buildup on aircraft leading edges, improve aircraft safety, and reduce energy consumption during deicing procedures.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed integrated deicing system directly supports NASA's continued interest in researching the most effective means for aircraft icing detection, removal, and mitigation. Existing and next generation aircraft (including N+2/N+3 aircraft, as well as vertical lift and unmanned systems) will benefit from the technology as it will help enable all-weather operation, reduce weight and lower power consumption. Success in the proposed effort will advance the capabilities of the active de-icing systems. Apart from using the anti-ice coatings in conjunction with active de-icing systems, these coatings can also be used on the wings of unmanned aerial vehicles operated by NASA; radio telescopes and transmission/receiving dishes located in cold climates where icing can hamper the performance, rocket launch pads and microwave towers operated by NASA or its affiliates.<BR>The proposed program can also address the icing problem in both high altitude long endurance UAVs (HALE-UAV) and low altitude high speed UAVs (LAHS-UAV). Icing can occur on the wings of these UAVs during take-off/landing and ascent/descent, which can lead to an increase in drag and reduction in endurance and control, consequently jeopardizing the mission.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Other than aerospace, applications that can benefit from the use of anti-ice coatings, either as a standalone coating, or in combination with another active or passive de-icing device, include: (i) wind mills, where ice on the rotor blades can increase wind turbine load, as well as pose a safety hazard when chunks of ice can come loose and be propelled some distance from the turbine; (ii) communication towers, where, the presence of ice can be a safety hazard; (iii) transmission lines, where ice accumulation results in their snapping, and (iv) train cars, where the presence of ice can be a safety hazard.

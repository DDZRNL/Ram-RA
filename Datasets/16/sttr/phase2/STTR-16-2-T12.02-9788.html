		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Supporting aerospace mission readiness, a system is needed that allows for composite repairs without the current roadblocks imposed by ovens, autoclaves, and expensive tooling. Cornerstone Research Group (CRG), its subsidiary NONA Composites, and the University of Dayton Research Institute (UDRI) presents NASA with the opportunity to obtain a rapid and robust method for on-site composite structural repairs that is cost effective and flexible to a wide spectrum of repair scenarios. &nbsp;In Phase I the program succeeded in establishing concept viability. The strength of the NONA repair was considerably better than a comparable existing system. The repair steps allow for a complete repair to occur in a single eight-hour shift. Additionally, NONA Composites independently showed that the repair technology could be delivered in a simple, easy to use kit. The kit contains everything that a user would need and is now being evaluated by a range of beta testers to allow for a launch of this first generation product directly as a result of the Phase I and NONA Composites activity. In Phase II, CRG and NONA Composites will establish allowable use parameters and design specifications. Quality control efforts will focus on improvements in the existing kit, but will also translate to additional repair configurations, including repair of different composite materials. UDRI will perform scarf activities and conduct destructive and non-destructive evaluation. Finally, the team will perform an on-site repair at Kennedy Space Center to show the true flexibility and portability of the technology. The Phase II effort will also help support further technology socialization and continued business analysis on cost, supply chain, and market acceptance. The NONA repair process enables fast, effective composite repairs. The true cost savings of the technology is realized by limiting down time and offering greater system reliability.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Supporting NASA's Kennedy and Johnson Space Centers, this project's technologies directly address requirements for simplified but effective repair techniques for Space Launch System composite fairings, skirts, and tanks.  This project's technologies offer reduced infrastructure footprint, reduced time for preparation, and reduced time for complete repair to enable minimal delays in vehicle launch if a repair is deemed necessary. Potential NASA missions that could utilize the proposed technology include Space Launch System, Orion, and Commercial Crew Program for launch vehicles as well as launch support structures.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This project's technologies, developed for NASA systems, would directly apply to systems operated by other government and commercial enterprises.  Government systems that would derive the same benefits would include helicopters, UAVs, engine fan structures, and fighter and cargo aircraft in need of quick repair operated by the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force and foreign governments. DoD programs that could potentially use the proposed technology include the Air Force LCAAT platform and the Army AH-64 Apache.  This technology's attributes for rapid, "in-field" repair should yield a high potential for private sector commercialization for commercial space launch vehicles by SpaceX, United Launch Alliance, or Orbital ATK; and use for a wide variety of aerospace MRO (maintenance, repair, and overhaul) organizations who need a rapid repair for time critical AOG (aircraft on ground) situations.  Boeing has expressed interest in this repair technology for their military and commercial aerospace applications as well as multiple MRO organizations.  Repair of wind blade and marine composite structures also has high application potential, as well as automotive composite structures on vehicles like the Corvette.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Under the support of a FY 2016 NASA Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) contract (NASA contract number NNX16CM40P), Morningbird Media Corporation in collaboration with Alabama A&amp;M University Research, Innovation in Science and Engineering (AAMU-RISE) Foundation, has devised a unique method for an additive manufacturing technique for the direct 3D printing of functional electronics. This method involves the preparation of proprietary fast curable inks as well as filaments for the critical materials necessary; the cartridge deposition technologies, and the software layout and control to produce a multitude of electronic devices. The primary goal of the Phase I effort was to determine the viability of the additive manufacturing technique from a materials standpoint. Morningbird Media Corporation has developed new techniques to create the ink-based and/or filament based materials for conductive, resistive, capacitive, semiconducting and insulating materials. Several methodologies were explored: (a) direct laser melting of nanopowders onto the surface, (b) an ink-based approach using nanopowder mixtures with fast UV curable epoxy, (c) nanopowder/ABS material mixtures in an acetone solution, and (d) filaments created from a nanopowder and a thermoplastic adhesive. The company has also designed a unique print cartridge and a layout and control software package. We determined the most viable material development process and applied it to a prototype printer to produce and test the first electronic elements. &nbsp;This printing technique completely eliminates the needs of post-processing. This work has the capability of revolutionizing the way electronics are designed, produced, and implemented in all of technology. A commercial product development strategy is formulated around the Electronic Alchemy (TM) system as a consumer product in order to print unique 3D structures with electrical/electronic functionality.&nbsp;</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Morningbird's Electronic Alchemy technology has the potential to impact several areas within NASA taxonomy.  Some of these are:<BR><BR>- In-situ production and replacement of electronics devices.<BR>- 3D printing of biomedical and environmental sensors/detectors<BR>- 3D printing of antennas.<BR>- Establishment of a ground-based environmental monitoring network using custom sensors (such as CO2).  This will enhance outreach to K-12 and university students/faculty.<BR>- Enhancement of research and development processes by providing a system for real-time, custom creation of test devices and test beds.<BR><BR>The Electronic Alchemy printer and material cartridges will be available to be provided to all NASA centers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Morningbird Media Corporation is leveraging its technology development strategy, strategic partnerships, and early-stage venture funding to embark upon a product an commercialization path built upon the projected $30B 3D printing market and the $1T consumer electronic market. <BR> <BR>Product Lines:<BR> <BR>The Electronic Alchemy� 3De Printer ver. 1.x is a multi-material printer capable producing intricately detailed devices that have electronic functionality.  <BR> <BR>The Electronic Alchemy� 3De Cartridges provide the various critical materials needed to print functional electronics. <BR> <BR>The Electronic Alchemy� Design Cauldron ver 1.x is the layout, analysis, and printer control software for PCs, tablets, and other computing platforms.  <BR> <BR>The Environmental and Biomedical Sensor Elements Package is a set of customized sensors and detectors designed to be modified and printed with the Electronic Alchemy� system. <BR> <BR>The Electronic Alchemy� Development Community is a development environment that will allow members to interact and exchange designs.  It will be modeled much after an app store (iTunes or Google Play) where member designs can be sold, traded, or given away.

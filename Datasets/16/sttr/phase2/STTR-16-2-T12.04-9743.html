		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>In this Phase II STTR project, the proposed collaborative effort between UTC, AFIT, and ULRF represents a crucial step forward for AM.&nbsp; UTC&rsquo;s unique AM optimization and process control framework<em>, </em>constructed entirely from experimental sensor data collected in-situ, will finally transfer technology from our SLM test bed system to state-of-the-art and commercial-grade systems, including a Concept Laser M2 Cusing and EOS M270 system.&nbsp; UTC&rsquo;s framework, which leverages a &ldquo;physics-capturing&rdquo; empirical black box built on correlations between in-situ data, input process parameters, output AM build characteristics, and machine variations will be used to quantify AM process uncertainty across these systems.&nbsp; This Phase II project will show how seamlessly UTC&rsquo;s technology can be integrated in to any SLM system to inform real-time output prediction for open loop (closed architecture) systems, and real-time process parameter selection and optimization for closed loop (open architecture) systems.</p>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This project will allow UTC to continue supporting various NASA efforts nationally:<BR><BR>- The transfer of UTC's low-cost in-process monitoring capabilities to Concept Laser M2 and EOS M270 industry-standard commercial SLM systems, as well as to NASA MSFC's Concept Laser M-Lab, M2, and M-Line systems.<BR><BR>- UTC continues to support ASTM collaborations and working groups, specifically component and flight certification frameworks for AM parts based on in-situ monitoring and nondestructive evaluation & inspection.<BR><BR>- These work areas directly support NASA's Additive Manufacturing Structural Integrity Initiative (AMSII), an effort to create robust and production-ready flight certification procedures for propulsion applications.<BR><BR>- Phase II will allow UTC to work towards integrated physics-based modeling within our real-time control feedback loop framework.<BR><BR>- UTC is working to develop its own physics-based modeling software to be leveraged during feedback control, which supports NASA powder bed modeling, process modeling, and property prediction modeling MGI/ICME initiatives.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential customers include prime contractors that provide systems or maintenance to NASA and DoD, and additionally include machine manufacturers Concept Laser and EOS.  Interest from additional additive manufacturing OEMs is expected, as UTC's sensor technology will be demonstrated on multiple commercial systems.  Initial interest in sensors is expected to be for retrofitting existing commercially available SLM machines to provide commercial entities process monitoring on in-house equipment, or working with research-grade users to implement or develop additional customizability for in-process sensing, perhaps with external sensors of their choice.  The hardware/software/sensor suite will be calibrated and integrated with commercially available machines by the end of this Phase II. This will allow standards for accepting additively manufactured parts used in space and earth applications to be developed.

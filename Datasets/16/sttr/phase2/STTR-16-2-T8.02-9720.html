		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Next generation optical modems for NASA will be based on the RZ-DPSK modulation format. This modulation format is robust, delivers high quantum efficiency and allows burst-mode operation, key when using a power limited transmitter in combination with a fixed delay line DPSK demodulator. Freedom Photonics approach in this proposed program is to integrate the laser, modulator, and amplifier into a single transmitter photonic integrated circuit (PIC). Photonic integration reduces the cost, size, weight, and power (C-SWaP) of the transmitter optical component so that they can fit into a package the size of a half-dollar coin or smaller. It will be realized using an Indium Phosphide photonic integration platform, well suited for space application.&nbsp; The Phase II effort will culminate in a FSO demonstration in a laboratory environment demonstrating transmission of RZ-DPSK signals.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This proposed work will make space science and exploration more effective, affordable, and sustainable in that it will enable low cost and low SWaP technologies for space communications, freeing up resources for other onboard systems. The PIC technology will also better utilize the high bandwidth afforded by optics and scale readily to higher data rates. This technology will allow more frequent and lower cost missions and allow for incorporating free space laser modems on smaller satellites (ex. cubesats) and small craft (ex. drones).
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The FSO transmitter technology is also applicable to a range of commercial FSO link applications, both space based and terrestrial. 1550nm is eye safe, which will allow up to two orders of magnitudes higher emitted power while maintaining eye safety for terrestrial communications links. For this reason, the developed transmitter technology will be ideally suited for implementation in long-range FSO link applications.

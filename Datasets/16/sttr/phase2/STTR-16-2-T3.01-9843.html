		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>In the Phase I effort, Gloyer-Taylor Laboratories LLC (GTL) verified the feasibility of generating power from space particle radiation.&nbsp; This effort successfully demonstrated electrical power production from a particle radiation source using an initial proof-of-concept device.&nbsp; The effort also identified a second approach that has the potential for even better power generation and offers enhanced high energy radiation protection.</p><p>In the proposed Phase II effort, GTL and the University of Tennessee Knoxville (UTK) will further investigate and develop these breakthrough capabilities. This will include developing scientific models of how these devices function and testing samples to characterize and optimize their design. Based on these results, GTL and UTK shall produce an engineering prototype coupon device for NASA evaluation.</p><p>When fully developed, these techniques will provide NASA with access to an alternative power source, increasing available power from ambient sources (even in deep space) and enhancing power efficiency of on-board radiation power sources.</p>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed active radiation shield techniques will provide NASA with access to an alternative power source for space missions, increasing available power from ambient sources (even in deep space) and enhancing power efficiency of on-board radiation power sources.  This technology could enhance power production on deep space science spacecraft using either ambient radiation or on-board radiation sources.  The technology could also scavenge additional power on small spacecraft, including cubesats.  The radiation protection aspects of the technology could dramatically reduce the radiation risk to astronauts in space.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The active radiation shield techniques can also provide power for commercial and DoD spacecraft, including large geostationary spacecraft and nanosatellites.  This technology could also open the door to routine spacecraft operations in the radiation belts.  The radiation protection features could be used to enhance spacecraft resilience or protection of personnel.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>The objective of this Phase 2 proposal is to provide a new set of sensitivity analysis theory and codes,&nbsp;the<em> Sensitivity Analysis for Design Optimization (SADO) software</em> that integrates with the existing NASA O3 Tool. In this Phase II effort, the sensitivity codes developed in Phase I will add functionality to simplify Ground Vibration Test, or model tuning, by calculating a number of error metric that can be used as objective functions in the tuning process. The approach will be implemented for two basic types of responses, namely basic direct responses from the analysis (weight, frequencies, stresses) and special indices (MAC, Correlation Index, CG, Inertias) whose calculation was implemented during Phase I. Additionally, we will implement a domain specific language and interface specifications to simply the programming of optimization problems and incorporating additional analysis software tools for multiobjective applications. We will all implement software tools to use sensitivity analysis as system evaluation tool and for the development of reduced order models. We will use this software for two NASA relevant design projects, the ATW2 wing and the Hybrid Wing Body air vehicle.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Specifically at NASA we see direct application in the efficient integration into the optimization environment of analysis modules already built in the Object-Oriented Optimization Tool. At the conclusion of Phase 2 we see immediate benefit to Ground Vibration Testing. We intend to simplify the coding mechanism for optimization through the implementation of an "optimization language" and provide tools that automatically check and propagate the design variables to the proper analysis codes  without having to "hand code" the same variables in multiple places. Having standalone sensitivity modules will also provide NASA flexibility in evaluating constraints and responses not necessarily available in standard commercial codes. Additional improvements will increase runtime performance of optimization iterations. We will apply the system to the NASA ATW2 and HWB models as a demonstration and system benchmark.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Sensitivity analysis is required for efficient optimal design and reliability analysis. Optimization is today widely used in the aerospace industry, automotive industry, sports equipment design and medical equipment design, just to mention a few. Building sensitivity analysis modules that can flexibly connect with analysis and finite elements has a tremendous potential for these industries since we can provide tailored solutions for their particular needs. Not only has the optimization become more efficient but also sensitivities provide guidance on determining the importance of variables by their effect on other system components.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Mapping spectrometers have been extremely useful in multiple NASA applications, from Earth composition mapping to identifying hydrocarbon lakes on Titan. &nbsp;Traditionally, imaging spectroscopy systems are not only heavy but also large in order to accommodate the long path lengths needed for spectral separation. There are several varieties, such as push-broom and scanning imaging spectrometers, but hyperspectral framing cameras are still relatively rare and are often untenably bulky. However, framing cameras place fewer restrictions on platform motion and can complete their data acquisition more rapidly, which allows more time and power to be dedicated to other instruments. A chip-scale full-frame hyperspectral imager would provide the ideal balance: small, light, no moving parts, low power requirements, and suitable for numerous mission architectures. In the Phase I program, Nanohmics, teaming with Dr. Hewagama at the University of Maryland, developed a chip-scale hyperspectral imaging technology for ultra-compact VIS hyperspectral cameras for smallsat and CubeSat applications. The technology provides spectral dispersion with full spatial-spectral registration orders of magnitude smaller and lighter than grating or prism options.&nbsp; During the Phase II program, the team will mature the technology to enable commercialization of the sensor and evaluate the feasibility of extending the technology to infrared spectral bands.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The measurements produced by the chip-scale hyperspectral imager will enable surface characterization in support of planetary probes or sample return from asteroids, moons, and comets. Spatially and spectrally resolved scattered light provides ice particle size distributions and compositional analysis, and gives insights about resurfacing events and water cycle processes. A framing camera enables movies of fast processes, including auroras, lightning, and rotating bodies, without requiring additional platform motion for each frame (allowing other instruments to remain focused) and provides spectral analysis for composition and aerosol size analysis. Search for organics and biomarkers through spectral composition analysis helps focus mission resources on the right areas and samples without changing color wheels. A framing camera enables movies of transient processes, including fluid phenomena like geysers.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The low-cost hyperspectral technology will have a significant opportunity in the international commercial, military, and industrial markets.  For example, agricultural industries can benefit from crop health monitoring, environmental protection groups can monitor chemical dumping and cleanup, medical applications can improve measurement of biomarkers, military surveillance applications can benefit from spectrally-resolved target identification, and industry can improve quality control with low-cost in-line spectral analysis of manufactured goods.

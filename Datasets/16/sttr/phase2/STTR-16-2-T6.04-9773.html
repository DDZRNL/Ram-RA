		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>TDA Research Inc.(TDA) in collaboration with University of Puerto Rico &ndash; Mayaguez (UPRM is proposing to develop a highly efficient CO2 removal system based on UPRM proprietary strontium exchanged silico-alumino-phosphate (Sr-SAPO-34) sorbent for closed loop space craft cabin air re-vitalization during deep space missions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the Phase I work, we successfully completed bench-scale proof-of-concept demonstrations, elevating the TRL to 3. In Phase II, we will further optimize the sorbent and scale-up its production using advanced manufacturing techniques such as continuous microwave synthesis. &nbsp;We will carry out multiple adsorption/desorption cycles to demonstrate the sorbent&#39;s cycle life (&gt;500). &nbsp;We will develop a CFD model to optimize the cyclic operation of the sorbent system and carry out a detailed engineering assessment of the full-scale system.&nbsp; Finally, we will design and fabricate a sub-scale prototype to fully demonstrate the technology under simulated spacecraft cabin atmospheres (TRL-5); this unit will be sent to NASA for further testing and evaluation.</p>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The main attraction of our research to NASA is its ability to provide a lightweight, compact and energy efficient CO2 removal system for closed-loop space craft cabin air re-vitalization during deep space missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This system will also find use on earth for removing CO2 from confined spaces such as large buildings, aircrafts, and submarines to reduce the energy use of next generation life support and air conditioning systems. The sorbent developed is also applicable to a wide variety of industrial processes, which require CO2 removal (i.e., CO2 capture from flue gas, biogas, natural gas, etc.) and sorbent enhanced water-gas-shift reaction in hydrogen manufacturing.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Fibertek, Inc. in partnership with researchers at the Pennsylvania State University Center for Innovative Materials Processing through Direct Digital Deposition (CIMP-3D) are proposing to develop a state of the art, space-qualifiable laser transmitter that meets the requirements of the flash lidar transmitter defined in the 2016 STTR subtopic T9.01, Navigation and Hazard Avoidance Sensor Technologies. The design will be an innovative synthesis of key technologies that results in a &gt;3x reduction in the size and weight and a &gt;2x increase in the efficiency of the laser transmitter previously developed for the Autonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) demonstrator program . These key technologies include incorporation of additive manufacturing techniques to develop a much lighter weight mechanical structure, an ultra-compact unstable or near stable ring resonator that achieves a large fundamental mode, higher efficiency diode-pumped head designs that incorporate compact athermal pump architectures, and compact and efficient electronics designs derived from the environmentally hardened versions previously developed for DOD and NASA programs.</p>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A number of planned NASA missions will be either enabled or greatly enhanced by an autonomous capability to collect real-time 3D image data for landing and rendezvous, satellite servicing and proximity operations. The missions include future robotic missions to the Moon and Mars that require landing at pre-designated sites of high scientific value, autonomous rendezvous and docking with the International Space Station or other satellites, and comet sample and return missions. A flash lidar system can meet the 3D imaging requirements of all these missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There is a significant commercial interest in the high efficiency, compact laser being proposed. The applications include the following: 1.As an upgrade to the Ball Aerospace Vision Navigation Sensor (VNS). 2.As the transmitter for compact rangefinders that are being developed for commercial satellite servicing systems. 3.Laser marker/designator for defense applications.

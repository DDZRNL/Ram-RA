		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Remote sensing, when combined with real-time processing, provides instant feedback on safety, mission success and system health.  Being able to combine embedded sensing with distributed networks gives us the additional potential to further benefit many systems and sub-systems in the aerospace industry including launch vehicles, ground test equipment and spacecraft.  These remote distributed sensor networks need to be flexible to the needs of different types of data, environments and configurations.  Highly flexible solutions will support the widest variety of sensors, power methods, communication protocols and real-time processing algorithms.<BR><BR>Angstrom Designs proposes a modular, embedded, intelligent sensor network comprised of a network of sensor nodes, to maximize flexibility.  Each system node contains three modules: sensor, communications and power.  We propose to develop sensor modules to gather and condition signals including heat flux, acoustics and electric fields to compliment existing temperature, pressure and strain measurement hardware. Communications modules will transmit sensor data via high-frequency, high-bandwidth, low-power network technologies.  Power modules will supply power to the node through the use of battery, solar or scavenged power. Phase I prototype system nodes will be smaller than 5 cubic centimeters (cc), and after miniaturization, nodes will likely be smaller than 0.5 cc.  Additionally, radiation hard versions of many of the components will be available for possible flight missions.  A central processing gateway receives data from the sensor network, provides real-time processing of the data and reports raw and processed data to test engineers and software via standard network interfaces.  Research partner, the Pennathur lab at UCSB, adds expertise and capability in advanced power harvesting, micro- and nanofluidic based sensors.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Highly modular, remote sensors are of interest to many NASA tests and missions.  Real-time data from sensor networks reduces risk and provides data for future design improvements.  For example, sensor networks on a vehicle body can give measurement of temperature, pressure, strain and acoustics.  This data is used in real time to determine safety margins and test anomalies.  The data is also used post-test to correlate analytical models and optimize vehicle and test design.<BR><BR>Because these sensors are small and low mass, they can be used for ground test and for flight.  Sensor module miniaturization will further reduce size, mass and cost.  Small sensors can be placed in formerly inaccessible locations and can wirelessly provide new insights on system behavior.  Wireless remote sensors can be used for thermal, structural and acoustic measurement of systems and subsystems and also provide emergency system halt instructions in the case of leaks, fire or structural failure.<BR><BR>Other examples of potential NASA applications include 1) measuring strain in test structures, ground support equipment and vehicles, include high-risk deployables, 2) measuring temperature, strain, voltage and current from power storage and generation systems and 3) measuring pressure, strain and temperature in pumps and pressure vessels.  There are many other applications that would benefit from increased, real-time sensing in remote, hard-to-test locations.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are many potential commercial applications.  As with NASA, the commercial sector would benefit from data that shows real time performance, gives greater test safety and correlates models to enhance design. <BR><BR>Angstrom Designs is very familiar with the deployable solar array market, and solar array structures designers could use sensor arrays for many applications, including 1) measuring strain in structures to verify design models, 2) measuring loads and strain in ground support equipment (GSE) to determine GSE effects on ground testing and 3) measuring sensor position and acceleration to determine deployment dynamics.  Similar examples exist in flight and ground test for many of the components of spacecraft, from power systems to structures to pressure vessels to propulsion systems.<BR><BR>Additional sensing capability will benefit the largest GEO-communications satellite and the smallest CubeSat.  Every spacecraft has critical systems and subsystems that, given additional sensing, could be made more efficient, more reliable and safer.  These systems could benefit in design, ground test and, potentially, flight operations.  Additionally, sensing of ground test equipment can validate the impact of GSE on test results.

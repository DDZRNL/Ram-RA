		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Balcones Technologies, LLC (BT) proposes to adapt technologies developed by and resident in BT and The University of Texas at Austin Center for Electromechanics (CEM) in the area of advanced high efficiency, high-power density motors/generators and propulsion power train systems to address SBIR 2016 Subtopic T15.01 Power Systems for Hybrid Electric Propulsion.  In particular, our team will develop new aircraft propulsor  technology that:  (1) Is critical for success of the NASA High Voltage Hybrid Electric Propulsion (HVHEP) program, which in turn, directly addresses the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate Strategic Thrust 3 (Mid and Far Term Ultra-Efficient Commercial Vehicles) and Strategic thrust 4 (Mid and Far Transition to Low-Carbon Propulsion);(2) Is initially focused on Small Single Aisle (SSA) aircraft (100-150 passengers), which accounts for approximately one third of fuel consumed by commercial aircraft, but is scalable to larger aircraft as well;(3) Is a megawatt class propulsor, compatible with distributed propulsion concepts;(4) Interfaces with the HVHEP high frequency variable AC prime power bus concept, but could also be adapted for other types of power buses;(5) Optimizes a propulsor system topology consisting of power electronics, propulsion motor and possibly magnetic gears;(6) Directly addresses potential control and frequency mismatch issues arising from the minimalist use of power electronics in HVHEP variable AC power bus architecture and allows improved optimization of size, frequency, and efficiency for the aircraft overall prime power system and propulsor systems;(7) Is compatible with or can be adapted to the use of propellers and ducted fans with or without blade pitch control;(8) Exploits core technical strengths of both BT and CEM in optimization of controlled electromechanical systems, high performance motors and generators, magnetic gears, and analysis and simulation of these system

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The aircraft propulsor systems and technology developed under this proposed Phase I and potential Phase II STTR have applications in NASA focus areas of advanced aeronautics, especially those addressing the commercial aircraft industry of the future.  Our proposed program also develops MW class motor and generator technology that advances the state of the art in efficiency, torque density, and power density for commercially available machines.  This presents commercial opportunities within NASA for applications that benefit from these capabilities.<BR>Additionally, NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate lists Ultra-Efficient Commercial Vehicles and Transition to Low-Carbon Propulsion as two of their six strategic thrusts.  Within the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, the Advanced Air Transport Technology Project (AATTP) seeks to develop technologies and concepts to revolutionize the energy efficiency and environmental compatibility of fixed wing transport aircraft in the 2025 to 2035 timeframe, three generations beyond the current state-of-the-art.  The AATTP lists establishing a viable concept for 5-10 MW hybrid gas-electric propulsion system for a commercial transport aircraft as one of its seven technical challenges. Our proposed program directly addresses these thrusts and major technical challenges.  Consequently it presents our company with associated commercial opportunities within these NASA programs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Our proposed project develops propulsor technology that enables a high voltage, variable frequency AC hybrid electric drivetrain topology for distributed propulsion aircraft that is being developed by NASA.  The NASA goals for this effort are to revolutionize the energy efficiency and environmental compatibility of fixed wing transport aircraft in the 2025 to 2035 timeframe, three generations beyond the current state-of-the-art.  The focus aircraft are small single aisle aircraft (100-150 passengers) which accounts for one third of fuel used by commercial aircraft.  As a result, the commercial potential for our technology is very large, especially as commercial and military aircraft move toward high efficiency, environmentally friendly propulsor technology/systems and distributed propulsion approaches.  Additionally, the Doubly Fed Induction Machines (motors and generators), that are a focus of our proposed Phase I, effort have applications in many aspects of the power industry, including small grids and wind energy applications.

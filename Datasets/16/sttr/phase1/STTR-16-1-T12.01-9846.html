		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		GTL�s SNS technology aids in the operation of new or existing structural health monitoring (SHM) systems by integrating data and power pathways into the structure. The use of this technology within a composite structure would allow engineers to place sensors from an SHM system directly where they are needed on a structure with instant power.<BR>GTL�s SNS technology offers the potential for developers to have substantial gains in vehicle performance as well.  Embedding power and data transmission within the structure reduces the mass of the system by eliminating the need for wires as well the additional vehicle mass required to contain them.<BR>In the proposed effort GTL will perform a series of feasibility studies to assess and optimize the SNS technology.  This work will result in the development of the SNS architecture to be employed in the Phase II effort.  In this effort, GTL will perform several design iterations of the SNS technology and develop test panels for testing.  At the end of the Phase II effort, GTL will deliver an SNS test panel to NASA for evaluation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		SNS technology offers the potential for an innovative and efficient method for the transmission of power and data to for existing or new Structural Health Monitoring systems. It offers a cost effective and mass reducing alternative to the use of cumbersome wiring systems for the transfer of power and data in conventional systems.  This ability would be in high demand throughout the aerospace industry.  Potential applications include all aerospace composite structures including space structures and composite pressure vessels.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology is not limited to space structures but can be extended to other equipment where structural integrity and health monitoring is essential; applications include military ground vehicles, fixed and rotary wing air vehicle structures, as well as sea vessels. Potential customers for these systems include Air Force, MDA, Navy, and Army as well as a host of commercial customers.

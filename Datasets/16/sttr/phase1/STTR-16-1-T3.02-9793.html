		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's various Space Mission Directorate seek to develop technology to fulfill the technology gap and to enable missions with the unique high energy density charge storage technology. The overall goal of this STTR proposal is attempt to develop the novel energy storage technology to enable and enhance the capabilities of future NASA missions. The unique set of requirements for the power systems for various missions have emerged and they vary greatly, with advancements in components needed above the current State of the Art for high energy density, high power density, long life, high reliability, low mass/volume, radiation tolerance, and the wide temperature operation. For this STTR our first goal is evaluation of the concept of Nano Vacuum Tube (NVT) based charge storage device design that can provide High Energy Density storage with significant mass savings. The feasibility evaluation of design approaches are suggested to meet the desired special needs of charge storage in space. As a second goal, it plans to leverage IR&D done at UIUC and AMSENG to bring together unique experience base team to undertake the feasibility study to fulfill the identified technology gap through prototype development. Although the theory developed at UIUC predicts that storage of GJ/m3 charges is feasible in Nano Vacuum Tubes, the proposed experiments will decide what is feasible and which design options delivers the performance in space, when one uses the space stable heritage light weight materials. Finally, the suggested material designs and the devices need to meet reliability needs of the space mission environment for a typical ten year mission lifetime and conform to the mission space qualification needs and the requirements including high vacuum, microgravity, radiation, atomic oxygen, low out gassing, and high launch loads. The phase I - feasibility evaluation and the phase II - validation efforts suggested herewith can help us to fulfill the technology gap

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Many NASA science missions, avionics and terrestrial systems, including satellites, aircrafts, balloons and unmanned areal vehicle avionics  could benefit from the developed charge storage systems. Success in charge storage concept with low mass may open up abundant power needs of many NASA missions due to the appeal of device technology for light weight and ultra high charge storage density along with the involved very small charging & discharging times
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		DOD Applications: Many DOD space and avionics systems, including communications and navigation satellites, could benefit from increased availability of High Specific Power at High Power density and unique material design that can provide reliable power for the mission needs. Its unique applications in hardening can be of special appeal to the DOD needs.<BR>Commercial Application: Space, avionics and terrestrial commercial systems, including satellites, aircraft avionics and automobiles, could benefit from the developed charge storage systems. Success in charge storage concept may open various market sectors due to the appeal of device technology for light weight and ultra high charge storage density along with the involved very small charging & discharging times.

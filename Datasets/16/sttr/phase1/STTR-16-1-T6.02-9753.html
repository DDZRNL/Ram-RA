		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NextGen Federal Systems proposes an innovative SPace Radiation INTelligence System (SPRINTS) which provides an interactive and web-delivered capability that significantly improves long-range forecasts (2-3 days), all-clear forecasts, and forecast accuracies of solar particle events (SPEs). SPRINTS provides SPE-related data, visualizations, and forecasts that leverage and integrate two complimentary and cutting-edge foundational space weather systems: Magnetogram Forecast (Mag4) and Space Weather Information System (SWIS). The integration of these two capabilities with the addition of an intuitive/interactive user interface and advanced data analysis/forecasting capabilities provides SPRINTS users with the unique ability to effectively explore SPE data and forecasts relevant to their asset(s) and data needs. While leveraging and delivering the forecasts produced by Mag4, the SPRINTS forecast system will use machine-learning and expert-guided statistical analyses to explore new models based, not only on data provided by Mag4 and SWIS, but designed to incorporate other SPE-relevant datasets. SPRINTS also incorporates information about specific space and airborne assets that are entered by individual users and organizations. This information will be integrated with the SPRINTS radiation environment models and engineering models of the predicted impact of SPEs to specific hardware and instruments. SPRINTS serves as a platform to deliver SPE-based operational products covering monitoring, forecasting, and impact analysis of SPEs to help define mission planning, operations, evaluation, and safety.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's Robotic and Human Exploration missions can leverage SPRINTS forecasting and SPE-related tools to mitigate the negative effects of SPEs. For NASA Robotic Mission support, SPRINTS can be integrated into NASA's Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) and could be offered through the Integrated Space Weather Analysis (iSWA) system for spacecraft operators. For NASA's Human Exploration Mission support, SPRINTS could be leveraged by NASA's Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG) through their space weather and SPE forecasting lab.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		SPRINTS can be leveraged by other Government, Intelligence, and Commercial organizations and customers similarly to NASA applications to help mitigate the negative effects of SPEs. Potential customers that could leverage a commercialized SPRINTS include, but are not limited to, NOAA, USAF, US STRATCOM, Commercial Satellite and Space Systems Operators. Specific applications and opportunities include:<BR>- NOAA: SPRINTS can provide valuable space radiation forecasts for NOAA's Earth-based weather satellites.<BR>- USAF Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC): Add space radiation forecasts and products in an easy to use visual product through the AGI SSA Suite or JSpOC Mission System (JMS).<BR>- US STRATCOM: Space Weather is important from our nation's Strategic capability; STRATCOM is also interested in supporting Foreign Military's (allied) satellite operations with these capabilities <BR>- Commercial Satellite Operators: Our business partner Analytical Graphics currently offers Commercial Space Operations Center (ComSpOC) to private sector customers. Addition of Space Weather data products and analysis support through AGI's current marketing and business development could provide access to a wider commercial market.<BR><BR>NextGen would deliver SPRINTS via a mixed data products and services model to maximize commercialization and value to customers.

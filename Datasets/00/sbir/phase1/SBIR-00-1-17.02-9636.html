<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Solar physics and astrophysics require very accurate spatial and spectral resolution of celestial x-ray and gamma ray sources.  Fabricating x-ray, gamma-ray, and neutron collimators that have the precision necessary to achieve arcsecond or sub-arcsecond imaging is a critical problem. Lenses or mirrors cannot be fabricated due to the lack of efficient reflectors or refractors for these wavelengths. Collimators are required to achieve the necessary resolution.  In order to achieve high-resolution images, fine collimator geometries are needed.  Commercial collimator fabrication techniques provide structures with coarse cell sizes that require long structural lengths to achieve image optimization. Collimators with fine cell geometries help reduce the overall length of the collimating structure and increase resolution.  Single collimators have been fabricated, with fine cell sizes, using photochemical machining and stack lamination.  However, assembling a multi-grid array from single collimators requires demanding assembly and alignment schemes. P-10 Micro Engineering's proposed innovation is to develop a manufacturing technique for fabricating multi-grid, high-resolution, rotating modulation collimators for arcsecond or sub-arcsecond x-ray and gamma-ray imaging.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
In addition to applications in solar and astrophysics, high-resolution collimator grids offer dramatic performance improvement in medical imaging, non-destructive testing, hydrodynamic weapons testing, mammography, and micro-beam radiation therapy. The market for gamma cameras used for nuclear medicine alone is estimated to be over 600 million dollars per year.

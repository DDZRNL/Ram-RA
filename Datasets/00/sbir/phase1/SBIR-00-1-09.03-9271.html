<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A new miniature, low-power, and stable oxygen-pH-temperature sensor is proposed.  It can measure both the atmospheric oxygen and dissolved oxygen over the pressure ranges of interest for plant-growth systems and bioreactors.  The sensor measures the phosphorescence decay time from a doped-silica material.  Unlike total phosphoresence intensity, phosphorescent decay time is a property of a molecule that should remain highly stable over time, eliminating the need for re-calibrations.)  Because phosphorescence occurs on a much slower time scale than fluorescence, this sensor is simpler, smaller, and more accurate than a fluorescence-based sensor.  We have also found methods for measuring pH and temperature from the same sensor making this a versatile instrument suitable for plant and animal studies including extremophile research on earth and particularly in space.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Because oxygen is essential both to fire and to life, oxygen sensors are needed in industries as varied as bioremediation of pollution, pharmaceuticals, and electrical power plants.  The largest market is in automobiles: all new cars have oxygen sensors in the exhaust to optimize combustion and minimize pollution.  Existing automotive oxygen sensors are a reliability problem and a better replacement has a potential worldwide market of billions of dollars.

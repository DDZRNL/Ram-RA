<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR> Low-Cost Polymer-Derived Zirconium-Silicate CMC for Rocket Nozzle Applications <BR>

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 NASA has identified a need to reduce weight and cost of cooled composite nozzle ramps.  A lightweight actively cooled ceramic matrix composite (CMC) system would be lighter than metallic designs and would require significantly less cooling during re-entry.  Composite Factory proposes a zirconium-silicate or Zr-Si-O glass CMC with integral ceramic tubes reinforced with a low cost discontinuous ceramic fiber preform.  Integral ceramic composite mounting structure offers potential for a 2.0 lb/ft2 structurally integrated exhaust ramp.
<br>The Phase-I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of producing an ultra high temperature CMC based on the zirconium-silicate materials currently used in EBC coatings for SiC-SiC  CMC’s.  Low cost pre-ceramic polymer CMC manufacturing methods combined with automated low-cost fiber preforming methods will be applied in order to keep both material and processing costs at a minimum.   Mechanical test coupons will be fabricated and tested.  Phase-II objectives would include design and fabrication of a sub-scale test component to verify durability of the composite structure along with manifolding and hermeticity of coolant channels. 
<br>The development of a low cost zirconium-silicate matrix would be applicable to turbine engine combustor liners and other commercial engine exhaust components used to mix exhaust gas and reduce noise emissions.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 Currently Composite Factory focuses on BlackglasTM based CMC components.  Applications currently being produced for sale are the CMC brakes for motorcycle racing and after-market street use.  We are currently working with multiple automotive OEM’s to introduce the CMC brakes into automotive applications.  The ability to offer a higher temperature polymer derived CMC system based on similar chemistry would increase the potential markets Composite Factory could pursue.  Immediate markets for exhaust liners in diesel engines and combustor liners in turbine engines appear promising.
<br>The application of a higher thermal conductivity phase in the CMC may also improve the performance of the CMC as a friction material in aircraft brake applications where higher thermal conductivity is critical to maintaining acceptable surface temperatures.

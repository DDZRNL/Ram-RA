<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
New nanocomposites based on thermally stable copolymer matrices are proposed for developing thin film balloon and ballute materials for aerocapture missions.  Hybrid nanocomposites of synthetic layered clays and cardo poly(imide-siloxanes) are proposed to achieve ballute materials with temperature capability of over 400C, mass-areal density below 10 g/sm, and stability to sulfuric acid.  High emissivity is achieved via in situ thermal reduction of silver complexes.  Issues to explore are material strength, space environment durability and lifetime, retention of properties after tight packing, and manufacturing/repair techniques.  The proposed materials, if successful, will greatly reduce the cost and size of deep space mission payloads by combining low mass, low undeployed volume with the ability to withstand harsh temperature and chemical conditions.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
There are numerous applications for silvered films above and beyond their use for ballute materials.  These include the fabrication of lightweight optical mirrors and sunshields for the NASA Next Generation Space Telescope, large scale radiofrequency antennas for management of electromagnetic signals, highly reflective thin film reflectors and concentrators for solar thermal propulsion and solar dynamic power generation, and conductive coatings to minimize charging effects.

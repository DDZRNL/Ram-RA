<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 The proposed innovation is germanium power semiconductor devices (diodes and transistors) developed specifically for power-management and actuator-control circuits operating at low and cryogenic temperatures.  This is important for upcoming space missions to extremely cold environments, because it can greatly reduce the need for thermal control and required spacecraft power.  These missions include those to the outer planets and other cold sites of primary interest in the Solar System, such as Europa as well as interstellar missions.  Preliminary measurements confirm that Ge diodes and some types of Ge bipolar transistors can operate down to the required deep cryogenic temperatures, namely the vicinity of liquid-helium temperature (4K).  The objective of this Phase I effort is to demonstrate the advantages of Ge devices for cryogenic power applications and to determine the feasibility of producing the necessary types of devices.  Deliverables will include working prototypes with characterization at 4K and 77K and the identification of promising technologies for fuller implementation in Phase II.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Visidyne proposes to critically assess the requirements for a phase processor to detect miniscule phase bumps hidden in the beat frequency signal from a pair of interfering optical beams, e.g., used to link proof masses on free flying satellites.  These phase bumps, the result of a cosmological event producing gravity waves affecting the local space time frame thereby causing small length changes or strains.  These length changes maybe at the level of a few picometers or strains for a gage length of 5 x 10 E6 km of 4 x 10 E-22.  The proposed effort would assess these requirements in light of the errors; random and systematic associated with doing ultra high resolution optical interferometry.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed effort and technology, length  measurement on the picometer scale, are way in excess of any conceivable needs presently existing in the commercial marketplace.  However, some of its spin-offs in the form detectors, chip sets may find use in such fields as nanometer metrology for semiconductor lithography and high resolution phase based optical sensors.

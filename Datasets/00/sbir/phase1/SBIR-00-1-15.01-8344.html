<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 The goal of this effort is to investigate router architecture to seamlessly unite a terrestrial network to a network of satellites.  This proposal generates a specification (Phase 1) and test-bed (Phase 2) to address these NASA needs for sensor data transmission:
<br>
<br>&#61623; Data Compression Techniques 
<br>&#61623; Buffer Management Optimization
<br>&#61623; Network Architectures
<br>&#61623; Provide a Terrestrial-based Test Bed Architecture for Concept Verification.
<br>Below is our program effort summary.
<br>
<br>PHASE 1:
<br>
<br>1.  Define a protocol stack for the network including encryption.  This investigation uses existing protocols, such as TCP/IP and PPP, as a basis and examines the impact of one-way communications paths upon these architectures.  In addition, we determine the optimal placement of encryption into the stack for data confidentiality.
<br>
<br>2.  Target a hardware platform for these protocols.  Determine and list the criteria for hardware selection and provide a hardware recommendation.
<br>
<br>3.  List known techniques.  List available compression, buffer management and encryption techniques and determine target platform performance.
<br>
<br>4.  Optimize throughput.  Sort the list above according to the estimated target platform performance for maximum throughput.
<br>
<br>5.  Generate a specification.  Use the results from 1-4 for a router specification deliverable.
<br>
<br>PHASE 2:
<br>
<br>1. Develop the Test-Bed.  Build the terrestrial test-bed to the specification.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS
<br>
<br>One potential application is commercial satellites, specifically those providing crosslink communication paths between an orbiting constellation.    This would allow a robust, fault tolerant communications network in orbit.  Another application is in wireless router design applications that would replace the terrestrial landline with a Radio Frequency (RF) links.   Both of these commercial applications provide a large market for such a router.

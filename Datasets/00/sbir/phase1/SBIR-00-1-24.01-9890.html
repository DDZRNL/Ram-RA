<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR> A Hybrid End-to-End Architecture that uses Model- and Rule-Based Inferencing <BR>

<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 As a key component within Remote Agent, Livingstone has the most maturity and potential for commercialization.  ICS is proposing to integrate Livingstone into an existing end-to-end architecture for real-time command and control.  This flight proven architecture has been demonstrated recently with the NASA FUSE program.  Adding the Livingstone component would fill a void in the SCL architecture and would significantly augment the capability of the spacecraft or rover for onboard autonomy.  A significant deviation from the expected behavior of the model would be flagged to the inference engine.  This would add an enhanced flexibility and versatility of the system in allowing the user or operator to use dynamic scripts and rules in order to complement a model and support progressive autonomy as necessary.
<br>
<br>ICS believes that the two technologies are highly complementary and would greatly benefit autonomous operations.  The key to success is in the tight integration of those technologies into a flight proven environment and supported by an integrated ground development system.  This includes the insertion of Livingstone in the flight architecture but also addresses the modifications of the ground development tools to merge the model-based and rule-based languages.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 Several commercial and government customers have expressed a strong interest in the aforementioned  technologies to aid in the automation of their missions. 
<br> 
<br>ICS is working with Lockheed Martin and Aerojet on SBIRS-High Ground System to provide assistance for payload flight software fault management.  System-level state recognition is very important and Livingstone capabilities would be critical. ICS is currently under contract with the NRL to support the flight software for the Navy Earth Mapping Observer (NEMO) a dual-use commercial program with a sophisticated level of onboard autonomy.  Other programs with similar requirements include FAME and Windsat/Coriolis.
<br>
<br>ICS is also seeing an increased demand for these technologies in non-aerospace areas such as transportation and robotics.  The proposed integrated system provides a proven, cost effective solution to a wide range of control system problems and market segments.  Market penetration is facilitated by the fact that ICS is following the Open-Source Model similar to Linux or GNU tools.  Our software is available at http://www.opencontrol.org.   We have had a considerable number of inquiries since our open source announcement.  ICS offers documented and supported open software solutions as COTS -- a first in our industry.

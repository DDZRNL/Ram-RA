<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Instruments such as those proposed for the High Resolution Solar Optical Telescope (HRSOT) mission will require a very high resolution and high throughput device to isolate absorption lines in the solar continuum.  Thus, a very narrow passband is required, and sideband contamination must be minimized.  An unavoidable effect of any spectral filtering system is to attenuate the signal even at the bandpass centroid, and there is a tradeoff between providing the narrowest bandwidth, while maintaining maximum throughput.  The device must also be robust enough to survive the vibration stresses of launch, and be immune to the thermal, vacuum, and radiation conditions of the space environment over a period of several years.  The objective are as follows:
<br>1.  Investigate what heritage from prior Fabry-Perot instruments that the Michigan Aerospace Corporation team has worked on is applicable to the HRSOT instrument and develop a simulation and conceptual design for the filter system with the critical initial trade studies and system development.
<br>2.  Using existing prototype hardware, demonstrate that a design exists for a tunable, high-finesse etalon that is capable of surviving the rigors of launch by subjecting the existing hardware to an environmental test, comparable to what would be required of HRSOT.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 The work that would be performed under this Phase I effort is directly applicable to a number of commercial remote sensing applications that are presently included in the Michagan Aerospace business plan, but are not at present funded.  Successful completion of the work contained in this proposal would provide Michigan Aerospace with a significant technological advantage in pursuing these other commercial opportunities.  The most applicable potential commercial opportunity is the satellite-based LIDAR (WeatherSat) project.  While the ground-baded LIDAR (GroundWinds) program has served to demonstrate the phenomenology of the system and allow the general concept to be developed, it does not provide any funding for the development of spaceflight-qualified hardware.  The portion of this SBIR proposal that deals with vibration testing of the interferometer would allow that work to take place, and provide Michigan Aerospace with a design that has been vibration tested.  This is a tremendous advantage when competing for both private sector investment, as well as government-funded instrument fabrication.  Other activites that Michigan Aerospace is involved in that may be able to leverage the work performed in this proposal involve optical air data systems for combat and civilian aircraft.

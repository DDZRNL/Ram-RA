<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR> Thin Film PV UltraFlex Solar Array System <BR>

<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Thin film photovoltaics (PV) solar array systems offer significant mass and cost saving benefits for current and future space-flight missions.  Much progress has been made in the development of thin film CIGS and amorphous silicon PV devices, however their integration into a solar array system has lagged.  As these PV devices have evolved, ABLE has spent a significant amount of effort in developing many ultra&#64979;lightweight solar array systems that can take advantage of the lightweight PV devices.  One of these systems is ABLE’s UltraFlex solar array which forms the basis of this proposed effort.  Recent internal studies have indicated that an UltraFlex solar array system populated with 10% efficient thin film PV represents a near term solution that can demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of array mass (>300 w/kg BOL, >600 w/kg with 20% efficient devices), cost (order of magnitude reduction) and stowed volume (<20% of a conventional planar array).  The objective of this proposed Phase 1 proposal is to integrate thin film PV to the proven UltraFlex structure in an effort to demonstrate these outstanding performance values.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 The specific commercial product resulting from the proposed program will be a high performance thin film PV solar array system.  This system will have many discriminating performance advantages that will leapfrog the competition.  These major discriminating features will include extremely low cost, extremely light weight, and extremely compact stowage volume.  In our view, this technology will become mission enabling for weight and cost sensitive missions when compared to its competition.  These exceptional performance attributes provide a clear indication of the thin film PV UltraFlex’s market potential.  The intrinsic performance and operational benefits of the thin film PV UltraFlex make it suitable for a variety of current and future government and commercial orbital and interplanetary missions.  
<br>
<br>The importance of the thin film PV UltraFlex array allows ABLE to enhance its strategic position as a solar array systems supplier leader.  Currently, the traditional solar array market is projected between $300M to $500M.  Once the thin film PV UltraFlex is completely qualified, it will capture a very large portion of the available solar array market. 
<br>
<br>The proposed programs (Phase I and II) have been structured to accelerate the commercialization of this technology and ready it for space-flight in approximately three years.  If the technology is proven worthy during the proposed program, then ABLE is committed to commercializing the developed system as a ABLE solar array systems product for all military and commercial applications.  ABLE has a demonstrated history of strategic investment in bringing technologies to market.  ABLE provided strategic investment in launching the PUMA, UltraFlex, SCARLET, and Aurora product lines, and is committed launching the thin film PV UltraFlex in a similar manner for the benefit of current and future missions.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The current expendable emergency oxygen generation systems in the Portable Life Support System (PLSS) are lightweight and work well.  However, they could generate very high weight penalties when the number and duration of missions (and/or emergencies) are high (as in lunar or Martian explorations).  TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes a light-weight emergency unit using a novel regenerable sorbent.  In the unit, the sorbent releases oxygen while removing CO2 and H2O.  The unit also rejects the heat of absorption to space and maintains the desired degree of cooling.  Following the EVA, the sorbent is thermally regenerated with oxygen.  A simple oven is the only regeneration equipment required, greatly reducing the weight of the regeneration equipment.  In addition, the same unit can also be used for O2 supply and CO2/H2O removal in normal EVAs (i.e., non-emergency cases).  The innovation addresses the needs for future long-term microgravity and planetary exploration requirements.  Decreased weight reduces the launch costs, easy maintenance increases crew time available for research activities, and an efficient design reduces the logistic train support for replaceable units and spares.  
<br>
<br>In Phase I, TDA will measure the oxygen storage capacity and CO2/H2O loading of the sorbent under simulated PLSS conditions, and carry out 20 full cycles.  We will then design the components of the emergency unit and the regeneration system.  We will estimate the weight and power requirements.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The innovation also addresses to a specific industrial need; separation of oxygen from air at low cost.  TDA's regenerable oxygen storage sorbents can selectively absorb oxygen from air and can be regenerated easily.  A sorbent-based process offers the potential to reduce the cost of oxygen by minimizing the capital costs and the energy required air separation.  Parasitic power and capital costs are the largest contributors to the cost of the conventional air separation, thus the overall savings could be as much as a factor of two compared to the cost of the oxygen.

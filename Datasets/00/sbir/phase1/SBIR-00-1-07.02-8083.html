<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 We have recently used a state-of-the-art Planar Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) system to demonstrate the first successful measurements of spatially and temporally resolved, three-dimensional, velocity vector fields in the blade wakes of a full-scale, operating rotor.  The supporting software for processing the PDV images is a core element of the instrumentation.  However, the present software set is unrefined, constrained to a specialized computing environment, and requires significant operator expertise to implement.  To enable its universal use by non-specialists, this proposal addresses the requirements for an integrated PDV image-processing software system that is transportable and fully documented.  The PC-based software will incorporate advanced and experimentally validated algorithms to fully accommodate the time-dependent flows of operating rotors, and will provide near-autonomous processing procedures and velocity field displays with the minimum requirements for operator expertise and training.  An additional objective is to define a strategy for an ancillary processing system that is specifically designed to rapidly display interim velocity fields for preliminary analysis during the test period.  The tasks described in this proposal are essential steps leading to an advanced PDV system that can be routinely applied to future full-scale rotorcraft/STOVL aerodynamics testing programs, and subsequently commercialized.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 The primary commercial application is the measurement of velocity vector fields in large-scale, three-dimensional, time-dependent flow fields. This unique capability is expected to be attractive to a wide range of customers including world-wide Government aerodynamic facilities, universities, and industrial testing sites.  Examples of potential applications, other than rotorcraft and fixed-wing aerodynamic test-ing in large wind tunnels, include flow-field diagnostics of automotive vehicles, helicopter landing pads, aircraft wake, and weather disturbances over airport runways and ship decks, building and bridge wakes, and the motion of solid targets and projectiles.

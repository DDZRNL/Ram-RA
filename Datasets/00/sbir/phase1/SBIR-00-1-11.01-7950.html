<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR>
A Portable Non-invasive Detection/Identification System for Biological Pathogens<BR>
<P>
<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to develop a non-invasive, portable fluorescence-based detection system 
that will be capable of detecting and identifying biological pathogens commonly 
found in air, water, food, blood or even tissue that has been solublized in water. 
The innovativeness of this proposal involves the development of peptide ligands, 
using phage display technology, that specifically interact with different bacteria 
and/or viruses. The ligands will be covalently affixed to a chip that is inserted 
into the detection system. The Center for Biophysical Sciences and Engineering 
(CBSE) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, previously developed phage 
display peptide ligands that attach to specific spore strains of Bacillus anthracis 
and Bacillus subtilis. A laboratory fluorescence-based detection system identified 
the individual type and strain of spore. Our system will provide a tool for monitoring 
crew health and environment on long distance space flights (ISS). This proposal 
addresses SBIR subtopic: 11.01, Commercial Microgravity Research-&quot;Portable 
Biological Sensors- The need for sensing devices that can detect and identify 
biological pathogens (airborne or in vivo) is desired to support NASA&#146;s mission 
for a permanent presence of man in space&quot;. Our system will be useful to monitor 
the crew and the vehicle environment for biological pathogens.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed biological sensor will be extremely valuable in any healthcare setting 
since it will provide the healthcare practitioner with an immediate, non-invasive 
diagnosis. It will be extremely valuable for differential diagnosis of any bacterial 
strain, and of a bacterial versus viral or fungal infection. This will enable 
physicians to immediately determine the proper mode of treatment thereby improving 
the quality of medical care and decreasing medical costs. The detection system 
can also be<br>
used to monitor pathogenic contamination in food, water reservoirs (for consumption 
or recreation), and air.

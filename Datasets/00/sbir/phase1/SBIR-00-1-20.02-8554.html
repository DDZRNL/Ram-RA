<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR> Sub-Millimeter C(f)/C Grids For High Power Ion Propulsion Engines <BR>
<P>
<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 The high specific impulse and efficiency of ion propulsion thrusters has increased the popularity of these devices for a growing number of proposed missions, such as planetary and deep space, longer station keeping mission lifetimes, and tighter geosynchronous orbit tolerances.  Grid erosion is one of the major life limiting phenomena for operating ion thrusters and carbon/carbon composite grids have shown to exhibit at least a 5 fold reduction in the erosion rate.
<br>
<br>Ceramic Composites Incorporated proposes a novel, low-cost fabrication approach for braided carbon/carbon composite grids with sub-millimeter hole sizes and narrower screen spacing.  The thrust per unit beam area is directly proportional to the number of holes in the screen and accelerator grids, thus the smallest possible hole sizes and largest hole density potentially correspond to the maximum thrust density.  The high thrust densities enable the accomplishment of a prescribed mission using either smaller thrusters or a smaller number of larger thrusters.  A unique approach will be developed to fabricate a woven fiber preform containing sub-millimeter holes, which will be rapidly densified with pyrolytic carbon via chemical vapor infiltration.  The grids will be evaluated to determine the ion extraction and other key parameters.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 Future mission requirements support the use of high efficiency, ion propulsion thrusters and it appears that demand will grow significantly in the upcoming years.  Hughes presently produces a number of commercial ion propulsion systems both as sub-propulsion units and as the main thruster in the DP1-NSTAR system.  Other companies are keen to become commercial supplier of ion propulsion systems as these markets develop and expand.  PRIMEX will work closely with CCI during the Phases of this contract to ensure that 30cm C(f)/C grids are produced that can be inserted into their designs for commercial systems.  
<br>
<br>The proposed outline in this proposal proves to be a low-cost approach to producing the next generation of ion propulsion thrusters with increased thrust capability and life expectancy.  Once the technology is proven in the Phase II, CCI will establish a dedicated facility to produce 30 cm grids with sub-millimeter hole sizes.  Additionally, this thin section woven technology may find applications in other electrode related systems in growing industries such as ion implantation, ion optics and imaging.

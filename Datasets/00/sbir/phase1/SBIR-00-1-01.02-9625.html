<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Airbags are established injury preventing devices in automobiles, and will soon appear in aircraft. Airbags have already been developed for military helicopters and commuter aircraft, and general aviation applications will follow. The proposed research will develop technology to permit the first general aviation airbags to be as small and light weight as possible while still providing the needed level of crash protection. While optimizing performance,this technology will also prevent airbag induced injuries. Unfortunate incidents of the type publicised in the media for auto air bags will then be avoided in the first genereral aviation air bag applications. The technology will be based on total gas flow management techniques. The flow of both inflating and exiting gas will be controlled.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
There are commercial applications for the resulting product in all airbag applications. The flow control device can be used in aircraft and automotive occupant protection airbags. It can also be applied in other airbag applications, such as those used to attenuate the impact of air cargo pallets, aircraft escape modules, and recoverable space launch vehicles. The envisioned general aviation airbag market is but the first of many commercial opportunities for the technology.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Mesoscopic Devices proposes to develop a low-cost, highly compact and efficient mid-capacity reverse Brayton cycle cryocooler for liquefying oxygen and fuel on Mars. Suitable for cooling loads between 0.1 kW and 5 kW at 90K, this cryocooler will be a factor of five smaller and lighter than competing Stirling and pulse tube cryocoolers at this size scale. An innovative system configuration utilizes recent advantages in power electronics, bearings and high power density magnets to allow an order of magnitude reduction in cost for the cryocooler. A innovative recuperator design allows very high performance recuperators to be manufactured at low cost. In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through a combination of analysis, design, and proof-of-concept fabrication trials. In Phase II, we will build the cryocooler and demonstrate its advantages over alternate approaches.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The reverse Brayton cycle cryocooler proposed for the liquefier has applications in both military and commercial markets.  Cryocoolers in this size range will be needed to support two emerging markets – power high temperature superconductor (HTS) applications and small-scale industrial gas liquefaction.  Power HTS applications for the military include electric motors for ship propulsion and electric motor and generators for the More Electric Aircraft program.  Commercial power HTS applications include motors, superconducting magnetic energy storage systems and transmission lines.  All of these applications will require reliable, compact, cost-effective cryocoolers for widespread applications, as will small scale liquefaction of industrial gases at distributed sites.  The proposed reverse Brayton cryocooler will meet the needs of these markets through high reliability, high power density, low cost and easy integration.

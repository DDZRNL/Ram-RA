<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA seeks breakthrough technologies that will greatly increase the sensitivity of its astrological, space, planetary and earth observing and sampling instruments while reducing significantly their overall mass and cost. Nanotechnologies have the potential to meet these requirements.  Physical Optics Corporation proposes to develop a nanocomposite material for phase shifting applications in infrared (1.4-4.5 micron), millimeter wave (W-band and over), and  microwave (X, K bands) parts of the spectrum. The proposed material will consist of nanoparticles with a special magnetic order. These nanocrystals will be embedded in a solid matrix, or matrices, that are transparent at the wavelengths specified above. Large phase shifts and high switching speeds in these materials will be achieved by application of low driving power, thanks to the exceptional electrodynamic properties of the nanoparticles. 
<br>
<br>This effort, after proof-of-concept in Phase I, will result in the introduction, at the end of Phase II, of a low-cost and effective material technology for multiband beam control and switching applications. The high speed, low power consumption and potentially small size and weight of devices incorporating these materials will enhance the sensitivity of the sensing and detecting systems used in NASA missions.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Reducing mass is increasingly important to NASA spacecraft.  MicroTechnology (MicroTech) fiber optic pressure transducers provide mass and power savings of up to 0.25 kg and 0.35 W per unit.  Furthermore, the shift toward smarter spacecraft requires a larger number of pressure transducers.  Development of a low mass, MicroTech fiber optic pressure transducer would greatly facilitate implementation of smart systems.  Intelligent Optical Systems, Inc. (IOS) proposes to develop MicroTech fiber optic pressure transducers -- an enabling technology for all chemical and electrical Micro/Nano Spacecraft propulsion systems.  IOS has pioneered innovative fiber optic solutions to diverse technological problems.  We have made particular progress in Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) systems, which show real promise for use as MicroTech non-invasive, fiber optic pressure transducers.  The IOS FBG system is based on a distributed array of in-line FBGs that convert pressure-induced strain into shifts in wavelength.  Affixed to the external wall of a fuel supply tube, FBGs monitor changes in the pressure inside the tube by detecting the minute changes they induce in tube circumference.
<br> 
<br>In Phase III of the proposed project, IOS will market a distributed fiber optic pressure monitoring system capable of determining the internal pressure and health of pipelines and structural components.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed sensor system can monitor internal pressure in tubes and pipes used for aerospace, research, and industrial applications.  IOS's system will find immediate adoption in the aerospace industry in monitoring aging aircraft, ground processing equipment, space vehicle launch and landing facilities, and payloads.  They will also be used in civil engineering to monitor bridges, highways, dams, and buildings; in public utilities, to for monitor pipelines, power lines, power generators and storage tanks.

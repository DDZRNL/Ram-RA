<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The potential commercial applications of this research are numerous in both the private and the government world. Any distributed organization, which has some complex process and need to deploy on a wide variety of platforms, will be interested in this type of product. In the government, many organizations have heavy processes. NASA is a good example with the Space Station program, where different teams are working all over the world to build and operate it.

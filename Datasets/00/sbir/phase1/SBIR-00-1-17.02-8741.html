<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 We propose the Integrated Large-Aperture Zonal Meniscus as an evolutionary advance that will form the basis for our revolutionary Photonex Telescope vision. It features a continuous meniscus mirror with integrated zonal actuation intended for space-based, large mirror applications where weight, reliability, schedule and cost are prime factors in the design. The integrated design is directly applicable to space-based applications in both earth observing and space imaging surveillance as well as for directed energy beam propagation for laser weapons. It will also serve as the basis for the cost-effective, volume production of high precision aspheres, which will be in big demand for 0.1-mm lithography systems.

<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR> Rapid Identification of Bacterial Pathogens Using a New Optical Biosensor <BR>
<P>
<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Echo Technologies, Inc. proposes a Phase I program to demonstrate a new type of optical biosensor for identification of bacterial pathogens.  The biosensors use Fluorescently Labeled Virus Probes (FLVP) which are highly specific bacteriophage particles encoded with fluorescent reporters.  The sensors are monitored by wavelength-specific fluorescence spectroscopy, which indicates the presence of the phage/host complex.  In Phase I sensors will be fabricated and selectivity demonstrated with Escherichia coli and Streptococci but the approach can be extended to other bacteria.  Sensors are evaluated against a specific test matrix, including initial interferent/matrix effects testing.  A small optoelectronic interface and data acquisition system will be demonstrated.  In Phase II a prototype 4-channel Biosensor Array will be developed using COTS photonic components.  The system will be evaluated for a period of 1 month in a recirculating aqueous testbed.

<br>
<br>Application of the FLVP technology to optical sensing represents a new approach to real-time identification of bacteria.  This approach reduces the need for culturing to identify pathogens, and is an important departure from immunoassay or DNA-based sensing concepts. The probes are suited for incorporation in a sensor array for simultaneous detection of many pathogens and could be used in potable, hygiene, food regeneration and bioreactor subsystems.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 The proposed Biosensor Array is applicable to both military and civilian problems such as identifying terrorist threats, ensuring the safety of food supplies, in agricultural engineering, and ensuring the purity of processing water in the biotechnology and semiconductor industries.  The sensors are also ideally suited to routine monitoring of municipal and recreational water supplies for outbreaks of enteric pathogens.

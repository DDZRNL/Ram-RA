<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Quantum dot (QD) infrared photodetectors offer promise to improve performance over current bulk material technology.  Namely, QD devices can have higher detectivity and reduced needs for cryogenic cooling.  Current QD technology has yet to achieve theoretical goals however, mostly due to non-uniformities in their size and distribution.   For this Phase I study, we propose improve the uniformity of QDs using patterned substrates.  The structure of the substrate surface will influence the QD formation and enhance their uniformity. In(x)Ga(1-x)As(y)Sb(1-y) quaternary will be used as the active material.  Both structural and optical characterization will be performed.  These improved QDs will eventually be employed into a multiple QD layer photodetector structure.

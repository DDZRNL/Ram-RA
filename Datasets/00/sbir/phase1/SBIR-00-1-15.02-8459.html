<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR> An Assisted Change Detection System <BR>
<P>
<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 NASA has a critical need for intelligent change detection algorithms and
<br>geoprocessing techniques for digital imagery archives of earth science
<br>data obtained from satellites and aerial platforms.  Currently, the change
<br>detection process is slow, labor-intensive, and costly.  Change detection
<br>methods that rely on pixel differencing detect all changes between imagery
<br>and are thus not well suited for detecting target-specific changes, such
<br>as riparian zones within a selected watershed.  Thus, targets must first
<br>be extracted from both sets of imagery before target changes can be
<br>detected. Visual Learning Systems (VLS) proposes to design and demonstrate
<br>the feasibility of an intelligent target-specific change-detection module
<br>based on VLS's novel, proprietary machine-learning methods.  VLS's 
<br>approach is expected to provide a mechanism for detecting object-specific
<br>changes that is 50-200 times faster than existing techniques while
<br>maintaining the same level of accuracy.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Visual Learning Systems (VLS) has conducted market research that shows 
<br>that the potential market for the proposed assisted target-specific 
<br>change-detection module is conservatively worth at least $100 to $250 
<br>million. The GIS market for terrestrial applications is a $6.9 billion
<br>dollar industry worldwide.  This market continues to experience rapid
<br>growth, consuming spatial information for the following diverse
<br>applications and vertical markets: agriculture and forestry, banking and
<br>insurance, environmental and resource management, petroleum exploration
<br>and mining, electricity and gas pipeline routing, health and public
<br>safety, law enforcement and criminal justice, real estate management,
<br>retail and commercial development, state and local government, and
<br>transportation and telecommunications. There is a large market within the
<br>Department of Defense and the U.S. Intelligence Community for the proposed
<br>assisted change-detection module.  These applications include the
<br>following: support to military operations; counter-terrorism; 
<br>proliferation control of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons; arms
<br>control and treaty monitoring; counter-drug initiatives; and peacekeeping
<br>operations. VLS's proposed change-detection module will also help meet a
<br>widespread need among other federal agencies.  For example, NASA and NOAA
<br>both have a pressing need monitor changes in the earth's environment using
<br>remotely sensed imagery.

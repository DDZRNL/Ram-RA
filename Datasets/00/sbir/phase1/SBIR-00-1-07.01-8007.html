<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Computational approaches for estimating the relative stability and robustness of distributed air-traffic-management  (ATM) systems are proposed. These methodologies combine the notions of Lyapunov stability and dissipativity in nonlinear dynamic system theory with the concepts of connective stability and robustness from decentralized control theory. The proposed research builds upon a recent research effort that resulted in the development of a software environment for ATM stability and robustness analysis.   
<br>	Phase I research will develop the computational algorithms and will demonstrate their use in a high-fidelity simulation of the air-traffic-management system. Scenarios illustrating the practical use of these algorithms to gauge the stability properties of the ATM environment will also be developed during Phase I research. 
<br>	Based on the Phase I research results, Phase II work will develop computational modules that can be integrated with air-traffic-management decision aids such as CTAS to provide real-time information about the ATM system stability and robustness. After adequate testing and evaluation of the proposed algorithms, the stability and robustness information can be used as a decision aid for intervention by centralized air-traffic-control entities in the distributed ATM environment.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 A recent trend in the aerospace industry is to develop decentralized autonomous systems for carrying out aerospace missions. Examples include the distributed control of satellite formations, unmanned aerial vehicle formations, and cooperative missile systems. Methods developed under the present research can be used to assess the stability and robustness properties of such distributed control systems.  Other areas of application include stability and robustness analysis of distributed computer networks, intelligent vehicle-highway systems, and distributed process control systems.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The development of new, active flow control devices will be critical to meeting the NASA Aerospace Technology Enterprise goals of reducing air travel costs by 25% in 10 years and 50% in 25 years.  Continuum Dynamics, Inc. (CDI) proposes the development of a new “pop-up” vortex generator (PUVG) concept which will eliminate cruise and off-design drag penalties of conventional vortex generators through flush surface stowage and deliver the proven flow control of traditional vortex and micro-vortex generators when deployed.  Key in the development of this new flow control device is the application of Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) technologies developed at CDI which allow: device stowage conforming to the application mold line; minimum power requirements through self-locking actuation; low weight and simplicity through elimination of bulky mechanical actuation; the potential for selective deployment optimization based on vehicle operating conditions; and the potential for retrofit on existing aircraft systems.  The proposed Phase I effort will carry out the conceptual design, fabrication and experimental studies demonstrating “proof of concept,” which can then be carried to Phase II/III product development.  PUVGs offer the building blocks for a distributed flow control system with the potential to optimize aircraft performance in critical flight conditions.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
PUVG devices offer the potential for a tremendous increase in overall aircraft performance through the efficient management of flow separation without the off-design drag and flow losses associated with conventional devices.  PUVG’s have application to aircraft wing and fuselage separation control, engine inlet distortion control, marine hull and keel separation control, and enhanced mixing and heat transfer in a wide range of chemical and combustion processes.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovation is a total workstation for analytic and digital photogrammetry (also called softcopy) and for integrated mapping from ground, aerial and earth satellite data which is designed to optimize the interaction between human and artificial intelligence. The Universal Mapping System (UMS) provides dual-tracking, optical and digital images by image superimposition in a stereo binocular field of view for real-time interaction between operator and machine. It is designed to match or exceed the productivity of a state-of-the-art softcopy workstation, as well as the precision of the best analytical plotter. 
<br>The Phase I effort will accomplish the completion of a second UMS-2 prototype of the UMS hardware with a full complement of software for analytic photogrammetry and for color-stereo film scanning at along-axis speeds of at least 40 mm/sec. It will also install and demonstrate color digital projector technology for stereo image superimposition of cadastral survey and map data, and radar and space imagery. Phase I will prove UMS-2 feasibility and confirm its potential performance advantage over existing systems. It will prepare the UMS-2 for the installation of digital/softcopy and artificial intelligence aids to analytic photogrammetry in a Phase II commercial development program.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The number of stereoplotters worldwide has been estimated at 100,000. They include analog, analytic and digital (softcopy) versions. Perhaps 50,000 analog stereoplotters were installed before they were superseded whereas the move to analytic stereoplotters had only grown to a reasonable volume when the digital stereoplotter appeared on the scene. Now there is argument and confusion as to the relative value of  "pure" analytic versus "pure" digital technology. The UMS-2 combines the best of both worlds as a total workstation and is arguably the best platform for R&D of "pure" softcopy.  The UMS-2 is designed to set a standard that could promote sales approaching those achieved in the past with analog stereoplotters.

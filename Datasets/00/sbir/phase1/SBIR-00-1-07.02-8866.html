<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR> Low-Cost Lightweight Attitude-Command Augmentation System for Civil Helicopters <BR>

<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 This project will result in a low-cost, lightweight, attitude-command-attitude-hold (ACAH) stabilization system for civil helicopters.  The results of past and ongoing U.S. Army and NASA research will be used as a starting point to develop an ACAH stability augmentation system (SAS) that can be used to enhance the dynamics of civil helicopters in a way that is economically viable to the user.
<br>The helicopter dynamics required to achieve safe IFR capability are not well understood, so that each certification is a high-risk (and therefore expensive) effort.  An important feature of the proposed SAS it that it will provide handling qualities and divided attention characteristics that can be depended on to meet the FAA requirements for IFR certification.  
<br>The proposed ACAH SAS would provide a low cost solution to achieve improved helicopter dynamics, and hence enhanced safety, in two critical flight regimes, the DVE and for IMC.  There is substantial evidence from NTSB accident data to indicate that it is safer to operate IFR than to attempt to continue visual flight in low visibility conditions.  However, if it is necessary to operate in the DVE, the ACAH SAS can be shown to substantially improve the safety of that operation

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 An informal survey of manufacturers and users, as well as editorial comments in trade journals (e.g., Rotor and Wing) indicate that there is a substantial need for a low cost SAS for helicopters that would provide handling qualities that result in reasonable assurance of IFR certification, as well as increased safety for divided attention tasks.  Current solutions are too expensive, so most helicopters in the medium-to-low cost range do not have the benefit of IFR capability.
<br>The ACAH stability augmentation system would be marketed to manufacturers for installation in new helicopters, and as an aftermarket installation.  A unique feature of the system is that it will be designed specifically to allow IFR certification without an autopilot, and to provide a stable attitude response in all flight regimes regardless of the SAS-off handling qualities.  
<br>The target market would consist primarily of helicopters that exist at the lower end of the cost spectrum (less than $300,000).  This would include mostly piston helicopters such as the Robinson R-22 and R-44, the Enstrom 280FX, and Schweizer 300C.  It is estimated that there is also a potential market for low-end turbine helicopters.  Not many of these helicopters are currently certified for IFR.

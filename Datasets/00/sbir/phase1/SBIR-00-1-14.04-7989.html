<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 The Earth Science Enterprise (ESE), formerly known as Mission to Planet Earth, is a NASA-initiated concept that uses space-, ground-, and aircraft-based measurement systems to gather scientific knowledge for understanding the Earth's climate system and its variations. The space-based components of ESE will provide a constellation of satellites to monitor Earth from space. The variety of satellites contributing to ESE investigations collectively carries different Earth observation sensors.  These sensors enable ESE observations for assessment of various Earth processes: hydrologic, biochemical, atmospheric, ecological, and geophysical.  Scientific investigations can benefit from complementary sensor measurements that can be fused to produce Earth Science data otherwise not attainable with single sensors. Simultaneous collection of such data from different sensors may require the coordinated flight of different satellite platforms, making it necessary to control satellites in a coordinated formation over the period of data collection.    A computer-aided design (CAD) environment is proposed to include modeling, design and simulation technologies for the study of multi-satellite formation control. The CAD environment will include two major components: a configurable simulation environment with extensible modeling tools for realistic evaluation of the operation of these vehicles, and a guidance and control design environment with special emphasis on satellite formation flight.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 The proposed technologies constitute two separate but related commercialization directions for OSI.  The configurable simulation environment developed through the proposed research will be applicable not only to almost all aerospace vehicles, but also to other automatic control applications such as advanced transportation systems, robotics, and manufacturing processes.  The software architecture can be generalized into reusable "frameworks," which will form the basis for extending the established technology into these other application areas.
<br>OSI already has a product for nonlinear controller design applications.  The new formation control technology will enhance this product line.  Besides satellite formation control, the technology will also be applicable to intelligent vehicle highway systems for controlling platoons of automobiles in close formation to improve traffic efficiency.

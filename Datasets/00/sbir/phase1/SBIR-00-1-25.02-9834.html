<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 The overall goal of this program is to develop a new class high-performance carbon nanotube-based composites for aerospace applications.  This program addresses the NASA’s need for nanotube-based materials that are lightweight, structurally robust, and environmentally stable.  The key innovation is to develop techniques for fabrication of advanced composites through modification of nanotube surfaces. In the Phase I program we will prepare and evaluate a series of composites based on combination of reactive carbon nanotubes and high-performance polymers. 
<br>
<br>Based on successful proof of feasibility in Phase I we will pursue a Phase II program where emphasis will be placed optimizing the most promising candidates identified in Phase I.  Phase II will involve the design and development of prototype devices demonstrating performance characteristics for specific applications within NASA and industry.

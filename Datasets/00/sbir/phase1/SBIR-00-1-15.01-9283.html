<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This system is intended to develop a novel structure to support the onboard information exchange. This structure is based on Internet related techniques, which are very popular in many areas of applications, and have been proven to be commercially successful. Based on Internet related techniques, the system is modularized, and compatible with the current Internet related standards. Leveraging the latest developments of object oriented software engineering, and its widely adopted standards, this structure is cost-efficient, reliable, maintainable and open to all interfaces which are compatible to Internet standards. Under this structure, every onboard instrument will support the unique interface standard: Java. All functional modules take the form of a java class, and are highly modularized. By downloading the latest functional modules from a manufacture's web site, the upgrading can be done or bugs can be fixed. The system maintenance and upgrades can easily be achieved, and this can be done at any time, even during operational flight missions. The structure is technologically compatible with the current commercial applications and information accumulated by the onboard sensors and instruments is accessible to these commercial applications. And in fact, the onboard instruments and sensors turn into a node of information source in the Internet.

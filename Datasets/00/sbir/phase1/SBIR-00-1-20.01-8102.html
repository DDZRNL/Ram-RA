<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 This innovation is concerned with the fabrication of a novel morphology of LiMnO2 to be implemented in revolutionary composite cathode for lithium ion rechargeable batteries. The proposed cathode material and novel fabrication process will overcome capacity fading problems inherent in LiMnO4, exhibit greater utilization of its theoretical capacity, show exceptional cycleability and provide a vehicle for easy scale-up to commercial production. LiMnO2 cathode materials produced by this route are projected to compete very well with the benchmark LiCoO2 system by showing specific capacities in excess of 150 Ah/kg and energy densities greater than 550 Wh/kg while costing substantially less. A cathode of this nature will enable manufacturers to provide NASA with a high energy density, high cycle capacity, low cost alternative to the current state-of the-art LiCoO2 based batteries. Further, batteries based on nanoparticulate LiMnO2 are projected to compete very well in the consumer battery market by providing a safe, cost effective alternative to the environmentally unsound, expensive cobalt based systems.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 Potential commercial applications for the proposed cathode material are far reaching and promise substantial financial gain. The applications which represent the most probable routes to market penetration include portable telephones, lap-top computers, electronic toys and radio communication devices. All of these niches in the whole of the consumer electronics market measure financial success in billions of dollars. This insures that even a small gain of market share represents substantial profit. Secondary applications (represented by smaller or developing markets) include electric vehicles, storage of alternatively generated power (e.g. solar cells), portable devices for the electronic foot soldier and other military applications.

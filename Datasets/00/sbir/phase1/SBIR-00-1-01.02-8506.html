<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Midé is proposing innovative energy-absorbing seat and restraint system enhancements for improving crashworthiness in aircraft, using Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs). It is proposed that the passive superelastic properties (energy-absorption) of SMA’s are investigated for integration into various components of the seat, support, and restraint system.  These alloys are capable of absorbing energy in the form of strain, to a much higher degree than conventional materials such as steel and aluminum alloys.  Phase 1 will downselect among the proposed concepts and determine feasibility.

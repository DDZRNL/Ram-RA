<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Southwest Sciences proposes to apply a novel, yet simple non-invasive technique, Point Diffraction Interferometry (PDI), to provide highly accurate and precise two-dimensional temperature profiles.  This proposed instrument can provide reliable and robust temperature measurements that are required for propulsion test operations, including facility and test article health monitoring.  Unlike invasive techniques, such as thermocouples which only provide point data measurements, a PDI system produces two-dimensional temperature profiles without disturbing the test flow field.   Other non-invasive techniques could be used, however, many only provide  point measurements or one-dimensional profiles, are optically complex, or involve a nonlinear analysis.  PDI  is a self-referencing technique, inherently stable, and relatively insensitive to vibration.  We expect to achieve temperature uncertainties less than 20 K at propulsion exhaust temperatures.  This technique uses visible light, simple optics and is easy to align and operate; collimated light sources and imaging detectors in the visible are inexpensive and commercially available.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed instrument can be used to non-intrusively measure temperature in propulsion test facilities.  Unlike other non-invasive diagnostics, the proposed Point Diffraction Interferometer uses visible light with simple optics, and is easy to align and operate; collimated light sources and imaging detectors in the visible are inexpensive and commercially available.  With these advantages the proposed instrument has the potential to be applied to a wide variety of applications.  In the laboratory, this novel technique can be applied to density / temperature measurements in numerous fluid/thermal experiments, including combustion and fire sciences.  This instrument could also be used for monitoring density changes in gas streams, which could be applied to chemical process monitoring.

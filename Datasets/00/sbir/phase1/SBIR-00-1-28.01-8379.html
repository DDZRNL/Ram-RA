<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 In orbit, a satellite is exposed to solar radiation and to plasma, which has the effect of accumulation charge on the outer surface. On insulating surfaces in shadow, potentials of 18kV are measured, whereas the illuminated surfaces have potentials of zero. Such differences cause electrical discharge, resulting in; damage to the thermo-optical and mechanical properties of the satellite films, radio interference, and the onboard electrical equipment to switch logical states. Eikos Inc. proposes the use of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWnT) in LARC-developed polyimides as a novel transparent, electrostatic dissipation (ESD) films for spacecraft protection. This technology will provide environmentally stable and durable ESD films while protecting the surface from atomic oxygen (AO), Ultraviolet (UV) light by exploiting space proven polyimides. To the polyimide is added highly conductive SWnT to form interpenetrated network or nanocomposite, which is conductive, tough, and lightweight. The use of SWnT within this matrix to impart ESD protection offers a cost effective approach for a wide array of application and products. The applications include nanocomposite films for deployable structures, shielding, concentrators, and thermal barriers.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
There has been enormous interest in products intended to minimize the effects of ESD in a variety of industries, ranging from satellites to the automotive industry. Catalog vendors list more than 1,000 types of ESD products, many could be supplanted by this technology. Most of the research and development associated with these products has been done domestically, and the U.S. remains the largest producer of ESD goods. Furthermore, this country still is the largest single market for ESD products. Estimates of the size of the ESD market well over $1 billion.

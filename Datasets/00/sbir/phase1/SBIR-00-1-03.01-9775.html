<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovative analysis tool is driven by the need to integrate both analytical and experimental techniques when performing an experiment of spacecraft launch. When available, this tool provides an acoustic engineer access to both the experimental data being measured and analytical predictions that are derived from empirical models and a database.  Thus, the proposed tool takes advantage of an existing database that includes pertinent extensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data.  As data are being recorded, the tool generates acoustic spectra at locations that are not part of the experimental setup to provide in-situ prediction.  Furthermore, this high-level analysis tool improves the quality of the experimental data by detecting potential problems as the data is being taken; hence, the engineer can intervene in the process to eliminate anomalies or improve results.  The analytical prediction tool, once calibrated, can be used to predict acoustic spectra during launch at various locations on and around the spacecraft.  These acoustic load predictions can then be used for structural dynamic analysis.  The proposed tool incorporates several input parameters that an analyst can change to simulate or eliminate perturbations in the experimental conditions.  This flexibility helps determine the sensitivity of the measured experimental results to various parameters.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Once this method has been developed, coded, and tested, it has strong commercial potential.  Broad marketability arises from the fact that this method provides both spacecraft and aircraft designers a highly useful tool to analyze acoustic data in real time and provide loads for structural analysis early in the design phase for a new vehicle.  The method will be made available as a functional accessory module to an existing analysis product that evolved from earlier NASA SBIR work.  This product, PC-SIGNAL™, has just become available for users.  The commercial version of the new module will feature an extensive graphic user interface to enable users to apply it with minimum training and obtain results.  The proposed module fills a long standing spacecraft/aircraft engineering void.  Heretofore, surface acoustic forcing functions were hard to synthesize because no combination of analysis techniques and test data integration was available for this purpose.

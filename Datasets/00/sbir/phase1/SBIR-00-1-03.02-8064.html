<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The innovation is a unique Carbon-based Mars ISRU Rocket Technology (CMIRT) that 
can greatly reduce vehicle size, complexity, support systems, and Earth launch 
mass requirements for a variety of human and robotic Mars missions, where propulsion 
systems use propellants from indigenous materials on Mars. CMIRT propellants are 
simply derived from the CO2 or H2O in the Mars atmosphere or from H2O found in 
the Mars soil or subsurface. The CMIRT innova-tion consists of efficiently packaged 
solid carbon-based fuel (with various percentages of hydrogen)/liquid oxygen inte-grated 
into ORBITEC's cryogenic hybrid with a vortex feed system. The ISRU-based propellant 
family and the unique vortex-fed hybrid propulsion system approach proposed here 
has many advantages over other Earth-derived propellants and conventional propulsion 
systems. ORBITEC's experience and capability in advanced propulsion and ISRU sys-tems 
will allow much to be accomplished during the Phase I effort. During Phase, I 
ORBITEC proposes to: (1) conduct test firings in the ORBITEC Mark II hybrid engine 
to measure regression rates of the carbon-based propellants, (2) de-sign the vortex 
advanced cryogenic hybrid engine that will integrate into the MarkII system, (3) 
construct/fabricate and test the vortex advanced cryogenic hybrid engine, (4) 
conduct test firings in the vortex engine, and (5) analyze test firing results 
and recommend Phase II propellant selection and flexible propulsion systems that 
can use many of the carbon-based fuels with oxygen. Phase II will result in the 
final designs, construction, parametric testing, and larger-scale test firings 
of selected CMIRT propellant systems.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The results of this effort are applicable to future NASA Solar System unmanned 
and manned exploration missions to Mars. This activity is a part of NASA's overall 
strategic plan. Totally Mars-produced fuels and oxidizers will enhance and/or 
enable a variety of Mars exploration missions by providing a very cost-effective 
supply of propellants. The unique hardware proposed will also provide a low-cost 
and efficient/simple approach to reusable rocket propulsion on Mars. The establishment 
of practical feasibility could absolutely result in significant savings to our 
exploration pro-grams. These engines could be used for efficient planetary ascent/descent, 
orbit transfer, launch boost, intercept, etc. The storage aspects could lead to 
developments in lunar, Mars-based or on-orbit cryogenic fluid storage applications. 
This propellant/propulsion concept can meet the requirements of a number of manned 
and robotic ISRU Mars missions, especially a sample return mission. The proposed 
project could spinoff into revolutionary high-performance, low-cost, advanced 
cryogenic engines, of various sizes, that could significantly enhance a wide variety 
of Earth-based military and civil space missions and enable others.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Mobile Geographical Information Systems (MOGIS) are applications capable
<br>of running on wireless devices.  Two major hardware limitations have
<br>hindered the development of efficient MOGIS: (1) reduced screen sizes
<br>and (2) small memory capacities.  An innovative approach that overcomes
<br>these shortcomings is the utilization of map generalization. Map
<br>generalization is a visualization and geospatial data reduction technique
<br>that emphasizes and suppresses information from digital maps in order to
<br>represent a specific theme at reduced scales, while meeting specific
<br>cartographic specifications and maintaining the aesthetic quality of
<br>the geospatial data.  The primary objective of the Phase I program is to
<br>demonstrate the feasibility of applying map generalization technologies
<br>towards the development of MOGIS.  NASA objectives are met by the creation
<br>of innovative visualization and geospatial presentation techniques for use
<br>in mobile computing.  The results of the Phase I effort will be applied
<br>to a Phase II project directed towards the implementation a MOGIS
<br>prototype for personal digital assistants using map generalization technologies.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The results of the research and development effort will facilitate the development of a mobile geographical information systems with improved visualization, presentation, analysis, and geospatial data collection capabilities.  Some of the potential commercial applications include:
<br>
<br>1. Mobile geospatial data collection, presentation, and analytical tool for use in the field.
<br>2. Technology would permit more multi-purpose geospatial datasets 
<br>3. Innovative geospatial data reduction technique without compromising the integrity of data
<br>4. Applicable to Internet-based geographical information systems

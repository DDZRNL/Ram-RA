<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The objective of the proposed program is to develop high capacity nanostructured LixMnO2 cathode materials with a layered structure, which is stable over a wide range of lithiation. Layered LixMnO2 is a very attractive cathode material for aerospace applications because of its high theoretical capacity (~ 300 Ah/kg), low cost and low toxicity. In the proposed approach,  doped MnO2 nanoparticles will be produced by our patented vapor phase process. MnO2 sheets will be stabilized by an electrochemically active cation, which will restrict the movement of Mn ions. The unique feature of our vapor phase process is its ability to produce “kinetically stabilized” nanoparticles, which lead to exceptional energy densities, e.g. ~ 900 Wh/kg in case of our V2O5 nanoparticles. In Phase I, electrochemical properties of cathodes fabricated using doped-MnO2 nanoparticles will be evaluated by working with our industrial partner. These materials will lead to Li-polymer batteries with  high energy densities (> 250 Wh/kg) and a long cycle life (> 250). In Phase II, prototype batteries will be fabricated and tested for performance, along with optimization and scaling of the powder synthesis process.  In Phase III, the newly developed materials will be implemented in commercial batteries.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 The cathode in rechargeable Li - batteries is a very important constituent and accounts for a worldwide market value of more than $ 250 million/year. Consequently, cheaper and better performance cathode materials have a major role to play as Li-polymer batteries evolve in the years to come. Our approach to synthesis of cathode materials will lead to economical batteries with exceptional energy density.

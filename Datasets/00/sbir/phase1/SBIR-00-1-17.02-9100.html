<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A high precision laser range finder is proposed for applications in spaceborne telescopes and interferometers. A new kind of spatially adaptive optical frequency sensor is integrated with the Coherent Frequency Domain Reflectometry, leading to high precision laser range finder with broad measurement dynamic range and large baselines. Adjustable spatial resolution ranging from several centimeters down to a few tens of nanometers has been demonstrated experimentally. It is proposed in this proposal to demonstrate to NASA the expected spatial resolution on and beyond mono-atomic scale for future spaceborne missions involving telescopes and interferometers.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Successful execution of the Phase I program will lead to a novel optical range finder with unprecedented resolution that has tremendous technological and commercial importance. Potential commercial applications include in-situ semiconductor wafer thickness monitoring, integrated-circuit chip fabrication process, inspection of magnetic disks, navigational grade optical gyroscope, characterization apparatus for short-range communication optical fiber bundles, fiber amplifiers, and fiber preforms, optical data storage, as well as the detection of gravitational waves which is of interest to scientific communities.

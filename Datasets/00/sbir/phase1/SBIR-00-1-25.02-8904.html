<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are remarkable materials with the highest strength to weight ratio of any known material.  Successfully incorporating SWNTs as the reinforcing component of a composite structural material will provide properties far beyond those of any other material.  Other researchers have added SWNTs as reinforcing fibers in epoxy resins.  These experiments failed to produce materials with properties better than epoxy alone because the fibers did not link to the resin matrix.  Covalent linkage between SWNTs and the secondary composite component (plastic or epoxy) are necessary to realize the benefits of the SWNTs in the composite. SWNTs can be functionalized with organic molecules. This Phase I effort focuses on functionalizing SWNTs so that they may be covalently integrated with a host matrix, in order to limit pullout and fabricate a nanotube composite with properties superior to any current structural material.  It is the purpose of this Phase I effort to functionalize the ends and side walls of SWNTs as well as control reaction parameters such as extent of functionalization.  Phase II will result in a prototype SWNT composite material.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 Structural components for launch vehicles, spacecraft, aircraft, missiles, inflatables, and bridges.  Because of the electrical and thermal properties, such composite structural components can double as heat sinks, radiators, electrical conductors, electrode materials, high energy density capacitors/batteries, and gas storage devices.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Los Gatos Research proposes to develop wafer-based microfluidic manifold that includes the micropump and microvalve devices for lab-on-a-chip (LOC) applications.  These microfluidic devices will be engineered for integration with chemical and biological LOC detector systems.  For Phase I, a chip-based micropump system will be constructed and tested, and microvalve devices will be designed to function with the pumping system.  The Phase I Research will address issues related to the performance of, as well as production methods that can be used for the technology. An integrated microfluidic system will be designed, and specifications for the Phase II Prototype will be determined.  The suitability of the technology for present NASA LOC applications will be assessed, and relevant commercial markets and products will be identified.  Commercial devices based on the Phase II prototype will be constructed and commercialized during Phase III.

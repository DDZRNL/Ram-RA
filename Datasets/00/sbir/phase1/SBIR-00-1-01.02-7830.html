<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 This SBIR proposes the development of a real-time system to detect, discriminate and track in real-time the growth of low cycle fatigue cracks in rotating disks.  
<br>
<br>The goals of the SBIR are to develop:
<br>1.	A crack detection system that is not associated solely with a change in the center of mass.  
<br>2.	A system that can be licensed to general industry for use in spin pits, jet engines, steam turbines, medical centrifuges, flywheels or any other high speed turbomachinery, 
<br>3.	A system that can discriminate between cracks and other effects that give potentially false readings.  
<br>4.	A system that can be physically integrated with other sensors and the data easily correlated with readings from cooperating probes to provide a high confidence in the information to support a directed action by a health monitoring reasoner.
<br>
<br>The Phase I effort will focus on defining the method and demonstrating the feasibility of the system to detect and track cracks in rotating hardware.  Phase II will refine the method, provide crack discrimination capability, characterize the method across a variety of disk types, and integrate the method into a commercial rotor health monitoring system.  Phase III will commercialize the system.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The overall goal is to develop a crack detection system that can be used as both a flight safety device and a retirement for cause identifier.  The system would be designed to alert maintenance technicians of crack trends in specific disks in the engine, and would initially supplement the existing inspection systems available today.  The system would be used as a component of a flight safety, rotor health monitoring system on jet engines and other industrial turbo-machinery such as compressors, medical centrifuges, steam turbines, etc.  The system has direct applications in spin testing for increasing efficiency and generating early warning of an impending failure.  The system can also detect cracks in flywheels used for power generation and stability control in space.

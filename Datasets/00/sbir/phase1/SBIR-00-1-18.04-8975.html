<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Los Gatos Research is developing a simple robust methodology for the determination of carbon isotope ratios in small gas samples.  This new measurement scheme is inherently compact and rugged and offers a great potential for adaptation into space vehicles.  With such a sensitive method of accurately determining carbon isotope levels we hope to significantly advance the prospects for making in-situ tests for evidence of life on nearby planets, such as Mars.  The isotope ratio is known to be a sensitive indicator of biologic activity.  The new innovative advancement we propose to make will make such measurements potentially much easier than currently possible.  We will demonstrate the new absorption analysis technique at wavelengths of ~1.5 microns in Phase I and demonstrate that the approach can be used to record the relative isotopic abundance of carbon 12 and 13 with great accuracy.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Instrumentation proposed here is being developed with our partners for use in low cost medical diagnostic chemical analysis.  We are also currently developing a related isotope analysis system for use in nuclear nonproliferation applications.  The key technical aspect of our approach is the low cost of operation and simplicity of design.

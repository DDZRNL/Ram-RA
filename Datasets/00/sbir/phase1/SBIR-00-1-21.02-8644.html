<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A demultiplexing-discriminator device for decoding fiber Bragg grating sensor arrays is proposed.  Typical fiber Bragg grating sensor array decoders use scanning elements to demultiplex individual sensor signals.  They do not allow simultaneous signal detection, and consequently have limited sensor response times.  The proposed sensor array decoder is based on a Radiant Research telecom wavelength demultiplexer that is modified to provide a discriminating function that will allow simultaneous decoding of individual sensor elements on a fiber Bragg grating sensor array, and consequently high speed detection of the sensor signals.  For this proposal a telecom demultiplexer unit will be redesigned and fabricated to provide a feasibility demonstration using fiber Bragg grating sensor elements.  Such a commercialized device would be very useful in providing a relatively low cost solution for demodulation of fiber grating sensor arrays.  Sensor systems based on the proposed device would be used for aerospace multiplexed sensors, as embedded sensors in composite materials, and could be used extensively in civil structure analysis and monitoring to reduce cost-per-measurement point.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 The proposed device will allow high speed detection of multipoint sensors for aerospace and civil structure applications at a reasonable cost by using a telecom derivative product.  The reduced cost-per-measurement point will allow future expansion of the use of multiplexed fiber grating sensor arrays.  Benefits of using fiber grating sensor arrays have been demonstrated in many feasibility tests both in aerospace applications on fuel tanks and civil structure applications such as bridges.  In many of these cases higher speed detection is needed such as in highway weigh-in-motion devices, for example.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Brimrose proposes to develop miniaturized acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF)based multi-spectral imaging radiometer. This radiometer will operate in the wavelength range of 1 to 2.5um. We propose a novel fabrication procedure to make it capable of withstanding extreme environments of space. It involves moving parts, has high throughput and extremely fast scanning capability. The work focuses on 4 major areas: (1) Using newly developed bonding technique to bond transducer to the acousto-optic crystal to fabricated a more rugged AOTF, (2) The spectral characterization and calibration of the AOTF and, (3) Radiometric calibration of the multi-spectral AOTF, (4) Develop the bread-board design for Multi-spectral Radiometric Imaging System.
<br>
<br>In Phase II, the bread-board design will be optimized, the compact Multi-spectral Radiometric Imaging System will be built, optimized and thoroughly tested.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The successful completion of the proposed program will result in a miniature multi-spectral imaging radiometer capable of operating in the wavelength range of 1-2.5um under extreme conditions. It will have a number of scientific applications which include meteorology and atmospheric physics. Other applications include areas of military, space technology, medicine and photo-biology to mention a few.

<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR> DWDM Filters for High Efficiency Optical Communication <BR>

<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) is dramatically increasing the bandwidth on telecommunications networks and will have a direct impact on internet-based communication architecture for data delivery from NASA near-earth platforms.  The optical demultiplexers in DWDM systems rely on complex interference filters to transmit a very narrow wavelength region while reflecting the larger out of band region.  We propose a filter fabrication approach that uses DC magnetron sources, a unique optical coating chamber configuration, very efficient filter designs, and, most importantly,an innovative insitu optical monitor. The result will be the capability to fabricate low cost, high performance DWDM filters, both as single filters and spatially variable filters.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 The commercial potential of DWDM, and especially a low cost, high throughput filter fabrication method, is enormous.  The North American market for DWDM technology has grown to over three billion dollars in the last four years and is expected to grow to just under five billion dollars in 2001. High performance, low cost, DWDM interference filters, fabricated in large quantities will directly increase telecommunications bandwidth.

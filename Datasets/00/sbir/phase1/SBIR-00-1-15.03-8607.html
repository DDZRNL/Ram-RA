<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop an innovative Dynamic Time Multiplexed Holographic (DTMH) 3-D system for scientific data visualization based on direct viewing of an interactive environment that simulates reality in the most natural way.  This proposed DTHM system is based on our multiplexed holographic screens, 3-D projection scanners, and electronic signal processing.  The innovations include:  (1) novel large screen multichannel volumetric 3-D projection that does not require any special eyewear; (2) totally flexible position for viewing 3-D video/graphics, unique high speed multiview virtual world generators with interactive capabilities; and (3) high speed scanning for 3-D image generation.
<br>
<br>The key component of the system is a special holographic screen that displays a 3-D volume of visual information in front of a viewer.  The volumetric-like display is achieved by projecting slightly different views of the environment at a high refresh rate by polygon scanning.  All views are updated every 30 ms (single frame duration), with both spatial (angular) and temporal multiplexing of the visual channels.  Each spatial channel displays only the image associated with the specific predefined view, and the channel assignment is fixed.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The DTMH system can be applied to a broad variety of training, scientific simulation, and entertainment applications.  The DTMH technology can be incorporated into computer games, video conferencing, telemedicine, and advertising.  One prime technology focus will be on medical training, to which the system offers unique features.  Other 3-D training system for pilots, drivers, and machinery operators will be also considered.  Finally, we strongly believe that DTMH technology in the consumer market will replace existing 2-D television with 3-D television.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
EDAptive Computing, Inc., Dr. Perry Alexander of the University of Kansas and Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation propose an innovative solution to the problem of automated code synthesis by reusing existing components in an enterprise, starting with declarative specifications. Our proposed solution, which automates reuse of existing software components through their retrieval, adaptation and integration by applying innovative automated reasoning techniques, will lead to reduced time and cost to deploy systems as well as enable custom design of high-integrity software systems, thereby ensuring safe and reliable operation of the designed systems. Our proposed Enterprise Component Integration System (eCIS) project leverages the following:<br>(i)	An emerging System-Level Design Language (SLDL), Rosetta, <br>(ii)	EDAptive "s ongoing R & D in formal specification-based retrieval to accurately match requirements with existing functionality ,<br>(iii)	Ball"s Collaborative Enterprise Environment, and <br>(iv)	Dr. Perry Alexander"s expertise in formal methods, especially adaptation techniques.<br>As a result, this effort will focus on research & development of adaptation techniques since other pieces of the solution either already exist or are being currently developed by our team members. Further, we will use the results of this effort (Phase I and II) to incrementally demonstrate synthesis of a web-based data analysis system.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
eCIS will be sold as a tool suite that provides automated reuse support. The value proposition to the customer will be reduced time-to-deploy which is usually very important to commercial and government customers alike. eCIS will offer a competitive advantage to the Vendors that license it for sale with their software development tools since their tools will be able to offer reuse as a feature as well as Vendors that sell reusable software components. Further, eCIS is equally applicable to hardware systems as well, and therefore applicable to the large embedded systems market.<br><br>In addition to NASA and DoD agencies, our commercial customers are companies that will eventually sell products to end users by leveraging our eCIS technology. Very often, our customers would need our services to customize & integrate our products. We anticipate a market potential of over $ 10M for the eCIS technology.

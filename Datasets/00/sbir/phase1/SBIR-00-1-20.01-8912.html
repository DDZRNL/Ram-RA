<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
An Advanced Capacitor Dielectric Material (ACDM) is proposed.  Technical success will result in capacitors with both dielectric constant and strength values which exceed current polymeric capacitor materials combined with use temperatures >200ºC for NASA advanced capacitor programs.  Molecular modeling has been used to design polymeric materials composed of nano-sized titanate domains incorporated into a high temperature resistant polymeric material.  The resulting material will combine the high dielectric constant of barium titanate and the good electrical properties of polymers into one material but not as a blend  Blends have been tried and have not been successful.  ACDM films have been made which exhibit dielectric constants of 13, exceeding the value for the state-of-the-art capacitor material, polyvinylidene fluoride.
<br>
<br>Research will concentrate on refining the ACDM synthesis and developing new ACDMs that can be processed into high quality films exhibiting high temperature resistance, dielectric constants >20, and low loss factors.  Demonstration capacitor(s) will be fabricated and evaluated by us, our commercial team members, and NASA for proof-of-concept purposes.
<br>
<br>The Phase II program will focus on refinement of Phase I ACDM performance properties for NASA program use, fabrication of prototype capacitors, scale-up, and building a data base for capacitor performance/reliability purposes. (P-00834)

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The aerospace and electronics industry have been increasing the maximum use temperature of electronic devices as vehicles perform at increased speeds and electronic devices decrease in size.  A limit has now been imposed by the lack of high temperature resistant capacitor dielectrics.  The ACDM will find use as high temperature, high energy density storage and filter capacitors in NASA terrestrial and space based programs, as passive components in the microelectronics industry, as implantable defibrillators for the health industry, and as energy storage capacitors for various DoD applications.

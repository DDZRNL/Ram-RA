<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 	Present planetary protection policy specifies maximum biological contamination on spacecraft, dependent on mission type.  Present technologies do not have the sensitivity to measure biological contamination after heat sterilization for Class IVB biologic spacecraft.  Measurements taken prior to heat sterilization using present technology require typically 3 days for validation, thus slowing the assembly process and increasing spacecraft assembly cost and complexity.  
<br>A multiple emission waveband, deep ultraviolet laser induced native fluorescence (UVLINF) detector is proposed for use with present sampling techniques to replace the need to culture samples and reduce the time to less than 8 hours for providing a high level of contaminant identification specificity.  This universal detector can be used with small variations as a core detector in a variety of instrument modalities.  Flow cytometry will be the first of these instrument modalities to be investigated.  This detector will have the ultimately capability to locate, in situ, on the surface of a heat sterilized spacecraft, a single microorganism within an area of 30 square meters in less than 8 hours.  The core technologies proposed for development here are compact, low power consumption, deep UV lasers and dichroic filters needed for band separation at short wavelengths.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 	A large commercial opportunity has been demonstrated for lasers and instrument methodologies being proposed for development under this SBIR program.  The applications include DNA sequencing, clinical instruments, quality and proof testing in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical, manufactured food and chemical industry products, testing of water and air quality, biological and chemical warfare agent and bomb residue detection and in a wide range of research applications.  Many of these applications are suited to other NASA mission requirements.  
<br>	Ultraviolet source radiance is a major technical driver for UV Raman and laser induced native fluorescence detectors used in a wide range of commercial instruments.  A compact, low power, low cost laser emitting in the deep UV can enable 10 orders of magnitude improvement in signal to noise of biological materials in resonance Raman spectrometers and eliminates the need for dye derivatization and problems associated with tagging of complex analytes in capillary electrophoresis, high performance liquid chromatography and other analytical instruments.  
<br>	The commercial goal of this development is to offer the analytical instrument market a new family of deep UV sources which provide a million-fold improvement in source radiance at essentially the same cost, size, and weight of present incoherent source systems.

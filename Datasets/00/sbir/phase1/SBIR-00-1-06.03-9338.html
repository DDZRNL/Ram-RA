<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Very light sensors having a fast response time are required for making direct, non-intrusive measurements in a rocket or jet engine environment for precise control. In order to monitor key physical parameters in this environment, it will be necessary to develop new concepts in sensor design to measure such parameters as temperature. Fiber optic sensors offer a possible solution to this problem. Lasergenics Corporation is proposing to investigate single crystal fibers of YAG, spinel and yttria doped with neodymium and dysprosium for this application. This material can withstand the harsh environment that will exist at temperatures as high as 2300 degrees C. The temperature will be determined by measuring the fluorescent decay time as a function of temperature using the phase shift method. This concept will be tested during the Phase I effort. For the Phase II effort we will determine sensor and data transmission link designcharacteristics usable in this environment and fabricate and test a breadboard.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 This program can result in a new concept for fiber optic sensors for high temperatures in harsh environments such as rocket and jet engines. Such a sensor can result in important savings in fuel, maintenance and repair costs because of more precise control. They could find application in process control in steel, chemical and semiconductor industries, in power generation plants, in plasma, fusion, MHD, combustion and chemical research.

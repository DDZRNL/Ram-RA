<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR> Syntactic Titanium Foam Propellant tank <BR>
<P>
<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 This Phase I SBIR program will result in the availability of a high strength, closed cell titanium foam material suitable for fabricating propellant tank structures.  The resulting titanium foams are predicted to have >350Mpa strengths at densitied <2.4g/cc, while providing combined structural/thermal insulation functions.  Through a teaming arrangement, suitability for propellant tank fabrication will be verified through testing.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 The syntactic titanium foams produced in this program will provide a much needed technical solution to reusable launch vehicle conformal tank fabrication problems.  Commercial applications for deep sea vehicles, off-shore structures, and sporting equipment will also be pursued.

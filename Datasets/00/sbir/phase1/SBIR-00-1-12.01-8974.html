<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR> Next-Generation Collaboration Tools to Support Telescience and Outreach <BR>
<P>
<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovation is a set of next-generation collaboration tools and techniques utilizing standard Internet Protocols (IP).  The primary use is to support "24 x 7" mission operations and telescience; secondary use includes education and public outreach.  Existing first-generation "24 x 7" IP-based collaboration systems such as the International Space Station (ISS) Internet Voice Distribution System (IVoDS) are limited to audio-only conferencing.  They replicate the functionality of legacy business telephony-based systems. Our goal is to incorporate the power of the personal computer, Internet, multimedia, and videoconferencing into these systems.
<br>
<br>Phase I will test those technologies that promise to dramatically increase the effectiveness of performing telescience.  Four collaboration areas have been identified: audio, video, conference management, and application sharing. Representative tasks and metrics for collaboration performance monitoring will be developed.  Candidate capabilities will be prototyped and tested utilizing ground-based experimenter and educational groups. 
<br>
<br>In Phase II the most promising capabilities will be incorporated into a prototype CONTACT system and tested with larger groups, including researchers performing "live" ISS telescience and NASA Quest educational audiences.  The prototype system will be interfaced to IVoDS, demonstrating techniques for providing unsecured secondary users limited access to secure telescience conferences.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The immediate market is hundreds of International Space Station experiment telescience users over the next decade.  Additional markets are other NASA missions, as well as military and commercial systems such as air traffic control.   Several of the techniques may be applicable to business/consumer market.  For example, the capability to monitor multiple conferences may be very helpful to a future AOL Instant Messenger user deciding which of several audio chat rooms to join.

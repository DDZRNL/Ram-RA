<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
As the sophistication of the modern electronics grows, there is an interest in developing wide band gap semiconductor and molecular electronics.  In the past a few years, many studies were conducted to research the feasibility of using Single-Walled and Multi-Walled Nanotubes as molecular electronic devices.  Theoretical calculation and modeling indicated that Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) exhibit both metallic and semiconductor characteristics.  While great advances have been made in recent years, fabricating CNT based devices involves low yield deposition and lengthy purification process, which makes molecular electronics virtually impossible.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Applied Sciences, Inc. (ASI) has conducted extensive research in fabricating Vapor Grown Carbon Fiber (VGCF) and CNT.  Currently, ASI, has a pilot production line mass-producing CNT of the average size of 50 nm.  Utilizing our expertise in CNT fabrication, we propose a new deposition method, which combines hydrocarbon pyrolitic technique and laser ablation technique to produce CNT junctions directly on Si wafer without purification process.  If successful this research can eventually lead to the realization of molecular electronics.

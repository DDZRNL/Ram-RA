<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 It is proposed to develop a directional solidification system equipped with a novel sensor to maintain a separation gap between the crucible containing the charge and the solidifying charge.  The interaction of crucible wall and the solidifying charge during growth of single crystals of electronics materials is known to influence generation of a myriad of defects with concomitant deleterious effect on the performance of these materials in device structures ranging from detectors to telecommunication equipment.  The goal of this proposal is to develop the enabling technology for sensor-based feedback controlled growth of detached semiconductor crystals.  The Phase I of this activity will focus on development of the sensor.  The Phase II work will focus on integration of this sensor into a modified Bridgman system, development of the control algorithm, and growth of semiconductor crystals in the developed system.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 Reduction of defects generated by the interaction of the charge with the crucible will significantly increase the yield of commercial production of electronic materials as well as their properties.  The commercial materials producers are expected to embrace a system that can achieve detached or partially detached growth of semiconductor crystals.

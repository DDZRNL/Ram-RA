<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A 150W fuel cell power generator is proposed using Physical Sciences Inc.'s tubular proton exchange membrane technology to provide power to an astronaut during extravehicular activities.  The generator will operate for 12 hours at 12 V and have an energy density of 250 W-hr/kg, approximately 2.5 times higher than state-of-the-art batteries.  The  hydrogen fuel will be stored in metal hydrides packed into the microtubular membrane and electrode assemblies.  This integrated approach eliminates an external storage tank and helps remove waste heat from the fuel cell via the endothermic hydrogen release.  The incorporation of a metal hydride directly into the fuel cell can reduce the system mass by up to 70% using our tubular fuel cell technology.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The major benefits of the proposed energy storage design are higher power and specific energy densities than are attainable using batteries.  Successful development of this energy storage system will find widespread use for power generation in portable tools, communication equipment, and remote and emergency power applications.

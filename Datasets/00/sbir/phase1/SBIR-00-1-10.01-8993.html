<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Los Gatos Research has developed a new technique for absorption based spectroscopic analysis of gas samples for use in the analysis of confined atmospheric samples for the build up of trace level contaminants.  This new capability is being developed for applications in the near-infrared using established InGaAs infrared laser sources, which provide the sensitivity and low power consumption needed for long duration space applications.  The innovation we are developing is based in the sample cell and signal analysis end of such instruments, as well as in the fiber-coupling scheme employed.  The net result of our innovation is an increase in sample analysis path length of one thousand to ten thousand times that achievable using standard optical techniques.  Using our new cell technology, the user is essentially free to employ traditional laser modulation techniques and data analysis as long as the light source frequency modulation remains less than 1 GHz.  We will demonstrate the new absorption analysis technique at wavelengths of ~1.33 microns in Phase I and demonstrate that the approach can be used with sensitive low power sources such as InGaAs lasers.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 The absorption instrument under development at LGR will be used in commercial and research applications for trace chemical analysis and diagnosis of air environments.  Medical usage in the real-time monitoring of respiration gas is also under development as the current approach can provide the low system cost required for such use.

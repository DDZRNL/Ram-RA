<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This work will focus on evaluating lower cost PIP processing of C-SiC composites for thick-section and large volume components such as blisk turbomachinery, nozzles, ramps, thrust chambers, ducting and other hot structures. A significant barrier to using composites in these applications involves processing limitations with respect to part size and volume.  Processing routes utilizing chemical vapor deposition/infiltration (CVD/CVI) require high-temperature pressure reactors and rely on time/temperature dependent diffusion.  As a result, CVD/CVI facility reactor dimensions limits the maximum part size while process physics limit the practical thickness/volume of parts to be infiltrated.  Polymer infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) processing may overcome such limitations.  Although significant development has been done in the PIP processing of SiC/SiC systems, little work has been done with PIP C/SiC CMCs.  Insufficient data and material properties exist for PIP processed thick cross section parts, which has hindered acceptance and application of this process.  The work proposed here provides a baseline mechanical property database for PIP processed C-SiC CMCs, and provides the initial evaluation of thick section composites processed using the PIP approach and incorporating the latest advancements in process cost and schedule reductions.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 The results of this program will be immediately applicable to on-going work of Boeing Rocketdyne Propulsion & Power for the RS-2200 Linear Aerospike Engine system for the second generation of reusable launch vehicles (RLV) and for Rockwell Science Center’s work on the NASA Composite Nozzle Ramp program.  An increased understanding of PIP processed materials, and demonstration of large volume and thick section PIP processing will extend the application of this lightweight, high temperature material system into other areas currently under development, such as turbomachininery (turbine blisks and stators), nozzles, thrust chambers, ducting and other hot structures.  This work also sets the stage for potential use of PIP processed CMC materials for third generation spacecraft propulsion systems including RBCC and solar thermal propulsion systems.

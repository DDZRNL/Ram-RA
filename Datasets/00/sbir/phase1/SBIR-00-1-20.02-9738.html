<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR> Thermally Resistant Catalytic System for Monopropellant Ignition <BR>

<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 This proposed Phase I addresses the catalytic ignition of monopropellants using solid solutions of metal oxides rationally selected from materials possessing functionalities amenable to the initiation of ignition as well as imparting thermal stability to the materials. It is anticipated that these metal oxide catalysts will readily ignite ionic monopropellants such as ammonium nitrate or hydroxyl ammonium nitrate (HAN) but will be thermally stable, resistant to sintering and loss of activity at high temperature and will be available at low cost.  Incorporation of active metals into the crystal structure will result in high long life catalyst activity in part as a consequence of the high dispersion of these sites.  Phase I will consist of the coarse screening of 18 - 24 catalysts representing a spectrum of compositions from a general composition anticipated to possess a refractory nature in addition to ignition activity.  Identification of preferred variants will be followed by their optimization. Use in high specific impulse systems or long life thrusters is anticipated.  These catalysts are expected to possess high activity not only for these ignitions, but also for catalytic combustion.  Phase II would consist of extensive testing and optimization of preferred catalysts and application in model thrusters.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 Catalysts to result from completion of this program will find application for ignition of monopropellants in rockets as well as for the catalytic combustion of effluents originating from incinerators and combustion sources.  Use of the catalysts for combustion of propellants in gas turbines and other power generators is another promising application.  These materials will also be of potential utility for the removal of VOCs and nitrogen oxides from gaseous effluent streams. The materials would be of interest to the military as well as aerospace and waste disposal industries.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Microcosm proposes to develop and validate a guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C) package to perform fully autonomous rendezvous and docking operations applicable to Mars orbit or other planetary missions.  Phase I will apply Microcosm’s current autonomous GN&C systems, including autonomous orbit transfer algorithms and optical navigation systems for coarse Martian orbit transfer, and develop the control algorithms for fine rendezvous and docking maneuvers based on relative navigation and attitude sensing.  The algorithms well be validated in AttSim™, Microcosm’s high fidelity attitude and trajectory simulator.  Requirements for a suite of optical and radar relative navigation sensors will be defined and modeled as part of the simulation.  A critical element of Phase I is to design an expert control system capable of making real-time mission critical decisions, identifying abort and recovery scenarios, and balancing mission success with fuel optimization.  Microcosm’s State Machine™ will be used to design the expert system.  An autonomous rendezvous and docking simulation, including a standard docking scenario and an abort scenario, will be delivered upon completion of Phase I.  Phase II will result in an autonomous rendezvous and docking GN&C system, ready for flight coding and implementation.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 There is great potential for this technology to substantially lower the cost and extend the life of LEO science and defense related missions as well as GEO communications satellites.  The lifetime of a LEO satellite is limited primarily by atmospheric drag.  A virtually unlimited supply of fuel could be transferred to LEO satellites, indefinitely, for station keeping purposes.  High priced defense programs (e.g. SBIRS Low and SBL) and science missions (e.g. HST and TOPEX) would no longer be fuel limited if they could support satellite docking and refueling.  GEO satellites pay a high premium for station keeping fuel.  If GEO satellites where able to refuel, their payload mass fraction could be increased substantially at launch.  This option is particularly attractive due to the relatively large number of launches per year into GTO.  Re-fueling missions could be made small enough to fit as a secondary payload aboard the ASAP ring of the Ariane 5, for example, further increasing the cost efficacy of on-orbit servicing.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The realization of future space transportation systems and hypersonic aircraft will need the use of ceramic matrix composites that are economical and can withstand high thermomechanical and aerodynamical loads. Advanced Ceramics Research, Inc. (ACR) has recently developed a rapid prototyping process for its patented C3 continuous fiber reinforced ceramic composites for high temperature applications. The process is simple, robust and is widely applicable to a number of CMC materials. In the proposed Phase I program, ACR proposes to leverage this rapid prototyping approach for CMC’s to produce fully dense lightweight turbomachinery components having capability to operate in hot hydrogen and oxygen environments. The process after scale-up will be capable of producing uniform densities in thick CMC components.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The rapid prototyping technology developed under this program has tremendous commercial potential for both government and the commercial industries. The development of a low-cost technology for rapid prototyping of complex, thick high-temperature ceramic composite components will have far reaching implications in heat engine systems, rocket propulsion systems, and other energy conservation systems. The materials and the technology have potential applications in combustors, hot gas ducts, exhaust flaps, first stage vanes, heat exchangers etc.

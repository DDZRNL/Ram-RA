<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR> Multiple Configuration Space Environment (MCSE) <BR>
<P>
<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 The offerer proposes to develop an innovative Multiple Configuration Space Environment (MCSE) through application of a proven design methodology with staff/consultant capabilities.  The process will define a set of mission driven reconfigurable habitat components plus a development tool set for use by NASA and others to employ MCSEs in future applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 In addition to known and stated NASA applications, such a habitat technology would be useful to designers of aquatic craft, advanced submersibles, aircraft, survival shelters and architects to name a few.  The concept taken in its most simple form may provide techniques for habitat development in severely depressed or resource limited countries.

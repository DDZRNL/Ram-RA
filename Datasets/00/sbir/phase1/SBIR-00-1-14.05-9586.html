<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Planar antenna systems such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Waveguides offer a sophisticated method of providing transmit/receive communications for spacecraft. They have the significant advantage in space of being electronically steerable.  From the mechanical viewpoint, the advantage of the tensioned membrane planar concept, in addition to its ultra-lightweight and low packaged volume, is its inherent shape. Relative to parabolic antennas, the requirement to make an accurate doubly curved surface is removed. L’Garde is currently working in this area to develop lightweight planar technologies utilizing inflatable and thin film deployable methods.
<br>
<br>The purpose of this SBIR phase I is to study and identify the structural and rigidization issues specific to the support structure, and address the packaging and deployment issues for this class of planar antenna. Further, to determine the major factors affecting performance, and develop a comprehensive test methodology and plan to fully address these issues. This test plan will be developed and structured so that the most relevant variables influencing system performance will be addressed. Completion of this SBIR will develop the final technology necessary to bring this concept to fruition, that of the ultra-lightweight inflatably deployed rigidizable structures required to deploy and support tensioned membrane planar antennas.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The commercial applications of the Waveguide concept are immense. The lightweight and simplicity of the concept, coupled with the geometric precision of the planar array, will find many applications in the fields of space based radar, radiometry, and communications

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Deep space optical communications requires a laser source and modulation technique for high data bandwidth with low power consumption, diffraction-limited beam quality, and the absolute minimal size/weight. Optical fibers are compact and can efficiently amplify high data rate diode lasers, but do not provide the peak power required for detection over deep space transmit distances. Bulk diode-pumped solid-state lasers can produce the required Q-switched pulse energies, but are not as efficient or robust as guided-wave lasers. Furthermore, bulk lasers require a high voltage Q-switch to accurately time the laser pulses for pulse-position modulation (PPM) formats. Coherent Technologies, Inc. has recently discovered a new waveguide laser geometry that allows TEM00 operation in a multi-transverse mode waveguide capable of high power operation. This geometry is exceptionally compact/lightweight and capable of high conversion efficiency as is typically achieved in fiber lasers. Furthermore, this same technology can be applied to create low voltage (~ 15 V) Q-switches or phase modulators resulting in a nearly monolithic optical communications transmitter. The waveguide laser transmitter is compatible with a variety of data encoding formats, could be used with direct or coherent detection receivers, and will be capable of data rates in excess of 10 Mbps.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Significant commercial opportunity exists for both the component-level technology and the free-space communication architecture. Waveguide lasers power scale beyond the limit of fiber lasers and will outperform bulk lasers at high power continuous-wave and pulsed energy applications due to their compact size and high efficiency. Low voltage waveguide electro-optic modulators will replace free space modulators in many applications. Free-space optical communications is finding niche applications where fiber communications are not feasible.

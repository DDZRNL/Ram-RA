Cool-Wall Vortex Combustion Chamber (CWVCC)<BR>

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
ORBITEC proposes to develop an innovative, cool-wall rocket engine combustion 
chamber that confines propellant mixing and burning to the inner region of a coaxial 
vortex flow field. The outer region of the flow field prevents the hot combustion 
products from contacting the wall. Though the chamber walls are subject to radiant 
heat transfer, one of the propellants provides effective wall cooling to prevent 
thermal degradation of the chamber. The Cool-Wall Vortex Combustion Chamber (CWVCC) 
offers several advantages over conventional liquid rocket engine designs. Avoiding 
severe thermal cycling of the chamber will extend chamber lifetime and allow for 
simple, lightweight, low-cost chamber designs. The vortex acts as an effective 
flame holder and may prevent combustion instability. The spinning vortices also 
provide an extended flow path much longer than the geometric length of the chamber. 
The chamber length may thus be reduced for a<br>
significant weight savings. The enhanced shear mixing should produce high combustion 
efficiencies. Engines featuring this technology should offer high reusability, 
high performance, long life, and low cost. Phase I will include numerical flow 
field analysis, lab-scale engine design, fabrication, parametric hot-fire testing 
using oxygen and hydrogen, data analysis, and large-scale preliminary engine designs 
for Phase II.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The ultimate goal of this technology is aimed at improving liquid rocket and RBCC 
engine heat transfer capability, lifetime, reusability, and thrust-to-weight ratio. 
Simplifying engine manufacture and lowering operational costs represent further 
benefits. Second and third generation launch vehicles will benefit from these 
improvements. The end product of the overall research and development program 
will have application to sounding rockets, single-stage-to-orbit vehicles, and 
other reusable and expendable launch vehicles and upper stages for Earth orbit 
and planetary ascent and descent applications. The advantages of the CWVCC may 
also make it an attractive technology for combined-cycle vehicles, hypersonic 
space planes, and airbreathing engines such as ramjets and rocket ejectors. Near-term 
military applications include: high-speed and/or high altitude target drones, 
cruise missile propulsion, interceptors, and forward observation craft propulsion. 
In addition to these applications, this new type of vortex combustion may have 
significant industrial benefits. For example, many classes of air-fired combustors 
can use the CWVCC technology for improved combustion efficiency, extended lifetime, 
and potentially reduced emissions.

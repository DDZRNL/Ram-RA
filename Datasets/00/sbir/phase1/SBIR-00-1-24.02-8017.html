<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to design, build, and validate a novel architecture for designing and managing human-centered work systems.  Key innovations include (i) novel enabling technology for human-centered work system design, (ii) adaptive architecture for life-cycle integrated work management, and (iii) agent-based mechanisms for work execution status monitoring and control.  The proposed solution, a Toolkit for Enabling Analysis and Modeling of Adaptive Work (TEAMWORK), will facilitate the following: (i) modeling work from human, technical, and business perspectives, (ii) performing work system design trades using simulation, (iii) enacting the work using workflow technology, and (iv) monitoring work status and triggering work redesign using software agents.  The Phase I project will develop and demonstrate a prototype TEAMWORK that will establish the technical viability of the innovation.  Phase II will (i) harden and scale up the innovation by developing a focused, NASA-specific TEAMWORK application and (ii) commercialize TEAMWORK.  The proposed innovations address NASA’s requirements for a “design approach that integrates computational systems with human performance and capabilities, such that the total system amplifies, corrects, and leverages the capabilities of both people and machines.”   TEAMWORK also provides a process-oriented knowledge management solution for multi-disciplinary, collaborating, distributed NASA project teams.

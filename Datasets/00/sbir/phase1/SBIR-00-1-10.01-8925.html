<P>
<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Current space water reclamation systems require resupply and expendable use that are too large for long duration remote space applications such as Mars expeditions and lunar bases. We propose development of a novel jet-induced cavitation process for water reclamation that would be lightweight, low maintenance, reliable, and require little or no expendables. 
<br>
<br>Cavitation is known to produce reactions in water resulting in organic compound oxidation. We have demonstrated that jet-induced cavitation can oxidize selected organic compounds with two orders of magnitude greater energy efficiency than other methods such as ultrasonics. 
<br>
<br>We propose to utilize jet cavitation to accomplish three water reclamation functions for advanced space life support: total organic carbon (TOC) reduction, microorganism reduction, and oxygenation. Phase I will investigate the feasibility of using jet cavitation for these three functions. Phase II will consider a broader range of contaminants and microorganisms, a detailed parametric study to obtain optimization relations, and issues of integration into a space based life support system.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Successful completion of the proposed effort will produce a new state of the art technology for the treatment and disinfection of wastewater resulting in a high efficiency advanced life support water reclamation system for long duration remote space applications. It could be directly utilized in all manned space applications. Its other potential applications are vast. It could provide a simple economical means of organic wastewater treatment and drinking water disinfection without the potential hazards of chlorination by-products.  There is a growing need for such technology throughout the world as the demand for potable water supplies increases and the available supply decreases.

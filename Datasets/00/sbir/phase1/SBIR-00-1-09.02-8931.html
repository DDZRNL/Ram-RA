<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Conventional fluorescence-activated cell sorters (FACSs) are widely used to study eukaryotic cell populations.  Although they provide impressively efficient sorting, they are costly, mechanically complex, and require large sample volumes and trained personnel for operation and maintenance.  In addition, the footprint per unit separation is considerable and they typically require large input populations.  Inexpensive devices that rapidly sort live cell, particles and even single molecules would greatly facilitate screening of combinatorial chemical, biochemical or biological libraries taking advantage of the enormous power of in vitro evolution.  Moreover, such devices would have wide applications in clinical medicine and basic research.  Current systems are also not well suited for use in low gravity environments or impose a significant cost in payload size and weight.  Agave BioSystems proposes to develop a miniature flow cytometer/ fluorescent cell sorter (nanoSort) based on a novel micropumping system with an integrated optical waveguide that will eliminate these shortcomings.  The microfabricated system will be ideal for use in low gravity environments as well as typical laboratory settings and will be both compact and lightweight.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 This flow cytometry technology is valuable to scientists in academia, government and industry for a number of research and biomedical applications.  Because of the enormous potential of cells display libraries to generate valuable binding proteins, we expect this market to be a major user of this technology.  Further, the use of nanoSort for reagent and drug discovery purposes has great potential and can provide a critical edge in the discovery of promising new lead compounds.

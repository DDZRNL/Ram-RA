<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Q-Peak, Inc. proposes to develop an efficient, single-frequency, diffraction-limited, 10-W-average-power laser source at 349 nm for use as a Lidar transmitter for direct-detection measurements of winds. The laser source proposed will be based on a compact, cw diode-pumped, high-pulse-repetition-rate, Q-switched Nd:YLF laser. The laser will be injection-seeded using a single-frequency, cw diode-pumped, 10-mW Nd:YLF laser developed by Q-Peak. The system will feature intracavity tripling to convert the near-IR output of the Q-switched Nd:YLF laser into the UV. Due to the use of both diode pumping and intracavity conversion, the electrical efficiency of the proposed source is substantially higher than that of lasers now used in the wind profiling lidar systems. High repetition rates (5 – 10 kHz) allows the possibility of reducing the data acquisition time. Single-frequency, short pulses (20-30 nsec) allows for a high accuracy and high range resolution.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 The development of the proposed technology, high-efficiency intracavity conversion in the Nd:YLF diode-pumped lasers, is expected to advance the state of the art in solid-state laser technology with further applications in material processing, in particular, the laser would be a low cost pulsed UV source for via drilling, stereolithography and precision micro-machining applications.

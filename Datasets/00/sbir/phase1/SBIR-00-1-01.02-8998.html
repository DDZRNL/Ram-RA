<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 The electrostatic atomization of hydrocarbon fuels provides precise, predictable electronic control of droplet size and distribution independent of fuel viscosity, density and flow rate.  Phase I will focus on demonstrating that electrostatic fuel preparation makes combustion performance in an ambient combustion environment insensitive to the presence of anti-misting fuel additive (FM-9).  A hybrid Lean Direct Injection nozzle incorporating electrostatic primary fuel flow atomization for ignition, idle and low power operation, and conventional air assisted secondary flow atomization for high throughput operation will be developed for these tests.
<br>
<br>Phase I testing will focus on evaluating the ability of electrostatic fuel preparation of anti-misting kerosene to provide superior atomization/dispersion under the low flow rate conditions (ignition, idle, low power) that have heretofore been associated with poor atomization performance from conventional systems.  Upon conclusion of testing, the atomizer will be delivered to NASA for evaluation testing with appropriate AMK blends in the combustion test facility.  Nozzles will be designed and developed for engine combustion in Phase II.  General Electric, Pratt & Whitney, and Honeywell have expressed interest in supporting the Phase II test program.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 Contingent upon successful completion of the Phase I effort, commitments in excess of $500,000 for Phase III development have been obtained from eleven (11) fuel injector and combustion equipment manufacturers.  Long term production outlook for the Phase II fuel injector and its derivatives sis on the order of thousands of injectors per year.  Additional funded development potential from non-aviation industries (agriculture, IC engines (gas and diesel), paint spraying, domestic, commercial and industrial burners, spray mist lubrication and nano-fiber non-woven fabric manufacture) all of which require high throughput electrostatic atomization/dispersal, is significantly greater than the typical SBIR.

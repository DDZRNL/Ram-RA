<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR> A Real-Time Monitor to Predict Loss of Control due to Pilot-Induced Oscillations <BR>
<P>
<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Pilot-induced oscillations have occurred during early development testing and in operational flight.  As awareness of the phenomenon improves, reports of PIOs have become more common, and while most such reports indicate mild episodes, the threat of a severe PIO is always present.  With increased use of fly-by-wire technology, and with plans for several possible mega-transports, the potential for PIO will only continue to increase.  An on-line flight control system monitor that will detect the onset of loss of control due to PIO will enhance flight safety in the 21st century.  The real-time monitor looks at input and response states and compares the input/output relationships with known definitions of PIO.  A pilot alert system will notify the flight crew that the event is a PIO and assist in decision-making about the criticality of the event.  Such a monitor will benefit pre-production testing as well, as it can be used for envelope expansion, quick-look analysis of stability margins, and even for crew training for PIO idenfication.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The primary commercial application will be for civil airline transports, marketed to airframe manufacturers and airline companies as an affordable method for preventing loss of control through severe pilot-induced oscillations.  The system will be designed to be incorporated into the flight control system computers of both current and future aircraft.  Other applications, in both the civil and military worlds, is as a tool for flight safety during envelope expansion and as an analyzer of data near-real-time for checking stability.  The monitor can be used as a training aid to expose pilots to the phenomenon of pilot-induced oscillations.

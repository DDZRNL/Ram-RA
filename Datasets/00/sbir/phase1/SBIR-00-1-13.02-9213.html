<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Los Gatos Research has developing a new technique for absorption based spectroscopic analysis of gas samples for use in atmospheric analysis.  This absorption capability will be developed for applications in the near-infrared using established InGaAs infrared laser sources, however it can be easily employed with any of several new continuous infrared light sources such as cw-OPO, difference frequency sources, and the new Quantum Cascade diode lasers.  The innovation we are developing is based in the sample cell and signal analysis end of such instruments.  The net result of our innovation is an increase in sample analysis path length of one thousand to ten thousand times.  Using our new cell technology, the user is essentially free to employ traditional laser modulation techniques and data analysis as long as the light source frequency modulation remains less than 1 GHz.  We will demonstrate the new absorption analysis technique at wavelengths of ~1.33 microns in Phase I and demonstrate that the approach can be used with sensitive low power sources such as InGaAs lasers.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 The absorption instrument proposed here has significant commercial and research potential for applications in airborne chemical analysis and diagnosis.  Additionally, the technology also holds great promise for applications in the characterization of liquid and solid state media such as solvents and in trace analysis.

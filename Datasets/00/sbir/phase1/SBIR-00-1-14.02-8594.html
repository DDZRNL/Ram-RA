<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A new generation of Ka-band helical traveling wave tube (TWT) power amplifiers with efficiencies of over 60% will be developed.  The dramatic increase in efficiency over current state-of-the-art amplifiers with about 45% efficiency will be achieved by the introduction of a novel taper to suppress all parasitic power flow, the elimination of severs, and new approaches for the minimization of circuit losses.   These innovations will lead to large reductions in power requirements, circuit size, and system weight, and will result in enormous cost savings for launch and operation of communication satellites.  The proposed technology development promises to provide the biggest contribution to efficiency enhancement in helical TWTs since the introduction of velocity tapers some 35 years ago and will enable high frequency digital broadband communications for near-Earth and deep-space missions with multi-gigabit-per-second data rates.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Helical traveling wave tubes are the power amplifiers of choice in satellites for telecommunications, data transmission, broadcasting, and radar mapping.  High frequency, high data rate digital communications and high power broadband electronic countermeasures are the primary space applications for our new technology.  Additional high volume applications are in satellite ground stations, phased array antennas, microwave power modules, radar for air traffic control and weather forecasting, and medical as well as scientific areas.  The successful development of a new generation of helical TWTs with very high efficiencies will significantly increase the global competitiveness of the U.S. power tube industry.

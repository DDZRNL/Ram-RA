<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Knowledge generation is one of the keys to an organization's long-term viability, not to mention its competitiveness.  Knowledge generation includes the creation of new ideas, the recognition of new patterns, the synthesis of disparate concepts, and the development of new processes.  We propose a new approach to scientific knowledge generation and amplification that draws on the synergy amongst multiple distinct technologies that have individually proved to be extremely valuable in knowledge management.  We intend to enliven the knowledge representation and assimilation technique called Concept Mapping with novel information retrieval and natural language processing technologies.  In particular, we propose to utilize recent advances in automated thesaurus development and novel query construction techniques to semi-autonomously fuel the concept mapping process.  The resulting system, Farsight, will act as an integrated knowledge elicitation, assimilation, codification, and sharing device.  Farsight will benefit NASA by enhancing the ability of their scientists and engineers (and those of their partners) to better understand new and/or challenging concepts and push the scientific envelope.  The prototype tool developed in conjunction with our Phase I user studies will form the basis for the Phase II development of a complete integrated knowledge amplification system.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 Farsight represents a novel knowledge amplification technique that will improve problem solving and knowledge sharing capabilities.  The market for this technology is extremely large and continues to grow as more corporations recognize the need for knowledge management.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 We propose the application of sublimation purification technology (SPT) to the recovery of water from solid wastes which originate from functions of the spacecraft life support system.  We will apply SPT to the purification of simulated solid waste media (SWM)which has a well characterized composition and morphology.  SPT is a physical process and does not involve the consumption of any resources except energy.  SPT recovers the maximum amount of water because it reduces the wastes to a solid dry material as opposed to a concentrated solution.  The recovered water is of high purity.  The solid residues should have many desirable properties including very low moisture content, very low yield strength, and high surface area.  Since solid residues will be low in moisture, incineration of the solid residue can be achieved using a minimum energy input.  In the proposed work SPT performance data will obtained from SWM as a function of varying processing conditions.  We will examine the feasibility of applying SPT to the space flight environment and investigate how SPT will be integrated into existing and planned space flight specific life support subsystem components.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 SPT has been developed for extreme applications including the purification of waters from evaporator bottoms bearing plutonium and uranium salts.  The principal investigator has applied SPT to the production of high purity water and solvents for use in proprietary industrial applications.  Applications to the space environment presents certain problems which are fundamental in nature to those encountered during the production of pico-pure liquids.  Resolution of those problems will allow water recovery recycle and reuse systems for long duration space to operate more efficiently, with greater potable water yield, and will allow SPT to be more cost effectively applied to terrestrial purification problems.

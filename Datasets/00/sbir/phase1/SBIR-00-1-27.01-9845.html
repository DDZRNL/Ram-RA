<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovation is a connector with mechanical, electrical and
<br>environmental sealing capability that will enable the installation and
<br>removal of major components, subassemblies and sensors by autonomous robotic vehicles allowing remote repair, replacement, and reconfiguration. The innovative features are the combination and integration of several different elements into a compact package to allow the transfer of signal, power, mechanical force between the vehicle and the component. This would provide a robotic vehicle the means to replace worn motor assemblies and components, or exchange science instruments at the lander or depot facility and even jettison malfunctioning components, wheels or wheel assemblies in the field. A connector with the major elements will be delivered at the end of Phase 1. During Phase 2 a set of connectors suitable of use in a simulated environment will be delivered for testing.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The potential commercial applications for this connector system will allow
<br>the next generation of mobile robots to reconfigure themselves. One industry that will benefit is the nuclear energy industry. Trained personnel without being exposed to potentially lethal radiation levels cannot repair robots used in radioactive areas.

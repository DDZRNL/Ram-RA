<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 We propose to develop single-mode DFB lasers at 1.8 to 2.2 um based on InGaAsP materails at room temperature with a linewidth of 0.1 to 0l.2 MHz. MBE regrowth technology will be used for the grating. We will also study the device reliability. A compact mid-IR single mode laser could be extremely useful for the enviromental monitoring and pollutant sensing. We have a lot of experience in the IR lasers and demonstrated single-mode type-II interband-cascade (IC) laser with single-frequency mode operation with an output power > 5 mW at 4.5 um, and type-II SL lasers from 2.5 to 4.1 um. An operation temperature of 260 K was achieved for a 2.9-um type-II SL laser. The peak output power per facet exceeds 800 mW at 100 K, and 200 mW at 200 K with a threshold current density of 1.1 kA/cm2. Operation at 286 K was achieved for 3.6 um IC lasers. An external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 580% was achieved for a 4.5-um IC laser at 80K. 
<br>
<br>	The Phase I effort will be directed towards the demonstration of the single-mode DFB InGaAsP lasers at 1.8 to 2.2 um at high temperature.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 Critical military needs include lidar and remote chemical sensing for defense against biological/chemical warfare, eye-safe covert illumination, and free-space communications. Commercial markets include leak detection, chemical process control, remote chemical sensing for atmospheric pollution and drug monitoring, IR spectroscopy, and medical analyses. With the development of room-temperature single-mode tunable DFB lasers, this program should considerably accelerate the huge potential needs of the defense and commercial applications.

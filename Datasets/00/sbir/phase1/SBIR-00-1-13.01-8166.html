<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Tropical, temperate, and glaciated littoral zones differ widely in character and time variability. Their study and characterization requires high spatial resolution and repeated measurement which may be accomplished from remotely piloted, manned, or other atmospheric vehicles. MEDECO proposes the development of an aperture stabilized, miniature hyperspectral imaging interferometer sensitive between 400 and 2500 nm. The transition zone DASI or TZ-DASI, will be a new, high throughput variant of the digital array scanned interferometers MEDECO has previously used in RPAs and has the necessary characteristics for light aircraft and remotely piloted aircraft application, as well as in situ use. The sensor will provide superb hyperspectral imagery for the definition and characterization of the transition boundaries of land and water (littoral zone) scenes. The hyperspectral data from this sensor will be processed using calibration and signal extraction methods developed specifically under this effort for the TZ-DASI .

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 Numerous applications of these technologies in medicine, biology, geology, oceanography, and agriculture have been identified and all will benefit from the analysis and algorithms to be developed here. These include medical sensing and monitoring, atmospheric sciences (cloud effects on climate via scattering, absorption) and biogeochemical remote sensing (plant canopy, geochemical remote sensing, volcanic and industrial plume monitoring, site surveillance and toxic species monitoring).
<br>	The study of the demixing methods for Earth science applications is directed towards biological, agricultural, and mineralogical evaluation of diverse regions of the Earth, as well as the littoral zone. The successful development of a demixing method that is real or near-real time and reliable can lead to the realization of a data product interpretable by suitably knowledgeable users. Such a data product can lead to potential commercial applications to hyperspectral imaging in mineral exploration, agricultural and biosphere assessments, and urban planning and development.

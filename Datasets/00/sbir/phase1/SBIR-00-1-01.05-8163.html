<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This project will develop a practical, nondestructive inspection technique for the detection of corrosion hidden under the reusable surface insulation tiles found in thermal protection systems. This technique is based on an innovative use of x-ray interactions to discriminate low levels of corrosion from airframe structural materials, such as magnesium, aluminum, and titanium alloys.  A second innovation in detection greatly speeds up the measurement and reduces the cost.  This results in an accurate measurement of low level corrosion at rates approaching a few seconds point.  Phase I will empirically demonstrate the sensitivity and throughput using a breadboard instrument and realistic thermal protection system configurations. Phase II will develop a prototype of the instrument and demonstrate the ability to inspect large areas for hidden corrosion.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 This project is targeted to meet the needs of NASA and direct opportunities exist to support the Orbiter program as well as the development underway in the X33 and X38 programs.  Significant opportunities for the technique exist within commercial and military aviation for the detection of corrosion in aging aircraft.

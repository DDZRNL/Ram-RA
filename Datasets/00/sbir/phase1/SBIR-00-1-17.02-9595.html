<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The objective of this SBIR is to investigate the feasibility of constructing grazing incidence x-ray mirror replicas from nanolaminate composite technology.  Nanolaminates are constructed by vacuum depositing thousands of thin alternating coating layers.  Structural laminates have been recently constructed this way by depositing these layers on a rotating drum within a vacuum chamber.  By utilizing an e-beam cured organic layer with either a sputtered coating or a thermally evaporated coating, it may be possible to produce a structural mirror carrier with high stiffness, low residual stresses, and exceptional moisture stability.  An extremely low residual stress in the laminate is required to minimize deformations in the mirror optic upon release from the polished replication mandrel.  A high stiffness construction is necessary to facilitate separation from the replicating mandrel by introduction of a thermal gradient.  By proper selection of materials and utilizing near room temperature coating processes, it may be feasible to produce a material that encompasses all of the unique properties desired in a x-ray mirror structure.  This mirror fabrication technology could be enabling for the Constellation-X program for which there is currently no viable technical solution for the manufacture of lightweight mirror components.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Barrett Technology, Inc. proposes to design and build a lightweight high-performance manipulator for micro-gravity muscle/bone strengthening and trauma rehabilitation with data quantification.  The device will be used on board months-long interplanetary space-exploration missions.  The enabling technology is based on the novel concept presented confidentially in this proposal.  If Phase I demonstrates feasibility, then Phase II will support the design of such a versatile device, featuring: (1) human-centric operation; (2) virtual energetic sports environments; and (3) a rich stream of quantification data for body motion trajectories, force/torque vectors along the trajectories, and power/energy profiles.  
<br>Unlike any manipulator available today, the proposed device will achieve the normally incompatible requirements of:  (1) human-level strength and (2) reach but also (3) precise controllability and (4) true fail-safe operation - all in a (5) lightweight package.  Even Barrett's high-performance WAM™ arm, which is haptic and has higher force capability than the popular Phantom (sold by Barrett's licensee, Sensable Technologies) cannot meet this set of requirements without a technology breakthrough as significant as the innovation presented within this proposal.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 During future NASA interplanetary explorations, the on-board accessibility of a manipulator with extraordinary versatility that can work safely among crew members should quickly find other duties to assist the crew.  In commercial (terrestrial) applications, manipulators made with this new technology would be a boon to emerging service robots.  It enables a wide range of activities such as elderly-assist devices, precise surgical assistants, and even psychologically-engaging fitness machines that create virtual sports activities.

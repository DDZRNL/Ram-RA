<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The successful application of ultra-light structures on space platforms requires the development of highly innovative materials technology. Thin polymer films have long been considered a leading candidate for meeting these technology needs. While these materials promise to meet the weight requirements and, in some cases, the space environment durability issues, they are typically somewhat lacking in strength, tear resistance, and thermal stability. Physitron proposes an approach to augment the properties of current state-of-the-art polymer materials. This approach involves the use of graphite nanofibers (GNFs) as an additive for polymer films (specifically polyimides). The GNFs have an altered surface chemistry, which allows them to form covalent bonds with the polymer molecule, and are available in a number of geometries and atomic structures. The use of GNFs in a polymer matrix will result in a nanocomposite film material having increased strength, tear resistance, and thermal stability over conventional thin films. In Phase I, the feasibility of the use of GNFs will be demonstrated. Phase II will include the development of these materials for specific space applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 Thin GNF-doped polymer films will have similar commercial applications as conventional thin film materials such as Kapton, Mylar,  and various materials developed by NASA. These applications include thermal control blankets, membrane structures for space applications, packaging materials, materials for strain gauges and other sensors, high strength tapes, speaker cone materials, etc. These materials may also be used as resins in more standard composite applications where the use of GNFs in the polymer provides additional strength to the resin material that may allow the use of fewer macroscale fiber materials. All of these applications will be investigated during this effort.

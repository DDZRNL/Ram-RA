<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to design a novel three-dimensional digital memory (3DDM) system based on 2-photon excitation.  A new femtosecond fiber laser system will be used in this optical data storage device to achieve a recording density of approximately 1 Tbit per square inch in 500 layers, or more, in an inexpensive erasable nonlinear nanomaterial.  Such a high recording density in nanomaterials will be extremely useful in widespread fields ranging from scientific research to industrial applications, and from video and audio devices to special facilities for super-computers and the information super-highway.
<br>
<br>IOS’s 3DDM system will enhance the development of 3-D optical storage systems.  The keys to IOS’s system are:
<br>·	Superior data density through the use of two-photon excitation and high-resolution, nonlinear response media;
<br>·	A highly sensitive and low cross talk data reading system; and
<br>·	A lower cost and smaller size light source through the use of innovative fiber lasers.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The growth in demand for digital storage capacity exceeds 60% per annum.  Storage area networks, data warehouses, supercomputers and e-commerce related data mining require ever greater capacity in order to handle the volume of data to be processed.  High bandwidth Internet and data intensive applications (such as high definition television, and video and music-on-demand), small handheld devices (such as personal VCRs, PDAs (personal digital assistants), and mobile phones), and the proliferation of other information appliances will demand multi-gigabyte and terabyte capacities in the very near future.  IOS's 3DDM system can improve storage capabilities in all of these applications.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 ORBITEC proposes to conduct an innovative research and development program that will result in a Aerodynamic Microgravity Containerless Processor (AMCP) technology demonstration on the International Space Station.  This system will satisfy microgravity scientists that cannot currently be accommodated by the ESL, EML or acoustic systems.  The innovation is based on: the use of a newly developed gas-jet rectifier hardware concept, a fuzzy logic expert control system, an automatic sample loading and retrieval system, a revolutionary sample spin diagnostic and control system concept, a specially designed cooling and quench system, a new containment concept for on-orbit position control of spherical samples, a new, highly-accurate, fast-response optical sample tracking and a tetrahedral laser heating system.  In Phase I, we propose to: update and refine the preliminary system requirements by setting up an expert science review team that needs aerodynamic containerless processing in microgravity, perform testing of several critical components, design, develop, and test a prototype AMCP system, and develop the preliminary design for a Phase II prototype space flight system.  In Phase II, we propose to develop a space "flight-like" AMCP system.  Many scientists have expressed interest in using this proposed system.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 A fully-developed facility for space flight applications provides the opportunity to: make significant progress in heating, melting and controlled slow and very rapid cooling of materials in a free-float zone; conduct crystal structure studies; measure thermophysical properties in melts and other liquids/solutions; and conduct various fluid dynamic and combustion studies in a micro-g environment.  ORBITEC can develop this space flight hardware at much less cost and higher quality because we will use the knowledge developed in our BPS flight system being sponsored by NASA/ARC.  Additional AMCP experiments could include: surface nucleation studies, undercooling research, development of unique composite materials and glasses, gas-based quenching, liquid state property measurement, etc.  There are many commercial needs to gain thermophysical property measurements for the casting industry, need for new glasses for the optical fiber applications and development of new metal foams.  Parabolic aircraft low-g flight of the basic approach has proven that superior performance and experimental flexibility is achievable over other techniques, including acoustic, electromagnetic, and electrostatic levitation.  Many government-funded and commercial spin-off opportunities have been identified and are in evaluation or pursuit.

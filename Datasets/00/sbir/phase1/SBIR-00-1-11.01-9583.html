<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 The proposed R&D plan focuses on the development of an innovative liquid combustion process for the production of unagglomerated nanopowders of uniform size, crystallinity and composition in a microgravity environment.  The project is designed primarily to exploit reduced buoyancy in a microgravity environment to accelerate the development and commercialization of technology for production of advanced materials for use in electronics and electro-optics.  Candidate materials are doped and undoped zinc oxide (ZnO) (for displays), barium-strontium-titanate (for advanced dielectrics), and platinum metal (for catalysis).  A related goal of this effort is to use the knowledge about microgravity-grown material behavior to improve ground-based nanopowder production capabilities.  The powders will be collected during experiments in a drop-tower and characterized for microstructure, stoichiometry and physical properties as a function of process variables.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 Although the proposed experimental study will be conducted using ground and drop-tower based experiments, the ultimate goal is to develop a commercially viable system for mass production of nanoparticles for advanced applications.

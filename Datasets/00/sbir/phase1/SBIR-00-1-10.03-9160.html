<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR> Intelligent Software for Astronaut Health Maintenance and Medical Training <BR>
<P>
<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 This project will improve astronauts' ability to maintain their own medical health during long-duration space missions. We will produce an integrated set of intelligent software applications that coordinate automatic intelligent patient interviewing and recommendations, ground-based emergency procedures training, in-space refresher and just-in-time training, and during-event procedure coaching. In Phase I, we will investigate the problem, knowledge engineer the expert doctors, develop the required AI techniques, and implement a proof-of-concept prototype.
<br>
<br> This proposed effort builds on SHAI's, and our partner, ZMedix's previous work, which developed a system that automatically interviews patients and uses those answers to make recommendations to doctors as to what exams, tests, and labs to perform, then takes those results and responds with medical conclusions for the doctor. This system will be expanded and adapted for astronaut use in several ways, including the entry of additional knowledge of space illnesses and injuries. The proposed team is very strong. SHAI has extensive Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Tutoring System experience. ZMedix has assembled an incredible array of medical expertise, including an astronaut M.D. specializing in space medicine, a former Psychiatric Evaluator for NASA's Astronaut Selection Program and specialist in the psychiatric effects of long-duration space missions, and a team of world-renowned physicians in various specialties, including emergency care.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 This project will result in 3 commercial products - a mental health patient interview/recommendation module; an emergency medical procedures training/prompting system; and a patient-education expert system, all to be marketed by ZMedix, who is dedicated toward marketing very similar medical advisory products and services to the medical industry.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Foster-Miller will demonstrate a novel processing method to develop SiC/SiC composites for optical structures.  The need to reduce the weight, size, and costs of current systems make the use of SiC ideal.  Traditional materials, like aluminum and glass are inherently limited in terms of CTE, stiffness, and weight.  More exotic solutions, like beryllium or graphite epoxy systems, are capable of making lighter structures, but suffer from cost and long-term space environmental effects.  
<br>	Foster-Miller proposes a SiC/SiC composite from preceramic polymer as a solution to NASA systems' weight, environmental resistance, and cost requirements.  A number of specimens will be fabricated to demonstrate mechanical strength, thermal capability, and environmental durability.  The structural materials will have relevance to the requirements of a variety of spacecraft, such as the Next Generation Space Telescope and other future space telescopes, Earth observing satellites, telecommunication satellites, and airborne instrument packages.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The lightweight and low cost nature of preceramic SiC make it applicable to a number of airborne and space based applications.  These include telecommunications and surveillance satellites, airborne instruments and packages, and engine components for automobiles, aircraft, and rockets.  Foster-Miller has already successfully transferred the precermic polymer technology to the commercial realm through a partnership with NASA-Rocketdyne.  At the end of the Phase I effort NASA will have a proven, low risk technique for fabricating fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites.  The technique will be applicable to a variety of ceramic materials systems.  At the end of Phase II a subscale optics structure will be ready for testing in simulated environment.

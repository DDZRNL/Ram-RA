<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 An extremely simple Permanent Magnetic Linear Shaft Coupler is presented that would magnetically couple the linear motion of a hermetically sealed shaft with an Actuator that operates in ambient conditions.  The proposed Coupler will eliminate potential leak paths for the cryogenic valves at the Kennedy Space Center.  The Coupler consists of only three parts and is based upon permanent magnets acting through a non-magnetic medium.  The Coupler utilizes an outer and inner set of many flat, washer-shaped permanent magnets.  The inner magnets easily fit within the hole of the outer magnets.  A leakproof Linear Shaft Coupler that can withstand adverse conditions is immediately needed in the hazardous chemical, cryogenic and nuclear Industries.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 The Permanent Magnet Linear Shaft Coupler is immediately needed in the hazardous chemical, cryogenic, and nuclear industries as a leak proof coupling between the actuator (operating in ambient conditions) and the mechanical movement of the valve.  The proposed Coupler will eliminate all maintenance and hazardous emissions (and their clean air purges) associated with dynamic “stem packing” seals.  The proposed Coupler will permit actuator R&R while the valve is loaded with hazardous chemicals, which is not possible with competing solenoid valve technology that seals the actuator inside the hazardous environment.  And of course, the proposed Coupler will have an immediate market of providing a maintenance free “leak proofing” of all hypergolic and cryogenic valves at the Kennedy Space Center.  An engineer with the local Trane, Inc. manufacturing facility stated that a well proven, leak-proof coupler is desperately needed for the million’s of air conditioners manufactured in the HVAC industry each year.

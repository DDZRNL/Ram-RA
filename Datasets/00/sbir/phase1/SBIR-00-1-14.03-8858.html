<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 The limited bus bandwidth is a major bottleneck for efficient communication among processing components, memory modules, and other I/O interface units. In the conventional electrical backplane, the bandwidth of communication path is limited by signal-propagation delay, skew, power consumption, and capacitive effects.  To solve these problems, Radiant Research, Inc., proposes a substrate mode holograms-based guided-wave optical backplane scheme that is capable of providing the equivalent interconnectivity and the architecture flexibility promised by three-dimensional optical interconnects while maintaining packaging reliability, low system insertion loss and cost-effectiveness.  The total aggregate bandwidth is expected to be three orders of magnitude higher than that of electrical interconnection.  The guided wave optical backplane employed is a waveguiding plate in conjunction with photo-polymeric multiplexed volume holograms. In the proposed scheme, the electrical connectors are positioned as usual, and the active optoelectronic modules including transmitters and receivers are placed on the bottom of the electrical backplane board, and a new broadcasting scheme is proposed to provide n.(n-1) even fanout for a backplane containing n boards. Thus the insertion or removal of circuit boards during normal operation does not affect their alignment. This approach also provides bi-directional signal broadcast capability, making the system compatible with existing electrical boards.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 Apart from addressing backplane bottleneck faced by conventional electrical methods, the idea we proposed here can be used to replace any free space optical interconnect systems.  For example, a perfect shuffle network can be implemented using the substrate waveguiding plate in stead of free space optical interconnects.  An array of applications can be realized based on the proposed interconnection scheme and the spin-off technologies.  These include even fanout 1-to-many couplers, guided wave perfect shuffle networks, wavelength division multiplexers and spectrum analyzers.  Compatibility with the existing electronic backplane makes the proposed idea attractive to companies interesting in packaging and high speed optoelectronics.

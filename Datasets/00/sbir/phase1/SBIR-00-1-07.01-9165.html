<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 In this SBIR effort we propose an innovative approach for the integration of Decision Support Tools (DSTs) for increased situational awareness, improved cooperative scheduling and collaborative decision-making in all parts of the air space. We propose to investigate two types of integration models based on the extent and feasibility of the level of integration and use appropriate game theoretic approaches to analyze these models. The proposed models are: (i) Data-sharing DST integration model: In this model, DSTs will primarily share data that is required for each DST to take a decision before an event happens. Based on the shared data each DST acts independently (ii) Interacting DST integration model: In this model, DSTs not only share data but also advise each other to act in such a way to reduce the level of conflict. Tools based on repeated strategic games and cooperative bargaining games will be used. We primarily focus on integrating Traffic Management Advisories (TMAs) across multiple centers as the application domain for the Phase I effort.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 The successful development of a verifiable approach for the integration of decision support tools will position IAI as a key player in the ATM market. Preliminary efforts lead by NASA for a Multi-Center TMA at Philadelphia are already in progress and it is anticipated that similar effort for integrating TMAs across NAS airspace will be conducted over the next few years. The proposed approach can easily be tailored to meet the needs of integrating other decision support tools as required by NASA's the Distributed Air Ground (DAG-TM) initiative. This is a fairly untapped market, still in its infancy, but with an extremely high commercialization potential. Techniques proposed in this effort will also have a market in applications such as transportation, factory scheduling and battle management.

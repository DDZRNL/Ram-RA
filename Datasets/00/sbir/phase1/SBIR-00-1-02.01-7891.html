<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovation is a new computational and analytical structural acoustic technique for aircraft interior noise prediction.  Its innovative quality resides in the unifying theory by which conventional finite element analysis (FEA) and statistical energy analysis (SEA) are related through the use of Principal Components (PC) analysis.  This "linking" of FEA and SEA methods provides the ability to predict structural acoustic response in the so-called "mid-frequency range" where neither conventional FEA nor SEA approaches have given satisfactory results.  FEA produces classical frequency-ordered modes that typically fail to correlate with test modes in this range.  Analytical SEA fails when modal density is low.  Experimental SEA is also problematic whenever poorly conditioned energy matrices must be inverted to obtain coupling and loss coefficients.  The new technique involves combining FEA for finely meshed finite element models with PC analysis to derive energy-ordered "modes" i.e. principal components, for the coupled structural and acoustic components.  These "energy modes" not only facilitate analysis-test correlation, but also provide a means for rigorous statistical quantification of modeling uncertainty and predictive accuracy.  The new PC/SEA modeling approach is expected to significantly improve the accuracy of aircraft interior noise prediction.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The PC/SEA methods developed under the proposed project have potential applications to all mid-frequency vibro-acoustics problems including aircraft interior noise prediction and suppression, ship's quieting, automobile interior acoustics, and launch vehicle-induced environments.  ACTA is pursuing com-mercialization of software developed under other Phase II contracts.  One project integrates ACTA's algorithms with a commercial FEA code.  The other is developing a standalone, third party toolbox for use with a general purpose, commercial mathematics package.  A strategy for commercialization of PC/SEA software based on integration with commercial FEA and SEA codes, and/or third party software will be formulated in Phase I.

<P>
<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Innovative Technical Solutions (ITS) is pleased to propose the development of a compact stabilization and navigation system which will correct the optical paths of spectral imaging systems in real time. It is our goal to provide NASA and the remote sensing community with a system which is unique in its combination of compactness, scalability, modularity, and adaptability to a variety of sensors and platforms. Additionally, the system will function autonomously, requiring only minimal user input. ITS’ planned graphical user interface will greatly simplify mission planning and data acquisition. 
<br>
<br>The proposed system, which ITS has named COMPASS for COMPact Airborne Stabilization System, immediately addresses the problems of reliable geo-registration, image degradation through aircraft motion, and incomplete area coverage, providing great utility to the remote sensing community. The Phase I program will first survey the candidate approaches to the problem, with the discussion of the pros and cons of various system architectures, emphasizing performance, modularity, and compactness. A recommendation will be made as to which type of system concept should be pursued, with the final goal of the Phase I program being the preliminary design of a scalable, modular stabilization/navigation system for a variety of airborne spectral imaging systems.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 The successful development of a compact, modular stabilization system for airborne sensors offers tremendous potential for commercial applications. The remote sensing market has been identified as having great potential, with a projected volume of over the next 5 years. A stab/nav system adaptable to multiple platform and sensors will add value to any remote sensing campaign, and greatly simplify data collection and processing. ITS has the technical expertise from a seasoned employee base and sufficient resources and capital to pursue the commercialization of a derivative of the proposed stabilization/navigation system.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 High power supplier is still a limitation for many applications, such as advanced consumer electronics, electric vehicles, and high performance aircraft.  Hybrid power packs: supercapacitor connected in parallel with batteries, are important power sources to satisfy this requirement.  Hybrid power packs lower the overall pack impedance.  Supercapacitor has low ESR resulting in minimal voltage losses and battery drain, lower impedance power packs provide longer run-times for high pulse power applications.  
<br>This proposed research is to develop spin-on thin film supercapacitor which can form hybrid power pack with thin film lithium battery to provide high pulse power and longer run-times for applications in microelectronics and telecommunication.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Due to the exceptional high energy and power densities, and long cycle life, hybrid power pack can be expected to replace rechargeable lithium batteries as a power source for pulse power and high power application.

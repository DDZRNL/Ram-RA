<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovation is a back-end/front-end integration of an authoring system for data-driven audio cues and a delivery system for simulated spatial audio display. The innovation includes adaptive incorporation of the integrated system with existing speech communications, in a real-time operations pipeline that accepts operational data streams and converts them into relevant auditory cues.  Compared to previous auditory display research, this proposed system moves beyond spatial/positional data from operators to incorporate data from operational signals and events.  Data-driven audio cues will be provided and supported by patented technologies developed at NCSA/UIUC. Spatial simulation will be provided by AuSIM's proprietary AuSIM3D™ technologies. This proposal is innovative because it integrates two robust and mature systems that have never been commercially integrated: broad, adaptable tools for data sonification and a rendering pipeline for spatial audio simulation.  These technologies are complementary and each has been demonstrated effectively in industrial contexts outside of the laboratory. The resulting system will provide a comprehensive audio operations environment to orchestrate and integrate existing speech communications with synthetic environmental cues that respond to changing conditions represented in operations data.  These innovations directly address the stated goals of enhancing system monitoring, crew-system integration and remote collaboration.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The most immediate application of this technology would be specifically for flight deck manufacturers and their equipment vendors, as they work to develop next-generation human-machine interfaces for their equipment.  Commercial aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing as well as military aircraft manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin will be highly interested in licensing this technology.  
<br>
<br>Longer-range applications include any situations where humans need to control complex navigational and related equipment: submarines, ships, helicopters, and even spacecraft.  Any such environment where improving the human-computer interface will result in increased operator performance in critical areas we should find customers for this advanced new technology.  
<br>
<br>The proprietary nature of the AuSIM3D™ core technology, the functionality of which has yet to be matched, combined with the NCSA VSS functionality, will prevent any real competition. AuSIM would market the product in parallel with its current product line. The market focus would be selling systems to research groups for use as prototypes, and the software and proprietary manufacturing process would be licensed to a commercial manufacturer when demand began to exceed AuSIM’s manufacturing capacity. The manufacturing process complexity and time of the new integrated system would be equivalent to AuSIM’s current product line.

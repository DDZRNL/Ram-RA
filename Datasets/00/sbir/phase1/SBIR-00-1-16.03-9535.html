<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose a new design of silicon photodiode which is based on the Avalanching Metal-Resistance-Semiconductor (MRS) photodiode design.  MRS photodiodes, which are themselves under development by a Ukrainian group, offer excellent performance (single photon detection is reported), but utilize a resistive film in their fabrication which is somewhat problematic and difficult to reproduce.  Our innovation is to altogether eliminate the resistive layer from the design while maintaining the operating functionality and performance of these devices.  This innovation should allow these sensitive new detectors to become cheaper and available to everyone sooner.
<br>
<br>In Phase I, we will demonstrate the suitability of these new photodiodes for use in detection of low level light in the visible range.  A number of space-based detection systems would benefit from such a sensor, which would have the sensitivity of an avalanche photodiode.  Even more importantly, the proposed sensors will be very 'manufacturable', meaning they will be more affordable than current-technology avalanche photodiodes, have consistent specifications, and be available in large areas and in abundant supply.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed research will be aimed at producing low cost, high performance photodiodes for use in space based detection systems.  These photodiodes would also be applicable to other applications such as medical imaging instrumentation (gamma cameras and surgical probes).  These photodiodes would also find research applications in high energy physics and nuclear physics.

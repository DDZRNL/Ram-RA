<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 AEC-Able Engineering Co., Inc. (ABLE) has invented a method for inclusion of elastic shape memory composite (EMC) elements in a high-performance ultra-light deployable coilable truss (CT) with ultra-low stowed volume. The performance of the heritage “CoilABLE” mast system can be increased 100x in bending stiffness and 10,000x in strength, for an equal mass per unit length.  The proposed program will demonstrate the feasibility of the key element of this new structure - a collapsible EMC tube that can be coiled - while advancing preliminary design detail of the new EMC-CT system in preparation for a spaceflight application.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 The specific commercial product resulting from the proposed program will be a linearly deployable space truss.  This system will have discriminating performance advantages that will clearly separate it from the competition.  These major discriminating features will include remarkably improved stiffness and strength per unit mass and low stowed volume.  The proposed system will be strongly desired as enabling for current and future government and commercial missions currently relying on relatively mass inefficient (but heritage) solutions or risky inflatable / rigidizable concepts.  The EMC-CT structure will greatly enhance ABLE’s strategic position as the leader in deployable space structures supply.
<br>
<br>The proposed program (Phase I and II) has been structured to accelerate the commercialization of this technology and ready it for spaceflight in approximately three years.  If the technology is proven worthy during the proposed program, then ABLE is committed to commercializing the developed system as an ABLE product.  ABLE has a demonstrated history of strategic investment, commercializing numerous technologies such as the ADAM mast and our various solar array products.  ABLE is committed to commercializing the EMC-CT in a similar manner for the benefit of future missions.

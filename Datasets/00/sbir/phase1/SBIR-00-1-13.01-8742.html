<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR> An Integrated Optical System for Synoptic Remote Sensing Validation: The DOLPHIN <BR>
<P>
<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Integrated, optical sampling systems capable of rapid surveys are needed in several areas of remote sensing validation, including the validation and calibration of aircraft-based and future space-based lidar technologies.  These sampling systems require the development of innovative deployment strategies, multi-sensor sampling packages with integrated acquisition, and software networks designed for automated and integrated processing.
<br>
<br>In response, we propose to develop a self-contained, compact, in-situ optical measurement system, the DOLPHIN (Diving OpticaL Profiler and High-speed Integration Network).  The sampling package will be a towed profiler to maximize spatial coverage.  Data acquisition and processing will be automated.  A water sampling system will additionally pump water to the vessel for laboratory analyses.
<br>
<br>The towed sampling package will provide a continuous set of calibration points for validation, instead of a single point (station) as typically obtained from a ship.  Equally important, substantial time and money will be saved by the research community by purchasing a sampling system already equipped with complete sensor integration and automated processing.
<br>
<br>At the end of Phase-I we expect to have design work for the system completed.  We will construct and test all DOLPHIN components in Phase-II.  Phase-II will culminate in a completely operational system transitioned to a commercial product.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The DOLPHIN will have immediate commercial applications in remote sensing validation research in oceanography and limnology.  We expect it to be particularly applicable to important up-and-coming remote sensing technologies such as space-based lidar systems.  The DOLPHIN will also be ideally designed for validating bio-optical algorithms for obtaining aquatic biogeochemical properties from water-leaving radiance, particularly in coastal, Case II waters.  By developing a compact sampling system that can be operated from a small research vessel, the DOLPHIN will open the door to new opportunities in the measurement of optical properties in riverine and lacustrine systems.  It will also be economical with a target price range for the complete system of $80,000 to $100,000.
<br>
<br>Synoptic surveys of in-situ optical properties will have many other promising potential applications.  After the DOLPHIN system for remote sensing validation is complete, the sensor package on the DOLPHIN system could easily be modified for other applications such as environmental monitoring and assessment.  For example, sensors could be integrated to detect and map sewage plumes or oil spills rapidly in multiple dimensions.

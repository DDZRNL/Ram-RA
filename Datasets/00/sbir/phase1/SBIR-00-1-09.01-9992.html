<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 The specific innovation proposed, tentatively named “DYNASCOPE”, is an innovative system of microscopy equipment capable of unique sample manipulation and real-time observation. A uniquely designed hollow microscope slide with high manufacturability offers an opportunity to study the effects of capillary forces, magnetic fields, electrokinetic fields, and microscopic hydrodynamics on a wide range of fluids including biological samples.  The key element of the system is the hollow slide which interfaces with other modular components, providing novel opportunities to manipulate fluid samples and to observe flows using particle image velocimetry and similar optical techniques. Three sets of endcaps, each specifically designed to accommodate pumps, magnets, or  electrodes, offer flexibility, stringent control of the applicable field, and user-friendly interfaces.  DYNASCOPE will facilitate video recording of motion in a variety of fluid samples on Earth or in space.  Laboratory applications include the study of magnetized particle interactions, electokinetically induced aggregation and coalescence, and flow driven by capillary forces in phase-changing mixtures and porous media.  In space research, DYNASCOPE can serve similar purposes, in which the gravity-dependent components of the above phenomena can be studied using the Light Microscopy Module designed for the International Space Station’s Fluids Integrated Rack.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 SHOT’s products, including DYNASCOPE, address three markets: (1) space flight hardware manufactured for government research, (2) space-flight services for commercial and academic users and (3) research laboratory equipment.  Applications of DYNASCOPE address each of these in the form of (1) potential sales of space flight hardware to government agencies using the compact, space-qualified features of the DYNASCOPE fluid-handling system, (2) agreements with materials and biotechnology companies whose research in fluids behavior or materials engineering benefits from low gravity, and (3) by creating in the research laboratory a new paradigm for routine microscopic observation of fluid mechanical phenomena.  In an example, an investigator may wish to test five physical conditions using a complete set of observational data.  With a single compact fluids handling and force-field generating system he/she can set up five sequential slides,  each with a different value of an independent variable (such as viscosity, temperature, magnetic field).  The fluid events can be recorded and analyzed by a user-selected motion analysis software package, with which the images recorded from the DYNASCOPE experiment will be compatible. This is a highly marketable integrated concept, with essentially no “off-the-shelf” competition at present.

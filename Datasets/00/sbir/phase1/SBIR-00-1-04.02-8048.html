<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Wiesen Engine is currently testing a diesel engine developed for NASA's general aviation program.
<br>
<br>This 98 cubic inch opposed piston diesel engine is able to produce 125 horsepower at 2,500 r.p.m. and weighs 160 pounds.  Combining eight pistons in four highly pressure charged uniflow scavenged cylinders, featuring an automatically variable compression ratio mechanism.  The engine is very compact, requiring 30 to 40% less maaterial and fewer parts than conventional engines.
<br>
<br>Cost benefits are the result of inexpensive manufacturing processes, at least 50% less than current systems.  Simplicity of manufacture and part design allows for reduced maintenance, lower insurance costs and easier certification.
<br>
<br>The principal objective of this Phase I project is to design and construct a production prototype version of the experimental test engine, incorporating improvements such as redesigned intake an exhaust manifolds that will lead to a substantial increase in power that preliminary analysis indicates would enable the engine to produce 125 horsepower without turbocharging.  Substituting materials used for the propeller shaft and the positive displacement superchargers will reduce the weight by 25 pounds.
<br>
<br>This proposed effort will produce a production prototype based on the unique Wiesen engine technology resulting in the development of a revolutionary class of internal combustion engine.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The General Aviation market offers a tremendous opportunity for a successful lightweight, efficient and inexpensive diesel engine for new and experimental single pilot aircraft; there are also numerous retrofit opportunities which can benefit from the significant advantages of cost, performance, economy and safety of operation that these engines can offer.  The availability of a line of very lightweight inexpensive fuel efficient diesel engines in this market would find many customers who are also seeking increased safety and lower insurance costs.  There could be derivative applications to other civilian and military transport groups where lightweight and high performance using diesel fuel is desirable.  It would also make an ideal marine engine.  Its low height, narrow width and low weight could permit installations not now possible.  Extensive spinoff potential exists, applications include, high altitude research, unmanned observation, flying bomb, hybrid-automotive and many off-highway applications.

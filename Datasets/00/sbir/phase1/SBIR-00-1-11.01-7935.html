<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
One of NASA&#146;s missions is to develop noninvasive models for monitoring the 
potentially deleterious effects of microgravity on human cell/tissue functions. 
Previous work has shown that gravitational changes can modify a variety of host 
cell-matrix interactions. Angiogenesis, an essential process for tissue growth 
and regeneration, is a coordinated process of activated endothelial cell proliferation 
and differentiation controlled by specific matrix and growth factor signals. However, 
little is known about the human angiogenesis process in microgravity, primarily 
due to the lack of defined functional models. We have created a new human biomatrix 
(Amgel)<br>
culture system which supports endothelial cell growth and function. This unique 
biomatrix simulates human cell morphogenesis only in the presence of specific 
modulators (FGF, VEGF). We now propose to employ this natural matrix to further 
develop an all-human angiogenesis model adaptable for microgravity studies. Endothelial 
cell cultivation models with controllablebioactivity utilizing Amgel-layered disk 
and microbead configurations will be evaluated in rotary culture systems. New 
3-D bioassays, generated with GF-enriched matrix, would allow examination of both 
early mitogenic and late angiogenic events. This R&amp;D proposal should positively 
impact the fields of wound healing, tissue engineering and vascular disease.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
No acceptable commercial model for examining human cell morphogenesis currently 
exists which utilizes a defined 3-D biomatrix system. We will develop, optimize 
and evaluate these microgravity adaptable human cell-matrix systems. Sale of proprietary 
Amgel and pre-packed bioassays would have a world-wide market in the hundreds 
of thousands of dollars. Thus, multiple utility of the Amgel model in biomedical 
and pharmaceutical research highlights its commercialization potential.

On-Line Particulate Sensor for Propellant Systems<BR>
<P>
<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Florida Laser Systems, proposes the development of a Fluid Optical Quality Sensor, 
(FOQS) for On-Line Particulate sensing. The sensor will ultimately be commercially 
available to determine two phase flow, the fraction of vapor in the line, and 
the fluid quality. Current point sensor technology is incapable of determining 
the presence of particulate/contamination in the supply lines for facility propellant 
(liquid oxygen and hydrogen) and support gas systems. The FOQS will provide a 
means of measuring fluid quality for a wide range of flow systems. Our phase I 
experiments will monitor fluid quality and response time of the sensor in liquid 
nitrogen. These tests will build on previously successful ambient tests performed 
with surrogate fluids. Very large commercial markets have been identified for 
this predictive maintenance sensor.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
There are 2 primary applications for commercialization of the novel sensor developed 
under this SBIR program. These applications are in the fields of cryogenic test 
facilities and Air-conditioning/Refrigeration systems.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A high precision, adaptive, and low-cost laser velocimeter is proposed for aerodynamic applications. We adopt a new kind of optical Doppler frequency sensor to detect Doppler frequency shifts caused by air flows. High speed investigation of aerodynamics is enabled by the fast response times of the novel Doppler frequency sensors. It is proposed here to demonstrate to NASA the compact laser velocimeter for wind tunnel applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 Successful execution of the Phase I program will lead to a high speed laser velocimeter ideal for modern studies in aerodynamics. Potential commercial applications include the monitoring and control of engine combustions, aerodynamic design and verification, laser ultrasound inspection systems, and laser radars for law enforcement agencies.

<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR> GPS Multipath Mitigation and a GPS Signal Processing System <BR>
<P>
<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This project develops two innovations: new effective GPS multipath mitigation algorithms, and a flexible GPS signal processing system. The multipath mitigation algorithms aid the GPS receiver in maintaining accurate code-phase tracking under multipath conditions. The GPS signal processing system enables development and real-time evaluations of the multipath mitigation algorithms, and other algorithms for multi-antenna digital GPS receivers. Advanced signal processing neural network techniques are used for multipath mitigation, and commercial off-the-shelf digital radio ICs are used for the GPS signal processing system hardware.
<br>The implications of this approach and the anticipated results of this project include: facilitation of human presence in space by effecting accurate control of space structures and robots, accurate GPS position and attitude navigation under multipath for consumer-grade and for professional-grade multi-antenna GPS receivers, an inexpensive modular and flexible GPS signal processing system that enables development and evaluation of various receiver signal processing techniques.
<br>The NASA needs addressed by this project include: the reduction in the ground control personnel workload, development of high-performance techniques for autonomous position and attitude navigation, development of autonomous self-calibrating GPS sensor algorithms, and development of a flexible GPS testbed for design and validation of self-correcting navigation solutions.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Inflatable membrane concentrators for space solar power currently have two large weight penalties.  The extra inflatant needed to make up for gas leaked through construction defects or meteoroid holes can dominate system weight for long missions.  Also the inefficiency of the canopy over the reflector can be great, requiring doubling the reflector’s size to compensate.  We plan to make the inflatable membrane concentrators for space solar power viable by reducing these two largest weight penalties. We can greatly reduce the first penalty by lowering inflation pressure to a minimum by constructing the reflector from formed gores, requiring essentially zero strain to obtain the desired shape. We will learn in laboratory testing how to seam such formed gores to retain surface accuracy.  Thus we allow large hybrid reflectors of combined, formed gores to be made. The second penalty can be reduced by selecting proper canopy configurations to minimize oblique incidence of solar energy and by applying anti-reflection coatings.  We will perform a system configuration study and laboratory tests to learn how to do this.  Thus we will make viable the replacement of hard reflectors with inexpensive, light-weight, and easily deployed inflatable membranes.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Missions that may be enabled by the inflatable solar concentrator include deep space missions using solar power rather than the controversial nuclear power modules, with an added benefit that the reflector may be useful as an antenna and also to provide heat to the spacecraft.  Once this type of reflector is accepted, the solar rocket orbital transfer vehicle may finally be financially feasible.  The application of inflatables may also make orbiting solar power stations more attractive.  In general, the application of these relatively inexpensive collectors may bring solar dynamic power systems for spacecraft into direct competition with solar cells.  Furthermore, there are several microwave applications where very large antennas are needed, that can be based on this proposed technology.  These include interferometers (high-resolution studies of the universe) and radiometers (e.g. Earth-soil water-content measurements).

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal describes a non-intrusive, fine-grained, and situated approach to software design rationale capture. Non-intrusive means that the software developer can articulate rationale without stopping the normal flow of work. Situated means that rationale is captured with active links to the software affected and to other related decisions. Fine-grained means that the referenced software may consist of arbitrary portions of the design or code. A voice interface will enable developers to speak the rationale for a design or implementation action, as they are performing the action. By expressing the rationale in an alternative modality (speech), the developer can continue without interrupting the keyboard- and mouse-based processes used for design and coding. This approach allows the developer to maintain the mental context of the current task, thereby eliminating a large piece of the cognitive overhead involved in more conventional rationale documentation methods.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Knowledge management and the idea of a knowledge-creating company have recently come to be viewed among corporate strategic planners as essential for survival in the global economy. Because software codifies much of a business"s knowledge about itself, a knowledge-creating approach to software development must play a key role in any such initiative. Systematic rationale capture is a crucial element of knowledge management as applied to software development, maintenance, and operations. It is essential for the creation and ongoing maintenance of a corporate memory of software knowledge. One advantage of framing the technology this way is that it can be targeted towards higher-level managers, who not only have the authority to purchase new technology, but are more likely to see the acquisition in a context of company-wide knowledge management and associated strategic issues.

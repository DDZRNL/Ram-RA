<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Space based lidar systems for the remote sensing of Ozone require high-power, 
high-efficiency lasers operating in the ultraviolet. Diode-pumped solid-state 
lasers are the primary candidates for this application. Operation in the ultraviolet 
is typically achieved through two or three frequency conversion steps using nonlinear 
optical materials. This reduces the efficiency of the laser systems placing very 
stringent demands on the laser design and the gain media. A promising material 
for use in lasers for the remote sensing of Ozone is Nd:Y2O3 operating at 914 
nm and 948 nm using the 4F3/2 to 4I9/2 transition of the Nd3+ ion. This material 
offers several advantages over other crystals, including a lower threshold for 
oscillation of this transition, a high thermal conductivity, and a broad transmission 
range from 0.23 microns to 8 microns. Recent studies indicate that this material 
is well suited to Ozone lidar applications provided that crystals of sufficient 
size and quality are available. This Phase I SBIR project is aimed at developing 
growth systems to produce high optical quality Y2O3 and at demonstrating proof 
of concept for scaling of such systems to produce laser rods of sufficient size 
for use in lasers systems capable of meeting NASA's requirements for Ozone sensing.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Yttria has the potential of several commercial applications. First is the replacement 
of Nd:YAG in laser oscillators and amplifiers. The material may also lead to new 
applications because of improved material performance. A second application is 
4-8 &#131;&Yacute;m optics. This material may make a very practical optic in this 
region on the spectrum. A third application is for high temperature optics. This 
material can be inserted directly into a hot gas stream for thermal studies above 
2000 C.

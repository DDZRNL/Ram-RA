<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR> A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS TOOL FOR DUCTED PROPELLERS <BR>
<P>
<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The use of ducted propellers as the quiet propulsive device for Unmanned
<br>Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is steadily gaining popularity. Their successful 
<br>application as the fenestron tail rotor is global and well established.
<br>This research proposes a comprehensive analysis tool for ducted propellers.
<br>
<br>In Phase I, an axially symmetric Navier-Stokes flow solver capable of 
<br>analyzing the ducted fan in climb, hover and descent will be developed
<br>and integrated with an intutive graphical user interface. The rotor will be
<br>modeled as an axis-symmetric momentum source in the governing equations. 
<br>An automated grid generation based on the geomtric characteristics of the 
<br>duct will be an integral part of the tool. In Phase II, the analysis tool 
<br>will be extended to non-axial forward flight conditions.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The software developed under this initiative will find wide usage in the 
<br>U.S. helicopter industries and aerospace industries in addition to the 
<br>US government. With the success of the software in predicting the 
<br>aerodynamics of ducted propellers, extention to dynamics, control and
<br>accoustics will be considered in future initiatives.
<br>
<br>In Phase III, the comprehensive aerodynamic analysis tool will be 
<br>wrapped with pre and post-processing capabilities and licensed to the industry.

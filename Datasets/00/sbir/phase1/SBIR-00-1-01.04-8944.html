<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Scientific Systems Company Inc. (SSCI) proposes to develop
<br>nonlinear on-line Health Monitoring (HM), Failure Detection and
<br>Identification (FDI) and Adaptive Reconfigurable Control (ARC)
<br>algorithms for the case of failures of Electro-Mechanical Actuators
<br>(EMAs) and other subsystems and components of a modern combat
<br>aircraft. The proposed algorithms will result in fast and accurate
<br>on-line FDI and ARC for EMAs whose behavior is characterized by
<br>highly nonlinear dynamics. The proposed on-line HM-FDI and ARC
<br>scheme will be integrated into Boeing's open Prognostics and Health
<br>Management (PHM) and Open Control Platform (OCP)
<br>architectures. In order to achieve the above objectives, we propose to
<br>carry out in Phase I the following tasks: (i) Formulation of the
<br>HM-FDI and ARC problem for Electro-Mechanical Actuators
<br>(EMAs). (ii) Acquisition of nonlinear actuator models from Boeing.
<br>(iii) Development of on-line nonlinear HM-FDI and ARC
<br>algorithms compatible with the PHM and OCP architectures for the
<br>nonlinear actuator models. (iv) Testing, tuning and performance
<br>evaluation of the algorithms on a linearized TAFA simulation. (v)
<br>Integration of the HM-FDI and ARC algorithms into the PHM and
<br>OCP. In Phase II we plan to integrate our HM-FDI and ARC
<br>algorithms into Boeing's PMH and OCP systems and test them under
<br>laboratory conditions at Boeing, and in flight tests. The end product
<br>of this research will be a user-friendly software design toolkit for
<br>on-line HM-FDI and ARC. Boeing Phantom Works will provide
<br>technical and commercialization support in all phases of the project.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Recent analyses carried out by Boeing have revealed that decrease in
<br>Can-Not-Duplicate (CND) failures and false alarms by 50% on a
<br>platform such as the C-17 or F/A-18, would result in a maintenance
<br>cost savings of over $100M over the life of the aircraft. The approach
<br>pursued by Boeing is based on predictive diagnostics, or prognostics,
<br>combined with on-line FDI algorithms and data mining techniques,
<br>and will be used to identify more accurately the root causes of failures.
<br>Such an approach has a potential to achieve substantial decrease in
<br>CND failures and false alarms. The resulting architecture, under
<br>development by Boeing, is referred to as the open Prognostics and
<br>Health Management (PHM) system, and is expected to result in a
<br>substantial decrease in operational maintenance costs for modern
<br>aircraft. Efficient ARC algorithms are an important component of
<br>the future Vehicle Management Systems (VMSs) for modern aircraft.
<br>Hence the proposed HM-FDI and ARC algorithms, that will be an
<br>integral part of the PMH and the aircraft Operational Maintenance
<br>Program (OMP), have a great commercial potential in the area of
<br>operational maintenance and safety improvements in modern
<br>aircraft.

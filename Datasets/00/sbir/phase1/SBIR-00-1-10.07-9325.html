<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Technology Applications, Inc. is proposing to develop a unique evacuated microsphere insulation (MSI) panel that is over twice as effective as polyurethane foam insulation in a one-atmosphere environment and approaches multilayer insulation performance in a vacuum environment.  The MSI is rugged, easily applied to cryogenic transfer lines, and not subject to degradation from environmental exposure or thermal cycling.  This insulation system will enable the effective distribution and transfer of cryogens over long distances; it is a promising candidate for reusable launch vehicles, space applications, and low-pressure atmospheric applications, such as cryogenic storage and transfer for Mars missions.
<br>
<br>The MSI consists of microsphere filled panels that are vacuum tight and can be configured to fit any symmetrical shape.  The microspheres provide structural support for the vacuum shell while reducing radiation heat transfer by reflection and scattering.  Gaseous conduction is greatly reduced by evacuating to <10E-2 torr, and solid conduction is minimized because the glass microspheres make only point contact with each other.  The Phase I study will demonstrate the feasibility of the MSI through design, analysis, and the fabrication and testing of candidate panels.  During the Phase II development program, representative MSIs will be fabricated and rigorously tested under operational conditions

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Reliable and efficient insulation systems are critical to many NASA programs such as reusable launch vehicles and in-situ propellant generation for extra-terrestrial applications.  The airline industry requires a lightweight insulation for its proposed liquid hydrogen powered aircraft.  The petroleum industry needs efficient, long-life, and minimum maintenance insulation for long-distance transfer of LNG for their ground and underwater applications.

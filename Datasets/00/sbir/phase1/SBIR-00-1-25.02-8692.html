<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 It is proposed to establish the technical feasibility of using carbon nanotubes as a novel anion intercalating cathode materials for lithium-ion battery. The proposed concept will result in a novel lithium-ion battery of low cost, high energy, high power, long cycle life and safe for portable electronics and EV applications. The proposed efforts will address the synthesis of controlled structure nanotubes, purification, and electrochemical characterization. A modified electrolyte with low anion radii will also be investigated. Preliminary data indicated that the new battery has exceptionally high open circuit voltage of 5V, average discharge voltage at 4.5V with flat discharge plateau, and potentially with double the energy density of state-of-the-art commercially available batteries. Phase I effort will focus on the synthesis and purification of nanostructured carbon Nanotubes, processing nanostructured electrodes and electrochemical testing using full cells design.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 It is anticipated that the proposed new battery system will have high performance at low temperature for consumer applications, but high energy density, and environmentally clean for EV applications. Besides, this technology has broad commercial applications, such as portable video cameras, cellular phones, portable computers and electric vehicles. The low cost, environmental safety, and high performance of this dual intercalating battery technology will promote immediate commercialization.

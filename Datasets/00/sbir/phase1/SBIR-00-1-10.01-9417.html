<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR> Sub-Micron Particle Removal From Gas-Water Mixtures Without Flow Restrictions <BR>

<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The removal of sub-micron sized particles from an aqueous stream based on electrostatic 
<br>attraction is proposed.  The system will remove suspended particles from a gas-water-
<br>solid mixture with minimal flow restrictions.  This is particularly important for the 
<br>removal of fine alumina particles in the outlet stream from the Volatile Removal 
<br>Assembly (VRA), since high pressures are required to force the gas-water mixture 
<br>through a small pore collection filter.  Electrophoretic particle removal will result in 
<br>direct capture on the oppositely charged surface of removal media or an electrode, or by 
<br>collection of larger aggregates formed at such surfaces on a large pore filter. Zeta 
<br>potential is a measure of the effective surface charge on suspended particles.  For oxides, 
<br>the zeta potential varies strongly with pH, reaching zero at the isoelectric pH.  The zeta 
<br>potential is negative at pHs above this value, and positive at pHs below it.  Particle 
<br>collection by removal media requires an opposite polarity zeta potential, or alternatively, 
<br>an electrode with the proper surface potential at the pH of interest.  The Phase I effort will 
<br>demonstrate feasibility.  The Phase II project will result in the delivery of a prototype 
<br>scaled to handle the nominal VRA flow rates.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 It is anticipated that a particle removal system based on the electrostatic interaction of 
<br>very fine particles in water with removal media will have numerous commercial 
<br>applications.  Foremost among these will be as Flight Hardware purchased by NASA, or 
<br>by an aerospace contracting firm on behalf of NASA, to provide enhanced capability in 
<br>support of the water processor aboard the International Space Station (ISS).  Terrestrial 
<br>applications include replacement of conventional filtration techniques for particulate 
<br>control in water systems.  The removal of extremely fine particles without large pressure 
<br>drops associated with fine filtration is a leading candidate.   High value products that are 
<br>susceptible to adsorption on conventional filter elements are another area of potential 
<br>application.  Many commercial processes require the addition of flocculating agents to 
<br>remove products or wastes from the process stream.  Extensive washing of flocked 
<br>aggregates is required to complete the process, adding expense and time to the overall 
<br>process.  The utilization of electrostatic flocculation methods can greatly simplify this 
<br>requirement and improve profitability.  It is anticipated that as a result of the Phase II 
<br>effort, UMPQUA Research Company (URC) will develop a technology demonstrator to 
<br>help market this process.

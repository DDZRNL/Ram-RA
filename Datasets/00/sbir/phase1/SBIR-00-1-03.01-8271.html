<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR>
MagLev Launch Propulsion for LoFLYTE&reg; Waverider Unmanned Aerial Vehicle<BR>
<P>
<hr><BR>
<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Accurate Automation, teamed with PRT Advanced Maglev Systems, will work together 
to perform flight test experiments for launching the LoFLYTE&reg; UAV from NASA 
Marshall Space Flight Center&#146;s 100-foot outdoor Maglev track. The goal of 
the Phase I program is to lay the foundation for a Phase II flight test program 
that will demonstrate the use of the Maglev track to launch a hypersonic configuration 
UAV. To achieve this goal we will prepare detailed designs for modifications to 
the LoFLYTE&reg; aircraft to mate it with the release mechanism designed by PRT 
Advanced Maglev Systems. The successful completion of this flight test program 
will set the stage for the incorporation of Maglev launch systems for both high-speed 
aircraft and next-generation Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLV) with the goal of reducing 
gross takeoff weight, thereby drastically reducing the cost of launching payloads 
into space.<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The obvious commercialization of this technology is to U.S. Government applications, 
but the non-Government commercial potential is also vast. We anticipate Government 
Phase III customers for the product, primarily DoD, NASA and/or their prime contractors. 
We also will market the system to the civilian UAV industry. The Phase II follow-on 
to the proposed program will be an actual flight test program of the LoFLYTE&reg; 
UAV being launched from the NASA Marshall Maglev track. The ultimate Phase III 
commercialization will be the incorporation of this technology into a real launch 
vehicle or high speed aircraft with the goal of reducing gross takeoff weight.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The inexpensive, versatile micro-machined mass spectrometer (IVM^{2}-MS) is envisioned as a inexpensive replacement for large, complex, macroscopic instruments in use in the field and in the laboratory. At its core it is a  180 degree magnetic deflection mass filter fabricated from Si wafers. A small vacuum chamber for mass separation with an entrance slit and exit slit are micro-machined from the wafer by anistropic etching. An acceleration grid is built over the entrance slit and a small faraday cup built around the exit slit using standard lithographic methods. On the largest dimension they are on the order of 1.5 millimeters, with different accelerator to collector distances useful for changing the m/Z tuning characteristics of the filter. Arrays of such small mass filters can be created on a single wafer, and multichannel detection becomes trivial. Funding is requested to fabricate such a device and perform an elementary proof-of-concept study.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 The inexpensive, versatile micro-machined mass spectrometer (IVM^{2}-MS) is envisioned as a inexpensive replacement for large, complex, macroscopic instruments in use in the field and in the laboratory. These microscopic chemical sensing devices would be robust enough to be used in demanding hazard detection work on board spacecraft and at launch sites, small enough to be mounted to EVA equipment, and inexpensive enough to be used in a variety of less demanding chemical sensing applications. They would be simple and small enough to allow for arrays of mass filters to operate in parallel, allowing for simple, multichannel mass spectroscopy. 
<br>The need for inexpensive, versatile mass spectrometers does not end with space exploration. The market for chemical sensors already spans the military, security, research, and industrial sectors of the economy. A versatile micro-machined mass spectral analyzer such as the IVM^{2}-MS would fit the chemical detection needs of many at a substantially lower initial price, lower total cost of ownership, and with greater reliability. Although not a replacement for ultra-high resolution instruments used in some research applications, it frees many end-users from large, cumbersome, high maintenance macroscopic instruments. Further, the introduction of a low cost versatile chemical sensing instruments would have the potential to create new possible applications in the home and workplace.

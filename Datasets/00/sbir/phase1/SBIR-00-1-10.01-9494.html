<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 The development of robust membrane oxygenation systems for microgravity and 
<br>hypogravity compatible dissolution of oxygen into flowing water streams such as 
<br>Biological Water Processor feed or recycle is proposed.  Multiphase gas-liquid flow 
<br>through catalyst particles or cells immobilized on solid supports can result in flow 
<br>channeling and in extreme cases, gas block (i.e., the requirement for extremely high 
<br>pressures to achieve fluid flow).  The potential for multiphase flow related problems is 
<br>significantly increased under low gravity conditions due to the weakening (or absence) of 
<br>buoyant forces which facilitate phase separations based upon density differences.  These 
<br>problems can be easily avoided by first dissolving the gas phase in the liquid phase and 
<br>then establishing single phase flow through the system.  We propose the development of 
<br>organic polymer/ceramic membrane based oxygenation systems, compatible with 
<br>operation at either elevated or ambient temperatures, and able to saturate an influent 
<br>aqueous stream flowing at rates corresponding to the requirements of ISS or ground based 
<br>ALS testing in the BioPlex facility.  Phase I will demonstrate feasibility; Phase II will 
<br>result in the design, fabrication, and thorough testing of a complete system to be delivered 
<br>to NASA at the end of the project.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 It is anticipated that, once fully developed, polymer/ceramic membrane oxygenators will 
<br>be incorporated into a variety of industrial scale reactors for the production of chemical 
<br>products.  Most probably, the greatest area of application will be in ceramic membrane 
<br>reactors, where the permeation of oxygen across the full length of the catalyst bed will 
<br>minimize concentration gradients, and thereby enhance the efficiency of oxidation 
<br>reactions.  The primary NASA related commercial application will be as Flight Hardware 
<br>to provide advanced capabilities aboard ISS or in support of future long duration manned 
<br>operations, such as a Mars Mission or Lunar Base.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Foster-Miller will demonstrate high strength isotropic aluminum and copper alloy matrix composite materials to produce lightweight rocket engine oxygen and hydrogen turbopump housings. These materials have the potential to provide the key rocket engines materials requirements: high specific strength over the relevant service temperature range, excellent environmental resistance, and low-cost, net-shape fabrication.  Foster-Miller proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of producing high strength alumina reinforced composites with Al and Cu matrices using a Foster-Miller proprietary process. During Phase I, Al and Cu-matrix composite materials will be produced and tested, and compared with currently used and potential (experimental) turbopump housing materials.
<br>
<br>Our team includes a component producer partner and a rocket engine integrator. These partners will be involved in steering the program so as to develop an innovative technology that is well suited for scale-up and industrial implementation. The follow-on Phase II program will initially prove repeatability in materials properties, and then build and validate MMC turbopump housing demonstration articles with a support from team members.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Our proprietary fabrication process will provide, low cost route to a net shape Al and Cu-matrix alloy composite components. The primary application being investigated is rocket engine turbopump housings. This technology is enabling technology for Reusable Launch Vehicle rocket engines. Other rocket applications exist as lightweight replacement materials for nickel and ferrous superalloy components. Many applications also exist in gas turbine engines, diesel engines, automotive brake systems, and industrial equipment such as power generation, mining, and oil drilling.

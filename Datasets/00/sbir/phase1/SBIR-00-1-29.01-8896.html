<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
   The large effective cross-section at optical wavelengths, of even small retroflectors makes them an attractive option for long distance ranging.
<br>   Visidyne proposes to demonstrate, using an innovative combination of newly available optical component technologies, and advanced signal processing, the capability to range, measure range rate and bearing to a target satellite from initial acquisition to the docking phase.  Unique about the proposed concept is that it can be optimized for a wide range of update rates from the very low at long distances to high during the critical docking phase.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
An ability to measure at substantial stand-off distance, range, range rate, bearing and even attitude has substantial commercial potential not presently being met, i.e., for assembly and turning up large structures; aircraft, bridges, oil drilling platforms, etc.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
To build lower-cost and more-capable aerospace vehicles that are based on multifunctional structure and sensor systems necessitates innovative concepts and designs for assessment, test, and validation of design integrity. This, in turn, calls for a broadening of the tool set through the introduction of new kinds of design and analysis methods. To respond to this need, the proposed SBIR effort is intended to develop the Risk Assessment and Management Environment (RAME). As envisioned by Mr. Goldin, the Director of NASA, failure reports, maintenance actions, and operational experience should be tracked by tools and be used to update analytical models and data/knowledge bases in order to better predict future system performance and risk. Accordingly, RAME is intended to become a supervisory system that enforces design for safety and mission success, and enables learning from prior experiences. Unlike traditional analysis tools that play a passive role for system evaluation, RAME aims for actively escorting a system to undergo design, development, operation, and maintenance. Moreover, while its primary goal is to validate a system, RAME will facilitate validation of mathematical models, in terms of cause-effect relations, parameter values, etc., and thus be able to offer convincing risk-assessment results and risk-management recommendations.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
As RAME will enforce stringent risk assessment and management practice, the results of this effort are anticipated to benefit a wide variety of mission-critical or safety-critical applications for which undiscovered or unmitigated effects of faults in design, development, operation or maintenance may result in severe consequence. In particular, the potential commercial market of the resulting techniques and tools includes commercial aviation industries, air-traffic control systems, nuclear power plants, and medical industries. Moreover, RAME is anticipated to effectively promote the combined use of qualitative and quantitative methods, and knowledge/rule based techniques, and thus will accelerate the transferring of state-of-the-art enabling technologies developed by research communities to real applications.

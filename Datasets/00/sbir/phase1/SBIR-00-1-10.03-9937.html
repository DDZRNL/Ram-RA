<B>PROJECT TITLE</B><BR> Speckle-Free, Hand-Held, Ultrasound Imaging System for Space Missions <BR>

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Ultrasound imaging has long been the preferred modality for diagnostic evaluation of acute physiological conditions. However, current B-scan ultrasound, based on a fan of echoes, is very difficult to understand and requires specialized training to interpret. In this program, we propose to develop a speckle-free ultrasound imaging system which is low power, low cost, and can be made in a handheld format. The images generated from this system are striking for their radiographic appearance and lack of unwanted ultrasound artifacts. The system could be used to diagnose a variety of acute conditions as well as guide therapies during surgery. 
<br>
<br>The solution proposed by Imperium is based on a proprietary 2-D monolithic integrated array in which a piezoelectric material is deposited on a CMOS integrated circuit, much like an infrared imaging array.  The lens-based device produces video quality images which unlike current ultrasound systems, requires no special training to interpret.  The proposed solution is a high resolution, real-time, speckle-free, portable, ruggedized camera which will allow for a Crew Medical Officer (CMO) to immediately diagnose internal features and organs. Alternatively, the device could be used to assess the air bubbles in the bloodstream both during and after space flights.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Imperium is focused on the development of next-generation ultrasound imaging systems.  We have identified four areas of commercial application for these systems.  These are medical imaging, non-destructive testing, industrial imaging, and undersea imaging.  Imperium is pursuing the deployment of commercial systems in these areas and the research proposed to support NASA's mission is directly applicable.
<br>	
<br>The ultrasound camera that is the object of the research will be commercially significant. It will provide non-specializing clinicians with a high resolution image for diagnosis. The system is a low cost design and compatible with standard video equipment. The images generated are similar to x-ray flouroscopy and easily interpretable. Furthermore, the same technique which will allow NASA to assess acute physiological conditions can image delaminations in composite materials.  The same technique used to view corrosion hidden under paint can also be used to view foreign objects in a soda can.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Physical Sciences, Inc. (PSI) has developed a novel method of producing thin film membranes for solar sails, based upon an adapted literature method.  The PSI process has been used to make highly reflective membranes with an areal density of 0.125 g/m2.  The Gossamer design for very lightweight solar sails that utilize photons for propulsion requires very large areas (>10,000 m2) and with low mass.  The current solar sail concepts involve terrestrial fabrication of ultra-thin polymer films, seaming the films together, launching the sail into orbit, and deploying the sail without damaging these ultra-thin films.  The present state-of-the-art polymer materials, and polymer thin film processing technologies are unlikely to permit tear and defect free solar sail launch and deployment without a true materials or processing breakthrough. The PSI process will rapidly produce large area polymeric membranes in space that meet the mechanical, areal density, space durability, cost, and propulsion requirements of the NASA solar sailing missions.  The processes will be further developed during a Phase II effort for the in space fabrication of solar sails.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The PSI thin membrane technology is focused on the production of membranes for solar sail applications, with very unique materials requirements.  Terrestrial applications of this membrane fabrication process include improved membranes for gas separation, improved multi-layer plastic barrier packaging, specialty bandages and other markets that could utilize thin polymer membranes.

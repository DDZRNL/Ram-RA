<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Future NASA missions and nanosat applications demand the highest performance microelectronics and this generally leads to use of commercial products.  These microelectronics must also operate in the natural radiation environment of space. The goal of this work is to reduce the threat of single event latchup (SEL) to commercial microelectronics processed by standard foundry methods and thereby enable their use in space systems.  The constraint is that no circuit redesign or process change to the foundry should be required.  The technical concept being investigated is aggressive thinning the Si substrate below the active region of the surface CMOS circuitry.  The thinned substrate generates less charge when an ion penetrates and this raises the effective LET threshold for SEL.  Because of the rapidly decreasing flux of energetic ions in space as LET is increased, a small increase in effective LET threshold provides a large decrease in SEL-causing flux, leveraging the SEL rate reduction.  In addition, the reduced charge collection volume reduces the probability that an ion will penetrate the sensitive volume, further reducing the SEL probability.  Availability of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) microelectronics that are immune to SEL will enable NASA system designers to achieve the advanced space missions that are planned.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
All commercial and government implementation of space systems is faced with the challenge of using unhardened commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) microelectronics in the radiation environments of space.  This project will be performed with United States Semiconductor, Inc. (US Semi) as subcontractor, which provides a clear path for commercialization of the SEL mitigation approach.  US Semi serves the space community by re-selling COTS microelectronics after making them more radiation-tolerant through various post-processing methods.  US Semi?s proprietary, patented process thinning process, designated RHI-NO? (Radiation Hardened Integrated circuit-NO redesign) is based on two exclusive licenses from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  The thinning process instills improvements in chip tolerance of radiation effects, independent of the fabrication process.  It enables satellite and military system designers to use commercial parts that may not have been available in the past because of radiation performance problems. RHI-NO?  will also be deployed in the development of proprietary families of chips and multi-chip modules, directed at high volume customer requirements.  The results of this project will feed directly into the commercialization plans of US Semi and will become available to commercial and government spacecraft designers.

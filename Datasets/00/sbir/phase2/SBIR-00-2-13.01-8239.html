<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Management of the earth's delicate marine environment is becoming a critical aspect in maintaining a healthy planet.  While mankind's presence and activities have a continuing impact on all of our oceans, nowhere is the interaction more delicate than at the complex interface between land and water in our coastal ecosystems.  The objective of the proposed effort is the development of a tool specifically designed to provide effective characterization and monitoring of these environments. The proposed sensor will  provide five bands of spectral imagery at wavelengths ranging from the ultraviolet to near infrared along with a thermal band.  Imagery will be acquired with a compact-portable sensor that provides direct acquisition of pixel-registered, geo-referenced imagery at resolutions of 1900x1080 or 1600x1200 per band.  The system will be configured in a compact, portable package that can be implemented on a variety of platforms.  Several features will be incorporated to provide high sensitivity and a large dynamic range.  The sensor will be calibrated and characterized to enable conversion of acquired digital numbers to true reflectance data.  Interfaces to the front-end and back-end software tools that are the heart of the practical applications of remotely sensed data will be developed.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed technology has a large commercial potential in the remote sensing market along with several other healthy markets.  The products resulting from this program will deliver outstanding image and data quality at a price point that creates an entirely new segment of the rapidly expanding remote sensing market.  The portable configuration, performance, and cost effectiveness are key strategic factors that will cause the technology to be adopted for applications ranging from precision agriculture to emergency response and municipal planning.  In addition to the remote sensing market, this high-resolution color and spectral imaging technology is one of the major growth segments of the machine vision and medical imaging markets.  Additional opportunities exist for products targeted at microscopy and entertainment/special effects applications.  There is a high confidence for successful commercialization of the proposed imaging technology illustrated by the growing presence of the offering company, Duncan Technologies, in the imaging market.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The goal of the proposed Phase II program is to further develop a family of novel synthetic muscle systems with robotic sensing and actuation capabilities for a wide spectrum of NASA space robotics and EVA applications.  In particular, configurations of interest are in the form of contractile fiber-like linear actuators.  The fact that the proposed synthetic fibrous muscles function well in the cold harsh environment of space and yet are biomimetic and noiseless is of significance to NASA related space missions.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The synthetic muscle systems with robotic sensing and soft actuation capabilities can be also utilized for terrestrial actuators, sensors, and transducers applications due to their unique performance.

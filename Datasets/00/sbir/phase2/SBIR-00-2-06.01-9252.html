<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Fixed vane vortex generators (VGs) have been in existence for over 50 years and as yet no other flow control device or technique has proven to be as cost effective.  This is perhaps surprising since studies using flow control by blowing and suction, use of synthetic jets to energize a boundary layer, etc. have been going on for some time. Fixed VGs are still being fitted to commercial jetliners currently manufactured due to their simplicity and the fact that VGs can be surface mounted.  For these reasons, VGs are preferred over leading competing concepts that require modification and /or plumbing beneath the aircraft skin.  However, once the VG has been configured to improve performance in one flight regime,there is an off design penalty.  This proposal details a program to improve upon the fixed VG by making them deployable ?on demand? and thereby eliminating any penalty when the generators are stowed.  The enabling technology to accomplish this is to use Shape Memory Alloy materials to deploy the generators.  Because of their unique force/stroke characteristics it is possible to design surface mounted vortex generators so that they have no aerodynamic penalty when not deployed and require no surface cut-out.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
On demand vortex generators can replace all fixed vane generators currently
<br>in use as well as allow designers to find additional applications where
<br>fixed vane generators would give unacceptable off-design penalties.
<br>Control of separated flow about a helicopter rotor hub and fuselage, since
<br>a helicopter operates in a dual mode, is a new use for an on demand device.
<br>General aviation applications may reduce landing speed and mitigate stall.

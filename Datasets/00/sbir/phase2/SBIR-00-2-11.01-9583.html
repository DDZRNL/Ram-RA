<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed Phase II R&D plan focuses on the development of an innovative Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition (CCVD) process for the production of unagglomerated nanopowders of uniform size, crystallinity and composition.  The project is designed primarily to exploit reduced buoyancy in a microgravity environment to accelerate the development and commercialization of ground-based technology for production of advanced materials for use in electronics and electro-optics.  Candidate materials are cerium oxide, doped and undoped zinc oxide (ZnO) (for displays), barium-strontium-titanate (for advanced dielectrics), and metal nanoparticles (for catalysis).  A related goal of this effort is to use the knowledge about microgravity-grown material behavior to improve ground-based thin-film production capabilities.  The powders will be collected during experiments in KC-135 and characterized for microstructure, stoichiometry and physical properties as a function of process variables.  Results from the microgravity experiments will be used to develop model of the CCVD process and to optimize conditions for ground-based pilot-scale production.  Potential industrial partners have been identified and recruited for the proposed effort.  Successful completion of Phases II and III will result in a cost effective, commercially viable process for production of advanced nanopowder materials for catalysis, electronics, pigments, and structural industry.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Nanotechnology has attained both nation and market significance.  Nanopowders constitute an important embodiment of nanotechnology in multiple industries including catalysts, electronics, health care, energy storage, and power generation.  Nanopowders represent a huge commercial opportunity with the market size reaching $2 billion by the end of the decade. Although the proposed experimental study will be conducted using ground and drop-tower based experiments, the ultimate goal is to develop a commercially viable system for mass production of nanoparticles for advanced applications. Specifically, success in this effort would benefit electronics, catalysis, pigments, and polishing industry.  Several industrial partners have been recruited.

<P><B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>Mod Works Engineering Inc. 
proposes to apply AGATE developed technology to create a Fully Integrated small 
Aircraft Cockpit that will enable retrofitted and newly constructed aircraft to 
operate within the envisioned Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) 
environment. Emerging flat plate display Primary Flight Displays (PFD), 
Multi-function Displays, Graphic Display Unit, Digitally Integrated 
Stabilization and Control devices, switches, panel hardware and controls will be 
integrated in an automotive type lean manufacturing design process. The goal is 
to develop technology to reduce the cost of designing, constructing, 
integrating, simulator testing, and airborne testing of fully integrated 
aircraft cockpits. <BR><BR>The technological challenges are to apply virtual 
reality based development tools to conventional cockpits in a manner that 
reduces direct costs, development cycles, and the certification process. We must 
prove the concept of scenario base evaluation to optimize the operational 
characteristics of aircraft cockpits. Success of this concept expand the 
opportunity to develop highly functional and effective systems to reduce work 
load and increase safety of aircraft operation. This technology application 
supports the mission and goals of the SATS program. <BR><BR><BR>
<P><B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>Commercial products are the 
justification for the technology development. Product goals are VAV, an aircraft 
stability and control system that provides full time-on pitch and roll 
stability. GDU, a Graphic operational depicter that provides information to the 
pilot in a logical sequential manor creating a virtual flight instructor in the 
cockpit. An Integrated Instrument Panel will be manufactured for new aircraft 
and retrofit markets. Flight Training Devices are being designed as a spin-off 
of the technological development. Manufacturing of a low cost FTD level III 
simulator is a specific goal of this program. <BR><BR>Demand for the products 
under development has already been established during public displays throughout 
the phase I effort. Our proven track record of quality high tech products will 
be continued with the technical success of this project. <BR>

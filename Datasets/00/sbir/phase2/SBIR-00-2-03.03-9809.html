<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This work will focus on evaluating lower cost PIP processing of C-SiC composites for thick-section and large volume components such as blisk turbomachinery, nozzles, ramps, thrust chambers, ducting and other hot structures. A significant barrier to using composites in these applications involves processing limitations with respect to part size and volume.  Processing routes utilizing chemical vapor deposition/infiltration (CVD/CVI) require high-temperature pressure reactors and rely on time/temperature dependent diffusion.  As a result, CVD/CVI facility reactor dimensions limits the maximum part size while process physics limit the practical thickness/volume of parts to be infiltrated.  Polymer infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) processing may overcome such limitations.  Although significant development has been done in the PIP processing of SiC/SiC systems, little work has been done with PIP C/SiC CMCs.  Insufficient data and material properties exist for PIP processed thick cross section parts, which has hindered acceptance and application of this process.  The work proposed here provides a baseline mechanical property database for PIP processed C-SiC CMCs, and provides the initial evaluation of thick section composites processed using the PIP approach and incorporating the latest advancements in process cost and schedule reductions.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The materials developed in this program will apply directly to the NASA Space Launch Initiative (SLI).  Both the 2nd Generation of reusable launch vehicles (RLVs) and 3rd Generation programs (Hypersonics) require advancements in CMCs, which are recognized as a critical material system that can improve safety and reduce cost.  CMCs will allow increased operating temperatures while reducing the weight of propulsion systems.  Cf/SiC CMCs are expected to find additional applications in turbomachinery, thermal protection systems, hot structures, control surfaces, and other components.  The results of this program will be immediately applicable to on-going work of Boeing Rocketdyne Propulsion & Power for advanced high-temperature propulsion systems for the second generation of RLVs.  An increased understanding of PIP processed materials, and demonstration of thick section PIP processing will extend the application of this material system.  This work also sets the stage for potential use of PIP processed CMC materials for 3rd generation spacecraft propulsion systems including RBCC and solar thermal propulsion systems.  Other potential non-space related applications include next generation aircraft brakes and industrial furnace components. COIC is a full service organization capable of developing markets and transitioning advanced composite technologies to production.

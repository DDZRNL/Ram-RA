<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 The ultimate objective of the proposed project is the development of a practical onboard, inert-gas generation system for fuel tank inerting on commercial aircraft.  The system would also have the potential to produce:  (1) inert gas (and/or liquid) for fire suppression, and/or (2) liquid oxygen for the emergency breathing supply system.  The system is based on compact cryogenic air separation technology originally developed for the Air Force's C-17 aircraft.  However, since the requirements for commercial aircraft are vastly different from military aircraft, significant adaptation is required.  As compared with other approaches to onboard gas generation for large transport aircraft applications (e.g., molecular sieves or semi-permeable membranes), cryogenic air separation requires less bleed air and less power, and has similar system weight and size.  During the successful Phase I effort, we developed system specifications, produced a preliminary design, identified key technology elements that require further development, and produced a preliminary system design for a future flight test.  In Phase II, we will demonstrate the core air separation technology components at full scale for full-time inerting of a 747 center wing tank.  We will also define the palletized system flight test to be conducted during Phase III.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
A commercial aircraft fuel tank inerting system has significant business potential.  Rules potentially forthcoming from the FAA may require that fuel tank ullage be inerted on commercial aircraft during a significant portion of the operational envelope.  This would create an immediate, large and ongoing market for this technology.  For large to medium sized aircraft, the technology proposed here is more attractive than alternative approaches such as molecular sieves and semi-permeable membranes.  The primary advantages are lower bleed air and electrical power requirements.  In addition, the proposed technology offers the potential to produce liquid nitrogen for fire suppression and liquid oxygen for emergency breathing supplies.  Other approaches do not offer these potential benefits.

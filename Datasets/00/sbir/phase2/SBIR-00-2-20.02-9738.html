<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposed SBIR Phase II will be addressed to the further development of thermally stable high temperature ignition catalysts, their optimization for mechanical strength and erosion resistance, and their employment in laboratory scale propulsion devices.  Catalysts were found in Phase I to provide activity comparable to alumina supported iridium (Shell 405) but with preferable thermal stability characteristics.  Preferred materials will be  first compositionally and morphologically optimized and then incorporated into appropriate forms.  Optimization will be assisted by the measurement of materials properties such as mechanical strength.  An important target will be the elimination of pulverization of catalyst pellets or other forms of the materials.  The forms will be tested for activity and longevity under operating conditions which will then be incorporated into laboratory scale devices such as microthrusters.  Testing of catalysts under such conditions will result in the identification of preferred catalyst systems and specifications for the ignition of HAN-based monopropellants using these catalysts systems.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
If successful, the proposed program will result in the identification of thermally stable catalysts and catalyst operating and use specifications for the ignition of monopropellants.  Additional applications would be found in combustion and incineration.  Companies involved in the  manufacture of catalysts and systems for propulsion as well as those entities concerned with catalytic combustion or incineration would find interest in the proposed catalysts.

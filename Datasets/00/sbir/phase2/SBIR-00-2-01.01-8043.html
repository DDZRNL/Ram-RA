<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Aircraft icing is a severe aviation weather hazard as the formation of ice on aircraft surfaces can lead to degradation in aerodynamic performance due to increase in drag and weight, and decrease in lift and stall speed. Today, there are limited ice detection systems available that warn pilots of icing due to their high acquisition and certification costs.  During the Phase I program, IDI developed a proof of concept windshield mount infrared icing advisory system for detecting both icing conditions ahead of the aircraft as well as ice buildup on the windshield surface. Technical feasibility of the forward-looking system concept was established using a dual wavelength infrared (IR) laser source and detection approach. A low cost visible wavelength was demonstrated for local icing condition and windshield ice detection.  The proposed Phase II program will develop a multi wavelength IR system with ranging and cloud property assessment capability, to provide the pilot critical distance and icing severity of the approaching weather front. The Phase II prototype system performance will be demonstrated in the near and far field using various ground, flight, and icing tunnel environments. Sensitivity of the proposed IR system for the detection of dangerous freezing rain and Super-cooled  Liquid  Droplets (SLD) will also be evaluated. Successful development of a low cost icing advisory system will provide GA pilots a level of flight safety currently unavailable.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Applications for the proposed ICIRIS icing advisory system include OEM business jets, small general aviation aircraft, as well as commuter airline fleets.  A battery operated retrofit version of this technology would be ideal for the existing GA fleet owners who operate in IMC, and currently use visual cues to determine icing conditions.  More importantly, the proposed system will demonstrate the capability to detect real time IFR conditions ahead of the aircraft, thus preventing VFR pilots from entering dangerous IMC conditions, currently one of the largest source of in-flight aviation accident fatalities

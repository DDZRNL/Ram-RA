<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
AEC-Able Engineering Co., Inc. (ABLE) has invented a method for inclusion of elastic memory composite (EMC) structural elements in a high-performance ultra-light deployable CoilABLE truss with ultra-low stowed volume.  By integrating EMC materials within a heritage CoilABLE mast system, performance of can be increased 3X in bending stiffness and 3X in strength, for an equal mass per unit length!  The CoilABLE EMC structural performance is superior to inflatable/rigidizable solutions while offering significantly reduced deployment risk.  The proposed Phase 2 program will demonstrate the feasibility and deployment of a CoilABLE EMC Engineering Model structure designed for an ?SSP-type? space truss application.  The successful validation of the proposed Phase 2 hardware demonstration will ready this unique technology for space flight.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The specific commercial product resulting from the proposed program will be a linearly deployable CoilABLE Elastic Memory Composite (EMC) structure suitable for extremely large space frame truss structures and/or stand-alone deployers for deploying instruments, payloads and/or solar array systems to replace traditional systems.  This system will have discriminating performance advantages that will clearly separate it from the competition.  These major discriminating features will include remarkably improved stiffness and strength per unit mass and low stowed volume.  The proposed system will be strongly desired as enabling for current and future government and commercial missions currently relying on relatively mass inefficient traditional solutions, or risky inflatable/rigidizable concepts.
<br>
<br>The proposed Phase 2 program has been structured to accelerate the commercialization of this technology and ready it for space flight in approximately three years.  If the technology is proven worthy during the proposed program, then ABLE is committed to commercializing the developed system as an ABLE product.  ABLE has a demonstrated history of strategic investment, commercializing numerous technologies such as the ADAM mast, FASTMast, and numerous solar array system products.  ABLE is committed to commercializing the CoilABLE EMC structure in a similar manner for the benefit of future missions.

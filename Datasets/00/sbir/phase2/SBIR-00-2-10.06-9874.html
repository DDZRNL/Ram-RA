<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This project develops a Vaporizing Heat Sink (VHS) that is a lightweight, 
<br>passive, open-cycle heat sink based on the vaporization of water into 
<br>vacuum (or rarified atmosphere) at near ambient temperature. Water is 
<br>encapsulated in a lightweight package having an internal structural 
<br>carbon-fiber wick that provides good heat transfer between the working 
<br>fluid and the input heat transfer surface. A simple relief valve controls 
<br>the vaporization pressure and determines the heat sink operation
<br>temperature. 
<br>
<br>The VHS offers ten-times higher specific capacity (~ 2.5 MJ/kg) than 
<br>competing melting-paraffin heat sinks and thus offers a weight-saving 
<br>alternative suited for single-cycle uses such as reentry applications. 
<br>
<br>Phase 2 will develop conductive carbon fiber structural wicks, reliable 
<br>pressure relieve valves, and acquire VHS performance data for model 
<br>validation. A Prototype VHS shall be tested in a thermal-vacuum environment 
<br>at all gravity orientations. A Prototype VHS, designed and tested for use 
<br>with existing spacecraft batteries, will be delivered.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Lightweight vaporizing heat sinks have application to reentry spacecraft 
<br>component thermal control. For example, the X-38/CRV batteries and power 
<br>converters require transient thermal control where this technology can be 
<br>applied with significant weight saving over existing baseline technology. 
<br>The technology also offers compact heat sinks for high flux electronics, 
<br>pulsed high energy laser systems, and precision temperature control of 
<br>laser diode systems.

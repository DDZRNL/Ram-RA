<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Multichannel Scaler (MCS) electronics are used in lidar-based photon counting applications.  Phase-I resulted in a highly integrated, low power, USB-based MCS hardware prototype and Windows-based software. Phase-II will focus on creating a flexible lidar data acquisition system using the Phase-I MCS as a basis.  This complete system will meet the needs of multiple programs due to the array of functionality provided.  For example, one program might require a single channel with high resolution and little memory space, while another program might require many channels, moderate resolution, and large memory space.  In addition to the primary objective of building a complete system, ASRC Aerospace intends to develop several "stand-alone" MCS cards which can each be used in a customer's own data acquisition system.  These cards may offer:  higher resolution, multiple user-selectable bin size settings, more memory per channel, or more channels.  Additionally, card-level changes may result in the inclusion of a higher throughput bus implementation.  The developed system may use all or some of these cards, thereby providing maximum flexibility for the end-user.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Multichannel Scaler (MCS) electronics are used in ground-based, airborne, and space-based lidar photon counting applications such as:
<br>
<br>Atmospheric studies
<br>Sub-surface carbon studies
<br>Portable analysis of toxic plumes
<br>Time-of-flight ion mass spectroscopy
<br>Time-correlated single-photon counting
<br>Phosphorescence lifetime measurements
<br>
<br>Due to the programmable nature of the proposed lidar data system, the Phase-II developments will be applicable across many different programs in both commerical and government institutions.

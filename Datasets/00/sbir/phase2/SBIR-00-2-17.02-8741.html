<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The results of the SBIR Phase I verified the performance of Xinetics? Integrated Large Scale Zonal Meniscus Mirror concept and an in-depth manufacturing study confirmed the feasibility of producing it. Intended for use as the primary mirror for beam directors and imaging telescopes, the ultralightweight, active mirror combines the desirable material properties of a silicon carbide substrate with electroactive ceramic actuators embedded in it to control the figure of the mirror. The proposed project will build a 1.3 meter, f/4 spherical mirror with a 0.030mm rms surface figure after correction and a micro-roughness less than 20 Angstroms rms. Its areal density, including actuators, will be 11 Kg/m2, with a goal of 8 Kg/m2. Using Xinetics? CERAFORM silicon carbide process we will produce a lightweight rib-stiffened meniscus substrate to near-net shape and, after polishing, embed in it our PMN actuators. Three sets of bipods will then be attached to mount the mirror to a test fixture. We will use our XiMUX  electronics to drive the actuators during interferometric testing to verify performance, which will be demonstrated by correcting 1g deflections and by producing surface shapes corresponding to Zernike terms 4 through 21.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
CERAFORM SiC is well-positioned to penetrate the non-specialty mirror market as well. Laser mirrors for commercial welding systems are typically several thousand dollars each in small sizes. Xinetics recently delivered 2 inch optics for $2,000 and 6 inch optics for $6,000. These mirrors were polished to l/10 peak-to-valley at 0.63-mm with a surface finish of better than 20-?-rms. Xinetics recently funded Kodak to polish a 20-inch diameter sphere at a cost of $45,000 and has received a recent quote for a 1-meter diameter sphere at a cost of $100,000. In 1998,we stated that polishing cost must be reduced by an order of magnitude to enable SiC to be cost competitive with metal based laser mirrors. These costs presented here represent an order of magnitude cost reduction over the past 3 years and effectively enables SiC to compete directly with glass and metal based mirrors. The proposed program combines near net shape forming and agile polishing to greatly mitigate the cost of making precision aspheric optics and high quality laser mirrors. It is our intent to reduce the cost of making aspheric specialty optics by an order of magnitude to facilitate programs such as NGST and TPF. Silicon carbide provides superior performance and delivery schedule to conventional metal mirrors and provides a much more cost and schedule effective solution.

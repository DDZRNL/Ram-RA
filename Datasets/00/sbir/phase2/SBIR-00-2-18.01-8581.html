<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 	
<br>	The Phase I results provided the technology basis for membrane mirror manufacturing without high-cost, high-precision molds or mandrels.  The potential for the manufacturing technology to produce optical quality membrane mirrors for space applications was established and the art for producing improved performance low-cost membrane solar collectors and antennas was significantly advanced.  Doubly-curved membrane mirror substrates were produced that had improved surface smoothness using various film materials including polyimides with low coefficients of thermal expansion.  The capability to numerically simulate the manufacturing processes was demonstrated.
<br>	The Phase II effort will refine the membrane mirror manufacturing technology through expanded process simulation, tooling design enhancement, and additional process parameter control.  The numerical simulations will be used to correlate process parameter values with high shape accuracy and surface finish smoothness.  These parameter values will guide the process tooling design modifications.  The result will be higher quality membrane mirrors that could enable new generations of large space-based telescopes that meet the agency's goal of 0.1 kg/m2 area density.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The manufacturing technology will produce high-performance solar collectors for solar thermal orbit transfer vehicles for placement of satellites in geosynchronous and other high earth orbits and for high temperature materials processing in space.  The technology can be applied to large commercial communications satellites to provide lightweight, inflatable, self-rigidizing antenna support structures.

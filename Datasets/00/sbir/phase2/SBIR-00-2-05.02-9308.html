<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
	The proposed research is intended to develop a new analysis for stresses and displacements in aerospace structures based on the combined conventional Displacement (Stiffness) Method and on a new formulation of  the Force Method developed  by the principal investigator.  Since some of the elements used currently in the Displacement Method violate equations of stress equilibrium, an additional analysis by the Force Method in which element stresses do not violate the equations of equilibrium will provide bracketing on the solution (i.e. upper and lower bounds on stresses and displacements) thereby ensuring greater confidence in numerical results.  Since the Force Method stresses are derived directly from internal forces they are more accurate than the stresses in the Displacement Method which requires differentiation of the displacement field within the element.  The method will be illustrated on a typical  multispar wing structure.  The current project at this time will address only the overall concept of modifying existing computer codes; however, the actual modification of a specific commercial code or codes and subsequent commercialization will be addressed as a follow-on project after the completion of Phase I.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The unique feature of  the new finite element software program for obtaining the upper and lower  bounds  solutions for structural computations should generate a great potential for commercial applications particularly in aerospace industry where high accuracy is needed because of the small factors of safety on the design loads. Also other industries where plate (panel) or hexahedral elements are used will be interested in using this new software. In particular, the shipbulding industry will welcome the new concept of analysis since the ship structures are usually modeled by panel elements. The main advantage of the new software will be that it will provide a new structural design tool with improved accuracy of the computed stresses and displacements.

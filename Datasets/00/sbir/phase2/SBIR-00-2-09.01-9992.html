<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Dynamic microscopy in the physical and biological sciences usually depends on specialized, investigator-built chambers. There are no standard instruments for the microscopic imaging of moving objects. The proposed innovation is a versatile slide for the observation of fluid phenomena using conventional light microscopes.  The slide consists of a hollow glass chamber and a robust holder.  The chamber is a commercially available part (4 x 0.5 x 100 mm hollow slide with a 0.17 mm wall), and the robust holder can be manufactured by the hundreds.  Research is proposed that leads to a holder-chamber assembly ("Dynascope") that can be activated by electric fields, magnetic fields, thermal gradients, pumped fluids and optical trap(s).  The Dynascope will be usable in low-gravity research on the ISS Light Microscopy Module and on other light microscopes for observing electrically, magnetically and capillary-induced movements in fluids, including electrophoresis, ferrofluidics, Marangoni flow, colloid assembly and stabilization, and cell locomotion using particle image velocimetry (PIV). Algorithms will analyze velocity data unique to magnetic and electrokinetic motion.  The Phase II research deliverable is a final report describing the research and the Dynascope and a prototype Dynascope suitable for attaching to the LMM laboratory module and for laboratory experiments.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Apart from the potential uses of the Dynascope observation platform and software by microgravity researchers on the International Space Station, the different modules of Dynascope have several applications in earth-bound laboratories.  There will be a magnetic module that will be sold into laboratories wanting to characterize magnetic particle dispersions, such as are used in life sciences research, controlled delivery of therapeutics, biological cell separation and identification, ferrofluid physics and scientific and industrial magnetorheology.  There will be an automated electrokinetic module for which the largest market is expected to consist of industrial and research laboratories measuring or studying the stability of colloids.  Measurements of colloidal stability by electrokinetics are performed in water quality analysis laboratories, the paints and coatings industries, industrial fine particles, emulsion research, blood research and the study of living biological cells.  Without the application of force fields the Dynascope observation platform and software packages are useful in the study of microscopic flows by Particle Image Velocimetry, capillary-induced convection in phase-changing systems, particle-particle interactions and the automated determination of motility distributions in populations of living biological cells.  SHOT is considering entering several of these marketplaces.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 In SAR and radar interferometric altimeter instruments, the transmit / receiving antennas are separated as far apart as possible to increase resolution in the signal.  This requires a stiff and dimensionally stable deployable mast to provide the necessary length between the two radar antennas.  Deployable mast length is constrained by available stowage volume, spacecraft platform attitude control constraints (such as deployed frequency) and the requirement for high stability under on-orbit thermal environments and accelerations.  AEC-ABLE has developed the "Stiff-Soft" ADAM (ABLE Deployable Articulated Mast) as an innovative solution for providing this deployable and extremely stable structure that uses stiff rods as one set of diagonals in the face of each bay of the mast.  These stiff rods have the benefit of greatly increasing shear and torsional stiffness of the mast as well as having low CTE relative to metallic cables, which are the conventional "soft" diagonals used for the ADAM.  The Phase I effort demonstrated the deployment kinematics of the stiff-soft ADAM design, the Phase II effort will build a working prototype to demonstrate deployment kinematics and validate the deployed stiffness and strength of the unit.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The commercial applications of an optimally performing synthetic aperture radar(SAR)or interferometric ocean altimeter are numerous and growing. Current and potential end data users are numerous and vary greatly in their imagery needs and desires for data a SAR/interferometric altimeter can provide. The future trend will be for these users to require higher fidelity/resolution data, necessitating the space-based SAR/radar altimeter hardware be built to achieve the highest stability and reliability, the topic addressed by this proposal. The commercial applications of SAR remote sensing of land/water areas are abundant. In addition to domestic and foreign governments, commercial users in telecommunications, nonrenewable extraction and forestry are all showing interest. An active imaging system, SAR sends and receives a scattered signal from the earth's surface, enabling the signal to "see through" clouds and some vegetation. Given the important advantages of SAR and the wide range of possible applications, the greatest challenge for this industry will be to keep up with demand from of end users. Environmental, natural resource management, disaster management, industrial planning, and surveying/mapping are some of the applications that will utilize high-resolution SAR data made available by the hardware to be addressed in this proposal. The benefits of higher resolution, all-weather remote sensing of mesoscale phenomena on the surface of the oceans (as will be obtained from the Wide Swath Ocean Altimeter instrument)include better tracking of currents and their relationship to weather patterns, wavelength and direction of wave systems and sea surface topography for determination of faster shipping lanes, environmental studies and management, and control of ocean natural resources.

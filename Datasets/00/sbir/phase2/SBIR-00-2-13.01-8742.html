<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The described DOLPHIN (Diving OpticaL Profiler and High-speed Integration Network) is a compact, towed body, integrated sensor system designed for rapid optical surveying and real-time realization of advanced data products.  The key DOLPHIN system components are a towed optical and hydrographic instrumentation package, a real-time, automated data integration, processing, and visualization network, and a discrete sampling system designed to continuously pump water from the towed package to the boat for analysis.  The goal of the system is to provide optical data sets ideally suited for fulfilling calibration and validation needs for NASA remote sensing applications, including aircraft-based and future space-based lidar technologies.  Phase-I research has focused on determining the optimal sensor package configuration needed to achieve this goal, laying out specifications and designs for each component of the DOLPHIN system, and evaluating the technical, commercial, and scientific feasibility of the proposed system.  Work addressing these overall objectives coupled with a successful field test of a prototypic DOLPHIN system have demonstrated that the development of the proposed DOLPHIN system is feasible.  With design work complete and feasibility demonstrated on several levels, we are now poised to develop and test the DOLPHIN in Phase-II.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The DOLPHIN will have immediate commercial applications in remote sensing validation research in oceanography and limnology.  We expect it to be particularly applicable to important up-and-coming NASA lidar technologies.  Although the need for synoptic remote sensing validation systems has existed for over 30 years at NASA, technological advances have only recently made the development of a complete, integrated validation system feasible.  Since WET Labs has been the unparalleled leader in developing and commercializing this technology in the form of high-end in-situ optical instrumentation and networking architecture, we believe we are uniquely capable of addressing this need and filling the market vacuum.  Because no comparable system currently exists and the required sensing technology can only be found at WET Labs, we believe we are well ahead of the competition in this pursuit.
<br>
<br>Synoptic surveying capabilities for in-situ optical and biogeochemical properties also harbors enormous market potential beyond immediate remote sensing needs, particularly in environment assessment (detecting and mapping red tides, sewage plumes, oil spills, etc.).  WET Labs has committed a focused marketing effort in Phase-III and beyond to expand the market for the DOLPHIN into these areas because of the substantial potential return.

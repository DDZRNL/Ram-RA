<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Thorleaf Research, Inc. has demonstrated feasibility in Phase I and now proposes a Phase II effort to develop a miniaturized, low power micro-sampling probe and programmable thermal desorption/pyrolysis inlet system to collect and prepare samples for in situ chemical analysis by GC/MS or other techniques.  The proposed innovation addresses an important  NASA technology gap for in situ Solar System measurements, mainly how to acquire and pre-process complex ice, soil and rock samples for chemical analysis while remaining within challenging mass, volume and power constraints.  Although miniaturized GC/MS and other low power instrumentation is currently under development by NASA for in situ measurements, the great potential of such instrumentation for the identification and characterization of biomarkers or early pre-biotic chemistry in the Solar System will not be realized without complementary developments in technology for the collection and pre-processing of relevant types of samples.  Since we intend to follow a modular design approach in our Phase II development, this core instrumentation can also be adapted for other NASA needs, such as monitoring for microbial contaminates in space habitats and process monitoring for the extraction of planetary resources.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Analysis of commercial instrumentation markets shows that two of the three major growth areas for analytical instrumentation are real-time analysis and environmental monitoring, with projected annual growth rates of more than 15%.   There is a significant technology gap for low power instrumentation that can be miniaturized for field use while retaining the analytical capability of larger laboratory instruments.  The proposed SBIR effort to develop a miniaturized, low power micro-sampling probe and programmable thermal desorption/pyrolysis inlet system for GC/MS or other techniques addresses this need in an innovative way, and thus technical developments in the proposed program could have a significant market impact.

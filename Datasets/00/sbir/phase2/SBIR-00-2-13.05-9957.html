<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Development of an Ultra-Stable Radiometer Receiver (UMRR) operating in the 1400-1426 MHz frequency band with a measurement precision of 0.05-0.10 K is proposed.   Recent developments in MEMS (Micro Electromechanical Machine Systems) and MIC (microwave integrated circuit) technology are utilized to achieve small size, lightweight and low power consumption.  Risk reduction experiments and mathematical simulations have been performed to support the predicted performance of the UMRR.  Automatic calibration circuitry for has been designed and partially tested.  A novel total-system calibrator that is inexpensive, easy to use, portable and adjustable throughout the 50-250 Kelvin range of radiometric brightness temperatures will be constructed and tested in conjunction with the UMRR. Flight tests of a single beam soil moisture radiometer are proposed to verify system performance. Deliverables for Phase II include 35 L-band receiver channels that will be used to upgrade the two-dimensional electronically steered thinned array radiometer (2D-ESTAR) system currently under development at NASA GSFC.  Phase III commercialization of this technology will result in low cost radiometers from soil moisture monitoring, forest fire management, and salinity mapping applications

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Phase I of this solar concentrator SBIR demonstrated the feasibility of forming and/or solvent casting accurate gores and seaming them together to construct a full F/D=0.68 concentrator.  Surface measurements conducted using videogrammetry on the mandrel, the formed gores, and the seamed gores of the concentrator have proven the soundness of the fundamental concept. A major achievement of Phase I was refinement of the stereolithography technique to make accurate inexpensive nickel-coated mandrels. This method can be used to make large gore mandrels by integrating less expensive small sections together. Phase I and other related programs (e.g., LRA, HPALM, etc.) addressed the sub component items of the solar concentrator. There is a need to demonstrate the full size concentrator.  The technical objectives of Phase II are to enhance the design, construct the deployable concentrator and conduct tests to validate the concept and the design. Phase II will utilize the latest space deployable technology known as a triangle-faceted net-membrane configuration for the construction of the full-size concentrator.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The primary commercial market is all the spacecraft manufacturers who will need a low cost alternative to Radio-isotope Thermal Generators (RTGs). Missions that may be enabled by the deployable solar concentrator include deep space missions using solar power rather than the controversial nuclear power modules, with an added benefit that the reflector may be useful as an antenna and also to provide heat to the spacecraft. Also, once this type of concetrator is accepted, the solar rocket orbital transfer vehicle may finally be finacially feasible. The application of these deployable concentrators may also make orbiting solar space power stations more attractive. A specific need for this class of concentrators is expressed in a letter of interest by General Atomics, which is attached at the end of this proposal. In general, the application of these relatively inexpensive collectors may bring solar dynamic power systems for spacecraft into direct competition with solar cells.  Furthermore, there are several microwave applications where very large antennas are needed, that can be based on this proposed technology.  These include interferometers (high-resolution studies of the universe) and radiometers (e.g., Earth-soil water-content measurements). These devices may also have terrestrial applications such as inexpensive and portable (back-pack type) systems for the military and civilians to provide solar thermal electric power, as well as telecommunications capabilities in not easily accessible areas.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The new class of General Aviation (GA) aircraft, expected to be developed under the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) concept, will:  (1) be highly automated, (2) require much less skill to train and fly than current day aircraft, and (3) enable a trip to be made with a very high degree of safety in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) a high percentage of the time.
<br>WaveBand Corporation (WaveBand), in collaboration with Research Triangle Institute (RTI), has proposed to combine an active Millimeter Wave (MMW) sensor with a database-derived SVS.  This innovative approach will support and enable the SATS cornerstone concepts of self-separation for free flight, high-density operations and virtual terminal procedures (TERPS) during the transition period where the SATS aircraft must co-exist with conventionally equipped aircraft.
<br>Accordingly, we used the actual and current MMW radar image to reference the database-derived synthetic image (SI), i.e., to find the closest match between the two renditions and to present the pilot with the SI that reliably represents the real world and contains indicators of all real-time object insertions.
<br>The Phase II project objective is to demonstrate real time operation of the SISVS through its integration with WaveBand's autonomous landing and obstacle avoidance radar.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The commercialization and product development of the SISVS system for GA will be based on a similar development now underway for commercial aviation.
<br>The proposed SISVS system offers a dramatic improvement in the low-visibility landing, taxiing and take-off operations by reducing the likelihood of accidents, delays and diversions.  As distinct from other enhanced vision systems (EVS), the SISVS system will provide actual view of the landing strip in zero visibility without relying on any ground equipment.
<br>The GA community is huge in terms of numbers of aircraft and unlike the other market segments, the operators are very diverse in terms of their objectives and business standing.  These range from the sport flyer or weekend operator to the small company aircraft or sophisticated corporate jet.  The ability to be able to take off from one location, to complete the flight without incident and to land in any weather offers a tremendous benefit.  This can be estimated in terms of fuel savings, convenience and safety, although there are no specific financial models for safety.  This benefit can be measured more in terms of damage and loss of life.

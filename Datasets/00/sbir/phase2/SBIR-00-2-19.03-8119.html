<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Subsurface Coring Sampler System (SCSS) is multi-depth sample acquisition and handling tool that can be used for the exploration of Mars, Moon, comets and asteroids.  This Phase II proposal looks to build upon the successful results obtained from the SCSS Phase I objectives.  As stated in the Phase I proposal, this invention allows for a low power coring drill capable of penetrating weak or strong samples at cryogenic or elevated temperatures. 
<br>The goals of the Phase II effort will be to develop a fully integrated SCSS design to TRL 6 status; i.e. fabricate and test a demonstration unit in a Mars-type environment.  By combining drilling, coring (large/small volume, surface/subsurface) and precision sample handling in one fully automated unit, the SCSS provides maximum functionality for minimum power and mass.  
<br>This new and multi-functional prototype sampler development is a continuation of the SCSS Phase I effort.  Enhancements to SCSS in Phase II shall include the development of an automated sample transfer mechanism, improved shearing tip performance, higher volume sample chamber and a smart drill controller.  Finally the Phase II effort will terminate with the fabrication and testing of the SCSS in the various automated modes of operations with a near term goal of having the technology ready for a Mars 07 time frame.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The USGS has initiated contact with Honeybee regarding the use of SCSS technology for terrestrial sampling.  Currently, the USGS uses cumbersome rigs designed for oil-related drilling to take core samples.  These rigs require 3-person teams for operation, and are designed for depths much greater than those necessary for USGS purposes.  The large expense and lack of portability of current methods are major concerns for the USGS, and they have shown interest in purchasing operational SCSS units when they become available.  
<br>
<br>Similarly, these advantages of the SCSS will make it an attractive option for the Department of Transportation in their surveying needs, as well as agencies concerned with hazardous waste monitoring.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This project concerns the development of a sensor intended to remotely monitor plant stress using active stimulation of plant chlorophyll fluorescence.  The intensity and spectral band shape of leaf chlorophyll fluorescence in green plants has been linked to the physiological status of the plants and thus provides a good indicator of plant health.  The proposed sensor will measure the relative intensity of plant fluorescence in two wavelength bands corresponding to emission from two fluorescence emission bands.  The compact size (1000 cm3), light weight (3 kg) and low power consumption (15 watts) of the sensor make this instrument ideal for robotic operation in confined spaces such as might be found on manned space missions.  Use of a novel active fluorescence stimulation source and compact detector enables the device to remotely sense plant fluorescence (at the single leaf, whole plant, or canopy level) from a distance of at least several meters without using a large, high power laser and large focusing optics.  With the use of a synchronous detection scheme, the sensor can also efficiently detect the fluorescence in the presence of either solar or artificial lighting.  The Phase II program will focus primarily on field trials to which will involve a number of collaborators in academia, government, and private industry.   Another task will involve development of a version of the sensor suitable for remote location monitoring which will utilize solar cell powered batteries and communicate with a receiving station via remote telephone service.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed sensor has applications in agriculture, forestry and horticulture as an early warning device to alert growers to the presence of
<br>stress. Immediate applications include use as a monitor in greenhouse and hydroponics environments, oversight of forestry-related seedling plots, and utilization in biological research. Eventually, it will be used in monitoring high value-added crops and perhaps even in commodity crop applications if the costs can be sufficiently lowered.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Q-Peak, Inc. proposes to develop an efficient, single-frequency, diffraction-limited, 349-nm laser source for use as a Doppler Lidar transmitter for direct-detection measurements of winds. The laser source proposed will be based on a quasi-cw diode-pumped, ring-cavity, near-diffraction-limited, Q-switched Nd:YLF laser. The laser will be injection-seeded and frequency-locked using a single-frequency, cw diode-pumped, 20-mW Nd:YLF laser developed by Q-Peak. The system will feature intracavity tripling to convert the near-IR output of the Q-switched Nd:YLF laser into the UV. A prototype system suitable for application as an airborne Doppler Lidar Transmitter will be built and delivered to NASA GSFC at the end of the Phase II program. This system is expected to be a single-frequency, 349-nm source of 6-mJ pulses at a 1-kHz repetition-rate. Phase II development will emphasize technology that is ultimately field-suitable and efficient in terms of laser performance, prime-power use, and cooling requirements. We will also develop a preliminary design for a high-energy, hybrid Nd:YLF/Yb:S-FAP system that would be an excellent candidate for a space-based, wind-sensing lidar system.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed technology is of particular use to NASA for lidar transmitters. The pulsed UV source can be used for wind measurements or Raman probing of the atmosphere based on direct detection of Rayleigh or aerosol-scattered light. In the commercial sector, the applications include process control and material processing, in particular, the laser would be a low cost pulsed UV source for via drilling and precision micro-machining applications.

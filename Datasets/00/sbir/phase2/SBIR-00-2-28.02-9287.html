<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA is seeking high-fidelity adaptive optical systems for aberration correction. To address this NASA need and strong commercial interest, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) demonstrated in Phase I the feasibility of an innovative liquid crystal adaptive wavefront corrector technology that will lead to near term development of integrated adaptive optical systems, capable of operating with high spatial resolution, high accuracy, wide dynamic range, and high speed. POC?s new wavefront correcting technology proposed for Phase II development is based on three innovations: 1) high-density liquid crystal microlens array tuned electronically; 2) temperature-compensated phase-only spatial light modulator technology; 3) wavefront sensing and phase unwrapping routine developed at POC. In Phase II we will develop a prototype system with high resolution (128 x 128 channels) for low-cost adaptive-optics wavefront control and aberration correction to meet NASA needs. POC?s financial commitment and third party investments in Phase II/Phase III will help transition Phase II results into variety of successful commercial products.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The liquid crystal adaptive wavefront corrector technology constitutes a low-cost means of fast and reliable adaptive wavefront correction, which will find many commercial applications. Applications include real-time image enhancement, individual adaptive optical instruments (such as binoculars and sniperscopes), military and industrial robots, microscopy, optical manufacturing, and optical shops testing.

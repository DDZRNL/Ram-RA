<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Based on the success of the Phase-I program, Brimrose Corp. of America proposes to pursue the versatility of the photo-EMF sensors and to further develop self-adaptive laser velocimeters as well as high precision optical path length measurement apparatus and their wide-reaching applications in the commercial markets. During the Phase-II stage of this program, Brimrose and its consultants will develop and validate the auto-calibration technique which allows the photo-EMF sensors to unambiguously determine the Doppler frequency shifts and eliminate the signal power dependence of the sensor response. We will investigate the sources of errors and noises to improve the measurement signal-to-noise ratios. The Doppler shift measurement sensitivity and dynamic range will be optimized based on the specific application requirements. Multi-element sensor arrays will be investigated to allow scanner-less wide area monitoring of high-speed objects. Techniques offering ultra-high precision optical distance measurement using photo-EMF sensors will be demonstrated to NASA. Sensors and sensor apparatus will be provided to NASA for testing and evaluation purposes on a continuous basis during the Phase-II program. Commercial applications originating from the success of this program will include Laser Radars, Laser Ultrasonic Inspection Systems, Optical Metrology/High Precision Manufacturing, and high speed Optical Communication Networks.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Potential commercial applications stemming from the success of this program will include Laser Radars, Laser Ultrasonic Inspection Systems, Optical Metrology/High Precision Manufacturing, and high speed Optical Communication Networks. The ultra-high Doppler shift detection bandwidth allows photo-EMF sensor-based laser radars to monitor objects traveling with supersonic speeds. They can also be used to monitor the presence of air turbulence and cross winds. Photo-EMF laser ultrasonic inspection system will allow remote interrogation of specimen structural integrity. These applications will have profound impacts on the safety of aviation industries. Photo-EMF sensors can also be adopted to measure with high accuracy target distances and topographical features. With sufficient spatial resolution to be developed in the Phase II program, photo-EMF sensors can be used to monitor the thickness of semiconductor thin films during the growth process and determine the flatness of magnetic disks.  Photo-EMF sensor-based apparatus can be used to characterize the dispersion characteristics of optical fibers with unprecedented precision, determine the integrity of optical fiber cables, and measure the timing jitter between high bit rate optical pulses. All these will lead to next generation ultra-high bit rate optical communication networks capable of simultaneously sharing information among remotely located facilities.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 NASA has identified a need to reduce weight and cost of rocket thrust 
<br>chambers, nozzles, and ramps.  A lightweight actively cooled ceramic matrix 
<br>composite (CMC) system would be lighter than metallic designs and would 
<br>require significantly less cooling.  Composite Factory proposes a 
<br>zirconium-silicate or Zr-Si-O glass CMC with integral ceramic tubes 
<br>reinforced with a low cost discontinuous ceramic fiber preform.  Integral 
<br>ceramic composite mounting structure offers potential for a 1.2 to 2.0 
<br>lb/ft2 structurally integrated exhaust ramp, thrust chamber, or nozzle.  
<br>The Phase-I project demonstrated the feasibility of adding Zr and tubes 
<br>including nearly a two-fold improvement in flex strength.  During Phase-II 
<br>a more detailed material evaluation will be performed to determine the 
<br>concentration of Zr required to improve the thermal stability of the CMC.  
<br>Testing will include basic mechanical, cooled and un-cooled flat plates and 
<br>cylinders in the Air Force LHMEL facility and thrust chamber and ramp 
<br>testing at NASA Glenn. The development of a low cost zirconium-silicate 
<br>matrix would also be applicable to military and commercial turbine engine 
<br>components.  Efforts related to helicopter turbine exit nozzles are being 
<br>proposed to the Army in a related Phase I SBIR Topic (A01-079).

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
 The efforts performed under the Phase I SBIR are complimentary to current 
<br>in-house research activities to expand the usage of Composite Factory's 
<br>Shuttle Gate Preform Machine and to increase Composite Factory's CMC 
<br>manufacturing capability. 
<br>Currently under development is a second generation of motion controls and 
<br>programming control for the Shuttle Gate Preform Machine with the goal to 
<br>achieve more precise control with less operator intervention and higher 
<br>outputs to handle the higher cost ceramic fibers with more precision and 
<br>ever lower scrap rates.  The use of the preform machine in CMC applications 
<br>will reduce the cost of preforming and fabrication of most CMC's.  The 
<br>Preform machine is already a key part of Composite Factory's business plan 
<br>and additional markets (CMC's) will continue to drive the costs of preform 
<br>machines and preforms lower.
<br>Currently Composite Factory focuses on Blackglas™ based CMC components.  
<br>Applications currently being produced for sale are the CMC brakes for 
<br>motorcycle racing and aftermarket street use.  We are currently working 
<br>with multiple automotive OEM's to introduce the CMC brakes into automotive 
<br>applications.  The ability to offer a higher temperature polymer derived 
<br>CMC system based on similar chemistry would increase the potential markets 
<br>Composite Factory could pursue.  Immediate markets for exhaust liners in 
<br>diesel engines and combustor liners in turbine engines appear promising.
<br>The application of a higher thermal conductivity phase in the CMC may also 
<br>improve the performance of the CMC as a friction material in aircraft brake 
<br>applications where higher thermal conductivity is critical to maintaining 
<br>acceptable surface temperatures.  
<br>	It is Composite Factory's business to produce polymer and ceramic 
<br>matrix composites for commercial applications and any technology that opens 
<br>additional markets w

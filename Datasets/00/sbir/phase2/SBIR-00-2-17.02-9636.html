<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Fabricating collimators for imaging x-rays and gamma-rays, with the precision required for sub-arc second imaging, is a significant problem in solar and non-solar astrophysics.  Fine collimators, made from dense materials, are enabling components in high-resolution imaging instruments.  Commercial collimator fabrication techniques are limited to producing structures with coarse cell sizes that require long structural lengths to achieve required resolution.  The ability to produce collimators with finer pitch (<50 microns) will significantly impact the performance and cost of space-based imaging instruments.  For modulation imaging schemes utilizing co-aligned collimators, producing finer grid patterns allows reductions in the distance between grid pairs, thus reducing instrument size and mass, while increasing spatial resolution.  Recent efforts have produced single collimators with pitch <50 microns using photochemical etching and stack lamination.  However, assembling multi-grid arrays from single collimators requires complex assembly and alignment schemes.  In Phase I, Mikro Systems, Inc. (MSI) developed an innovative technique for fabricating tungsten multi-grid arrays.  Phase II will extend this innovation and produce two flight quality arrays, each having 64 sub-collimators with pitch ranging from 35 microns to 2.0 millimeters.  MSI?s collimator technology will further the development of compact, cost effective instruments for space based x-ray and gamma-ray imaging.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The technologies being developed under this SBIR have direct application for commercial medical imaging and bio-medical products and devices.  The ability to fabricate high-aspect ratio, three dimensional devices has significant value for medical radiology systems and the development of BioMEMS devices. The MSI technological advances made in Phases I and II, will lead to smaller, better, and cheaper space-based instruments for NASA, and will be transferred to the medical and biomedical commercial markets, resulting in cost reduction and performance gains.

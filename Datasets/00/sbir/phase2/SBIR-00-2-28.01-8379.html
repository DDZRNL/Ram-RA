<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
During the Phase I effort, Eikos Inc demonstrated the use of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWnT) in LARC-developed polyimides as a novel transparent, electrostatic dissipation (ESD) films for spacecraft protection. In orbit, a satellite is exposed to solar radiation and to plasma, which has the effect of accumulation charge on the outer surface. On insulating surfaces in shadow, potentials of 18kV are measured, whereas the illuminated surfaces have potentials of zero. Such differences cause electrical discharge, resulting in; damage to the thermo-optical and mechanical properties of the satellite films, radio interference, and the onboard electrical equipment to fail. Our patented Nanoshield technology provides environmentally stable and durable ESD films while protecting the surface from atomic oxygen (AO), Ultraviolet (UV) light by exploiting space proven polyimides.  Carbon nanotubes are added to the polyimide to form interpenetrated network or nanocomposite, which is conductive, tough, and lightweight. The use of carbon nanotubes within this matrix to impart ESD protection offers a cost effective approach to for a wide array of application and products. The applications include nanocomposite films and coatings for deployable structures, shielding, and concentrators. The work has lead to a US provisional patent filed with co-inventors at NASA and Eikos.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
There has been enormous interest in products intended to minimize the effects of ESD in a variety of industries, ranging from satellites to the automotive industry. Catalog vendors list more than 1,000 types of ESD products, many could be supplanted by this technology. Most of the research and development associated with these products has been done domestically, and the U.S. remains the largest producer of ESD goods. Furthermore, this country still is the largest single market for ESD products. Estimates of the size of the ESD market well over $1 billion.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
IAI and its partner company, Time Domain Corporation (TDC), are developing and applying a new type of radio called Time-Modulated Ultra-Wideband radio.  Within the last few years, low cost ultra-high precision time delays have become available, and these now make it possible to build UWB communication systems, which have no carrier frequency.  The only signals transmitted are pulses.  With current hardware, the pulses are ? nanosecond, and a typical duty cycle is 1/500.  The Fourier transform of a perfect impulse is constant at all frequencies.  For the pulses we are currently using, the energy extends approximately from .5 to 4 Gigahertz. Because only pulses are transmitted, and because there is no carrier frequency, there is no up conversion and no down conversion required, and the output stage is a single transistor, which creates a binary pulse, all resulting in decreased radio size and complexity.  TM-UWB radios have already been built which reliably transmit 25 megabits per second from a single channel, and many channels can be hosted simultaneously at a single site.  TM-UWB can be very low power, and is largely unaffected by multipath.  For electronically steerable arrays, true time delay is trivial to achieve.  There are also many advantages for SAR.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
IAI is currently working on 12 niche applications of TM-UWB and TDC has raised nearly $100 million in private funds to implement a set of ASIC chips that reduce almost all the electronics down to three chips, each approximately 2 cm square.  Early commercial products will be through the wall imaging radar, and short range wireless LANs which are higher bandwidth and more robust to multipath than competing approaches.

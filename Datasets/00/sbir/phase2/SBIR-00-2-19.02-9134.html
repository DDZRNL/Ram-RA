<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Phase II research comprises constructing and testing the  core components required for an integrated microfluidic manifold system.  These microfluidic systems will enable analyte samples to be prepared, processed, and analyzed in lab-on-a-chip (LOC) type instrumentation .  Specifically, micropump and microvalve components for such a system will be built, tested, and refined for use in Micro Laboratory applications. The micropump and microvalve devices will be engineered for integration with established LOC chemical analysis systems, with emphasis on of sample injection and high pressure pumping in LOC systems.  The Phase II Research will address issues related to the performance of as well as production methods that can be used for the technology.  Commercial devices based on the Phase II prototype will be constructed and subsequently refined and commercialized during Phase III.

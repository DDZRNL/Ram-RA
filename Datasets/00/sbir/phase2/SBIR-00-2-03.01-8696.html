<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
On-line, real-time control and guidance law reconfiguration is a challenging task for reusable launch vehicles (RLVs).  Due to the often minimal set of control effectors on RLVs, full recovery of nominal performance will not always be possible, and the outer-loop guidance system must adapt.  Barron Associates, Inc. (BAI) has developed a guidance approach that can reconfigure in real time to increase the reliability and safety of RLVs.  The novel, modular approach autonomously identifies the inner-closed-loop dynamics and adapts the guidance for off-nominal performance. A more formal optimization technique developed and matured by BAI is employed to reshape trajectory commands on-line.  The proposed effort will seek to extensively mature the designs to be robust against a significant set of all possible contingencies that the vehicle might encounter in flight.  BAI?s approach does not require a priori knowledge of the failure, but can adapt the guidance system to unforeseen contingencies.  BAI has teamed with the Boeing Corporation and proposes to bring these technologies to near flight ready status.  A main strength of the proposal is that BAI will leverage the effort with a significant supporting Air Force-funded program, as well as proposed near-term flight tests of BAI?s algorithms on Boeing?s X-40A RLV.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
This Phase II effort will help to mature BAI?s reconfigurable guidance designs to near flight-ready status. The related Air Force commitments and NASA?s Space Launch Initiative program provide the vehicle test-beds for cultivating these technologies.  Commercialization will consist of (a) providing expertise and consulting to the industry in the area of reconfigurable launch vehicle guidance and control, (b) developing software toolkits that aid design of autonomous reconfigurable control and guidance systems that directly benefit RLV and other aerospace programs, and (c) transitioning the technology to existing customers and new control application areas.  Design and development of reconfigurable or adaptive guidance systems has become a significant portion of BAI?s business, and the techniques developed in this program will help BAI continue a leadership role in this field.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NovaSol proposes the Compact Airborne Stabilization System (COMPASS), providing the remote sensing community with a unique stabilization and navigation system adaptable to various sensors, platforms, and requirements. COMPASS offers a solution that currently does not exist: Namely high bandwidth optical path correction in real-time while simultaneously recording attitude and position data. The architecture chosen for COMPASS provides a maximum amount of flexibility, allowing for tailored solutions for specific sensors and budgets without employing custom designs. The system?s compactness, in combination with its ability to correct for disturbances of relatively high frequencies, make it an ideal candidate system for small aircraft and UAVs. Finally, the end-to-end-solution, incorporating a user interface for flight planning and execution, alleviates the difficulty of integrating and employing several subsystems. 
<br>
<br>As a result of the successful completion of the Phase I work, NovaSol proposes the development and test of a COMPASS prototype. The preliminary design developed for Phase I will first be finalized, followed by the assembly and test of all subsystems. After successful integration of all subsystems, COMPASS will be flight tested with a selected spectral sensor system and its performance evaluated. The completed and tested COMPASS prototype will then be delivered to NASA.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
COMPASS will provide great utility to the remote sensing community by adding value to spectral sensor systems currently flown and in development: With COMPASS, the end product (a geo-registered data set) can be produced at a higher quality, higher reliability, and in a shorter amount of time. Currently available stabilization systems either lack performance, are too large/heavy, or are specifically designed for a particular system. In addition, these systems typically do not offer a user interface for mission planning and execution. COMPASS? performance and features make it a unique system in the market, occupying a currently vacant niche. 
<br>
<br>The COMPASS system can be used in any of the areas where spectral imaging systems are flown. Examples include agriculture, fisheries, environmental monitoring, oil exploration and insurance/disaster industries. NovaSol plans to expand the prototype development into a commercial COMPASS product. The State of Hawaii has approved a grant to study the market potential for COMPASS, and develop a plan for commercialization. Scientists at NASA and private industry have shown strong interest in the system, and expressed their support for a continuation of the program.

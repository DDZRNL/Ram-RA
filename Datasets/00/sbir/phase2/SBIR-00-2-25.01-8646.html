<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
RAME (Risk Assessment and Management Environment) is a supervisory
<br>system that aims to ensure design integrity of IP-based ASICs and
<br>mixed-signal ASICs by identifying and tracking possible failure modes,
<br>and their causes, effects and criticalities.  Our objective is to
<br>develop model- and knowledge-based techniques to transform
<br>design-for-safety (DFS) practice from an ad-hoc, inefficient,
<br>error-prone approach to a stringent engineering process such that DFS
<br>can keep up with the rapidly growing complexity of avionics systems.
<br>In particular, RAME is built upon an information infrastructure that
<br>maintains the fault models, knowledge base, and failure
<br>reporting/tracking system.  This infrastructure thus facilitates
<br>learning from prior projects and enables the automation of failure
<br>modes, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA).  Through the
<br>preliminary prototyping effort carried out in Phase I, we have
<br>demonstrated the feasibility of FMECA automation and confirmed that
<br>the automation will improve turn-around-time, completeness, and
<br>accuracy of failure analysis.  Moreover, RAME accommodates a FMECA
<br>extension, namely, the hierarchical FMECA method, to support the
<br>multi-layer approach to building fault-tolerant avionics systems.  In
<br>Phase II, the complete version of the RAME prototype will be delivered
<br>to the Center for Integrated Space Microsystems (CISM) at JPL and
<br>benchmarking will be conducted.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The results of this effort are anticipated to benefit a wide variety
<br>of critical applications for which undiscovered or unmitigated effects
<br>of faults in design, development, operation or maintenance may result
<br>in severe consequence. In particular, the potential commercial market
<br>of the resulting techniques and tools includes commercial aviation
<br>industries, nuclear power plants, automobile manufacturing, and
<br>medical industries.

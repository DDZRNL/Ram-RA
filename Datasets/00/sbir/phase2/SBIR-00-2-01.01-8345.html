<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal describes the development of a multi-frequency airborne radar system for in-flight icing potential detection. Range profiles of cloud reflectivity from multiple radar frequencies can be used to derive estimates of cloud liquid water content and particle sizing parameters, based on differential attenuation as a function of frequency. During Phase II, we plan to build a prototype radar, using high power transmitters at 9.4 and 35 GHz and a solid-state transmitter at 95 GHz. The entire prototype system will be built in a wing-mountable pod for deployment on the NASA Twin Otter icing research aircraft. Up to 30 hours of flight tests are planned, with a goal of demonstrating the feasibility of icing potential detection under a variety of weather conditions. For Phase III, we plan to develop a multi-function weather radar (MFWR) providing conventional weather radar products as well as an icing potential detection capability and updraft/downdraft detection, that will be affordable within the commercial aviation marketplace. A key enabling technology, microwave integrated circuits (MIC), will be used to implement radar receivers at 9.4 and 35 GHz and a receiver/transmitter at 95 GHz that are compact, inexpensive, and easy to service.

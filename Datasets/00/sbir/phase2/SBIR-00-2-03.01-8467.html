<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Integrating cost- and time-effective analysis of turbopump steady state and transient thermo-mechanical effects into the preliminary and final design process is the overall goal.  Automating the thermo-mechanical analysis process is the proposed innovation.  Integrating the new methodology within an existing multi-disciplinary turbopump design system (owned by NASA and select turbopump manufacturers) is the primary commercialization path. The subtopic calls for advancements with integrated multi-disciplinary design and analysis systems for important vehicle subsystems such as turbopumps.  The offered approach meets the topic goal of lowering design, development, and production costs by developing advanced and innovative technology.  The integrated thermo-mechanical analysis capability is required by turbopump designers to support low-cost turbopump development for RLVs and other applications.  Turbopump requirements include better performance and reliability, lower product cost, reduced size and weight, and improvements in development cycle time.  More efficiently and effectively analyzing turbopump system thermal and transient response may be the most challenging aspect of turbopump design and integration into the propulsion system. The proposed work has tremendous dual-use potential for designers of industrial turbomachinery products. The results from the Phase I work show the feasibility of significant and achievable goals for the next generation of dual use turbopump design tools.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
In addition to turbopump applications, integrated thermo-mechanical analysis is important to the proposer?s design software users in the marine, locomotive, and automotive turbocharger market who deal with severe temperature differentials between the low temperature compressor and the high temperature turbine.  Small gas turbine engines also experience thermal transients when the compressor and turbine are mounted on a common shaft.  This rotor configuration is common in auxiliary power unit, turboalternator and helicopter applications.

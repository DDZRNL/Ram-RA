<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 The measurement of ozone is one of the most critical atmospheric chemistry measurements made in the study of the Earth?s atmosphere.  The depletion of stratospheric ozone and the photochemical production of tropospheric ozone from pollutants are two major areas of study which demand accurate, high-resolution ozone data.  The Phase I goal was to develop and demonstrate key technologies for a next-generation ultraviolet absorption ozonesonde for mounting on small aerial platforms.  In Phase I, a prototype ozonesonde for use on small aerial vehicles and sounding balloons was successfully demonstrated.  The new sonde is a fraction of the size of existing benchtop ultraviolet absorption instruments and consumes very little power.  The new ozonesonde is very similar in size to existing electrochemical concentration cell ozonesondes, proving that the new instrument can be flown on very small platforms. The proven Phase I ozonesonde design will be refined in Phase II; improvements will focus on performance enhancement and weight reduction.  Design changes will be made with consideration given to simplifying the Phase III production of ozonesondes.  Several prototypes will be produced in Phase II.  These prototypes will undergo extensive field tests to refine the design and to prove their ability to operate in the field.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The ozonesonde will be a valuable new tool for researchers interested in studying both tropospheric and stratospheric ozone.  The ozonesonde?s performance is far superior to the only commercially available existing alternative for ozone measurement from small aerial platforms, specifically electrochemical concentration cell ozonesondes.  The ozonesonde will be suitable for a wide range of airborne applications, including flight on small Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and balloon sondes.  The instrument will also be offered as an inexpensive replacement for current double-beam instruments in many surface-based applications.

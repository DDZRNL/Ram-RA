<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Due to limited crew availability to support science and the large number of experiments to be operated simultaneously, telescience is key to a successful ISS science program.  NASA has just scratched the surface of potential with the initial International Space Station Internet Voice Distribution System implementation.  The proposed CONTACT system will take full advantage of the digital world - the PC and the Internet -  to qualitatively enhance communications among ISS operations personnel.  
<br>Our Phase I objective was to identify and test those technologies that will dramatically increase the effectiveness of performing telescience.  Four collaboration areas were identified: audio; video; network/security architecture; and application sharing.  Our results indicate that both network/security architecture and application sharing are keys to a more effective collaboration system.  Major obstacles to deployment of CONTACT were identified: Internet bandwidth capacity,  network configuration, and strict security requirements.  Techniques to reduce and overcome these obstacles were tested.
<br>In Phase II a CONTACT prototype server, client, and network architecture will be developed that incorporate the techniques tested and proven in Phase I.  The CONTACT prototype will be made available for virtual planning meetings supporting distributed experimenter groups, evaluated, and delivered at the conclusion of Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The immediate commercialization will be deployment of CONTACT to supplement or replace IVoDS for ISS telescience support.  Additional commercialization plans include both collaboration products and services for this emerging market now being cultivated by major vendors like Microsoft and IBM.  Collaboration systems will grow in popularity in the next 5 years as extensions to existing e-mail/calendar systems such as Outlook and Notes.  AZTek plans to develop software "add-on" products for expected market-leader conference servers.  AZTek will partner with leading collaboration system vendors to resell and integrate their products to provide complete solutions to mid- to large-size government and commercial customers.

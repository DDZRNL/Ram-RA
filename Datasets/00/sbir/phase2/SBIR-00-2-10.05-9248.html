<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA needs a lightweight system that does not vent water to cool astronauts on EVA missions.  The Portable Life Support System (PLSS) on current spacesuits and systems planned for future spacesuits are heavy and use evaporation or sublimation of water to cool the astronaut.  We propose an innovative cooling device based on a regenerable heat absorption process that permits heat rejection from EVA suits using a lightweight system that vents zero water.  In Phase I we proved the feasibility of our approach with bench-scale tests that demonstrated both the cooling and regeneration process, and by producing a conceptual design for a heat absorber system with a capacity of 1000 W-hr of refrigeration and a mass of less than 8 kg.  In Phase II we will deliver a complete prototype system.  We will perform small-scale experiments to optimize materials and thermal design parameters, design and fabricate all the components in a full-size prototype system, assemble the system and test in a simulated space environment.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The heat absorber has direct and indirect commercial applications.  The direct application of the heat absorber is a lightweight, portable cooling unit to wear with sealed or heavy garments in hazardous environments.  Potential users include firefighters, HAZMAT personnel, rescue workers, etc.  The indirect application is to use the basic heat absorption process to provide portable, lightweight refrigeration and air-conditioning.  Applications include recreation (camping, boating), transportation (shipping items that need refrigeration), and medical (distribution of medicine and vaccines to undeveloped areas where conventional refrigeration is unavailable).

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose the application of sublimation purification technology to the recovery of water from solid wastes which originate from functions of the spacecraft life support system.  Our technology recovers the maximum amount of water because it reduces the wastes to a solid dry material as opposed to a concentrated solution.  We will examined the feasibility of applying sublimation waste processing (SWP) to solids and have developed a prototype conceptual design.  Accordingly, the overall objective of the Phase II work is to deliver a SWP prototype device to NASA Ames that embodies all of the critical functional features of a system needed for space flight.  We will also acquire process data from waste samples and integrate these results into the design of the prototype.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The major commercial market for the SWP is in the area of the processing of highly concentrated  hazardous and radioactive evaporator bottom sludge.  These bottoms are typically stabilized with grout, greatly increasing the volume, and stored indefinitely at great cost; they are incinerated which is meeting greater resistance from the public and government.  Increased pressures from federal, state and local agencies are forcing generators to look for other means of processing or storing this waste.  SWP can process these bottoms thus reducing their volumes 20 to 30 times.  Accordingly, the cost of post processing or storage is reduced proportionally.  The NanoMaterials Company plans to produce or license the production of process equipment to dry these bottoms in a fully automated processing plant using technology which will be developed during the Phase II effort.  The estimated annual market value for this technology is >$500M.

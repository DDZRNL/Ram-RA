<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
AJT proposes to fabricate and test a low-cost, engine test stand system for small thrust engines using gaseous, liquid or cryogenic propellants.  This test stand incorporates automated propellant transfer, leak test and system purge.  The rocket engines will be mounted onto an instrumented plate, providing thrust measurement, then attached to a cart.  The cart incorporates four propellant QDs. An engine manufacturer will plumb the engine to the appropriate QD.  The cart will then be placed on alignment rails, attached to a ground side frame, with four QDs matching the cart.  The cart is manually pushed into place, then latched. This concept eliminates the requirement for any reconfiguration of the ground side propellant system.  A PLC based controller allows the operator to monitor, control and program operational sequences for the propellant system.  This concept will reduce the time and costs typically associated with testing different engines on the same test stand.  Phase I resulted in complete assembly level drawings of the test stand using a solid 3-D CAD model. Schematics and isometric drawings were also completed for the propellant system.  This concept is scalable for other and much larger engine test facilities.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
There are two particular commercial applications for this technology: rocket engine and aspirated jet engine test stands.  There are numerous US and foreign rocket engine manufacturers which regularly fabricate and test small rocket engines.  These companies (including TRW Space & Electronics, Kaiser Marquardt, Rocket Research Company, Thiokol, Aerojet, NIIMash, Isayev, Melnikov, Stechkin, Glushko, Kosberg, Korolev) all have needs for small rocket engine testing.  Because this technology is scalable, other manufacturers of larger thrust engines are also potential customers.  In the US, there are several premier government testing facilities (Marshall Space Flight Center and Stennis Space Center) which have direct and immediate applications for this innovative technology.  Pratt & Whitney, Lockheed Martin and Boeing would also benefit from this technology for both small and large rocket engines.
<br>
<br>Jet engine manufacturers, aircraft maintenance facilities, and major airlines all conduct jet engine testing.  This test stand concept can be easily modified to accommodate jet engines.  Multiple carts could be used, allowing numerous engines to be tested quickly on the same test stand.  During Phase II, AJT will contact these various potential commercial customers.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Innovative materials are key to buoyant vehicles for terrestrial and extraterrestrial applications in NASA's Space and Earth Science Enterprises.  Thin film membranes which have resistance to UV degradation, temperature operation up to 750K, low helium permeability with good handling and folding characteristics at an areal density <40g/m2 and down to <12g/m2 are required.  Metallized composites of nanotube reinforcement in a carbon matrix are an innovative material that has the potential to meet these material requirements.  The Phase I program demonstrated that nanotube reinforced carbon matrix membrane with an areal density of 12 g/m2 could be produced, which had low helium permeability.  The Phase II program will optimize the processing to produce the fully stable nanotube reinforced membranes and scale-up to deliver meter size membranes.

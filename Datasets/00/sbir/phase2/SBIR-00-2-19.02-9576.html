<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 	Scientists have used laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) over the past decade to perform elemental analysis of soil, water and gases.  The formation of laser-induced plasma, which produces a localized blackbody source for atomic emissions, enables this technology.  Collection of the plasma's spectral signature by a lens or optical fiber allows examination for elemental components of numerous materials.  Recently, it has been shown that the stand-off measurement capabilities and ablative nature of the LIBS instrument would provide an extremely useful tool for space and planetary exploration. Geological features can be examined from a distance, reducing the time required to position a rover, and expanding the area investigated during each mission. To further the usefulness of the LIBS instrument for space flight conditions, compact, lightweight, low power and robust systems are required. To meet this end, Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. (RMD) will develop a highly sensitive, echelle spectrometer and an array of Geiger photodiodes (GPD) coupled to an echelle spectrometer. Matching the GPD array format with the output from an echelle spectrometer will provide simultaneous monitoring of the major and minor elements of greatest interest, while eliminating the need for a scanning or multiple grating system.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The development of a compact, low-cost monitoring system would reduce the need for time consuming, sampling techniques and provide a valuable tool for both, space and Earth-based applications.  LIBS has the capability to provided stand-off and point detection in environmentally hazardous areas.  An improvement in the ease of use, power consumption, and portability would greatly enhance the ability to perform initial screening or continuous monitoring.   The unique photo-counting properties of the GPD array will provide the sensitivity necessary for stand-off detection, particularly in low-pressure environments.  The high sensitivity of the photodiodes would reduce the required size and concomitant weight of other components, such as the optical elements used for collecting the return light from the plasma.

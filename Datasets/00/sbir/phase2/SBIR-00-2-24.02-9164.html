<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 A recently renewed interest in innovation and institutional agility has led to major investments in "knowledge management" tools.  But, while these tools have often led to certain efficiencies, they have not made good on promises to make organizations more innovative.  We propose to develop a new approach to facilitating innovation that draws on the synergy amongst multiple distinct technologies that have individually proven to be extremely valuable in knowledge creation.  In particular, we propose to enliven the knowledge representation and assimilation technique called Concept Mapping with novel information retrieval and natural language processing technologies.  More specifically, we will utilize recent advances in automated thesaurus development and novel query construction techniques to help fuel the concept mapping process.  The resulting system, BrainAmplifier, will act as an integrated knowledge elicitation, assimilation, codification, and sharing device.  BrainAmplifier will benefit NASA and other public and private organizations by enhancing the ability of their scientists and engineers (and those of their partners) to understand new and/or challenging concepts and push the scientific envelope.  The prototype tool developed during Phase I proved extremely effective in our experiments and provides a solid basis for the Phase II user-centered development of a complete integrated knowledge amplification system.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
BrainAmplifier will be extremely attractive to a wide variety of corporations that seek to improve their ability to do research and produce innovative new products.  The market for this technology is extremely large and continues to grow as more corporations recognize the need to exploit their intellectual resources.

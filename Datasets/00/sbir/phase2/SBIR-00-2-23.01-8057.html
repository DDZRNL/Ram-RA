<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Deep space optical communication requires a modulated laser with low power consumption, high data rate/accuracy, diffraction-limited beam quality, and minimal size/mass.   Single mode optical fibers are compact and can efficiently amplify diode lasers, but do not provide sufficient peak power for detection over extended distances. Bulk diode-pumped solid-state lasers can produce the required pulse energies, but are not as efficient or robust as guided-wave lasers.  CTI has an innovative waveguide laser technology that supports diffraction-limited high power operation.  The waveguide transmitters are compact and lightweight with excellent thermal properties, and capable of as high conversion efficiency as is typically achieved in fiber lasers.  When combined with a modulated diode laser and preamplifier, the transmitter is capable of MHz data rates from Mars and of high peak powers suitable for longer ranges.  The modulated diode approach is preferred to Q-switching or cavity dumping due to simplicity, low jitter, and high data rate.  Modeling supported by Phase 1 laboratory validation, points to a transmitter wallplug efficiency in excess of 19%.  The Phase II program will deliver a breadboard communication system.  CTI?s experience in severe environments and space-qualified designs provides leverage for the proposed program.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Significant commercial opportunity exists for both the component-level technology and the free-space communication architecture. Waveguide lasers power scale beyond the limit of fiber lasers and will outperform bulk lasers at high power continuous-wave and pulsed energy applications due to their compact size and high efficiency. Free-space optical communications is finding niche applications where fiber communications are not feasible.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Barrett?s proposed innovation is a high-performance actuator and drive system for life-size haptic devices.  The novel actuator will provide redundant safety while at the same time improving responsiveness.  The actuator is no larger than high-performance brushless actuators used in haptics devices today and is easily adapted to existing designs.  
<br>
<br>Phase-I proved feasibility of this concept with a series of successful proof-of-concept prototypes and supporting data.  Phase II will refine the design, integrate the actuators into a new life-size haptic device, and develop the controls required to exploit the extra capability.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Z-KAT, Inc. licenses Barrett?s present life-size haptic device, the WAM? for surgical uses.  The company has made significant investments in this product.  The market need for orthopedic surgical systems alone is 10,000 systems at $100,000 per system.  Other applications include short-wavelength laser cutting and welding, metrology, and rehabilitation therapy.  For NASA, the benefits include ground-based zero-G simulator training.  Shuttle and Station based practice training for Shuttle landings, and exercise/rehabilitation during extended periods in microgravity.

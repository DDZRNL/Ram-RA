<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Improvements in performance and safety will require improvements in control and health monitoring systems and the sensors required for these systems.  Large numbers of sensors are required and must be reduced in size and weight, perform over extended temperature ranges, and provide multiplexing capabilities.  In addition, with the industry moving toward a more electric aircraft, electromagnetic interference (EMI) becomes more of a concern with existing aircraft sensors.  Fiber optic sensor technology developed in this program can improve measurements by providing small size, light-weight, highly reliable and multiplexed devices that are immune to EMI.  In the Phase I program, the Luna research team successfully demonstrated the feasibility of producing nanotube/fiber-optic sensors smaller than ever before possible that will accurately measure wall properties, such as skin friction and temperature.  With Phase II support, the ultra-small fiber-optic sensors will provide point measurements of aerodynamic flow parameters previously unobtainable, with increased sensitivity As a result of this project, Luna anticipates introducing the world?s smallest skin-friction/temperature sensor, which will find ready markets in advanced aeronautic systems and machine design.  These measurements provide invaluable insight into validating new aircraft design and evaluating performance shortfalls on existing aircraft.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The development of an ultra-minaturized relatively non-invasive sensor, which has an enhanced temperature application range and is small enough to provide ease of manipulation, installation, and replacement will be beneficial in the flight testing of existing aircraft and other industries which require accurate flow measurements under demanding conditions.  This sensor will also find use in the research and development of future aircraft and the on-going monitoring of current aircraft.

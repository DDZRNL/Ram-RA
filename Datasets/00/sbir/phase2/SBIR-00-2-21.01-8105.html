<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Quantum dot (QD) infrared photodetectors offer promise to improve performance over current bulk material technology.  Namely, QD devices can have higher detectivity and reduced needs for cryogenic cooling.  Current QD technology has yet to achieve theoretical goals however, mostly due to non-uniformities in their size and distribution.   For this Phase II study, we propose improve the density and uniformity of QDs using novel index and patterned substrates.  The structure of the substrate surface will influence the QD formation and enhance their uniformity. In(x)Ga(1-x)As(y)Sb(1-y) quaternary will be used as the active material.  Both structural and optical characterization will be performed. Multiple QD layer photodetector structure will be fabricated and evaluated for infrared imaging and array applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
High performance infrared photodetectors with response in the mid- and far-infrared range. These have potetial applications which include surveillance cameras, night sights, fire-fighting, search and rescue, industrial or building maintenance, process control, machine vision, medical imaging and astronomy.

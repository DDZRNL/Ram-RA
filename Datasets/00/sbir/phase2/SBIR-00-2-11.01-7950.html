<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal is to develop a portable fluorescence-based detection system 
<br>for capture and identification of biological pathogens including fungi and 
<br>bacteria.  Peptide biosensors designed with phage display will be used to 
<br>detect targeted organisms in a rapid, non-invasive manner. To accomplish 
<br>this, we propose three tasks: 1.) Develop peptide-based, micro-array ligand 
<br>systems for the detection of 5-15 pathogenic fungi/bacterial targets via 
<br>phage display; 2. Establish optimal sampling/capture procedures for the 
<br>spore-specific biosensor module (ligand-coated microchip); and 3. Design an 
<br>automated spore detection and analysis system using computer-aided 
<br>fluorescent microscopy. Pathogen-specific peptide ligands will be developed 
<br>and cross linked to fluorescent tags and then covalently affixed to a micro 
<br>slide/chip, which will be inserted into the detection system. Assessment of 
<br>airborne fungal contaminants will involve a multi-parameter analysis of 
<br>ligand-spore affinity, specificity and quantity using a ‘wind-tunnel’ 
<br>model. This detection system will identify the individual strain of 
<br>airborne agents/spores with high sensitivity and reproducibility and will 
<br>provide an important bio-sensing tool for monitoring human health in 
<br>industrial and hospital environments as well as during space missions. This 
<br>novel biosensor technology satisfies the NASA SBIR program “Commercial 
<br>Microgravity Research-“Portable Biological Sensors”.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
As set forth in the attached Exhibit 1, the total market size for the 
<br>proposed product is enormous with an estimated total market value of over 
<br>$11M in year one assuming a market penetration in year one of only one-half 
<br>of one percent. According to estimates from the 1999 Commercial Building 
<br>Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS), there are over 4.7 million commercial 
<br>buildings in the U.S., comprising 67.3 billion square feet of floor space. 
<br>Over half of this space was built prior to 1964. Statistics for U.S. 
<br>Government buildings versus non-Government buildings was not located 
<br>although it is expected that the government would typically contract out 
<br>spore detection efforts in all but very secured buildings.

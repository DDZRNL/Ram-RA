<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A technology pioneering solution to a NASA fluid valving problem is presented for funding.  The solution will magnetically couple the linear motion of a globe plug with a novel motorized actuator that operates in ambient conditions.  The proposed seal-less valve will eliminate potential leak paths existing in the cryogenic valves at the Kennedy Space Center.  A continually expanding market for the proposed hermetically sealed control valve exists wherever the escape of fluid produces a hazardous environment or a large maintenance cost.  The solution involves a magnetic coupler consists of only three parts and is based upon permanent magnets acting through a non-magnetic medium.  The coupler utilizes an outer and inner set of many flat, washer-shaped permanent magnets.  The electro-mechanical actuator consists of only seven parts and is based on the principal of a nut and screw.  The noval actuator utilizes multiple axial gap motors connected by a common, non-rotating screw shaft for redundancy.  The 'nut' of the nut-n-screw is part of the armature.  The revolutionary compact, low-speed, high-torque, axial gap motor is a key element of the solution.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
A Permanent Magnet Linear Shaft Coupler is immediately required in the hazardous chemical, cryogenic, and nuclear industry as a leak proof coupling between the actautor (operating in ambient conditions) and the linear mechanical movement of a control valve.  The proposed coupler will eliminate all maintenance and hazardous emissions (and their clean air purges) associated with dynamic "stem packing" seals.  The proposed coupler will permit actuator R&R while the valve is loaded with hazardous chemicals, which is not possible with competing solenoid valve technology that seals the actuator inside the hazardous environment.  And of couse, the proposed coupler offers immediate value by providing a maintenance free "leak proofing" of all hypergolic and cryogenic valves at the Kennedy Space Center.
<br>Other commercial applications are promising:  An engineer with the local Trane, Inc. manufacturing facility stated that a well proven, leak-proof coupler could have a valuable applications in the millions of air conditioner's manufacturered in the HVAC industry each year.  
<br>Finally, a robust, low speed, high torque electric motor would have immediate applications in the Machine Shop Manufacturing Industry as an all inclusive variable speed motor that accepts single or three phase electricity.

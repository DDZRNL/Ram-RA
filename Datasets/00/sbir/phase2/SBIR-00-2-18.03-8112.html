<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASAs Origin Program strategic plans call for direct imaging optical telescopes to evolve from 8 to 30 to 100 meter apertures by 2025. Indirect measurements using long baseline interferometers require Angstrom level precision for long durations. High data rate communications for spatial acquisition and tracking systems require active mirrors and up-down transmission compensation. Fundamental to NASAs vision of the future is high-density deformable mirrors which enable highly corrected optical systems and structures in space.  These high-channel count deformable mirrors use very high-density actuator arrays and new 3D ceramic fabrication techniques to allow contrast enhancement for planetary imaging and correct system-wide optical errors within the telescope. The large, lightweight structures envisioned demand ultra high-density deformable mirrors.  These will perform the necessary correction without sacrificing size or weight.   Xinetics Photonex mirror modules have demonstrated 1 mm actuator spacing with array size of 21 x 21.  Larger modules with arrays up to 128 x 128 will greatly simplify the optical systems and provide even greater capabilities.   Xinetics has developed a 32 x 32 array of actuators with 0.5 mm spacing under Phase I and will continue this exciting evolution in deformable mirror technology under Phase II

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Several commercial applications are viable with the high actuator count, compact, highly reliable modular approach to deformable mirrors and active devices.  Dynamic Gain Equalization Filters (DGEFs) used in the telecommunications industry are the focus of the commercial development in Phase II.  DGEFs are inserted in the optical path within an optical amplifier, and the output of the amplifier measured with a channel ID/power monitor to provide control feedback.  Increasing the actuator density within a given aperture allows more precise control of channel equalization in the optical path of the system.  Ultra high density modules will provide a cost competitive, highly reliable solution to DGEF demands with actuator counts in the thousands in a compact device.  In addition, silicon wafer processing and opthalmic imaging equipment manufacturers have expressed interest in Ultra High Density Module technology.

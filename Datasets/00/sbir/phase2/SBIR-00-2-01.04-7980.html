<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Realtime Oscillation VERifier (ROVER) uses several tests to identify the conditions consistent with PIO, based on commonly available input and response data.  In real-time evaluations on a fixed-base simulator in Phase I, ROVER was effective at detecting PIO, with minimal occurrence of false trips.  Visual indication of the detection of PIO on a Head-Up Display (HUD) provided useful information to the pilot.  ROVER has several other strong uses, including post-processing of time history data to detect oscillatory responses, analysis of past PIO (and non-PIO) events, and rapid determination of the effects of intentional oscillatory-looking control inputs, such as frequency sweeps.  In example applications, ROVER verified the characteristics of the PIO experienced by the prototype YF-22 and suggested that a crash involving an MD-11 was not the result of a classical PIO.  Some practical issues identified for ROVER are noisy and low-sample-rate data, and requirements to tailor the detection flags to extend the monitor to all possible flight conditions, vehicle configurations, and tasks.  ROVER will benefit NASA in future aerospace research programs by minimizing the risk of loss of aircraft due to PIO.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Reports of PIO on commercial aircraft are becoming more common, with recent events leading to loss of property and lives.  ROVER will minimize the risk of catastrophic PIO by warning the unsuspecting pilot, much like stall or overspeed warnings on current airplanes.  Potentially every civil transport airplane in use today, and under development for the future, could be equipped with ROVER.  It is equally amenable to use in high-performance military airplanes.  A non-real-time version of ROVER can be used to post-process data as an analytical tool.  It can provide insights into pilot behavior and aircraft response in PIOs, and can reduce the engineer's workload in searching for evidence of PIO.  ROVER can also discern between normal oscillatory responses and real out-of-control PIOs.  Both the non-real-time and the real-time versions of ROVER have strong market potential.

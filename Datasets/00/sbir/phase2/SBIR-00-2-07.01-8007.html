<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
  The development of a modeling and analysis software environment for studying air traffic flow requirements and operations (MAESTRO) is proposed. The software package is based on the algorithms and techniques developed and demonstrated during the Phase I research. MAESTRO will provide a systematic approach for synthesizing traffic flow models using airspace geometric data. The software will incorporate methods from automatic control theory to help analyze the controllability of the air traffic environment with respect to specified flow control locations in the airspace, traffic latency between pairs of departure-arrival locations, observability of the traffic flow with respect to measurements, and the stability and robustness of specific traffic flow control schemes.  Algorithms for employing the flow models to determine the stochastic properties of the air traffic environment will be included. Finally, the synthesis techniques will be provided for developing stable and robust decision aids for use in air traffic flow control. 
<br>  The software package will be commercialized at the end of Phase II work. Phase III work demonstrated the benefits of using this software in real-time flow control operations.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
  Modeling and analysis methodologies developed in the present research are useful in any problem involving the movement of discrete objects through specified pathways. Thus, these analysis approaches can be used to develop reliable algorithms for routing of Internet protocol packets, IP-server load balancing and for developing strategies to combat IP-server intrusions. The techniques developed under this research can also be used to develop strategies for controlling discrete manufacturing processes, and for the development of intelligent highway-vehicle systems.

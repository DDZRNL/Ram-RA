<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The main objective of this project is to design and implement  efficient on-line Failure Detection,
<br>Identification and Reconfiguration  (FDIR) algorithms for an advanced military aircraft in the
<br>presence of  flight-critical  control actuator failures.  The  proposed  FDIR system  will  combine
<br>an  advanced decentralized on-line FDI scheme with efficient adaptive  reconfigurable control
<br>algorithms to assure effective  failure  compensation  and flight safety  improvement despite
<br>severe subsystem and component  failures.  In order to achieve these objectives, we propose
<br>to carry out the following  tasks:  (i)  Formulate  the FDIR problem; (ii)  Determine  Sensitivity
<br>-To-Failures  (STF) of the aircraft  dynamic model; (iii)  Design an  efficient  FDIR  scheme;
<br>(iv)  Evaluation, Verification  and Validation  (EVV); and (v) Software Tool Development and
<br>Commercialization.  It is  envisioned that the design  will be  developed  to meet the
<br>specifications arising  from the new  Intelligent  Vehicle  Program led by NASA  DFRC.
<br>Boeing Phantom Works will provide technical and commercialization support.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Increasingly  complex  equipment  has  substantially  increased  the costs  and complexity of  maintenance
<br>of modern  aircraft and other  engineering systems.  Hence Health  Monitoring,  Failure  Detection and
<br>Identification (HM-FDI), and Adaptive  Reconfigurable Control (ARC) techniques and related software
<br>tools are becoming  increasingly  important  and  commercially  attractive.  A commercial product that
<br>will result from the proposed research is a comprehensive software toolbox for the design of
<br>HM-FDI/ARC  systems.  Potential  applications of the software  tool  exist  in  civilian  and  defense
<br>areas   including aircraft, helicopters, jet engines and chemical and process control.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The objective for Phase II is to develop a compact, fiber-optic analyzer and method for real-time monitoring of turbine engine oil condition.  Although a combination of existing physical, chemical, and spectroscopic methods is capable of providing a detailed profile of oil quality, there is a need for methods compatible with real-time measurements to rapidly assess oil condition without requiring removal of samples for laboratory analysis.  Results obtained during Phase I demonstrated that Raman spectrometry could be used to achieve this goal by monitoring spectral changes resulting from degradation of the base ester and antioxidant additives in common synthetic turbine oil compositions.  The feasibility of the approach was demonstrated using a portable Raman spectrometer coupled with a fiber optic probe.  During Phase II, multivariate analysis will be used to refine the methodology by identifying the most appropriate spectra preprocessing techniques, and generating a calibrated model relating the Raman spectra to the extent of degradation.  Parameters extracted from the model will be used to construct an artificial neural network that will translate the data into an index of oil condition.  The spectrometer, preprocessing methods, and neural network will be compiled into a prototype device, and demonstrated using a small-scale turbine engine.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The proposed analyzer and analysis method focuses on real-time monitoring of synthetic turbine engine oil condition.  This technology could be used as aircraft or other turbine engine oil health sensors in many departments of the U.S. Government, including NASA and the Department of Defense.  The exact same technology could be used by the commercial airline industry, as well as the energy industry where turbine engines are used to generate electricity from coal, natural gas, or fossil fuels.  Furthermore, with minor modifications in the methodology, the proposed technique could be applied to the lubricant industry as an online spectroscopic analyzer for rapid quality control analysis.

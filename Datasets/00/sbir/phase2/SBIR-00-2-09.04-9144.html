<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The overall goal of this program is to develop a feedback-controlled directional solidification system capable of maintaining a separation gap between the solidifying charge and its containment, the so-called detached Bridgman growth. 
<br>
<br>The Phase I work focused on development and testing of an eddy-current sensor for detecting the presence as well as measuring the magnitude of the charge/crucible separation gap. Based on these results, we believe that eddy-current sensors have the necessary sensitivity to detect gap thicknesses expected to be present during detached growth, and can provide the necessary signal for achieving feedback control of detached growth.  In Phase II of this program,  we propose to develop a feedback-controlled detached growth  process based on eddy current sensors,  and to grow a number of different materials with and different diameters with this technique. 
<br>

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Reduction of defects generated by the interaction of the charge with the crucible will significantly increase the yield of commercial production of electronic materials as well as their properties.  The commercial materials producers are expected to embrace a system that can achieve detached or partially detached growth of semiconductor crystals.

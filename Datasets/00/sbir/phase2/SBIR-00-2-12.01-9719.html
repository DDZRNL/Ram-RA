<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Platform Digital proposes to develop and market the Remote Experience and Learning Tool (REAL Tool) that will allow educators, scientists and researchers to quickly and easily create interactive 3D models from NASA data sets for the study, evaluation, and presentation of science in an engaging and fun way.  REAL will enable the public to actively explore NASA remote sites via 3D computer game style representations derived from 3D sensor data from past, current and future NASA missions such as Pathfinder, Odyssey, and 2003 Mars rover missions.  Platform Digital?s experienced team of software engineers and designers is completing a Phase I feasibility study and alpha prototype of the REAL tool, which will allow educators and scientists to create remote experiences based on NASA exploration missions.  PI Coppin has led similar projects with successful outcomes that often surpass initial program goals.  The commercial application of the REAL Tool is viable in the education services industry in the functional areas of Earth and space sciences, with possible extension to life sciences, medical, and real estate.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The Remote Experience and Learning Tool (REAL Tool) that Platform Digital proposes to design, develop and market will have a number of viable commercial applications for consumers in diverse segments.  The first application that REAL will address is the $70 billion education services industry, with three major niche markets: (1) Earth and space science classrooms in domestic and foreign middle schools, (2) NASA education outreach programs, and (3) Science centers.  Platform Digital also intends to develop REAL with capabilities to make live NASA missions available to the public in time for the 2003 Mars Rover Missions.  Teachers, students, scientists, researchers, and the general public will benefit from this commercial application as they prepare classroom lessons, conduct research, prepare presentations, and explore the newest data from a remote planet on their desktop computers.  Platform Digital?s five-year plan includes expanding the commercial applications to the fields of medicine, real estate, and distance learning, incorporating multimedia into the REAL technology.

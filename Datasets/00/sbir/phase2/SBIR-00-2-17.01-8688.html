<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This SBIR Phase II Project proposes to use the semiconducting material AlxGa1-xN to develop a photocathode for highly sensitive, solar-blind photomultipliers. The band gap of AlxGa1-xN has a long wavelength cutoff that can be varied from 365 to 200 nm as the Al molar fraction increases from zero to one. Further, this compound can show a negative electron affinity (NEA) and can be used in high temperature and high power applications. In the phase I effort, NanoSciences successfully engineered working AlxGa1-xN photocathodes on (0001) sapphire substrates. The Phase II AlxGa1-xN photocathode program will involve the following tasks: 1) surface treatment to remove contaminants and improve Ga deficiencies, 2) making good Ohmic electrical contacts, 3) refining the cesium and oxygen termination treatments, 4) characterizing the material, optical, and photoelectric properties, and 5) the photocathode will be coupled to micromachined silicon microchannel plate (MCP) and miniature photomultiplier tube (MPMT) technologies to produce high gain (>1,000) detectors that operate at low power, high speed, and over a large dynamic range. Sensitive in the short-wavelength ultraviolet (UV), l < 290 nm, region of the spectrum, these detectors respond to relevant emission bands for UV astronomy, atmospheric ozone monitoring, optical data storage, and remote sensing of earth resources.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
UV sensitive photomultipliers would be beneficial to NASA for the remote sensing of earths resources, atmospheric ozone level monitoring, UV astronomy, astronomical survey instrumentation, and satellite and spacecraft communication systems. The military would have use for this device as in-flight aircraft sensors, biological agent detection, and missile plume signature sensors. Commercial applications include: medical diagnostic instruments, chemical analysis, fiber-optic communications, UVR monitoring for agricultural and personnel exposure, combustion monitoring of gases in the presence of a hot background, UV spectroscopy, furnace control systems, integrated optical systems, very high speed machine vision and robotic vision sensors, and next generation optical data storage.

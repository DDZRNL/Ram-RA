<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
EDAptive Computing, Inc. (EDAptive), the University of Kansas (KU), and Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corporation (BATC) propose a unique and commercially viable solution to the problem of automated code synthesis by reusing existing components in an enterprise, starting with declarative specification of the desired system. Our proposed solution, namely the eCIS tool suite, automates reuse of existing software components through their retrieval, adaptation and integration by applying innovative automated reasoning techniques. Our proposed Enterprise Component Integration System (eCIS) project leverages the following:
<br>
<br>(i)	An emerging System-Level Design Language (SLDL), Rosetta, and KU?s leadership in development of the language,
<br>(ii)	EDAptive ?s ongoing R & D in formal specification-based retrieval to accurately match requirements with existing functionality,
<br>(iii)	KU?s expertise in formal methods, especially adaptation techniques, 
<br>(iv)	BATC's Collaborative Enterprise Environment and EDAptive?s  reseller status, and 
<br>(v)	Partnership with The MathWorks (MathWorks).
<br>
<br>Although the proposed eCIS tool suite is applicable to a variety of application areas; our Phase II effort will focus on enabling reuse by communication system designers, especially wireless designers, through integration of the core eCIS retrieval and adaptation engine with MathWorks Simulink.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The eCIS tool suite is applicable to a variety of application areas; however, eCIS enabled component reuse by communication system designers, especially wireless designers, holds high probability of commercialization success.  Users of eCIS will specify their requirements for DSP components using Simulink (architecture) and Rosetta (component behavior). The architecture and component requirements will be translated into a system Rosetta specification for use by the core eCIS engine. The user will select from a specification library, Rosetta specifications of DSP and communication blocksets, including that for Texas Instruments and Motorola DSPs that are sold by MathWorks with Simulink. Given Rosetta specifications of blocksets, users will be able to generate and archive Rosetta specifications of pre-existing designs within an enterprise that employ MathWorks DSP and Communication libraries. Given a database of Rosetta specifications of previously created designs as well as a Rosetta specification of the desired system, eCIS core engine will retrieve matching components from the database, and adapt found components to create a solution to meet the user requirements.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Flexible thin film photovoltaics (PV) solar array systems offer significant mass and cost saving benefits for current and future space-flight missions.  Promising progress has been made in the development of thin film CIGS and amorphous silicon PV devices, however their integration into a solar array system is very immature.  As thin film PV devices have evolved, ABLE has spent a significant amount of effort in developing many ultra-lightweight solar array systems and flexible blanket subsystems that can take advantage of the emerging lightweight PV devices.  One of these systems is an advanced configuration of ABLE's UltraFlex solar array populated/integrated with thin film PV.  Results of the Phase 1 effort concluded that an advanced thin film PV UltraFlex solar array system represents a feasible solution that can demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of array mass (>300 w/kg BOL with 10% efficient thin film PV, >600 w/kg BOL with 20% efficient thin film PV), reduced cost (potential of an order of magnitude reduction), and compact stowage volume (<20% of a traditional planar array).  The proposed Phase 2 effort will mature the advanced thin film PV UltraFlex technology by furthering detail design and producing/testing Engineering Model hardware, in an effort to validate and this enabling technology for space flight and commercialize for future applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The specific commercial product resulting from the proposed program will be a high performance thin film PV solar array system.  This system will have many discriminating performance advantages that will leapfrog the competition.  These major discriminating features will include extremely low cost, extremely light weight, and extremely compact stowage volume.  In our view, this technology will become mission enabling for weight and cost sensitive missions when compared to its competition.  These exceptional performance attributes provide a clear indication of the thin film PV UltraFlex?s market potential.  The intrinsic performance and operational benefits of the thin film PV UltraFlex make it suitable for a variety of current and future government and commercial orbital and interplanetary missions.  The importance of the thin film PV UltraFlex array allows ABLE to enhance its strategic position as a solar array systems supplier leader.  Currently, the traditional solar array market is projected between $300M to $500M.  Once the thin film PV UltraFlex is completely qualified, it will capture a very large portion of the available solar array market.  The proposed Phase 2 program has been structured to accelerate the commercialization of this technology and ready it for space-flight in approximately three years.  ABLE is committed to commercializing the developed system as an ABLE solar array systems product for all military and commercial applications.  ABLE has a demonstrated history in commercializing enabling solar array system and structural system technologies to market.

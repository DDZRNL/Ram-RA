<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The offerer, using a proven design methodology in Phase I, demonstrated the feasibility of an innovative hygiene aid for use in the International Space Station and on other long-term manned missions.  The device is of multiple configuration (provides a cleansing function for skin, hair, and housekeeping functions) and operates independently of ISS systems, save for minimal power.  Using a proprietary gel formulation applied through the Astroclean unit, the user washes then the waste gel, body oils, exfoliated skin, and soil are immediately vacuumed into a holding container for later removal.  The gel formulation is entirely organic and water soluble, yet adheres to the surface in micro-gravity until collected.  Phase II enables further design and engineering development for the unit and will result in delivery of prototype devices for incremental and iterative NASA testing.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Astroclean has significant terrestrial applications for medical/nursing care, the military, and numerous recreational activities.  The ability to nearly 'dry-clean' a patient while at the same time applying skin lotion, antibiotics, or other emollients will be very attractive.  The military has long battled the issue of cleansing on the battlefield and a portable, battery operated, ruggedized version of the Astroclean device appears poised to answer those needs.  Recreational users may enjoy a commercial version of Astroclean to provide an alternative to the 'bird bath' in a cold mountain stream!  Finally, the technology offers an alternative cleaning mechanism for use in areas where water is interrupted, unavailable, or contaminated and can satisfy the hygiene needs of the populace or relief community.

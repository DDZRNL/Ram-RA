<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Rechargeable Li-ion batteries are projected to become a $3.5 billion/year industry within the next three years.  In state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries, the major constituent of the cathode is lithium cobalt oxide powder, which amounts to an estimated $700 million/year in terms of powder market.  In Phase I, using our newly developed chemical synthesis process, we developed non-toxic and low cost nanostructured lithium manganese oxide powders with a layered structure.  The powders were stable over a wide range of voltage (4.2-2.0V).  Cathodes made of these powders did not exhibit significant capacity loss during an electrochemical cycling.   The energy density of these powders was comparable to state-of-the-art lithium cobalt oxide powders.  Capitalizing on Phase I innovation, in Phase II we propose to develop cathode materials that will lead to Li-ion polymer batteries with an exceptional energy density (> 225 Wh/kg) and long cycle life (~ 500) at high enough discharge rates.  The objective of the Phase II program is to prepare our technology for commercialization.  This entails producing kilogram quantities of nanopowders at a competitive cost and fabricating prototype Li-ion polymer batteries with cathodes utilizing high performance nanostructured materials.  A successful Phase II program will lead to partnerships with powder producers and battery manufacturers, facilitating rapid commercialization of our technology.  Phase III will constitute production of tonnage quantities of this new class of nanostructured powders, and implementing them in space and commercial Li-ion polymer batteries.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Rechargeable Li-ion polymer batteries that require high volumetric and gravimetric energy densities and long cycle life, are becoming crucial for a number of space and commercial applications.  The electrochemical properties of the cathode materials limit the overall performance of the battery, and so there is an impetus to increase the energy density and simultaneously reduce the toxicity and lower the cost.  Our program is aimed at providing a solution to this particular need of rechargeable Li-ion polymer batteries.

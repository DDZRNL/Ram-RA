<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Space based lidar systems for the remote sensing of Ozone require high-power, high-efficiency lasers operating in the ultraviolet.  Diode-pumped solid-state lasers are the primary candidates for this application.  A promising material for use in lasers for the remote sensing of Ozone is Nd:Y2O3 operating at 914 nm and 948 nm using the 4F3/2 to 4I9/2 transition of the Nd3+ ion.  This material offers several advantages over other crystals, including a lower threshold for oscillation of this transition, high thermal conductivity, and a broad transmission range from 0.23 microns to 8 microns.  Recent studies indicate that Nd:Y2O3 is well suited to Ozone lidar applications provided that crystals of sufficient size and quality are available.  The primary difficulty in producing crystals of this material is its very high melting point (2410 C) that has previously prevented the use of apparatus and techniques typically employed to grow high melting point oxide crystals.  This Phase II SBIR project is aimed at developing commercial growth systems to produce Y2O3 using existing production crystal growth equipment currently employed for growth of Nd3+:YAG crystals and at scaling these systems to produce laser rods of sufficient size for use in systems that meet NASA?s requirements for Ozone sensing.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Nd doped yttria would have direct application in diode pumped laser oscillators and amplifiers where the replacement of Nd:YAG with a material of higher thermal conductivity would enable improved performance.  A second application is for use in 4 to 8 micron optics because of the broad transmission of yttria in this region of the spectrum.  A third application is for high temperature optics.  This material can be inserted directly into a hot gas stream for thermal studies above 2000 degrees C.

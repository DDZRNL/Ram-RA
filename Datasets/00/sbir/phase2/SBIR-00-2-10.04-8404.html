<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Great strides have been made in developing diagnostic systems for detecting and identifying specific pathogens and their toxins.  However, these systems may be too specific and unable to detect newly emerging pathogens whose immunological or genetic profile is different than the normal complement of pathogens.  The ideal system in an isolated environment such as a spacecraft would be one that provided a warning if any pathogen is present.  
<br>
<br>Having proven the components of a powerful mast cell biodetection technology in the Phase I, we will focus in the Phase II on developing an integrated prototype system suitable for both ultra low-gravity and earth-based applications.  The major objectives of the Phase II will include: developing microfabricated biochips for use with the mast cell system; engineering novel receptors for new pathogenic targets, including viruses; developing mast cell biochip storage and packaging for use in extended space missions; constructing a prototype fluorometric instrument for use in low gravity environments; and characterizing and demonstrating the use of this novel immunosensor for detecting microbial contamination for space and commercial applications.  At the conclusion of the Phase II, Agave BioSystems will deliver the prototype instrument to the sponsor for field-testing and continue with Phase III commercialization.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
As our knowledge of newly emerging pathogens expands, assay methods must not only be sensitive and accurate but also predictive in terms of recognizing pathogens beyond our current definitions.  The recent emergence of E. coli O157:H7 demonstrates that in nature there are potential threats that may not be fully recognized.  Diagnostic devices based upon virulence and pathogenesis rather than upon a genus or species label will be an important advance in accurately defining the risk.  Therefore this technology will find utility in a number of applications that extend beyond space flight and relate to testing of foodborne, waterborne, or airborne contaminants and allergens.

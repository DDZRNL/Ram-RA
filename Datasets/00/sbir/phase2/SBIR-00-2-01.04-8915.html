<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
ASRI proposes to develop an advanced and commercially viable CPLE Health Monitoring System (CPLE-HMS) utilizing a novel spectral enhancement method to provide incipient fault-detection capabilities for rotating machinery.  Based on a new spectral analysis technique called Coherent Phase Line Enhancer (CPLE), CPLE-HMS will significantly enhance all speed-related signatures in vibration measurements thus providing early detection of critical vibration signatures.  Unlike the conventional Power Spectral Density (PSD) function method, the CPLE technique incorporates phase information into the spectral estimation process by detecting a unique coherent phase relationship associated with all speed-related signal components in the wave-number domain.  Accordingly, the CPLE spectrum detects well-hidden fault-mechanism signatures (bearing, gear, rotor instability, etc.) that are often unnoticed by conventional PSD.  The significance of the proposed innovation is attributed to its enhanced capability to cope with severe operational environments where health-monitoring measurements are heavily corrupted by background noise.  The Phase I study has successfully demonstrated the feasibility and unique capability of  CPLE-HMS as a reliable HMS.  Phase II study will expand on Phase I to complete the design, development, and test of the prototype CPLE-HMS hardware/software system.  Phase III objective is to build a fully integrated CPLE-HMS product for other commercial aircraft and manufacturing applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
A portable low-cost Engine Health Monitoring System has strong commercial application.  The commercial transportation and power generation industries will benefit from its availability as will the manufacturing sector where production lines frequently rely on critical, active machinery.  Implementing an effective health monitoring system in these commercial arenas will reduce the risks of catastrophic hardware losses and plant downtime.  The commercial potential for an effective CPLE-HMS in the market place has been recognized by several of ASRI's customers.

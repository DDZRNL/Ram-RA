<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The overall goal of this SBIR project is to develop a new in vitro assay 
<br>model for monitoring the adverse effects of microgravity on human 
<br>cell/tissue growth and function. This also satisfies NASA’s program to 
<br>study inducible physiological changes in humans during spaceflights. 
<br>Previous work has shown that microgravity can modify host cell-matrix 
<br>interactions, and thereby exert potentially deleterious effects on human 
<br>vascular, immune and bone functions and regeneration processes.
<br>Unfortunately, defined functional models to study discrete adaptations in 
<br>target tissues are not yet known. In Phase I, we successfully created a 
<br>novel human biomatrix coculture system, for growth and activation of 
<br>endothelial cells. The practical feasibility of 3D Amgel microbeads was 
<br>demonstrated for cell proliferation and differentiation (angiogenesis). 
<br>Major advantages of Amgel model include it’s physiologic milieu and defined 
<br>biologic activity. We now propose to develop and commercialize Amgel-based 
<br>3D coculture systems for human tissue growth and functional studies. Three 
<br>extended tasks will be undertaken: 1. To institute efficient protocols for 
<br>Amgel production and formulation with coherent biological properties; 2. To 
<br>further develop and establish 3D human biomatrix configurations using
<br>advanced automated technologies; and 3. To validate the functional 
<br>properties of new coculture systems using NASA’s rotary bioreactors. 
<br>Morphologic, mitogenic and angiogenic events during the organotypic 
<br>bioassays will be monitored using our time-lapsed bioimaging system 
<br>(CytoScan). We predict these defined Amgel biomatrix & coculture kits will 
<br>be the first marketable human bioassay systems. This R&D proposal will 
<br>significantly impact both basic and biomedical arenas including tissue 
<br>engineering, wound healing, drug discovery and space biology. Thus, 3D 
<br>human cell-matrix te

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
No acceptable commercial 3D bioassay system for tissue growth and 
<br>development currently exists which utilizes a defined human biomatrix. We 
<br>will develop, optimize and evaluate different cell-matrix coculture systems 
<br>(Amgel microbeads, bilayered discs). Sale of proprietary Amgel and 
<br>pre-packed culture kits will have a world-wide market, both as a research 
<br>tool and a diagnostic tool. The multiple applications and commercialization 
<br>of our bioengineering products will significantly impact both research and 
<br>biomedical institutions.

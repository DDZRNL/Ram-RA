<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In their Phase I SBIR program, Technology in Blacksburg (Techsburg) demonstrated the feasibility of flow control for providing added stall margin to the UEET compressor. This was shown computationally on an isolated row of stators. Phase II intends to expand on Phase I results by demonstrating the capabilities of flow control in a state-of-the-art, multi-stage, transonic turbomachinery environment. To achieve this goal, Techsburg has teamed with AP Solutions, who will provide CFD support, and Roll-Royce Corporation in Indianapolis who will be providing mechanical design and analysis of the flow control stators to be rig tested.
<br>
<br>By preventing separation on the suction surface of stators, ejector pump flow control prevents stall of the stator during off-design flow conditions. As a result, the exit flow angle and pressure rise across the stator more closely resemble design conditions even when the inlet flow angle is as much as 10 degrees beyond design. Consequently, the inlet conditions for the downstream stages remains close to design and overall operability of the compressor is improved.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The product of this research program will be a technology that will be incorporated into future designs of gas turbine engines. To achieve this goal, Techsburg is developing this technology with aid from NASA Glenn and the UEET program. NASA Glenn and the UEET represent the forefront of technology development for future commercial gas turbine engines. The stated goal of the UEET program is ?to develop and hand off revolutionary turbine engine propulsion technologies that will enable future generation vehicles over a wide range of flight speeds.? Through participation with NASA Glenn, Techsburg is better positioning its technology for future implementation in commercial gas turbine engines.

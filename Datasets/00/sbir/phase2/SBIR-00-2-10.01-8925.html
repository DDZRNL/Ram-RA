<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Current space water reclamation systems require resupply and expendable use that are too large for long duration remote applications such as Mars expeditions and lunar bases and expensive for long duration earth orbit missions.  We propose development of a novel jet-induced cavitation process for water reclamation that would be lightweight, low maintenance, low energy, reliable, and require little or no expendables. The proposed technology would accomplish four water reclamation functions: total organic carbon (TOC) reduction, oxygenation, oxidation of specific compounds that are problematic for current systems, and microorganism reduction. 
<br>
<br>Ultrasonic cavitation is known to produce reactions in water resulting in organic compound oxidation. We have demonstrated that jet-induced cavitation can accomplish this with two orders of magnitude greater energy efficiency. In Phase I we demonstrated the feasibility of DYNAJET? cavitating jets to accomplish multiple water reclamation functions. 
<br>
<br>In Phase II we propose to perform a detailed investigation of microorganism destruction, expand the parameter range investigated and optimize the system for individual and simultaneous water reclamation functions, and develop predictive models and scaling laws. A design study for specific NASA applications including assessment of microgravity effects will be conducted. A laboratory prototype will be delivered to NASA for evaluation.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Successful completion of the proposed effort will produce a new state of the art technology for the treatment and disinfection of wastewater resulting in a high efficiency advanced life support water reclamation system for long duration space applications. It could be directly utilized in all manned space applications. Its potential non-NASA commercial applications are vast. It could be used for treatment of drinking water, groundwater, wastewater, and industrial process water, as a stand-alone process or as a part of a treatment train. It would provide a simple economical means of organic wastewater treatment and drinking water disinfection without the potential hazards of chlorination by-products.  There is a growing need for such technology throughout the world as the demand for potable water supplies increases and the available supply decreases. It is anticipated that both small and large-scale systems based on this technology could be designed to achieve a high degree of cost-effectiveness.  Such a technology will immediately find a wide demand with potentially huge benefits to both national and international markets.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In the Phase II program, Agave BioSystems will complete the development of this innovative device by assembling and integrating all components for a self-contained, easy to use instrument.  To assist in this development effort, Dr. James L. Leary of University of Texas Medical Branch - Galveston and Prof. George Malliaras of Cornell University will act as consultants.  Having proven the principals of operation, the focus will be on development of microfluidic interconnects for complete systems integration; optimization of fabrication techniques for reliable, high-performance characteristics; miniaturization of auxiliary components such as air supplies and electro-optics; and engineering of electronic controls and user interface.  At the completion of the program, Agave BioSystems will deliver a working prototype instrument to the NASA sponsor ready for testing and evaluation.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Since the nanoSort will be independent of droplet formation, versatility of this instrument will be enhanced over existing systems, whether for space or earth-based cytometric sorting. The nanoSort will be significantly easier and cheaper to operate than conventional fluorescence-activated cell sorters, will achieve a small footprint per unit separation, and will require much smaller input populations.  Because the microfluidic component of the nanoSort flow cytometer will be small and inexpensive to fabricate, it will be readily disposable, eliminating cross contamination between samples, and making it especially attractive for use in space and in the field.  In addition, the miniaturization of the flow chambers will allow configurations for parallel processing which will make these systems highly scalable.  Inexpensive devices that rapidly sort live cells, particles and even single molecules would greatly facilitate screening of combinatorial chemical, biochemical or biological libraries taking advantage of the enormous power of in vitro evolution.  Such devices would have wide applications in clinical medicine and basic research.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Recent developments have illustrated the tremendous potential of Micro
<br>Rotorcraft (MRCs) for new missions such as remote sensing, surveillance,
<br>and autonomous exploration.  To date, little effort has been directed
<br>toward addressing the severe aerodynamic limitations inherent in operating
<br>at low Reynolds number that have greatly constrained MRC performance.
<br>Phase I of this effort saw the development of novel blade configurations
<br>tailored to a range of MRC missions via a combination of advanced
<br>optimization methods for low Re airfoils and application of established
<br>rotor analysis tools.  These validated analyses demonstrated the potential
<br>of new configurations to provide double the payload or endurance of current
<br>generation MRCs.  Phase II will build on this to yield new, comprehensive
<br>design analysis software to support development of next generation MRC
<br>rotor systems, forming the foundation of a suite of tools enabling
<br>multi-disciplinary optimization of the full range of rotorcraft from MRCs
<br>to full scale vehicles.   This will enable a formal design capability for
<br>MRCs, bypassing the prevalent cut-and-try approach.  The design analysis
<br>will then be used to perform a complete design of an MRC rotor system for a
<br>free flight vehicle.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The recent rapid expansion of MRC missions in defense applications is being
<br>mirrored by growth in possible civil roles for MRC concepts, including
<br>aerial imaging, inspection, and specialized payload delivery.  Important
<br>Phase III goals of this effort would include producing and marketing a
<br>family of rotor systems for next generation MRCs, as well as providing
<br>software for design of autonomous rotorcraft for future missions, including
<br>possible exploration of planetary atmospheres.  In addition, through a
<br>collaboration with established industry partners during Phase II, the low
<br>Re design technology to be developed here will be applied both to the
<br>development of improved autonomous helicopters as well as to the design of
<br>high efficiency cooling fans for air treatment applications.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Successful Phase I work resulted in an optimized C-SiC technology and the fabrication of 8?x8?x2? composites and a deliverable of 15? O.D and 2.5? thick disc composites.
<br>
<br>Mechanical properties such as tensile strength (RT, 2500 F), and shear strength were determined.  These results were found to be equal or greater than the state?of?the art CVI produced composites.
<br>
<br>Phase II addresses the issues of process development to further increase the UTS, higher toughness, and improved environmental durabilities for these novel composites.
<br>
<br>This Phase II proposed program will extend the accomplishments of Phase I to the fabrication of 40? O.D, and 2.5? thick C-SiC discs.

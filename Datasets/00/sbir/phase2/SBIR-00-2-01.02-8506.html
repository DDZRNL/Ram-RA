<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Mide is proposing to develop enhanced energy absorbing aircraft seats using superelastic Nickel Titanium alloy.  The goals are to enhance crashworthiness while reducing weight in a cost-effective program.  The proposed work will follow a two pronged approach to develop the material technology while identifying and developing seat products in parallel.  In Phase I, the advantages of the material were demonstrated, and preliminary concepts were explored.  Phase II will advance the material technology and will continue to qualify the material for the operational environment.  Qualification tests will be performed.  Crash simulations and sled impact testing will be performed on selected seat systems to demonstrate performance.
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The technology developed will lead to aircraft seat products that can have a direct impact on the performance and weight of crashworthy seating systems.  Markets include military and commercial aircraft, including rotorcraft, and general aviation aircraft.  Additional opportunities will be pursued in other industries, including automotive crash safety.

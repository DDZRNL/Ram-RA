<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Human exploration and commercial exploitation of space is bogged down because of the lack of safe, low cost access to LEO. Opening the ?Final Frontier? requires a rocketplane with a "breakthrough" propulsion system and capable of airplane-like safety and reliability.  In Phase I of this SBIR, the Alchemist Air Collection and Enrichment System (ACES) was shown through analysis to provide the promised ?breakthrough? performance and safety advantages. In Phase II, we propose to take a key element of ACES, the air separator, and experimentally demonstrate that this technology is ready and available for use. The goal during this SBIR is to: 1) generate a two-phase thermodynamic model of the proposed single stage vortex tube air separator, and 2) demonstrate experimentally a 90 percent oxygen yield at 90 percent purity from a single stage vortex tube.  This technology has many applications besides saving weight and improving the reliability of RLVs.  It can be used on the ground for in situ generation of emergency oxygen at hospitals and for safeing fuel tanks and grain silos.  We propose to use it to enable a Suborbital Business Jet as the first step to space.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The Business Jet market is predicted to be worth $115 B over the next decade.  This market now exceeds the market for high performance fighter planes, and Teal Group has forecast a 50% chance that someone will launch a supersonic business jet (SSBJ) in the next fifteen years.  This market is driven by productivity in that the executives can work while in the air and depart when it?s convenient for them, not for the airlines.  A step beyond the SSBJ is the Suborbital Business Jet (SOBJ), which could reduce an all-day flight to three hours, allowing both travel and business to be conducted within an executive?s sixteen-hour day.  The SOBJ would takeoff from existing airports, cruise for two hours to generate LOX using Alchemist ACES, rocket boost to a suborbital trajectory, and then skip-glide to the vicinity of its destination. It would arrive under jet power with passengers who are now official astronauts. We think a market penetration of ten to fifteen percent is not unreasonable for the Suborbital Business Jet, which is roughly one to one-and-a-half billion dollars per year in the time frame of interest. Another subsidiary market, Overnight International Package Delivery, is just as lucrative.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
With the completion of the International Space Station the level of extravehicular activity (EVA) is set to dramatically expand.  Space suits worn by astronauts during EVA are pressurized to 4-5psi, significantly less than the pressure of the space station.  These conditions have lead to a concern by NASA regarding decompression sickness (DCS).     
<br>
<br>In this project we propose to provide NASA with a greatly improved capability to image extravascular gas concentrations hypothesized to be the cause of DCS.  It is has been difficult to confirm this hypothesis because to date there is no capability to detect and image extravascular gas bubbles in vivo. This is an important need.  Existing Doppler ultrasound systems are adequate for the detection of intravascular gas concentrations but insensitive to gas formations in tissue where the motion of gas is limited.
<br>
<br>The proposed capability is embodied in a transmission ultrasound camera design that improves on the camera used by Imperium in its NASA SBIR Phase I effort.  The new camera will have improved spatial resolution, sensitivity, dynamic range and the capability to study subjects while being exposed to hyperbaric or hypobaric conditions.  Experiments on animals and human subjects will be performed using the improved camera.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Imperium is focused on the development of next-generation ultrasound imaging systems.  We have identified four areas of commercial application for these systems.  These are non-destructive testing, industrial imaging, medical imaging, and undersea imaging.  Imperium is pursuing the deployment of commercial systems in these areas and the research proposed for an imaging system to support DCS research is directly applicable to these applications.  We have twelve commercial installations for medical, industrial, and nondestructive testing uses. 
<br>
<br>The potentially large market impact for Imperium's ultrasound technology has attracted interest and funding from the non-government investment community.  This cash investment is in exchange for equity in Imperium.  Thus the investor's return on investment will begin only upon commercial release of the Imperium imager and is based solely on volume sales of the ultrasound system.  This investment is based on their confidence in the Imperium team as well as the large market potential.

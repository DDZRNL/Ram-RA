<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 In this SBIR effort we propose an innovative approach for the integration of Decision Support Tools (DSTs) for increased situational awareness, improved cooperative scheduling and collaborative decision-making in all parts of the air space. We propose to investigate two types of integration models based on the extent and feasibility of the level of integration and use appropriate game theoretic approaches to analyze these models. The proposed models are: (i) Data-sharing DST integration model: In this model, DSTs will primarily share data that is required for each DST to take a decision before an event happens. Based on the shared data each DST acts independently (ii) Interacting DST integration model: In this model, DSTs not only share data but also advise each other to act in such a way to reduce the level of conflict. Tools based on repeated strategic games and cooperative bargaining games will be used. We primarily focus on integrating Traffic Management Advisories (TMAs) across multiple centers as the application domain for the Phase I effort.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The successful development of a DST for Traffic Flow management based on increased situational awareness, improved cooperative scheduling and collaborative decision-making between sectors, centers and regions can position IAI as a key player in the ATM market.  Currently there does not exist any DST for sector metering based on time-based collaborative metering. The proposed DST will result in significant increase in NAS-wide capacity and reduction in delays, resulting in cost savings to the NAS stakeholders that include the passengers, airlines, military and ATSPs. Our Phase II effort will result in the development of game-theoretic tools that can easily be tailored to meet the needs of integrating other decision support tools as required by NASA's the Distributed Air Ground (DAG-TM) initiative. This is a fairly untapped market, still in its infancy, but with an extremely high commercialization potential. IAI is already developing agent-based software for NAS-wide simulations of ATM operations under free flight/ DAG-TM scenarios. The DST will be integrated into the simulation toolbox providing users the ability to evaluate new ATM concepts and assess the impact of the DST. Participation of Raytheon and Booz Allen & Hamilton in our Phase II effort to help IAI commercialize our technology gives us unique competitive advantage.

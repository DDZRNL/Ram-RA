<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) has demonstrated a novel method of producing thin film reflectors for solar sails based upon electrospinning nanofiber membranes. The nanofiber membranes have been made from space durable LaRC CP-1 and CP-2 polymer with high reflectivity (>90%), low areal density (<2.5 g/m2), and excellent tear resistance (>100% elongation). The Gossamer design format requires very large and thin solar sails that are very lightweight, and utilize photons for propulsion.  The solar sail is envisioned to occur by terrestrial fabrication of ultra-thin polymer films, seaming the films together, launching the sail into orbit and deploying the sail without damaging these ultra-thin films.  The current state of the art in polymer materials, and in polymer thin film processing technologies are challenged to permit tear and defect free solar sail launch and deployment.  The electrospinning process will produce large area polymeric membranes that meet the mechanical, areal density, space durability, cost, and propulsion requirements of the NASA missions.  The method will be advanced during the proposed Phase II effort, with assistance from Prof. Darrell Reneker and SRS Technologies, for the in space fabrication of solar sails from melt electrospun CP-1.  Modeling, experimentation and end user feedback will be utilized to develop this technology.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The electrospun thin membrane technology is focused on the production of membranes for solar sail applications, with a very unique materials requirement.  Terrestrial applications of this membrane fabrication process may include improved membranes for gas separation, chemical and biological barrier materials, improved multi-layer plastic barrier packaging, specialty bandages and other markets that could utilize thin polymer membranes.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 		Triton Systems, Inc. is teaming with an air-framer to develop a new class of highly efficient load bearing thermal protection materials (TPM) which will serve as the vehicle structure while at the same time withstanding the extreme environments encountered by reusable launch and space vehicles.  This enabling technology will be used as lightweight, high performance primary structure components composing large acreage areas of the vehicle.  Triton?s proposed SBIR program will demonstrate an integrated composite approach, utilizing hybrid metal-ceramic matrix composite (MCMC).  The MCMC will be the basis of unitized structural component designs where the ceramic surface resists aerothermal loads while sharing and transferring thermo-mechanical loads with the integrated high specific strength metal composite.  Triton?s structurally efficient hybrid TPS will significantly reduce reusable vehicle cost and weight by eliminating design, acquisition, and assembly of the two separate systems, structural air frame and thermal protection, required by current parasitic TPM.  Furthermore, not only can the MCMC be welded, but it can be fabricated with complex features such as hat-bands, bushings, and threaded attachment points so existing joining technologies will be used to assemble the hybrid composite hot structural members.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Our team member has identified a number of potential vehicle components subjected to environments in which a MCMC hybrid hot structure is expected to perform well and its use would result in significant weight and cost savings in reusable launch and space vehicles such as, 2nd Generation RLV or the AF SOV, and the next generation of hypersonic vehicles.  In the broadest sense, the hybrid composite will serve as a means of bonding together ceramic components, opening a plethora of product applications in the chemical processing and energy production industries.

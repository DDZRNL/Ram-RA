<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In the NASA funded Phase I effort, Los Gatos Research (LGR) demonstrated a new sensitive and robust optical means for rapidly making mid-infrared absorption measurements of trace species concentrations in the atmosphere.  LGR has developed and demonstrated an innovative new optical technique that increases the sensitivity of such determinations by orders of magnitude while keeping the engineering complexity to a minimum.  LGR has designed and tested, on NASA funded flight tests with our collaborators at Harvard University, this new instrumentation.  The successful test results are presented in this proposal, along with a detailed plan to further develop this technology for the analysis of an atmospheric species selected in the Phase I program by NASA.  This Phase II proposal presents a plan for the development and testing of a prototype instrument that will be tested and used in Phase II, and delivered to NASA in the final quarter of the program for flight outfitting and tests.  LGR will continue to work with NASA scientists to integrate this new instrument into available flight platforms.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
LGR is currently working with Harvard University in a program funded by NASA that is benefiting from the innovative new technology under development in this proposed program.  The first flight-tests for NASA have already been made during the Phase I program discussed in this proposal.  In addition to these clear NASA Phase III contributions, LGR is working with Dow Chemical, Chevron Corp., and a commercial medical partner to develop this innovative new technology for use in process control applications and in a new medical diagnostic for more than a half dozen medical conditions.  LGR has filed patents for the commercial application of this new technology developed under this NASA support.  The commercial (non-medical) markets are in excess of $10 million per year in projected sales, and the medical market is projected to be four times larger.  LGR is working to close a Phase II/Phase III funding agreement with a medical partner to develop the first clinical prototype in the coming 18 months.

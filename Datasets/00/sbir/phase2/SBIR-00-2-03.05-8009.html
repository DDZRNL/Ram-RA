<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This NASA Phase II SBIR program will develop a lightweight titanium foam material to replace aluminum isogrid structures on future launch vehicles.  Phase I results demonstrated that these titanium foams have the proper strength and thermal conductivity to reduce the weight of aluminum tank structures by 20-40%, while having nearly 100X lower thermal conductivity and higher operating capabilities.  The Phase II program is designed to develop manufacturing procedures for large (meter-sized) titanium foam structures, and to generate detailed property design date for use in vehicle design studies.  through a teaming arrangement with Boeing, design trade studies will be carried out on tank and thermal protection structures to determine potential weight savings from both material substitution and reduction of insulation/TPS.  The program is designed to reduce technology risk for these novel lightweight thermally insulating structural materials resulting in the availability of a high strength, closed cell titanium foam material and panel structure suitable for fabricating propellant tank structures.  The titanium foams produced have crush strengths ranging from 35-300 MPa at densitied of 1.4-2.6g/cc, while having thermal conductivities of <2 W/m-C, compared to 19 w/m-C for titanium and 233 W/m-C for aluminum materials.  these closed cell foams are also expected to provide a more robust, relIable solution compared to honeycomb structures, and offer much greater design flexibility than either composite or honeycomb alternatives.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The titanium foams to be developed in this program have commercial applications in sporting goods, commercial transports, industrial processing equipment, marine structures and submersibles, and commercial spacecraft and launch vehicles.  The titanium foams to be developed in this program have a unique blend of strength and density not available in any other material form.  Fuirthermore, the scaleable manufacturing processes to be developed in the Phase II effort can be readily adapted to the production of other metal foams, inlcuding aluminum, steel, and magnesium for a wide range of lightweight high stiffness applications.

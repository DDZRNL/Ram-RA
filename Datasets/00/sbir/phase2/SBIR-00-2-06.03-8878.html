<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Physical sensors for acquiring transient point measurements of temperature, pressure, skin friction and acceleration in extreme temperature gas turbine environments are currently unavailable.  Current state-of-the-art sensors require researchers and turbine manufacturers to sacrifice frequency response for increased accuracy, forcing them to make assumptions about the transient nature of the environment being monitored.  Clearly, there is a need for a suite of sensors capable of acquiring transient measurements in high-temperature, gas turbine environments at discrete points.   Luna Innovations proposes to develop a fiber optic temperature, pressure and accelerometer suite capable of acquiring transient point measurements in high temperature, propulsive environments.  The operating principle of the probe will be based on proven Extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometric (EFPI) techniques.  Luna will use its extensive experience developing and commercializing fiber optic sensors technology, including the previous development of lower temperature versions of such sensors, to design, develop, and construct the proposed advanced sensor transducers for combustion environments. The data obtained by these sensors will be invaluable for validation and development of CFD codes for combusting flows.  This instrumentation is crucial to the development and operation of affordable and efficient 21st century gas turbine engines.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Research in the high temperature instrumentation area will provide transducers with commercial uses that will include 1) aerospace turbines, 2) high temperature monitoring in gas turbine power generation facilities, 3) high temperature industrial process monitoring, and 4) automotive sensing for engine health monitoring and control.  The aerospace and power gas turbine markets are each multi-billion dollar industries.  Luna Innovations reasonably expects to capture at least a fraction of this market with the proposed extreme temperature sensors, resulting in a conservative estimate of annual revenues at $10 million.  As target operating temperatures increase, the market size decreases, as does the number of competitors.  Our target market is the extreme temperature conditions found in gas turbines for the aerospace and power generation industries.  In these applications, SiC and sapphire-based sensors produced by Luna will dominate the high temperature sensor market.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This innovation relates to the development of a stitched composite hollow core fan blade that would be used in the first stage of a turbofan jet engine. It is a novel design concept that incorporates the recent advancements made in stitched composites under NASA Contract NAS1-20546 (Technology Verification of Composite Primary Wing Structures for Commercial Transport Aircraft) and further advances the state-of-the-art by employing a unique fabrication method that results in a hollow-core part that is lightweight, damage tolerant, and inexpensive to manufacture. The significant improvement in structural efficiency is made possible by: 1) the superior damage tolerance of stitched composites, and 2) the ability to produce a hollow-core geometry. The combination of these two features enables the design of a revolutionary blade structure that is capable of meeting the most stringent bird-strike-loading requirements. 
<br>
<br>The primary goal of the Phase I research was to demonstrate the manufacturing feasibility this novel approach. This was accomplished by validating the operational characteristics of a thin-gauge bladder system, and then ultimately, by fabricating a prototype component to demonstrate the critical structural design features of the hollow-core body. The Phase II work would focus on fabricating a full-scale complex-curvature fan blade component.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Commercial and military jet engines where weight and fabrication cost savings are critical. Since the potential for large fabrication cost savings exists, the market for this application is broader than just performance-driven aircraft; it also includes smaller, more price-sensitive, jet aircraft.

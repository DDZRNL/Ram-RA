<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In response to NASA?s need to, ?enhance human and machine interface in support of scientific, commercial, and educational applications of remote sensing data,? Physical Optics Corporation (POC) has preliminarily developed and demonstrated an advanced new technique of 3-D visualization.  In Phase II we will complete the development of a novel Dynamic Time Multiplexed Holographic (DTMH) system.  The DTMH technology is based on new 3-D screens with dynamic time multiplexing and unique playback geometry, uniquely integrated with new multi-channel illuminators.  POC?s proprietary holographic screen recording geometry is optimized for off-axis image projection, so that the display can be in any geometry from vertical to horizontal.  DTMH offers full look-around, with visual channels spatially distributed around the viewer, and high image quality (up to 1600 x 1200 pixels for each visual channel).  POC had earlier developed display technology for either horizontal or vertical screen geometry, and is now developing a flexible dynamic screen geometry with the preferred position near 45 degrees to visualize objects below the line of sight as well as between screen and viewer.  As a result, high quality 3-D objects float over the screen surface or in front of the viewer (between screen and viewer in vertical geometry).

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
This technology has many potential applications in visualization, virtual reality, medical, and related fields.  In addition to advanced 3-D visualization tools, it will bring new capabilities to computer training and simulation, entertainment (video games), air traffic control, environmental monitoring, and automatic satellite orbit control.  High resolution in both cross section and volume will make this an excellent tool not only for scientific data visualization but also for real-time visualization of medical procedures such as tumor irradiation, telemedicine, avionics, training, and simulation.  The proposed system can be used in 3-D modeling, simulation, and structural optimization, and can be used on a nationwide scale to significantly improve medical diagnostics.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 The overall project goal is to develop high-performance carbon nanotube (CNT)-based materials for an important range of aerospace and commercial applications.  This work directly supports NASA?s nanotechnology initiative to develop multifunctional, ultra-high-performance CNT-based materials/devices that push the state of the art in aerospace and commercial systems.  CNT?s have demonstrated unsurpassed physical properties and promise to play a key role in NASA?s future, as evidenced by the agency?s $24MM nanotechnology investment in 2001 (with $46MM requested for 2002).  Development of methods for cost-effective, large-scale CNT production, purification, and processing are the next key R&D issues.   
<br>ReyTech?s Phase I results clearly set the stage for a Phase II SBIR project focused on those issues.  The key ReyTech innovation is the development of economically feasible and scalable methods of producing a variety of CNT?s with specific physical and chemical properties?an achievement based on novel methods for chemically functionalizing CNT surfaces.  The Phase II project is focused on the optimization and demonstration tasks needed to ultimately produce covalent interfacial bonds between the CNT?s and a variety of materials, resulting in composites with improved and tailorable mechanical, thermal, and electronic properties.  Phase II success will lead directly to Phase III commercialization with private-sector investors/collaborators.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
CNT-based technology exemplifies a revolutionary advance in strategic materials?and is currently akin to the early stages of polymer development and semiconductor-based electronics.  Ultimately, the nanotechnology industry will demand large quantities of CNT?s having a broad rage of physical and chemical properties?similar to the present-day polymer industry.  Envisioned applications include structural, electronic, thermal, magnetic, optical, chemical and biological uses.  Nanotechnology appears to be emerging as the next major industrial force, and CNT?s are expected to be a key component?with potential applications for NASA that are critical.  A significant market already exists for the specialty functionalized CNT?s being pursued here.  Additional products based on composites of epoxies, polymers, and materials for chemical separations are also envisioned?and will lead to a multi-billion-dollar market.

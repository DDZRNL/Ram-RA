<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The throughput on missions such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory has been increased significantly through the use of metalized polyimide filters.  Future missions such as Constellation-X require higher transmittance across a large range of energies.  Phase I proposed to determine the feasibility of improving the overall transmittance and strength of thin foil filters through the use of innovative new film supports made from Kevlar or similarly strong advanced fibers.  At low x-ray energies, the reinforcing fiber structure will have higher transmittance than the often-required metal mesh that it will replace.  At energies above about 3 keV, the reinforcement will become nearly invisible, and improvements in mission throughput will be even more significant.  Feasibility was clearly demonstrated during Phase I in that thin polyimide films, (1400? thick), reinforced with orthogonal, 72 line-per-inch, 12 ?m Kevlar fiber support, were shown by test to be more than 200% stronger relative to standard nickel mesh supported films.  This same Kevlar mesh, metalized for opacity, was shown to increase transmittance by 12 to 15% over nickel mesh of similar pitch.  Thus, when developed, this innovation will provide substantially greater scientific throughput for future NASA missions.

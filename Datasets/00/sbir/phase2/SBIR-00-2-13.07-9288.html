<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
To meet the challenges of spectral remote sensing from NASA manned and unmanned airborne platforms and next-generation space platforms, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes a miniature Stacked Waveguide Imaging Spectrometer (SWIS), a hyperspectral imaging system.  The monolithic design of the SWIS keeps it small, lightweight, and low-cost, with high throughput and inherent environmental stability.  Because of their compactness, many SWIS modules can easily be combined, expanding spectral sensing capability to cover the UV, visible, and IR bands.  In Phase I, POC conducted a preliminary SWIS system design and analysis, and demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed concept by developing the components and integrating a laboratory proof-of-concept SWIS module.  This Phase II effort will optimize the system design, improving the spatial and spectral resolution, out-of-band rejection, and throughput of the system, leading to SWIS prototype development.  The prototype system will be tested for its high resolution hyperspectral imaging performance over a wide band, as well as environmental stability and suitability for airborne/spaceborne applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The direct applications of this technology will be in multispectral and hyperspectral imaging systems for remote sensing, including Earth observation, environmental monitoring, coastal research, pollution control, and agricultural surveillance.  The system will also find a wide range of applications in medical devices, manufacturing, scientific research, biological and chemical spectroscopic imaging, optical communications, and a broad range of portable low-cost instrumentation.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Space shuttles, the international space station, spacecraft for planetary missions, and satellites require monitoring of their structural health to assure safe and successful operation.  The need for a space-deployable structural stress sensor is a common goal across NASA enterprises.  In Phase I, Intelligent Optical Systems, Inc. (IOS) proved the feasibility of developing a detection system for temperature-compensated strain measurements with multiple sensor (fiber Bragg grating (FBG)) arrays. Although IOS employed FBGs to measure pressure changes of a few psi in a stainless steel pipe in Phase I, the ultimate application of FBGs is for structural stress monitoring. 
<br>In Phase II, IOS will engineer an FBG sensor prototype.  It will provide readout capability for measuring structural stresses at 8 locations, in less than 0.5 sec, while compensating for temperature over a ?80? to +125?C temperature range. The FBG sensors are insensitive to electromagnetic interference, and can measure structural loads and stresses at multiple locations simultaneously. The system will be designed to interface with the main spacecraft for delivering vital information about structural integrity.  The Phase II prototype will be delivered to NASA for evaluation.  IOS has secured Phase II cofunding and Phase III follow-on funding to support commercialization of this technology.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Potential markets include monitoring stresses in composite structures, large buildings, bridges, and aerospace vehicles.  The FBG-based system will have spin-off applications in the automotive market, and in industrial monitoring.  Fiber strain sensors can be used for: (i) The assessment of material flaws, such as voids, inclusions, cracks, fiber misalignment, and delaminations; (ii) Structural health monitoring and smart materials applications, which include assuring the health of reusable launch vehicles, and the development of smart aerodynamic components; (iii) Nondestructive evaluation science research, which utilizes methodologies for relating NDE measurements to engineering properties (e.g., bond strengths, fatigue state, etc.); and (iv) Commercial monitoring applications including embedment in new bridges and other civil structures, and the retrofitting of older structures.  In all these applications, IOS's system will reduce operating costs and reduce the probability of catastrophic structural failures.

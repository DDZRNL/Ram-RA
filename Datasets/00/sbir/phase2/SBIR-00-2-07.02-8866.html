<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This project will result in a low-cost, lightweight, attitude-command-attitude-hold (ACAH) stabilization system for civil helicopters.  The results of the Phase I SBIR, as well as the results of past and ongoing U.S. Army and NASA research, will be used as a starting point to develop an ACAH stability augmentation system (SAS) that can be used to enhance the dynamics of civil helicopters in a way that is economically viable to the user.  The proposed ACAH SAS will provide a low-cost solution to achieve improved helicopter dynamics, and hence enhanced safety, in two critical flight regimes, the degraded visual environment (DVE) for low speed and hover, and for IFR operations in forward flight.  The primary advantage of the SAS is that it will allow the pilot to remove his hands from the controls, and to accomplish divided attention tasks.  The initial development of the ACAH-SAS will be accomplished using a hardware-in-the-loop piloted simulation.  The system will be designed around low-cost, lightweight servo-motors/actuators that have been developed for other applications.  A main and monitor processor will be employed to detect failures.  Once the control laws and hardware have been selected, flight-testing will be accomplished using a Robinson R44 test aircraft.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
An informal survey of manufacturers and users, as well as editorial comments in trade journals (e.g., Rotor and Wing) indicate that there is a substantial need for a low  cost SAS for helicopters that would provide handling qualities that result in reasonable assurance of IFR certification, as well as increased safety for divided attention tasks. Current solutions are too expensive and/or too heavy, as evidenced by the fact that only 4% of US registered helicopters are IFR capable.  The ACAH stability augmentation system would be marketed to manufacturers for installation in new helicopters, and as an aftermarket installation.  The target market would consist primarily of helicopters that exist at the lower end of the cost spectrum (starting at a new cost of $300,000). This would include mostly piston  helicopters such as the Robinson R-44, the Enstrom 280FX, and Schweizer 300C. It is estimated that there is also a potential market for low-end turbine helicopters.  Essentially none of these helicopters are currently certified for IFR.

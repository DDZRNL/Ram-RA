<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The low mass, stowage volumes, and cost of inflatably deployed rigidizable space structures have generated much interest as an enabling technology.  Missions that were too heavy, complex, or expensive, may now be feasible using inflatable deployable rigidizable technology.  A large portion of these structures fall into the planar class consisting of a flat tensioned membrane forming an antenna or reflector supported by a frame-like structure.   This Phase I study increased our understanding of the structural issues dominating this class of structure, and further developed the conical deployment and sub Tg rigidization technologies needed to complete the technology.  A continuation of this effort under a Phase II program will bring the technology close to a flight prototype through the development, fabrication, and test of a ground test unit.
<br>
<br>The technical objectives of the proposed phase II study are to refine and validate the inflatable rigidizable support structure concept through development, deployment, and rigidization tests of component and scaled system test articles.  Ground tests will culminate in system deployment and rigidization tests in a thermal vacuum chamber simulating the space environment.  A successful outcome to this proposed effort will offer much credibility to the concept and pave the way to a flight experiment.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
The most immediate use for the inflatable rigidizable planar antenna support structure concept, coupled to the Waveguide array currently in development under other programs, is for Earth mapping soil moisture measurements. Quantitative observations of surface moisture content are needed because soil moisture impacts a range of biogeochemical and hydrological processes and have implications to agriculture, forestry, transportation, and weather prediction. Regional process measurements are also needed to validate climate model predictions of changes in the distribution of surface moisture induced by global warming. This space borne capability could be attained efficiently though the use of inflatable rigidization technology and the Waveguide array concept to achieve a high spatial resolution of (<10 km) to enhance remote sensing capability for soil moisture measurements as well as for applications such as sea surface temperature, salinity, and measurements of the polar ice caps.  
<br>
<br>Other commercial applications of the concept are also immense.  The lightweight and simplicity of the concept, coupled with the geometric precision of the planar array, will find many applications in the fields of space based radar, communications, and with continued development, even optics, and terrestrial structural systems.

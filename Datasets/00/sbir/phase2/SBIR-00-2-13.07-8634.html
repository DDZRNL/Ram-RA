<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
During Phase II we will develop a miniaturized acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) based spectro-polarimetric radiometer that operates over the wavelength range from 0.36 to 2.6 um. A radiometer is one of the most fundamental optical sensors for a number of scientific applications. Several studies have been reported concerning the accuracy of the numerical methods used to determine the downwelling solar irradiance, and it is believed that much of the uncertainty regarding the source of the cloud absorption can be attributed to a lack of spectrally resolved measurements. As such, there is a considerable need for improved spectral resolution and performance in the sensors that measure radiative flux. Furthermore, for applications involving atmospheric remote sensing, the polarization of the light (i.e., the measurement of both the orthogonal polarization components at the same time) provides very useful information. Thus, the radiometer that we will develop in Phase II will be capable of (1) hyperspectral resolution, (2) wavelength tunability and (3) spectro-polarimetry. Also, our device will be compact and light weight, able to collect radiation through either fiber optics or free space, capable of low temperature operation, capable of operating in conditions where radiation hardening is required, and able to withstand high g forces.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Potential applications for a NIR spectro-polarimetric radiometer are numerous. The proposed device is well suited for applications involving the study of solar radiometry and related issues such as the remote sensing of contrails, the radiative effect of aircraft exhaust, the discrepancy between the measured and modeled downwelling solar irradiance at the ground, and the remote sensing of aerosol measurements in the atmosphere, to name a few. This device can also be a valuable tool in a number of industrial areas including: Chemical- for the identification of materials, blending / batching verification and reaction monitoring; Pharmaceutical - for inspection of capsules and tablets, chemical verification and purity testing; Food & Dairy - for monitoring of moisture, fat and protein content;  Pulp & Paper - for monitoring of moisture, cellulose, and lignin prior to harvesting; and Mining - for the examination of mineralogy parameters, mineral mapping and soil sampling.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Innovation in key technology areas will provide the dramatic advances needed for small- to mid-sized space-based flywheel energy storage systems.  Our vision for this work is based on our understanding of high-speed machinery and our background in similarly sized flywheel systems.  Based on this experience, we have focused this SBIR program the main bearing system.  A reliable main bearing system is key to the success of any flywheel system.  The magnetic-bearing-based system we are developing is simple yet robust with high reliability.  Its unique combination of passive and actively controlled elements will become the standard against which future designs are judged.  Work in Phase I proved several key aspects of the system, specifically that passive radial bearings utilizing high-strength permanent magnets have stiffness and damping capabilities that are practical for flywheels.  Phase II will concentrate on developing the remaining elements of a complete suspension system, including a double acting electromagnetic thrust bearing, an auxiliary bearing system for launch ride-through, and an active shaft damper to provide additional dynamic stability to specific flywheel applications that may need it.  We believe that the technology we are developing will solve one of the most challenging aspects of flywheel energy storage systems for spacecraft.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
In addition to direct application to NASA, military and future commercial space platforms, the main bearing system we are developing has broad and important potential commercial application, both as an integrated energy storage system, and as separate entities that can be implemented in many types of high-speed rotating machinery. In general, flywheels have the potential for future terrestrial uses in applications that range from uninterruptible power supplies and power quality uses to vehicular transportation. Future military uses of flywheels include possible applications that range from electromagnetic weapons to aircraft launch and arrest. As individual technologies, the advanced magnetic bearing suspension system we are developing will have niche application in any rotating machine that requires high speeds, low losses, and lubrication-free operation.

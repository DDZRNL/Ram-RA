<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 The proposal is to develop a lightning mapping system (LMS) camera based on a solid state array of "smart-pixels" that can detect, locate and quantify lightning transient events in the focal plane pixels without reading out the array.  This concept is applicable to lightning mapping systems operating from synchronous orbit as well as low Earth orbit.  In Phase II the lightning detector smart-pixel focal plane will be designed, fabricated, and evaluated.  Phase II also includes designing, building and evaluating a prototype LMS for synchronous orbit applications.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
In addition to weather satellite monitoring of lightning such smart pixel arrays, with the ability to detect, locate and measure unpredictable events, have application in other scientific research such as cosmic ray shower detection and in military weapon systems.

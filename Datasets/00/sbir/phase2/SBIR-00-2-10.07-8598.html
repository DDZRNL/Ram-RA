<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The innovation proposed is an axially operated, high efficiency, low mass cryogenic valve. This innovation, using Venturi Off-Set Technology (VOSTtm), addresses four critical needs for effective storage, transfer and use of cryogens in aerospace. These are: thermal isolation, low pressure drop to accommodate high flows, reduced cavitation, minimal mass and space requirement due to low profile and potential electromechanical actuation. Existing cryogenic valves are characterized by: high pressure drop at high flows, large mass to envelope ratio, and high actuation torques. VOSTtm valves eliminate actuator contact with internal wetted parts, potentially improving thermal and fluid containment characteristics necessary for densified propellants while maintaining high flow. VOSTtm valves are suited for electromechanical actuation due to low torque requirements. These features combine to improve valve reliability necessary for use of cryogens in Earth, space, and extra-terrestrial environments. 
<br>Phase II will specify, prototype, test, evaluate and deliver a 1 inch cryogenic valve for system testing and integration.

<B>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
Commercial valve applications include cryogenic fluid users in aerospace, medical, food preservation, fuels, and and other industrial applications. US based market for cryogenic valves is growing and constitutes an annual US market in excess of $1 billion.  VOSTtm is focused on applications that demand high flow performance, minimal leak, and precise control.

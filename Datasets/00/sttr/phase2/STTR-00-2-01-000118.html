TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
In Phase I we developed, integrated, and demonstrated a real-time adaptive navigation system, and a companion real-time adaptive guidance system for UAVs. The underlying project goal is to provide an aircraft with the capability to autonomously reroute itself in real time through dynamic hazard environments and still achieve its mission objectives.  The adaptive naviagtion system uses an evolutionary algorithm to determine a set of waypoints which define an optimal discrete path between the current position and the final desired position.  The waypoint location search space is constrained such that calculation of the performance index is very fast.  The adaptive guidance module uses an adaptive critic to generate smooth, realizable paths between the waypoints.  The critic utilizes information gathered off-line about the closed loop system to adapt the natural frequencies of a system of second order smoothing filters.  The smoothing filters accept a series of step inputs (the waypoints) and output smooth paths between the waypoints.  During the proposed Phase II STTR program we will take development of the system to the next level including analyzing its stability characteristics.  The Phase II will culminate with an actual flight test demonstration/verification of the system on one of AACs research UAVs.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
As a result of the technology developed under this project, as well as the results of several other SBIR projects, we have received a three million-dollar investment from D.B. Captial.  Part of this money is being committed to support the Phase II project.  This project will result in two products.  The first product will be a nonlinear adaptive critic guidance and control computer.  The second product will be a software package that uses that tool for remote and autonomous operation of air vehicles.  These products are an important part of an operator station for a group of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). An obvious application is to Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAV).  By enabling a ground station to more easily operate an aircraft, the efforts of a remote pilot can be minimized and response time can be reduced.  These products are important to NASA because they can be applied to control of semi-autonomous agents of any sort, including spacecraft, rovers, and submersibles.

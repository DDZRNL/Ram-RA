TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
 Our Phase-I investigations were completely successful and gave new life to the concept of ablative laser propulsion (ALP).  New measurement techniques and equipment have been incorporated into the basic experimental apparatus constructed in Phase I, and this improvement will add considerably to our capabilities and to the fundamental understanding of laser-matter interactions.  Three materials (lead, aluminum, and carbon) showed the greatest promise for ALP in Phase I and we will concentrate on these in Phase II.  Our interest has previously been directed toward investigating the fundamental physics of ALP and we believe that the important concepts are now understood well enough to take the next step and actually produce a flight demonstration of a prototype ALP-powered craft.  Phase II will begin with further investigation of the selected materials and will conclude with the construction and flight of a laser-propelled craft of our own design.  The proposed work will demonstrate the viability of the ALP concept.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
Commercial applications of ALP fall into two broad categories: satellite launches and satellite altitude maintenance.  A laser-propelled craft could be used for temporary global positioning satellite applications; launching of specialized cellular telephone communications antennae for communications with remote areas and satellite-to-satellite communications; rapid delivery of tools and components for Space Shuttle or Space Station missions; remote visual inspection and diagnostics of satellites; maintenance of low orbits, using periodic boosts from the ground, for controlled-altitude data gathering in global hydrology applications and high-altitude weather monitoring; and cost-effective, efficient clearing of space debris.  Secure communications would be possible by storing the information in a small laser-launched payload that would communicate with the satellite when it is within a short range, obviating the use of signals transmitted from the ground and making interception of the signal impossible using ground-based antennae.  In addition to relevant NASA programs, this project has direct potential application to DoD BMD programs.  In particular, it is relevant to divert motors for miniature kill vehicles employed in mid-course systems such as Trajectory-Optimized High-Altitude Targeting (TOPHAT), a system authorized by Congress for funding of its Concept Development phase in FY02.

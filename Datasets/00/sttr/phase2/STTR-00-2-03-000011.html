TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
This program addresses an opportunity to develop unique electronically tunable filters for multi- and hyperspectral imaging with characteristics that surpass all other present tunable filter technologies.  The approach is based on holographically formed polymer dispersed liquid crystal material that were under development at Brown University for display and telecommunication applications.  The H-PDLC constitute a stack of polymer and liquid crystal layers whose index of refraction can be changes by the application of electrical potential, thus changing the optical properties of the stack.  
<br>
<br>The operating requirements for displays and telecommunications, under development for several years at a significant level of funding, are vastly different from the requirements for tunable filter based sensors.  The Phase-I STTR investigation, therefore, focused on identifying H-PDLC properties that need to be tailored to meet sensor requirements, and on developing technical approaches to implement such changes.  
<br>
<br>We have successfully completed this evaluation and developed plans for a series of modifications including special tailoring of material, assembly process changes and control steps, addition of other additives, etc., all of which will lead to a filter with the correct properties for the sensor applications.  Under Phase-II, H-PDLCs optimized for multi- and hyperspectral sensor applications will be assembled and incorporated into sensor prototypes for laboratory and field testing.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
The H-PDLC promise is in a unique combination of very fast switching filter, high throughput and most important of all, low production cost.  These characteristics open the possibilities for several commercial and NASA applications.  OKSI is already working with a commercial partner that will invest in Phase-III provided the Phase-II reaches certain milestones.  The sensors that will be developed with this partner will be used for precision agriculture on farm equipment.  This partner has already invested in complementary research at OKSI sums that are greater than the Phase-I STTR value, and continues to invest in sensor development.
<br>
<br>The properties of these tunable filters also make them a perfect match for future NASA spaceborne Earth observing sensors.  In such applications, the high throughput and fast switching time match the sensor requirements for typical operating characteristics of sensors on board sun-synchronous, polar-orbit platforms.

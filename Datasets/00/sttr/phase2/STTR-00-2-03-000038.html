TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
The elemental composition of meteors is one of the keys to understanding their origin and in turn the evolution of the solar system.  Spectroscopic measurement of the emission spectra of meteors as they are heated by entry into the Earth's atmosphere can yield this information.  An objective-grating spectrograph instrument payload designed to capture the ultraviolet emission spectra of metoers is proposed.  This Shuttle and or Space Station payload will detect and record randomly occurring transient upper atmosphere phenomena such as meteors and upper atmospheric lightning.  In this Phase II effort Princeton Scientific Instruments will complete the design and fabrication of the high frame rate CCD camera portion of the payload.  Villanova University will complete their thermal analysis and design to include the proposed International Space Station payload "SUMS" (Slitless UV Meteor Spectrometer).  It should be noted that high speed, real time, image analysis is of broad interest with applications such as missile guidance and cell morphology  in biological image data reduction and image analysis.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
The direct application of the proposed  research and development is a Shuttle and International Space Station instrument to acquire the ultraviolet spectrum of meteors, Sprites, and other targets of opportunity when viewing the Earth's atmosphere, in the UV.  While these NASA-commercial applications are sufficient justification for this program, there are other commercial market reasons as well.  This research and development is applicable to the increasing use of imaging in industrial, scientfic, and military applications, and the collateral need for real-time image processing to make decisions in real time.  There is an increasing need to recognize, respond to and measure transient events and to do this at high speed, high resolution and good photometric fidelity.  The software algorithms for detecting and characterizing rapidly changing spectral images and differentiating between meteors and Sprites will be applicable to other problems.  One example is real time analysis of rocket engine exhaust plume images and spectra to make quick decisions as to whether to proceed with a missile launch.  The ultraviolet image sensor and optics are also of commercial interest.  There is increasing interest in  the hard UV for achieving smaller dimensions in photolithography to make higher density integrated circuits.

TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
 The Phase I of this effort has proven key concepts of our proposed comprehensive health management solution: namely remote and shadow diagnosis over low-bandwidth network and prognosis based on statistical techniques. Our telediagnosis solution has been demonstrated to Honeywell and NASA-JSC, and is being considered for remote monitoring of the Space Station. It is also the centerpiece of Honeywell?s NOVA program (www.wipnova.com). Encouraged by the strong response from NASA and the Aerospace industry, we would like to develop on the shadow reasoning framework and statistical prognosis techniques from our Phase I effort and make RDS the most capable and scalable Intelligent Vehicle Health Management solution, onboard or remote. In Phase II we will add a novel new feature in our reasoner to explain in intuitive terms the diagnosis inferred by the reasoner. Such a capability will speed the adoption of the reasoner by experts, and will have applications in training. We will also address challenging issues of test sequencing in the presence of uncertainties and diagnosis in the presence of variable delay in detection of the fault(s) by tests. The new algorithms will be incorporated into our telediagnosis product, the Remote Diagnosis Server (www.teamqsi.com/rds).

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
Potential applications include monitoring and diagnosis of commercial and military jets, space systems, manufacturing systems, building heating ventilation and cooling systems, embedded automotive diagnosis, etc. The remarkable aspect of the proposed technology is that the data acquisition module can be implemented as single-board or even single chip solutions that can be mass produced and embedded in any networked system, while a network based server can monitor and assess health of thousands of such systems. This makes real-time diagnosis universally accessible at a low cost to a wide variety of applications, including home and office automation, smart appliances, battlefield soldier and equipment health monitoring, and in-home health care of patients in need of round the clock monitoring.

TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
Flight in continuous atmospheric turbulence can cause the pilot to be subjected to severe buffeting, leading to cumulative fatigue that can impair mission performance and endanger the aircraft and aircrew.  Future military aircraft concepts have been proposed with planforms that are different from present configurations, resulting from the need for low radar cross-section.  The low wing loading and low-level, high-speed flight operational requirements of some new configurations can lead to extreme buffeting of the aircrew when flying for relatively long periods in turbulence.  In severe turbulence aircrew tolerance may be limited to only a few minutes of sustained performance before the pilot?s abilities become impaired.  There is therefore a need for a means of assessing the likely ride quality characteristics for the proposed aircraft configurations and how susceptible they may be to this problem.  It is proposed to apply analytical methods for quantifying cumulative aircrew fatigue by enhancement of existing analysis software.  Further, it is proposed to develop a ride quality meter that can be used in practice to provide real time or off-line information about the extent of fatigue exposure either directly to the aircrew or to aircraft operational personnel.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)<BR>
<B>
The objectives of the research are to provide enhancements to the NASA Dryden STARS analysis software package for commercial exploitation, and to develop a related product, a ride quality meter, to provide real time and/or off-line information about cumulative fatigue of aircrew and passengers during flight in continuous turbulence.  Together, these objectives provide both service and product routes to commercialization.
<br>The development of a gust and turbulence response capability in STARS will increase the application range at NASA Dryden for test and evaluation clearance work for future advanced aircraft projects.  It will be suitable for potential sales and services marketing to various research facilities and aircraft manufacturers where similar advanced flight testing is undertaken.
<br>The ride quality meter will be able to assess ride quality using a device that is independent of the aircraft systems.  It will be of interest where excessive cumulative fatigue of the pilot clearly can potentially lead to failure to achieve the mission objectives and in the extreme can endanger the aircraft, and also for other aircrew and passenger comfort assessments.  An existing vibration meter is to be used as the basis for the development, which will be carried out in collaboration with the original manufacturer.

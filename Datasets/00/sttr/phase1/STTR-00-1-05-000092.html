<p><font size="2">The Stennis Space Center has identified a need to perform continuous 
  facility and test article Health monitoring. Florida Laser Systems proposes 
  the development of an innovative non-intrusive cryogenic mass flow rate sensor. 
  The sensor system is based on the Extrinsic Fabry-Perot Interferometric (EFPI) 
  sensor technology being refined at the Florida Institute of Technology. These 
  fiberoptic based sensors are capable of determining several measurands including 
  strain, temperature, pressure, force, vibration and shock. Their advantages 
  include immunity to electromagnetic interference and cross talk, light weight, 
  compact size, large bandwidth, corrosion resistance, ability to operate in hazardous 
  and explosive environments, and remote real-time operation in cryogenic environments. 
  This technology will be combined with an innovative mechanical design that will 
  allow the non-intrusive detection of temperature, pressure, fluid velocity and 
  mass flow rate. There are currently no products available for determining cryogenic 
  mass flow-rate non-intrusively with high dynamic response. During phase I of 
  this program proof of concept tests will be performed utilizing this technique.

<p><font size="2">This fiber optic sensor has substantial application to the commercial 
  aviation industry. The sensors small size and low cost make it suitable for 
  implantation into aircraft engines and attachment to aircraft skin and structural 
  members. When integrated into the data stream of flight data recorders, the 
  information derived would be beneficial in monitoring the life cycle performance 
  of aircraft structures. In this way any flight activity resulting in increased 
  stress on the aircraft could be detected and used to flag maintenance crews 
  to perform visual inspections. In addition, changes in the vibration spectrum 
  coupled with increased displacement in the sensor could provide warning of imminent 
  failures in the aircraft components in time for replacement. </font></p>

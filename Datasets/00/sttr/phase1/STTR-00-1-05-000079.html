<p><font size="2">6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> The objective of the proposed STTR program is to develop and 
  demonstrate robust, high temperature optical low-pass filters that may be formed 
  directly on the windows of spectroscopic instrumentation used for rocket engine 
  analysis. This work would solve the existing problem of excessive thermal loading 
  of spectroscopic systems typically used to analyze rocket engine performance. 
  Very high temperature metallic oxide nanocluster thin films with heat-blocking 
  low- pass optical filtering functions and graded coefficients of thermal expansion 
  would be formed by molecular-level electrostatic self-assembly processes demonstrated 
  by Virginia Tech. This nanoscale self-assembly process inherently leads to the 
  formation of low-defect structures, and the precise ability to achieve graded 
  material properties in functional thin film coatings. During Phase I, NanoSonic 
  would work with Virginia Tech to design, synthesize and demonstrate the optical, 
  mechanical and thermal properties of these coatings on representative instrument 
  window material substrates. Thermal performance of the optical filter coatings 
  to temperatures as high as 1400 C are anticipated based on prior Virginia Tech 
  research. A technology demonstrator test article will be fabricated and evaluated 
  in cooperation with a major U.S. aerospace contractor. During Phase II, NanoSonic 
  will develop methods for upscaling and transitioning the fabrication process 
  to manufacturing. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The electrostatic self-assmbly process may be used to form a 
  variety of high performance thin film materials and devices integrated directly 
  onto structural and other functional components, including instrumentation filters. 
  Low-cost ESA processing will allow the manufacturing of competitive aerospace 
  optical, electronic, optoelectronic, sensor and actuator materials, devices 
  and integrated function structures. </font></p>

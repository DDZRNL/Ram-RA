<p> <font size="2">6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </font></p>
<p><font size="2">NASA is considering an electromagnetic catapult, the "MagLifter" 
  to lower the cost of cargo delivery to space and improve launch reliability. 
  A carrier sled, levitated and propelled by magnets, provides an inintial velocity 
  to a space transportation vehicle. For Large payloads, the required energy for 
  this launch assist is in the range of 20 gigajoule with peak-power requirements 
  of several gigawatt. Using power for this application directly from a utility 
  grid seems prohibitive, and intermediate storage of energy is necessary. Superconducting 
  magnetic energy storage (SMES), which charged from the local power grid and 
  discharged during launch sequence, offers a highly efficient and environmental 
  benign solution. The technology is well developed and SMES systems are considered 
  worldwide for stabilization of increasingly complex power distribution grids. 
  Cable-in-conduit conductor, developed at M.I.T. is enabling technology for such 
  a SMES system. It is the goal of the proposed project to determine an economical 
  SMES configuration for the MagLifter concept, which enables reliable spaceport 
  operation. A conceptual design of the major components of this energy storage 
  system will be performed. During Phase II the conceptual design of the major 
  components, the magnet system and the power converters would be worked out in 
  detail. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The proposed SMES system is enabling technology for commercially 
  competitive, electromagnetic space launch infrastructure. Such SMES systems 
  are also of great interest for utility applications in particular after the 
  deregulation of the U.S. power industry. </font></p>

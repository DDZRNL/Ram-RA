<p><font size="2">6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </font></p>
<p><font size="2">The innovation is a compact, UAV compatible, high-definition 
  hyperspectral imaging system. The system concurrently-acquires a hyperspectral 
  image using a compact grating imaging spectrometer and a much-higher spatial 
  resolution color photographic image using a portable, measurement-grade, high-definition 
  CCD camera (2,000 x 1,312 pixel). The spectral resolution of the hyperspectral 
  image is better than 5nm covering a spectral range from 400nm to 1700nm (expandable 
  to 2500nm) with a swath width better than 320 pixels. The quantization bit resolution 
  of the system is better than 10-bits. The system is for NASA's stated need of 
  spectral imager instrument for UAV with a weight less than 15 kg<br>
  and a volume no large than 0.1 cubic meters. It achieves state-of-the-art system 
  integration with built-in data acquisition, positioning/attitude measurement, 
  on-board flight plan, map-matched system automation, and seamless real-time 
  operation into a compact airborne computer. The software package developed has 
  an excellent point-and-click graphic user interface that supports spectral and 
  radiometric calibration, post data processing, and pointing-device-activated 
  pixel spectrum visualization over its registered high-definition photographic 
  image. With seamless<br>
  data fusion of high-resolution photographic imaging and pushbroom- scan hyperspectral 
  imaging at the measurement level, well-balanced spatial, spectral, and radiometric 
  information is obtained with optimized and manageable data volume.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> 7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </font></p>
<p><font size="2">The commercial product is a novel, versatile, and ultra-compact 
  airborne high- resolution hyperspectral imaging system, which can be fit onto 
  divers small aircraft, UAV, airship and balloon for low cost and operational 
  remote sensing. Its immediate applications include NASA calibration/validation 
  for the multitude of hyperspectral and multispectral satellites and new application 
  development. The potential commercial applications of this innovative instrument 
  product include operational remote sensing for precision agriculture, crop and 
  forest growing status monitoring, mineral exploration, geological prospecting, 
  coastal environment studies, surface pollution detection, hydro-carbon related 
  gas<br>
  leakage detection, and land-use surveys. </font></p>

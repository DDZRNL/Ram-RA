<p><font size="2">6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Spectral imaging has broad potential applications ranging from 
  remote sensing in areas such as agriculture or geology, to medical use. The 
  remote sensing sensors use complex opto-mechanical and expensive techniques 
  to operate in pushbroom and whiskbroom modes. Ground based stationary applications 
  require mechanical scanning to build up the image cube. An alternative for all 
  these devices is based on the use of an electronically tunable filter that is 
  mounted in front of the monochrome camera system. Such spectral imaging sensors 
  present great simplification and cost reduction for all applications including 
  air- or space- borne, and ground based stationary sensors. Such techniques are 
  already in use, but present day tunable filters suffer from very poor optical 
  throughput, are polarization sensitive, and very expensive to produce. This 
  proposal capitalizes on recent progress in new optical polymers research, to 
  develop a novel tunable filter that will have an order of magnitude improvement 
  in light transmission, a factor of 500 faster switching time. This polymer dispersed 
  liquid crystal has wide applications in displays, and therefore its production 
  costs will also be but a small fraction of the cost of present systems.</font></p>

<p><font size="2"> For the past several years OKSI has been the first company 
  to market customized turn key spectral imaging systems. Its market now extends 
  into several fields including surgical imaging, dental, precision agriculture, 
  geology, inspection and manufacturing, forensics, and more. </font></p>

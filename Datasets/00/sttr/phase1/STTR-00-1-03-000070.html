<p> <font size="2">6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> There is an increasing need for large, reliable, and cost-effective 
  inflatable space antennas for communications applications. This Phase I program 
  will focus on the design and development of open-celled foams as structural 
  elements in self-deploying antenna systems. Foams offer the following significant 
  advantages over conventional materials for these applications: open cellular 
  structure allowing compaction of large structures into small volumes; high dynamic 
  damping, strains due to mechanical movement of the structure (turning moments, 
  etc.) will damp out very rapidly and the spacecraft will return to its required 
  dimensions in a few seconds; restoring force, results in its self-deploying 
  property and its utility as an antenna construction material; and glass transition-based 
  rigidization. The goal of the Phase II follow-on program is the use of an open-celled 
  foam rigidization system in conjunction with specialized high accuracy membrane 
  materials to create a stable "eggshell" antenna in space. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> The proposed work will result in a new materials technology 
  for self-deployable spacecraft based on open-celled foam support structures. 
  Use of this new technology will provide a much needed advance in inflatable 
  and deployable technology by providing a controlled deployment and rigidization 
  method for a lightweight, compact, and long storage life structural material. 
  As such, it is expected that antennas and other structures based on this technology 
  will quickly transfer from government and military applications into the commercial 
  communications arena. </font></p>

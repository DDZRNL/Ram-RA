<p><font size="2">This proposed research is to present a general CFD subroutine 
  for predicting flow transitions in hypersonic regimes. The subroutine makes 
  use of an intermittency transport equation to describe the behavior of the flow 
  transition, and is therefore compatible with existing CFD codes. The proposed 
  model solves an additional transport equation for the intermittency distribution 
  and the resulting intermittency is then used to adjust the turbulent eddy viscosity 
  in the transition region. The major advantage of this approach is that it does 
  not require pre-calculation of the mean flow but includes the laminar, transitional, 
  and turbulent regions in a single computation. The current intermittency transport 
  equation has been validated for subsonic flows with different freestream turbulence 
  intensities and pressure gradients. The Phase I research will extend the capability 
  of the model to high Mach number flight conditions by including compressibility 
  and heat transfer effects.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">For the design of hypersonic vehicles, it is important to predict 
  flow transition reliably: Mach number effects cause a significant delay in flow 
  transition and also give rise to a wider transition region, as compared to the 
  transition behavior of incompressible flows. As a result, the capability of 
  the current CFD code in predicting flow transition plays a significant role 
  in hypersonic vehicle designs. The proposed intermittency model involves the 
  solution of a transport equation for intermittency, and the resulting intermittency 
  is used to modify the eddy viscosity such that the transition behavior can be 
  described adequately. The current method has been tested in incompressible flows 
  under a variety of flow conditions with impressive results. As compared with 
  the available stability methods for transition preditions, the proposed intermittency 
  method is a cost-effective method to predict transitional flows, for it can 
  easily be incorporated into commercial and research codes used in the design 
  of high transport aircraft and space launch vehicles. </font></p>

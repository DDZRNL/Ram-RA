<p> <font size="2">6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Availability of engineering analysis and design tools for accurate 
  prediction of vehicle flight performance characteristics is highly desirable. 
  Existing programs that use panel methods are inadequate for complex geometry 
  and for handling the full range of flight conditions. This proposal identifies 
  the development and integration of finite element multidisciplinary analysis 
  (FEMA) and design of flight vehicles. An existing Computational Fluid Dynamics 
  (CFD) code will be used to couple structural, aerodynamic and flight controls 
  interaction in an efficient and robust manner. In Phase I, we will establish 
  criteria for critical performance and operation bounds, basic principles and 
  concepts, spatial and temporal discretization and related methods of solution. 
  We will evaluate the performance of FEMA tools with other available solutions. 
  A pilot code that simulates CFD-structure-control integration to depict the 
  effectiveness of the presently developed algorithm will be developed. Several 
  algorithms for design optimization for integration into FEMA tools will be identified. 
  Flight control systems integration will be evaluated and proposed for implementation. 
  Improvements and integration of advanced flight control systems structures will 
  be evaluated. In particular we propose to investigate the feasibility of integrating 
  nonlinear control laws as well as specific control design methods into multiobjective 
  optimization software.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> 7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> The finite element multidisciplinary analysis (FEMA) computer 
  program will be available for immediate usage for dual-use commercialization. 
  Potential dual-use applications include the design of all types of military 
  and civilian aircrafts, automobile and engine components, various mechanical 
  subsystems, marine and civil engineering structures, and applications in other 
  disciplines. Both linear and nonlinear aeroelastic and aeroservoealstic simulations 
  for subsonic to hypersonic speeds will be possible by the program.We will make 
  every effort to render the software developed in both Phase I and II user friendly 
  and provide good documentation. Ease of use and robustness in capabilities of 
  the software will ensure the fullest use of the tools by the government and 
  commercial sectors. </font></p>

<p><font size="2"> We will develop and demonstrate smart system component designs 
  and algorithms enabling real-time autonomous control systems. Autonomous control 
  system components will improve facility safety and reduce maintenance costs 
  by enabling automated operation, system fault tolerance, on-condition maintenance 
  and fewer false alarms. Our innovation consists of novel algorithms for fault 
  detection and classification that enable real-time self-diagnostic surveillance 
  and autonomous fault accommodation by a smart system component. Our approach 
  combines smart sensor and actuator designs, previously developed for NASA Stennis 
  Space Center, with patented multivariate state estimation algorithms from Argonne 
  National Laboratory (ANL) that have been shown to provide high fidelity sensor 
  and component failure detection for nuclear power plants and rocket engines. 
  We will develop microcontroller-compatible versions of the ANL algorithms and 
  combine these with a new Bayesian belief network expert system algorithm to 
  automatically classify and respond to a detected fault of a smart sensor or 
  control component. Phase I will culminate in demonstration of prototype smart 
  components that perform automated self-diagnostic monitoring and fault management 
  for a hazardous gas detection and control system applicable to a wide range 
  of NASA ground test facilities, test articles and flight systems. </font></p>

<p><font size="2"> Autonomous control system components with embedded self-diagnostic 
  fault management will enable improved safety, reduced maintenance cost, and 
  optimal economics for many process control applications including aerospace 
  ground test and vehicle systems, power plants, manufacturing equipment, and 
  chemical processing plants. Requirements for autonomous fault management exist 
  in all types of process critical control and safety systems where unexpected 
  process interruptions due to sensor or control component failures or false alarms 
  are unsafe or uneconomical. Our competitive advantage comes from the ability 
  of each smart system component to automatically fuse information from numerous 
  other sensors and components and interpret this data for autonomous control 
  and self- diagnostic monitoring. We will initially develop a family of inter-operable 
  smart gas leak detection and control components built around a standard industrial 
  automation protocol. Our targeted market niche is safety, diagnostic and predictive 
  maintenance monitoring for aerospace, utility and chemical process industries. 
  Near term commercial applications include the next generation Reusable Launch 
  Vehicle and supporting ground infrastructure as well as a wide variety of industrial 
  process control systems. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Mercuric Iodide has several properties that make it an ideal 
  detector material for space-based astronomy applications. Due to its high atomic 
  number (Z=80,53) and high density (r= 6.3 g/cm3), a significantly higher quantum 
  efficiency for x-ray and gamma ray detection can be achieved with a relatively 
  small amount of material. The project objectives are to: - develop the technology 
  to readout signals from a large number of anode pixels on a mercuric iodide 
  detector. - demonstrate the ability to produce a large volume mercuric iodide 
  detector with excellent spectroscopic and spatial resolution. - construct a 
  mercuric iodide position sensitive spectrometer with greater thickness than 
  has yet been produced. Completion of these objectives will allow us to demonstrate 
  the performance of the mercuric iodide detector system for application to gamma 
  ray imaging and spectroscopy.</font></p>

<p><font size="2"> The proposed position sensitive mercuric iodide detector has 
  broad utility across many applications in gamma-ray detection. For example, 
  pixelated mercuric iodide detectors and systems would be a compelling candidate 
  for nuclear and particle physics laboratories. The proposed mercuric iodide 
  detector has direct application to health care through gamma detection and imaging 
  applications such as Nuclear Medicine gamma cameras and PET systems. Pixelated 
  mercuric iodide detectors have the potential to improve image quality and diagnostic 
  accuracy of these devices and reduce healthcare costs in areas such as the diagnosis 
  of cardiac disease and the detection and staging of cancer. Other potential 
  applications include systems designed for: radioactive materials monitoring, 
  baggage and cargo inspection using planar or tomographic imaging, nuclear weapons 
  treaty verification, and explosives and contraband detection using gamma backscatter 
  detectors. </font></p>

<p> <font size="2">6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </font></p>
<p><font size="2">A very promising approach to a significant reduction of the 
  mass of the gasdynamic mirror (GDM) fusion propulsion system is proposed. It<br>
  makes use of field-reversal techniques whereby a rotating magnetic field is 
  employed to induce an azimuthal current in the plasma, which in turn gives rise 
  to the desired magnetic field at an appropriate plasma radius in the mirror 
  region. This has the effect of preserving the needed larger plasma mirror ratio 
  without the use of large mirror magnets. This proposal is aimed at an investigation 
  of this approach and how it might apply to the GDM propulsion system. The results 
  generated will constitute the basis of a Phase II proposal aimed at applying 
  this technique to the GDM experiment at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC).</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> 7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> NASA's often stated objective with regard to future space transportation 
  system is that they be faster, cheaper, and better. The field reversed GDM presented 
  in this proposal truly meets these objectives. The very large specific impulse 
  and thrust expected to be generated by the<br>
  modified GDM would allow it to serve as a space transport for space tourism. 
  In addition to its space application, the GDM device can serve as<br>
  a neutron source for materials testing for terrestrial fusion power reactors 
  and as a source of radiation for potential applications to radioactive<br>
  waste disposal considerations. </font></p>

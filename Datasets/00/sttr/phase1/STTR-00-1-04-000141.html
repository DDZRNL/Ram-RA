<p><font size="2">6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> The proposed work is directed towards the understanding and 
  utilization of the relatively unexplored concept of ablative laser propulsion 
  (ALP). The work will include direct measurements of the specific impulse imparted 
  to solid targets under short-pulse laser irradiation. The purpose of the proposed 
  work is to demonstrate the viability of the ALP concept and to develop a set 
  of specific requirements for solid materials best suited for ALP, supported 
  by data on specific impulse as a function of material properties and irradiation 
  conditions. Pulse width, pulse repetition rate and laser wavelength are expected 
  to be important parameters. Anticipated results of the Phase-I work are an understanding 
  of factors defining <br>
  specific impulse due to material properties and irradiation conditions and selection 
  of candidate elements for the Phase-II research. In Phase II,<br>
  we anticipate discovering the factors, such as material composition and irradiation 
  conditions, determining specific impulse and other parameters (such as mass 
  removal rates, angular distributions of ion energy and number density, charge 
  states, etc.) critical for ALP. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Because our concept obviates the conventional rocket engine, 
  it will provide improvements in the cost and reliability of space propulsion. 
  It will lead to safe, affordable, high-performance propulsion for space vehicles 
  and thus promote commercialization of space. Some potential commercial applications 
  of this work include satellite station keeping, satellite attitude control, 
  satellite maneuvering (gross movements, orbit maintenance), and even 'nano- 
  satellite' development. Space station and other similar construction activities 
  as well as Space Shuttle missions will also benefit from this technology. Some 
  aspects of this research will be useful for cleaning up space debris at LEO 
  (NASA Project ORION). </font></p>

<p> <font size="2">6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> We propose to combine the proven Brahms multiagent work practice 
  simulator and the DSpace1 3D thin client VR system to produce Brahms VE, a visual 
  simulator used to improve human practices within a model of the work environment. 
  The prototyping of the ALSEP deployment on Apollo XVI within Brahms VE should 
  qualify this approach for a broader applications in simulation and training 
  for fully autonomous missions and manned spacecraft employing tele-operation 
  and extensive ground support.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> 7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> Brahms VE is anticipated to have a wide range of applications 
  including: collaborative business virtual environments in shared problem resolution 
  spaces, as learning spaces for educational and museum institutions, e-commerce 
  service areas with agent-assistance for customers and as a training vehicle 
  for industrial users. </font> </p>

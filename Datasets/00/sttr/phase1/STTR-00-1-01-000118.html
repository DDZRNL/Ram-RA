<p> <font size="2">6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> We will apply the latest knowledge in learning control, adaptive 
  control, and optimal control to develop a modular, state-of-the-art, adaptive, 
  nonlinear, guidance, navigation, and control package for remote spacecraft. 
  The system will incorporate planning and decision making modules to give the 
  remote spacecraft on-line goal directed self-reliant behavior with a high degree 
  of autonomy. At the highest level, an expert system based "Goal Executive" will 
  monitor the spacecraft's environment and switch and/or adapt the performance 
  indices of an adaptive critic based guidance system, and an evolutionary algorithm 
  based navigation system. This will, in effect, change the near-term behavior 
  of the remote spacecraft by changing what it considers "optimal". The navigation 
  system will specify optimal way-points for achieving the specified mission goals. 
  The guidance module will generate an optimal trajectory between the way-points 
  and the control module will ensure robust and accurate trajectory tracking. 
  The controller will be based on an improved version of an nth order multi-variate 
  Neural Adaptive Controller (NACTM) developed at AAC.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> 7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> In the near term, we anticipate a modular, portable, autonomous 
  Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GN&C) software package to be the primary 
  commercialization. There is a tremendous need for such a package in industries 
  that apply advanced control technologies, especially the aerospace industry. 
  Our software will fill a gap in the GN&C development software market. Currently, 
  there are no easy-to-use tools that are highly general and powerful. The most 
  powerful tools available require the user to select many parameters, usually 
  iteratively, until an adequate solution is reached. We will investigate licensing 
  the software to a software company. In this way, we can benefit from royalties 
  without having to build a general support infrastructure. At the same time, 
  we can continue to sell the product to specific customers and support them through 
  individual agreement. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </font></p>
<p><font size="2">The proposed R/R&D effort will obtain new improved, in situ 
  measurements of vegetation using a computer-based fluorescence imaging system 
  that images and processes the plant's cellular energy emissions to quantify 
  and diagnose the plant's photosynthetic pathways. With multi-spectral bandwidths 
  and image processing which increase the system's sensitivity, fluorescence-imaging 
  diagnoses early plant stresses, pre-symptom, days to weeks before the unseen 
  symptoms become visible. The R/R&D effort will test the pre-symptom detection 
  of difficult vascular and root pathogen stresses, nutrient deficiencies, water 
  and other environmental stresses in tomato, corn and soybean. The test program 
  will also serve to test the system's diagnosis of the imposed stresses. The 
  plant stress test program and data acquisition will develop and provide a base-line, 
  plant stress image database for input to NASA science databases. In addition, 
  the innovation is important as a ground-based imaging system that detects, quantifies 
  and diagnoses plant stress and physiological characteristics as ground-truth 
  data, meeting a NASA need for validating Remote Sensing systems. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </font></p>
<p><font size="2">The proposed R/R&D effort, assuming the goals are achieved, 
  will lead to the commercialization of a ground-based fluorescence imaging system 
  that will provide computer-based imaging, diagnostic and plant stress information 
  to commercial growers and to users for environmental inspection. The on-site, 
  real- time inspection of field crops using an innovative imaging and diagnostic 
  system will be advantageous to growers as a crop management information system. 
  A portable imaging and processing system with real-time data acquisition will 
  enable the crop producer to recognize and diagnose early plant stress and physiological 
  characteristics, undertake managed alternatives to reduce or minimize a yield 
  loss and improve his profitability. A ground-truth system will similarly enable 
  users to monitor vegetation for environmental and remediation applications. 
  The benefits available are to replace today's visual inspections with an innovative 
  imaging system that quantifies and diagnoses the plant's physiological characteristics 
  and is capable as a management information system. </font></p>

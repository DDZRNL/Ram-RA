<p><font size="2">6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> We propose a real-time diagnosis, prognosis, and mission planning 
  solution for complex systems. The proposed effort leverages QSI's real- time 
  model-based diagnosis engine, TEAMS-RT, and UConn's expertise in the areas of 
  signal processing, estimation and prognosis. The resultant solution will collect 
  sensor data, process it, and assess system readiness in real-time. In the event 
  of degradation or failure, the source will be isolated promptly, and its impact 
  on mission evaluated. If the failure is in a redundant subsystem, the reconfigured 
  system can continue with its mission, possibly in a degraded mode. Otherwise, 
  the remaining life or extent of the failure will be estimated, and mission priorities 
  and available capabilities matched to modify the mission or to select an alternative 
  mission. A unique feature of the proposed effort is that the failure detection, 
  isolation and reconfiguration modules can operate remotely over a low bandwidth 
  wireless link. This can be utilized by ground support to assess system health 
  and to shadow the onboard reasoner. More significantly, this tele-diagnosis 
  capability will enable real-time health monitoring and on- demand diagnosis 
  of legacy systems that lack onboard reasoners. The technology developed here 
  has many space and commercial applications, including patient health monitoring, 
  and aircraft and automotive diagnosis.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> 7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words)</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> The technology developed here can be applied to real-time health 
  monitoring of safety critical systems, such as commercial airliners, nuclear 
  power plants, and telecommunication networks. However, few consumer applications 
  can afford the expense of onboard diagnosis. Many incorporate sensors to monitor 
  performance, and can be equipped with a communication link at a relatively low 
  cost. The remarkable aspect of the technology proposed here is that it is accessible 
  over standard cellular networks. This makes real-time diagnosis universally 
  accessible! For example, the driver of a stalled car can use our Remote Diagnosis 
  Server (RDS) to get a prompt diagnosis, and AAA can dispatch roadside assistance 
  with the exact spare part required to fix the problem. Other applications include 
  remote health monitoring of home-care patients and battlefield soldiers, round 
  the clock monitoring of high rise buildings and their elevators, escalators, 
  heating and ventilation systems etc. Some day, all our appliances, from the 
  toaster oven to the dishwasher, refrigerators and washing machines, may be networked 
  and inter-operating utilizing technologies such as Jini. Such a connected world 
  would open doors to a huge market for RDS, with applications in monitoring and 
  diagnosis of millions of appliances. </font></p>

<p> <font size="2">6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words)</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> Aeroservoelastic (ASE) modeling and vehicle stability analysis 
  are two major concerns in the accurate prediction of flight characteristics 
  of<br>
  generic hypersonic vehicles (GHVs). We propose to develop an ASE modeling and 
  vehicle stability analysis toolkit. System Identification (SI)-based black box 
  models of CFD solvers is the primary focus in Phase I. Bifurcation and Chaos 
  Theory Methodology (BACTM) is the main tool<br>
  for nonlinear stability analysis. The proposed software consists of a library 
  of ASE model structures, SI routines, and BACTM modules. The software will enhance 
  the capabilities of STARS code currently in use at NASA Dryden. Phase I work 
  involves: (1) acquisition of GHV models, STARS training data and code, (2) development 
  of ASE modeling toolkit for GHV, (3) nonlinear analysis of ASE, (4) trajectory 
  optimization and GHV flight stability analysis, (5) integration of software 
  modules into STARS, and (6) final report and software delivery. Specific problems 
  addressed include nonlinear flutter analysis, effect of modeling uncertainties, 
  nonlinear flight dynamics in the presence of inertia coupling and unsteady effects. 
  Prof. Lutze of VPI and Prof. Klein of JIAFS/GWU will serve as subcontractors 
  in this project.</font></p>

<p><font size="2"> SI-based modeling software has applications in flight testing, 
  combustion processes, fluid mechanics, and process control. Nonlinear stability 
  analysis software has applications in aircraft, jet engines, civil engineering 
  structures, chemical instabilities, compressor stall, biology and communications.

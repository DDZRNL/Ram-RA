<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Tailored Dynamic Characteristics for Membrane and Inflatable Structures </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>The goal of the proposed work is the development of an unified framework of analytical and testing tools, proven energy dissipation mechanisms, and system level approaches that will enable membrane and inflatable (M/I) structures designers to confidently predict and achieve the desired structural dynamic characteristics. In Phase 1, the efforts required to establish the feasibility of previously undeveloped key portions of this overall framework are proposed. These efforts include: 1) the development of new membrane material energy dissipation property test methods, 2) demonstrating structural energy dissipation mechanisms for use on M/I structures as needed, and 3) developing the analytical methodology required to accurately predict the response of M/I structures to realistic disturbance loads. The motivation for this work comes from several areas. First, M/I structures, being optimized for minimal weight through the reduction of load bearing material structures, are highly stressed. Thus any additional dynamic stresses can lead to eventual fatigue failures. </P>
<P>Secondly, unknown structural dynamics can lead to control structure interaction and the possible loss of the spacecraft. Finally, structural dynamics with long settling times can cause degradation in mission performance. The proposed efforts will help remove such uncertainties and lead to improved/optimal M/I structure designs. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The proposed developments, tools, and approaches will be directly marketable to the designers of large inflatable and membrane spacecraft systems, as well as to the manufacturers of such systems. While this field is relatively new, there is a large positive potential for growth, especially once rugged, reliable systems are developed and missions are baselined on the unique capabilities that membrane and inflatable structures can provide. It is anticipated that the approaches developed will also prove useful in other area of spacecraft design such as flexible solar arrays, and multifunctional flex circuits. Spin-offs of the knowledge into areas such as thin film manufacturing and test processes, sail and parachute design, and the music and loud-speaker industry are also foreseeable. </P>

<P><B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>High surface area transition metal nitrides constitute an 
  attractive approach towards low-cost, high-performance electrochemical 
  capacitors as energy sources for a variety of applications. However, current 
  NASA uses and other commercial applications require higher performance figures 
  than those demonstrated by present technology. This is due in part to (i) low 
  surface area deriving from large particle formation and densification in 
  current fabrication processes; (ii) low conductivity due to the formation of 
  oxides during synthesis, which result in poor electrochemical and cycling 
  stability; and (iii), corrosion of commonly used current collectors. 
  <BR><BR>In Phase I, we propose to fabricate and characterize electrochemical 
  capacitors where selected nitride nanoparticles will make both the electrode 
  material and current collector, The oxide-free nanoparticles will have a high 
  surface area and conductivity, and will be used in a tight packaging 
  configuration using novel lightweight, flexible, corrosion resistant and 
  easily sealable current collectors in conjunction with an alkaline 
  electrolyte. Energy density of the proposed innovation is expected to be more 
  than double that of existing capacitors. High energy density and power density 
  prototypes will be built at the end of Phase II in collaboration with Evans 
  Capacitor Company and will be used for marketing during the Phase III program.

<P><B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Use of low cost, high performance capacitors based on high surface 
  area transition metal nitrides and alkaline electrolytes combined with low 
  resistance, flexible and non corroding current collectors can be envisioned in 
  automotive applications and backup power devices, and for providing large 
  pulses in portable consumer electronics such as computers, displays and 
  camcorders. High voltage devices such as hospital defibrillators and "smart" 
  missiles will benefit from such a development. <BR><BR><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

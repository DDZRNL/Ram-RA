<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 03.02-4646 (Chron: 992012 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Friction Drag Reduction System </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>Accurate Automation Corporation proposes to design a system for reducing the friction drag on an aircraft by introducing an ion space charge into the aircraft's boundary layer. We will develop a detailed model for the drag reduction mechanism; evaluate the system performance; evaluate alternative electromagnetic and/ or mechanical processes for generating a space charge in the boundary layer of an aircraft from a bipolar weakly ionized gas; and design a wind tunnel experiment to evaluate the technology. The wind tunnel experiment will be fabricated and tested, and a conceptual design for a flight test aircraft will be performed in Phase II. This is the solution to a successful Phase III flight test, evaluation and production program. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>Phase III customers of the proposed program will be DoD, NASA, BMDO, and aerospace prime contractors. Applications of developed WIG technology are numerous; from business jets to rockets to military jet fighters to Naval vessels. Commercialization of this technology will be heavily directed toward the civil aviation industry with applications to the growing and very competitive transonic business jet market. AAC will also leverage the technology to compete with the large aerospace companies on new defense applications. </P>

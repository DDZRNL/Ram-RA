<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 25.03-5390A (Chron: 991898 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Cost Effective Processing Equipment for Large Composite Parts </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>Reduced mass materials are critical to the success of aerospace systems. Thus, large air and space structures can benefit from lightweight composite materials. However, their adoption is impaired by the lack of a robust, cost-effective fabrication process, principally because the autoclaves used to consolidate composite laminates are so expensive for large parts. This program develops for US aerospace companies the processing equipment that avoids the autoclave. In particular, this program will develop in situ deposition heads that can fit on aerospace company's existing placement machines so that air and spacecraft composites can be fabricated out of the autoclave. </P>

<P>In phase I, the deposition head concept designs will be prepared and reviewed with leading aerospace industry contacts who we know from working with them on a multitude of non-autoclave processing programs in the past. There, we will get feedback for our head concept designs suitable for fabricating the thermoset and thermoplastic composite parts that they need. In phase II, we will complete the design, fabricate, and prove-out the head equipment. We then will provide in situ deposition heads to the industry that they can use for in situ consolidation of large composite parts. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>There is nothing that could be done that would lower the cost of composites more than to eliminate the autoclave. The major applications are large aerospace composites such as launch vehicles, launch vehicle tanks, satellites, wind and fuselage skins for commercial and military transport aircraft, fighter aircraft structure, helicopters, and submarine structure. Other commercial applications include high-speed trains, and electric-powered automobiles. </P>

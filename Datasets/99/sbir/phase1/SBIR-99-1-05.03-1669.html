<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 05.03-1669 (Chron: 991624 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Development of a Finite Element Viscous Aeroservoelastic Analysis Capability </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>This proposal is concerned with the development of a coupled aero-structural-controls analysis capability involving vissous unsteady flow. The flow solver will be based on the finite element method enabling effective coupling with its structural counterpart. In Phase I, an existing, viscous FE CFD code will be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel coupling precedure. Numerical results of existing solutions will be compared in detail. In Phase II an improved version of a Navier-Stokes solver will be developed which will be used for subsequent generation of a viscous aeroelastic analyses capability. Further extension of the capability will be achieved in yielding an aeroservoelastic analysismodule. </P>

<P>The company has extensive experience in the commercialization of large scale multidisciplinary software. It has invested substaintial resources to that effect in the past, involving advertizing and intensive marketing. Further the company plane to enter into an alliance with a NASA commercialization center for distribution of the code. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The Phase I and II efforts are expected to yield an unique analysis and design tool which could be conveniently used to solve a wide spectra of practical challenging problems encountered in aeronautical/aerospace, mechanical, marine and civil engineering, among others. We have comprehensive plans to commercialize the code in the shape of leasing and also extensive consultations. </P>

<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Friction Stir Welding of Dissimilar Materials </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a new process which can weld alloys traditionally considered "unweldable."  The FSW phenomena is not well understood and the existing tool designs are subject to overheating resulting in the tool melting or deforming limiting commercial applications to low melt temperature alloys. The objective of the Phase I research effort is to develop analytical models of the FSW process which predicts important parameters (e.g., temperature and strain distributions, residual stresses) in the tool, weld, and base materials as a function of the materials used and the tool geometry. These models can then be used in Phase II to develop improved designs of the FSW tool and overall process parameters for joining dissimilar materials such as aluminum-lithium and aluminum metal matrix composites and hard to weld materials such as refractory metals and titanium. </P>
<P>Phase I activities will include development of kinematic, linear finite element and nonlinear finite element models of FSW.</P>

<P>Validation of these models will be accomplished by comparison with existing experimental data. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>There will be two primary products of the multi-phase SBIR effort. The first end-item-commercial product will be the analytical software models of the FSW process which can be marketed to the various FSW fabricators as a tool for optimizing the process parameters to improve joint efficiency, quality, and cost-effectiveness. The </P>
<P>second product of the research effort will be a line of FSW Tools that can be used to join materials not currently weldable by existing systems. Applications for FSW tools include shipbuilding, aerospace, railway, automobile and construction industries. </P>

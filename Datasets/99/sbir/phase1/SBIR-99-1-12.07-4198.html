<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Mobile Earth Inc. (MEI)'s innovation is a secure, low-cost, GPS-aware Internet browser for mobile applications. Our product will differ from current browsers in that it adds a mode that will pass real-time GPS coordinates to internet map and image servers. This innovation provides a user-friendly, low-cost, and effective data viewing and real-time data browse and general rendering tool for scientific as well as commercial applications as requested in topic 12.07.</P>

<P>The MobileEarth browser is a simple solution that leverages the widely accepted internet protocol (IP), current and pending cellular and satellite communications technologies, currently available laptop computers, simple or differential Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and the increasingly sophisticated server-side search, visualization and analytical capabilities of internet map and image servers while retaining access to all other elements of the Internet. With the MobileEarth browser and a simple GPS receiver card, any laptop computer with cellular or satellite Internet access could become a real-time mobile mapping, browse, visualization and analysis tool for less than $200. This solution is also flexible in that it can be used with differential GPS (DGPS) receivers and a wide variety of portable digital data acquisition instruments. </P>

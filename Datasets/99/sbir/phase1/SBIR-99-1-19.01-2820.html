<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 19.01-2820 (Chron: 991882 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Precision Optical Tools for Station Keeping </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>Proposed are optical tools for precision station keeping and communication between multiple satellites or balloons flying in formation. Using optical elements such as energy efficient pulsed or CW laser sources, fast detectors and large field retroreflectors in an innovative fashion, a wide range of flying formats can be accommodated. Depending on such factors as separation distances, acquisition fields and control bandwidths, separation stabilities to sub-mm's for systems operating at microwave frequencies, to stabilities commensurate with spacebased interferometry at optical and infrared wavelengths can be realized. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The proposed technology, in essence precision metrology over a large scale can be expected to find wide use for metrology, surveying of large structures such as buildings, bridges, ships, and antennae. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Ammonium ion is a byproduct of the oxidation of nitrogen-containing substances 
occurring in the initial treatmentsteps of water recovery systems. Removal of 
ammonium ions from the effluent stream from 1000 ppm to less than 0.25 ppm is an 
imperative need as a part of the space life support infrastructure. Drawbacks 
associated with processes proposed in the past include the generation of a 
secondary waste, cost, size, and/or the use of consumables that need to be 
stored or supplied. The proposed technology is based on an innovative,
environmentally friendly electrochemical process for the effective removal of 
ammonium ions. It does not use consumables but oxygen gas from air, readily 
available. It will not generate a secondary waste. By controlling operational 
conditions, the ammonium ions will be transformed to nitrogen gas, which can be 
removed from the liquid phase in microgravity conditions by the use of a gas 
separation module. In addition, it is an energy efficient process, operates at 
room temperature, and is microgravity compatible. The purpose of Phase I is to 
demonstrate the feasibility of the electrochemical oxidation of the ammonium 
ions to nitrogen gas and to test its efficiency using a bioreactor effluent 
simulant.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   The proposed method of removal of ammonium ion from the bioreactor process effluent streams has immediate terrestrial benefits as a method for removal of ammonia from aqueous solutions. This new method for removal of ammonium ion from waste process has a high potential for public acceptance in industry facing stringent laws regulating ammonia discharge. High level of ammonia content in the water is toxic to marine fish and ammonia has an odor and adverse effects on human health when inhaled.

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Due to the intensive research effort, supported by several billion dollars investment by the Government in the past two decades, high sensitivity HgCdTe infrared arrays operating at 77K can now be tailored in a wide range of wavelength from 1to14 mm. However, the cooling requirements make them quite bulky and unsuitable for many applications. Due to the advancements in the materials and device technologies, it is now possible to fabricate HgCdTe based infrared arrays operating close to room temperature with sensitivity better than GaAs based image intensifiers and noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) comparable to or better than bolometric and pyroelectric imaging arrays. We propose here a new generation of lightweight, compact, high efficiency infrared focal plane arrays, which operate near room temperature with performance matching the BLIP performance achieved at 77K. The consequence of this technology is the possibility of very large array formats with minimal power dissipation and payload, and improved image resolution. This, we believe, will be an asset for the NASA's proposed manned Mars mission and related space programs. This goal will be achieved by i) using the established flexible manufacturing molecular beam epitaxy technology for device quality HgCdTe material growth on large area silicon substrates and ii) incorporating novel device architectures including minority carrier exclusion and extraction to achieve nonequilibrium mode of operation. This will enhance the minority carrier lifetime and consequently increase the operating temperature. The HgCdTe being intrinsic class of photon detectors will have high quantum efficiency, and high speed of operation due to the low effective mass of electrons. This will make it possible to produce rugged, low-cost, large area 'hot' focal plane arrays. </P>

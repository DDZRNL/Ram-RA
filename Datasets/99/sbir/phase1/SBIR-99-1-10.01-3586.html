<P><B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>This proposal addresses the design and development of dynamically 
  controlled protein crystal growth payloads for Space Station application. The 
  Space Station will afford the protein crystal growth community the 
  unprecedented opportunity to grow crystals in a microgravity environment for 
  extended periods of time and then retrieve them. This will add a new dimension 
  to determining the structures of hard to crystallize proteins such as 
  membrane-bound proteins. To take full advantage of this opportunity, the 
  BioSpace International Dynamically Controlled Crystallization System will be 
  used as the basis of a system that will conduct a series of crystallizations 
  and screens over extended periods of time. During this time the system will be 
  monitored and controlled by the researchers via a laptop and the internet. 
  Each of these systems will be completely compatible with all the 
  Refrigerator/Incubator systems currently planned for the Space Station. 
  <BR><BR>The Phase I effort will include the analysis of protein crystals grown 
  in space and on the ground using the concept proposed for the Space Station. 
  In addition to the diffractometry analysis that will be performed at the 
  National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory, there 
  will be X-ray topographic analysis performed to determine the influence of 
  microgravity and to analyze growth induced defects. <BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Once fully developed and demonstrated, this system and its 
  techniques will be a vital tool in growing crystals that can yield high 
  resolution structural data for structure-based drug design and for government, 
  industry and university macromolecular researchers. To those performing 
  protein crystal growth on the Space Station, it will enable the crystal 
  growing process for the species being studied to be optimized on the ground 
  before using these costly and limited resources. <BR><BR><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

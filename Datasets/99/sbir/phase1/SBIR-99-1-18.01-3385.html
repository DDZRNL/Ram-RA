<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Graphical Application Language Experiment Implementation System </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>The Graphical Application Language Experiment Implementation(GALEXI) System development environment will proivde a method of direct flight software generation from a graphical language paradigm. Uers familiar with the National Instruments LabVIEW tools will be able to develop contgrol systgems for their instruments in the laboratory which will result in automatic generation ov flight worthy source code, ready for delivery to the spacecraft integrator or to upload to thye vehicle during operations. This approach will minimize the risk of software development for spacecraft instrument control.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The result of the Phase-I will be a complete system design, with the technical risks defined and mitigated as much as practical. The Phase-II effort will implement an end-to-end capability for demonstration. The demonstration system will provide instrument developers and scientists with a low risk flight software generation system, capable of generating flight worthy source code for commanding and controlling an instrument. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The <b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b> of this technology can be utilized in many spacecraft instrument control areas. The use of this technology can also be applied to the spacecraft management area, minimizing the cost of flight code development for spacecraft integrators and operators. </P>

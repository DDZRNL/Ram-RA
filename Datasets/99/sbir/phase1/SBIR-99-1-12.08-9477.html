<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>A novel approach is proposed for the detection and estimation of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals reflected from water surface for sea-state sensing and ionospheric measurement. Our approach sets forth new frequency-domain technical insertions into an innovative GPS signal delay-Doppler mapping receiver architecture. It will produce the correlation power as function of delay and Doppler (i.e., a two dimensional map) and lead to the pre-detection integration accumulation with longer time for enhanced signal to noise ratio (SNR). Our design has the potential to improve the reflected GPS signal detection and estimation, thus providing a reliable information source for scientific data extraction. It can also offer cost and performance advantages over present approaches based on hardware correlators design. In Phase I, the novel 2D delay-Doppler mapping mechanism will be thoroughly studied, a set of algorithms to achieve it will be developed and evaluated, and a preliminary hardware design to implement it will be put forth. In Phase II, the processing algorithms, software modules, and hardware schemes will be reduced into an operational prototype for testing and evaluation with real GPS data. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>When successful, the proposed research would lead to new sensing devices for detection and estimation of surface-reflected GPS signals in remote sensing applications such as wave height and salinity studies, delineation of wetlands and monitoring ionospheric total electron content above oceanic area. When built into a satellite-borne instrument, it would offer a new global scale remote sensing tool to infer various geophysical parameters to better understand global warming, ocean-current circulation, and climate change. The technology would go beyond geophysical remote sensing applications into conventional and particularly military receivers enhancement as well as other spread-spectrum communication and measurement devices. </P>

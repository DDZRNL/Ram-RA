<BLOCKQUOTE>
  There is a need for development of solid-state rechargeable lithium polymer 
batteries with both high voltage and high energy density as a new type of energy 
supply. When a solid polymer electrolyte is introduced into an Li/polymer 
battery system, an ultrathin battery with high energy density can be realized 
due to the merits of the polymer material, including its light weight and 
flexible form. For a solid-state battery system, a main need is improvement of 
the ionic conductivity of the solid polymer electrolyte. Another problem is the 
poor low-temperature (and room temperature) ion conductivity of most polymer 
electrolytes. In this proposal, an entirely new type of organometallic polymer 
material with high cation conductivity and high Li+ concentration will be 
developed. The conductivity of the lithium cations will not be affected by the 
Tg of the polymer. It is a "single ion" conductor. Li-cations are the only 
movable ions in the polymer system, the anion are not movable and are an 
integral part of the polymer backbone. This polymer offers the flexibility of a 
polymer material so that it will be compatible with continuous manufacturing 
processes based on laminate packaging technology.

   Mechanical heat switches are a critical component of sub-kelvin refrigeration systems such as ADRs. An efficient, high conductance switch enables more efficient heat flow and disengagement and thereby reduces the number for cascaded stages of refrigeration required to achieve a desired cooling capability. ADRs are a critical component on such space missions as the upcoming Constellation-X mission and future space telescopes such as STEPS where the detectors and instruments are being cooled to sub-kelvin temperatures to increase their sensitivity. 
   <br><br>
    Heat switches can be used in cryocooler systems to reduce the cooling time by Solid electrolyte has wide applications in battery, supercapacitor, oxide-based solar cell, electrochromic devices, fuel cell, sensors and other electrochemical devices.

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>The proposer (IME) is developing general-purpose electronics based on giant magnetoresistance (GMR). Underlying IME's all-metal electronics is the transpinnor, a novel device that shows amplification and either logic or linear characteristics. IME has designed and fabricated several transpinnor-based logic gates and simple linear circuits, which are being tested. The Phase 1 project objectives are to demonstrate all-metal GMR electronics for selection, amplification and logic in an all-metal magnetic RAM. A mask set will be designed and made for the required support circuitry,which will then be fabricated and tested. The proposed Phase 1 project will enable a nonvolatile, rad hard, all-metal (no semiconductors) RAM with nondestructive readout and fabricated in a single process. In a GMR RAM with semiconductor support electronics, the support circuitry and memory array are manufactured in separate processes. </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>Once economies of scale are realized, the all-metal magnetic RAM is expected to be produced at half the cost of DRAM and at on-fifth the cost of Flash. It will compete on performance and cost in all markets presently held by semiconductor memories. </P>

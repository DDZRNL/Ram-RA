<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Technology for ground testing of propulsion systems is often as demanding as 
that of the flight system. While weight is not a restriction, reliability, cost, 
safety and performance are important. In particular, long-life, liquid-oxygen-
compatible seal technology is essential to reduce recurring costs and provide 
personnel/equipment safety. A new material surfacing process, Laser Induced 
Surface Improvement (LISIsm), has demonstrated technical properties that make it 
promising for this application. The patent-pending surface alloying process 
permits a wide variety of metal and/or ceramic ingredients to be incorporated in 
a thin surface coating on component metals of interest. LISIsm forms unique non-
equilibrium alloys with enhanced properties; i.e., properties not possible in 
bulk materials. The surface is permanent; i.e., cannot be separated via physical 
abuse or thermal cycling. The surface alloy can contain constituents that make 
it less susceptible to liquid oxygen, yet have hardness as required to protect 
from particulate scratching. Other research has focused on the process to make 
sealing surfaces softer (for better sealing) and to protect Inconnel from 
hydrogen embrittlement. Phase I will experiment with designated surface 
additives to substrate materials of interest. Phase II will extend these results 
to real hardware which can be tested in an operating environment.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Ground-based transfer systems for cryogenic fluids is a big business, both for the U.S. Government and commercial interests. In particular, the production of liquid-oxygen-compatible components which are not scratch-sensitive and are longer lasting can make LISIsm surface alloying a necessary part of production. This technology will permit safer, more reliable and probably less-costly components. High-pressure air systems may also benefit from the research. Many businesses that are not space related use cryogens.

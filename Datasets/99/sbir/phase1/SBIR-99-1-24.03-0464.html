<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 24.03-0464 (Chron: 991335 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Video Speed Three-Dimensional Human Body Surface Imaging </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>With the development of long duration space flight capability, the space vehicle’s crew will become increasingly autonomous from the ground, with significant control and maintenance responsibilities. The crew’s performance and productivity will become an important factor to affect the fulfillment of flight missions. A method for studying and planning the crew activities in space is to make a 3D recording of the crew posture, position, and kinematics, and then play back to conduct scientific analyses. The image-recording system must be three-dimensional and must have real time speed with appropriate accuracy. Currently available technologies: 2D digital movie or static 3D surface imaging cannot provide the required complete information. We propose two technology innovations that can provide </P>
<P>a novel three-dimensional imaging system for measuring and tracking human body with real time video speed and with high image quality. The two technology innovations provide a systematic scientific solution to the longstanding fundamental difficulties in prior 3D surface imaging. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The market of high performance 3D body surface imaging includes: (1) Study of human-machine interface; (2) provide comprehensive body size data for clothing industry;(3) 3D digital movies. The proposed novel technology has the capability to meet all the challenges from the above three market segments. </P>

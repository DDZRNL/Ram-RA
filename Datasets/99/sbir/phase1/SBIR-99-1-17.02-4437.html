<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 17.02-4437 (Chron: 991978 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Novel High Temperature Dielectrics for High Energy Density Capacitors </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>The next generation of energy storage capacitors for power management and distribution will necessitate improvements in material efficiency, energy density, and temperature reliability. Similar performance issues are driving the consumer electronics market towards the development of high capacitance, low voltage, and small volume capacitors. These two market needs can be met by a single product which addresses the mutual concerns for </P>
<P>high temperature stability and improved electrical performance. TPL proposes the development of a dielectric having over a two-fold increase in energy storage density with improved thermal stability, operating temperatures &gt;500K (227 C). A composite system is proposed consisting of two novel materials; FPE polymer developed by 3M possessing excellent thermal stability and high energy density, and surface functionalized, nano-size titanate powders developed by TPL. Capacitor grade film of the polymer and composite materials will be fabricated and evaluated with regard to critical electrical performance parameters. </P>
<P>TPL has extensive experience in dielectric polymers and hydrothermal titanate ceramics, including the development of doping methods to produce 50 nm powders with flattened frequency and temperature response. Expertise in these two areas, in conjunction with industrial partners, will be used to develop dual-use materials to satisfy the mutual needs of military and consumer products </P>
<hr>
<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The new polymer and composites film materials will be targeted at the $2.5B film capacitor market. Specific for high temperature capacitors, under hood automotive applications and down hole well drilling applications will be targeted. In addition to film capacitors, the material will have potential for use in high temperature adhesives and loaded composites for vehicle repairs. The functionalized hydrothermal nano-size powders will be marketed in the $3.2B multilayer ceramic capacitor market. The narrow segment of this market is growing at a 50% annual rate. </P>

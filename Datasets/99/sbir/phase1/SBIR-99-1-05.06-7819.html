<P>Pulse detonation engines (PDE's) represent a potentially revolutionary approach to airbreathing propulsion compared to present-day gas turbine engines, with the potential for much higher specific impulse, thrust/weight,and range performance. Demonstrating rapid development of the detonation wave in a PDE combustor using conventional storable, high density, hydrocarbon fuels would be a key development to unlocking the promise of this engine cycle. Unfortunately, hydrocarbons have narrower detonation limits, lower heat release rates, and longer ignition delay times than hydrogen, which has been used in much of the past PDE development work. TDA Research has recently been developing additives for hydrocarbon fuels which promote chemical reactions, both for endothermic cracking and reduction of ignition delays for hydrocarbon-fueled scramjet applications. Archival hydrocarbon detonation data indicates that there is a high probability that we could develop initiator compounds for pulse detonation engines which would dramatically reduce the deflagration to detonation transition lengths currently observed with hydrocarbon fuels as well as reduce PDE initiation energy requirements. If successful, this research would substantially improve PDE specific impulse, firing rate, thrust level, and specific impulse performance parameters. </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>Combustion-promoting fuel additives currently hold an approximately $30,000,000/yr market as a low cost method for improving the cetane number of diesel fuels. The current leading additive, 2-ethyl hexyl nitrate, has been implicated in increased NOX emissions due to its fuel-bound nitrogen, however proposed stricter air quality standards indicate that more effective or higher treat levels of combustion promoting compounds will be needed for diesel fuels in the future to reduce particulate emissions. Identification of inexpensive and effective combustion promoting compounds with low toxicity could potentially capitalize on this market. </P>

<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Highly Efficient DC-DC Converter Using Matrix Components and Intelligent Control </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will result in a family of very high efficiency DC-DC converters utilizing smart control circuitry which will enable the implementation of emerging low voltage logic family trends for space systems. To address the need for efficient power conversion from higher voltage power busses to lower power electronics, American Research Corporation of Virginia proposes the development of DC-DC matrix component converters employing intelligent control. The proposal is innovative by integrating the matrix component converter topology, where each component type can be scaled to maintain performance specifications over a wide range of voltages and loads with intelligent control circuitry minimizing power and allowing load sharing, redundancy, hot swappability, back up modes, reduction in input ripple and condition reporting. Phase I Technical Objectives include design of an innovative power circuit topology to fulfill requirements for future space DC-DC converter power needs; design of suitable control electronics to meet load, regulation and bandwidth ranges; validation of the design by computer simulation; and circuit optimization and development of a radiation-hardened engineering model. Results of the Phase I project will quantitatively validate the design feasibility, and provide the basis for refinement, miniaturization and packaging in Phase II. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>Successful completion of the program objectives will fill a major power conversion gap as higher performance electronics tend toward lower operating voltages. The proposed technology will meet emerging requirements in the spacecraft environment as well as similar power management commercial applications in automobiles, aircraft, communications and digital computers. </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>The potential that MEMS flow sensors offer are obviously very exciting, but many practical issues need to be addressed before such sensors can be widely used in non-laboratory aerodynamic applications. Currently, many sensor elements have had their performance validated. Included in this group are the UM shear stress, pressure, and temperature sensors on both rigid and flexible substrates. Packaging and electronic instrumentation are two of the most important areas needing attention and improvement. Therefore, in this Phase I effort, we propose the following: (1) Develop novel MEMS backside contact technologies for both flexible and rigid substrates, and (2) Characterize and better understand a newly designed instrumentation package. Additional UM work in progress that will benefit from this effort includes a pressure probe based omni-directional velocity sensor. </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The information gained from this work can be applied to many generic MEMS flow sensor applications. Our customers have large interests in incorporating our sensors on their various vehicles. As the need for faster, more maneuverable, and more fuel efficient vehicles increases, we are confident that our sensors will play key roles in the design and validation of new aircraft and ships. </P>

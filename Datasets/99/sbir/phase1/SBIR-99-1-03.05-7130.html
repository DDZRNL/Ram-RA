<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Multipoint Fiber Optic Sensor for Cryogenic Fuel Leak Detection </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) Inc., a world leader in fiber optic sensing technology, proposes to develop a newmulti-point fiber optic sensors (MFOS) sensor system for the remote detection of cryogenic (hydrogen and oxygen) fuel leaks in evolved expandable launch vehicle (EELV) propulsion technology. The proposed fiber optic sensing technology is directly applicable to NASA's Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) strategy.</P>

<P>MFOS system operation is based on the use of miniature optrodes (optical point sensors) sensitive to cryogenic fuel and effluent gases distributed at multiple locations along the length of an optical fiber bus. Using a novel fluorescence-based approach to hydrogen sensing allows common signal processing (quench-monitoring) for both oxygen and hydrogen; a third temperature-sensitive fluorescent optrode assures good performance over the </P>
<P>entire 0F to 140 F temperature range. The proposed MFOS technology offers a low-cost, reliable solution to reducing planned ground processing (trouble shooting) through the predictive capabilities of real-time monitoring of system health and streamlined problem isolation, and will improve ground and flight safety through early detection and</P>
<P>prediction of component failures and by improving visibility into critical safety systems. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>With increased attention being focused on the environment by both industry and government, a distributed sensor with the capability to detect potentially hazardous hydrogen gas leaks will find widespread acceptance and utility.</P>

<P>Potential customers include Boeing Aerospace, NASA, Army, Navy, numerous natural gas, oil, and fuel companies, auto manufacturers, and EPA. The proposed sensors could be used as continuous real-time detectors or as portable probes for use at multiple sites. Direct applications in the aerospace industry include health monitoring for virtually all oxyhydrogen-powered launch systems, ranging from Titan rockets to the X-33 reusable</P>
<P>launch vehicle. </P>

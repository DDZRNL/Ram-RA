<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Wavefront Error Determination from Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) Temperatures </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>In planned NASA large aperture telescopes such as NGST sensing of the wavefront error due to thermal distortions is essential to controlling image quality. Hardware means for direct wavefront sensing can add significantly to system cost and complexity. Use of the science instrument for wavefront sensing can interfere with science data collection. Our innovation is to use Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) temperatures to indirectly determine Wave Front Error (WFE). The objective is to establish feasibility, to assess practicality, and to quantify potential performance. We propose considering the transformation between a grid of OTA temperature measurements and WFE of the OTA. We will study means for determining this transformation, the required grid of temperature measurements and the resulting accuracy of the WFE estimate in the face of errors and uncertainties. The NGST yardstick design will be used as an example. The result will be an assessment of the feasibility of this technique in the NGST application. This technique may apply to all optical and RF telescopes where the dominant source of WFE during long exposures arises from thermal distortions of the OTA. The benefit is a potentially reliable, low cost means for sensing thermally induced WFEs that require correction. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>This technique, if it is shown to be feasible, could be applied to any government or commercial optical or electromagnetic sensor where correction of thermally induced WFE is required. The feasibility of the technique is likely to be application specific. The commercial application of this technique would need to be tailored to each application. We hope to commercialize this approach to wavefront sensing by developing specialized software techniques for analyzing specific applications and for implementing the wavefront sensing function. </P>

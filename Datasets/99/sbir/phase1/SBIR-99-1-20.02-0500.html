<P>A Novel Integrated Two-Axis Electro-Optical Beam Scanner Based on 3D Microprisms </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>In this Phase I program, Radiant Research, Inc. (RRI) proposes to develop a novel integrated, low power, two-axis electro-optical beam scanner based on thin-film three-dimensional microprisms. An innovative compression-molding technique will be employed for device fabrication. The proposed Phase I device will provide a high scanning speed (&lt; 1 nsec), low drive power, and non-mechanical two-axis beam scanning with the scanning angle larger than 1° as required by NASA. The scanning angle enhancement is to be realized by accumulating the electro-optically-tuned angular shift associated with each three-dimensional electro-optic microprisms. The unique property of polymeric film allows the formation of a simplified uniform electrode pattern. No moving part is involved in such a high-speed, integrated beam scanning device where a low drive voltage less than 10 V is required for a scanning angle of 1°. Such an electrode structure is not realizable for inorganic electro-optical crystals such as LiNbO3 and SBN. The maturity of both type A and Type B EO polymers makes the proposed system highly feasible for airborne- and space borne applications where long-term reliability is pivotal. A working model of the proposed system will be demonstrated at the conclusion of the project. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>Electro-optic beam steering devices are key components in advanced laser communication systems, optical sensors, optical data storage systems, laser printers, and optical switching networks. The proposed EO deflector is advantageous whenever there is a need for low power fast optical beam steering with a large scanning angle. A reliable EO deflector with large deflection angle at low driving voltage, fast slew rate, light weight, simplified fabrication scheme, and compact structure. _____________________________________________________________________</P>

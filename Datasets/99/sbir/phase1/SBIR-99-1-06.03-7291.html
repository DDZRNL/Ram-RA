<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The global political structure has changed dramatically since the breakup of the 
former Soviet Union. World changes have caused the U.S. to reprioritize its 
National hypersonic needs. The United States government has looked to the needs 
of the future, and the hypersonic aeorospace plane is one of the systems 
included in alternative force structures. One of the hypersonic aerospace plane 
concepts would involve magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) technology, or the AJAX 
hypersonic flight vehicle concept, originally proposed by Russian scientist 
Vladimir Fraishtadt. The objective of this proposal is to study an air-breathing 
horizontal take-off and landing design concept using an MHD energy bypass 
injector ramjet engine. MSE and Hypertech Concepts will be using MSE
developed Electromagnetic code (MSEID Code) with new Scramjet model and other 
tools to examine the total system performance. Both cruiser and space launch 
propulsion configurations will be investigated. The MSE and Hypertech Concepts 
team will make sure this propulsion and operational concept for the hypersonic 
aerospace plane is based on operations consistent with existing NASA goals. The 
overall operational concept will also be examined to determine the overall cost 
effectiveness.

   The proposed research will allow us to identify the optimal strategy towards the 
rapid development of an integrated, airframe-engine propulsion system for 
hypersonic flight and access to space. Access to space is a multi-billion dollar 
industry that is expected to grow even more rapidly than in the recent past. 
With a compelling requirement for re-usable launch vehicles already established 
in the commercial space industry, the need for efficient and integrated 
propulsion systems is acute. The ability to design an efficient launch/cruise 
Propulsion system, and manufacture it at low cost provides the key to commercial 
success. The proprietary technology that allows this operation is therefore 
expected to generate large revenues and provide a key advantage to U.S.
business. There is a significant commercial and military market interest in the 
use of the product that will result from this research. NASA, the U.S. 
Department of Defense, and Boeing-Rocketdyne have all expressed interest 
in this project. MSE has and is continuing to implement strategic partnerships 
with large aerospace companies: United Technologies Research Center (UTRC & 
Pratt & Whitney), Boeing Rocketdyne, and Coleman Aerospace. It is through these 
partnerships that the commercialization of the technologies will be most 
effectively accomplished.  Our strategy is to leverage our strategic 
relationships to obtain match investment for a Phase II development effort
predicated on the results of our Phase I research and the interest generated by 
potential government andcommercial clients.

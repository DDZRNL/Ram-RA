<P>The requirements for large-scale complex applications are pushing the frontiers of distributed systems to support seamless integration among disparate computer systems that are build independently on a myriad of software and hardware platforms. This project aims to design and implement software mechanisms that facilitate building such systems using agent technology. Intelligent Automation Inc. has been working on autonomous agent technology in order to design and implement complex systems from autonomous software components running on heterogeneous networks of computers. Results from our previous efforts indicate that this technology can address the challenges of building peer to peer, interoperable systems, while reducing software design and implementation costs, improving system robustness, portability, extensibility and maintainability. Our work will result in a commercial software tool for building highly interoperable and extensible distributed systems. Integrated with our software design tools, the resulting suite will integrate reduce software development time while increasing robustness of the resulting applications. We expect our products will make a significant impact on industries that involve complex systems, such as aerospace industry, military logistics, manufacturing and e-commerce. </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>As a result of this effort, we will develop the next generation of Cybele agent infrastructure with a unique, extensible communication framework. Paired with the suite of agent design tool we are developing called DIVA, we will be able to market these tools, as well as our consulting services in the distributed applications arena. Our target applications include aeronautical applications, manufacturing, supply-chain management and electronic commerce, logistics, transportation and traffic management, as well as telecommunication operations. We have partnered with Rational Software Corporation, (revenues of $ 311 million in fiscal year 1998) which has a 62 % share of the software tools market for object oriented design. (A letter expressing Rational Software Corporation'sinterest in our agent technology and commitment to partner is included in our appendix). Rational will provide joint marketing and sales-generation activities, product literature, press announcements, and lead sharing. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The development of advanced immobilized enzyme bioreactors for the ambient 
temperature destruction of dissolved organics in reclaimed water is proposed. 
More than a decade ago, work began which resulted in the development of two 
unique composite beds which catalyzed the conversion of low molecular weight 
alcohols and urea to ionic constituents, and then retained the reaction 
byproducts on ion-exchanges resins. This original work barely scratched the 
surface with respect to an evaluation of potentially beneficial enzyme systems. 
A vast array of biocatalysts are yet to be investigated. Among these are a class 
of highly nonspecific oxidase enzymes which have been shown in preliminary work 
conducted in our laboratory to exhibit good activity toward the oxidation 
of ethylene and propylene glycols, two important components of humidity 
condensate. We propose to build upon this fundamental concept sufficiently to 
produce a comprehensive system for the treatment of BWP, RO or MF effluents to 
yield potable water meeting NASA drinking water TOC specifications. Fundamental 
advantages of the enzyme based bioreactors are simplicity, minimal power 
consumption, compatibility with current multifiltration systems, and ambient 
temperature operation.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   It is anticipated that specific enzyme systems will be identified which can be directly applied to ground-based environmental remediation applications. However, the most promising commercial aspect of the proposed projectis in the production and sale of enzymes which are not currently available commercially. The primary customers will be the biomedical and research communities. Enzymes are small-quantity-high-value products. It is anticipated that as a result of the Phase II effort,UMPQUA will have sufficient capacity to meet initial demand. The most probable means of bringing the new enzymes to market will be through a sales agreement with a major biochemical supplier such as Sigma-Aldrich.

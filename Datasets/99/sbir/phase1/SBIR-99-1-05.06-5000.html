<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Solid Hydrogen In Liquid Helium for HEDM Applications </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>ORBITEC proposes an innovative LHe/H2/HEDM slurry rocket fuel. In addition, ORBITEC proposes the development of an innovative bi-propellant cryogenic engine capable of utilizing such a fuel. Advanced High-Energy Density Matter (HEDM) cryogenic fuels show great promise for increasing Isp and moving space propulsion into the 21st century. Development of such fuels could enable SSTO concepts and low cost expendable launch vehicles. In Phase I, ORBITEC proposes to develop and test a hydrogen particle production system in liquid helium. In addition, a preliminary design will be produced for a specialized particle-slurry burning bi-propellant engine. Phase II work will finalize this design and fabricate and fire a bi-propellant GOX/LHe/hydrogen particle slurry concept engine. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>Development of particle hydrogen technology will play a vital role in the development of environmentally clean, high energy density propellants of the future. The particle hydrogen technology/LHe slurry propellants proposed here provide an extremely effective vehicle for development of and research into HEDMs in general. This technology can significantly increase the payload to orbit capability of all launch systems, especially in SSTO applications. Particle hydrogen technology also offers extremely high-performing fuels for air-breathing engines, either for launch vehicle applications or for high-speed military aircraft. In general, the proposed project could lead to revolutionary high-performance, low-cost, advanced cryogenic engines of various sizes that could significantly enhance a wide variety of military and civil space missions and enable others. </P>

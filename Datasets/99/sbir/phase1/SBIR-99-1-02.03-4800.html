<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Turbine Burner for High Pressure Ratio, Low NOx Gas Turbine Engines </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>The turbine burner is an innovative, potentially revolutionary concept for very low emissions and increased specific thrust while maintaining or improving cycle efficiency through increased overall pressure ratio. Heat addition in the turbine burner between the low pressure and high pressure turbine (constant temperature heat addition) is a better approximation of the ideal Carnot cycle. Moving a portion of the full power heat addition from the main combustor to the turbine burner reduces peak flame temperature which can drastically reduce NOx emissions and improve turbine life. A turbine burner must be compact, lightweight, and durable (no risk of fuel passage coking), must rapidly mix the fuel and air at a very lean equivalence ratio (to keep NOx at negligible levels), and have very low pressure drop to be successful. A turbine burner that meets these requirements and is closely integrated with the low pressure turbine stator will be developed in this SBIR project.</P>

<P>The overall feasibility of the turbine burner will be assessed with a numerical approach in Phase I.  Numerical analyses will be used to rapidly evaluate various concepts, demonstrate low NOx emissions at full power, and show that combustion in the turbine can be achieved with acceptable weight and cost penalties. In Phase II, selected concept(s) will be further optimized and tested in rig facilities in cooperation with General Electric Aircraft Engines. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The turbine burner concept developed in this SBIR program will result in decreases in NOx emissions and/or increases in thrust-to-weight ratio in advanced gas turbine engines. A successful turbine burner concept of this type would be a potentially revolutionary break-through. General Electric has expressed interest in the technology and development in Phase II will be targeted toward application in one of their engines. </P>

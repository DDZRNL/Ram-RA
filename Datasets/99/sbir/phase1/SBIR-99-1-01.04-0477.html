<P>Automated Reuse Support for Design of Embedded Avionics Systems (AutoSoft) </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>EDAptive Computing, Inc. (EDAptive) and Dr. Perry Alexander of the University of Kansas propose an innovative solution to the problem of the lack of automated reuse support for design of complex, embedded systems. Our proposed solution, which automates reuse of existing components, will enable design of high-integrity avionics software and systems, thereby ensuring safe and reliable operation of the designed systems. Our Phase I objectives are to (1) Define requirements - to ensure that we understand NASA"s requirements, (2) Identify and evaluate candidate methods, tools and , (3) Develop methods, tools, technologies, (4) Demonstrate technical feasibility through preliminary design and prototyping, and (5) Establish commercial feasibility and potential. Our Phase I Tasks include (1) Evaluating existing assets, (2) Determining additional capabilities needed, (3) Evaluating feasibility and demonstrating critical aspects, (4) preparing a preliminary design, and (5) assessing commercial potential. Our Phase I results will include: A Demonstration of critical design aspects by the end of the sixth month, and a Final Report at the end of the sixth month, which will document all the investigations, decisions, findings, commercialization strategy and demonstrations during the Phase I program. This technology will markedly improve space system development effectiveness through automated component reuse. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>With ever increasing complexity of embedded systems and growing demand for their safe and reliable operation, designers of such systems are constantly looking for tools, languages and methods that would enable them to rapidly meet user demands for high integrity systems and algorithms. Success of ISI MARIXx is a good evidence of the need. The need is universal among embedded system designers and is not just limited to avionics systems.</P>

<P>With ever increasing interest in embedded intelligent appliances, that market is only bound to grow with increasing time-to-market pressures on embedded system designers. A tool suite that enables automated reuse of existing components and a design correct-by-construction is likely to be of high interest since it will reduce time-to-market and enable high-integrity systems. In addition, complexity of newly designed embedded systems is such that a design from scratch is very hard, if not impossible. Therefore, AutoSoft market is bound to grow. </P>

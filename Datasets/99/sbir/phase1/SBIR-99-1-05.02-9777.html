<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>A CFD Tool for Resolving Turbulence-Chemistry Interaction in High Speed Flows </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>This innovation applies to CFD simulations of turbulent combusting high speed flows, such as those encountered in hypersonic airbreathing propulsion systems. The resulting product will deliver the Monte-Carlo/PDF technology developed by Professor Pope, and identified by several commercial and government contracting concerns as required to resolve the effects of turbulence on chemical reaction in high speed and industrial flows. The products of this work will be a robust, stand-alone, fully consistent JPDF code that will be unique in terms of technology and answering a documented NASA and industry need, AND a library of Monte-Carlo/PDF utilities to upgrade existing CFD codes to Monte-Carlo/PDF capabilities. The work has significant Phase II and III commitments, and market demand. The work will enable NASA to achieve a quantum leap in SCRAMJET simulations, supporting access to space. </P>

<hr>
<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The project results have application in the aerospace (improved design of SCRAMJETs, improved prediction of flows in combustors) automotive (improved internal combustion engine design, reduced emissions) and chemical process industries (a host of chemical manufacturing processes.) Based on feedback from customers, CFD market leader, Fluent Inc., has made a commitment to integrate the developed technology into their products. </P>

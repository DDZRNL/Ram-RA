<B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  
S&K Electronics is proposing a visual programming environment for developing expert systems in CLIPS. This project will be known as the Visual Expert System Programming Resource, or VESPR. The visual environment will provide a graphical interface for easily capturing knowledge and converting it into the appropriate language constructs; it will also provide visualization of the system being developed. VESPR will also automatically provide
'scaffolding' to simplify the development of features common to expert systems. By using an existing expert system development language, the project will be able to leverage the work already done on the language and have an existing pool of potential users available. The most important asset that NASA owns is flight knowledge.
 
  <br><br>
 How to fly space vehicles. This knowledge is unique to NASA, and most of it is confined to a few experienced flight controllers and mission specialists. Expert systems can represent that knowledge in a permanent, flexible, and useful fashion. The knowledge can be saved and used easily. Unfortunately, creation of an expert system is an expensive, time-consuming task, requiring, at a minimum, both an expert who possesses the knowledge that needs
to be captured, and an expert programmer.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   CLIPS has enjoyed success in the commercial market as an expert-systems language, and a visual development environment will be attractive to those who are already using CLIPS or already developing expert systems. 
   <br><br>
    The CLIPS User Group, an active group of developers currently using CLIPS, will give us immediate access to the people who are most likely to be interested in this environment. There is a language called the Java Expert System Shell, or JESS; this was originally an implementation of CLIPS written in Java. VESPR could be marketed as a tool for developing expert systems in Java, which could provide 'intelligence' for a web site. Because of the enormous current demand for Web development, there is a critical shortage of programmers competent to work on complex systems; a tool that would allow non-programmers to develop expert systems could be extremely well received. The market for Java GUI builders is currently highly competitive; in such a market, it should be easy to find a partner who will market a tool in return for the competitive advantage of a new feature.

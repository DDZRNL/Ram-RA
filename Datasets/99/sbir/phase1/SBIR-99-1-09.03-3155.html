<BLOCKQUOTE>
 In this proposal, Intelligent Automation, Incorporated (IAI) proposes an 
Automated Non-intrusive Health Monitoring tool for simultaneous component or 
structure degradation monitoring (trend analysis), fault detection, and 
diagnostics in ground systems. This prognostic technique, or health monitoring 
(HM) tool, can be combined with IAI's internetworking software to provide remote 
monitoring capability. The innovation will also allow us to detect new fault 
conditions that have not occurred before. This may include sensor failures and 
hence, the capability of validity self-checks. Our algorithm uses one major 
tool: Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a powerful technique for 
extracting the features inside the sensor signals. A major advantage of PCA is 
that supervised learning is unnecessary. Another advantage of PCA is that we can 
use it for degradation monitoring or reliability assessment. It can also be used 
for early detection of cracks, fatigue, and corrosion signatures buried in 
sensor signals. General sensor fusion architecture will be used for fusing 
different decisions. The proposed method is relevant to the subtopic because our 
innovation can provide a trend analysis that detects structural degradation due 
to cracks, corrosion, and fatigue. The purpose is to reduce the likelihood of 
structural or other failures in ground systems such as engines and gearboxes.

   Health monitoring technology has many applications such as helicopter gearbox systems, jet and automotive engine diagnostics, and many of NASA's flight critical systems. The jet and automobile industries are multibillion Dollar industries that are commercial grounds for this technology.

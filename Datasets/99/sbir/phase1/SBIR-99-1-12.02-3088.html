<P>Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a compact, low cost, widely tunable (visible to IR),rugged, high-optical-density tunable bandwidth filter system (TBFS) for hyperspectral airborne and ground-based sensing. This filter system is based on the unique integration of a pair of thin Raman holographic edge filters within a rotating lens. In this compact configuration, the TBFS can be integrated into an existing remote sensing video and digital camera lens system without major modification or effect on system imaging quality. The filter will be electrically programmable and rapidly scanned or agilely switched in milliseconds to selected band centers. In Phase I, POC will design a laboratory prototype and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method by integrating holographic filter and electro-optics technology fabricated for the demonstration. When fully developed, the proposed filter system will be rapidly tunable to spectral lines of interest for multispectral and hyperspectral imaging suitable in NASA remote sensing for coastal research. </P>

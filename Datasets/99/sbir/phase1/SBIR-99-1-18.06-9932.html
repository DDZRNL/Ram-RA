<B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  We propose to investigate the feasibility of an innovative flexible printed mini-strip design appropriate for cryogenic instrumentation especially sensitive readout electronics, multiplexers, and infrared detector arrays. The proposed design specifically addresses noise suppression by implementing a multi-layer design optimized by computer modeling; low thermal conduction by using appropriate material and geometric design; and reliability and operational integrity after many thermal cyclings. Our design promotes "plug-and-play" operation through standardization and simplicity in fabrication which yields reduction in installation and replacement time. Modularity, adaptability to different system configurations, and use of standard, readily available connectors to terminate the strip are key design elements. 
  <br><br>
   We anticipate the result of the Phase-I effort to be the conclusive demonstration of the feasibility of the proposed concept. The developmental work during Phase-II will result in working prototypes with desired characteristics. The final production and commercialization will lead us to reliable, easy to use, and cost effective flexible mini-strips, of many forms and varieties. Our finished product will offer superior quality and will be an engineering match to the cutting-edge technology of the cryogenic readout electronics for which it is designed.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  There is a decisive technology gap between the state-of-the-art focal plane 
electronics and the readily available signal transport systems. We believe that 
this void is already affecting the quality as well as the cost of the cryogenic 
instruments used in various NASA projects. We plan to fill this void by bringing 
to market modular, flexible mini-strips with integral interconnects appropriate 
for sensitive cryogenic instrumentation. Space and atmospheric programs will be 
the primary market for our proposed product, with NASA, national labs, and 
commercial aerospace companies being our first customers. Specific areas 
include: Space instruments developed under Origins Program such as NGST, science 
instruments for SOFIA, upcoming projects under Astrobiology Program, balloon-
borne instruments, laboratory science instruments and test systems, and science 
instruments for observations at ground-based observatories. Since there is 
nothing inherent in our design that would preclude the use of our mini-strip for 
applications other than cryogenic instrumentation, we anticipate our secondary 
market to be the electronics industry, and in particular the computer industry. 
The design's emphasis on noise suppression and EMI protection makes the product 
ideal for those instruments that have to operate in noisy environment.

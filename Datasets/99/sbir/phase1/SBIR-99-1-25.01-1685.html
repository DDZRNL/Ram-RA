<BLOCKQUOTE>
A new, photoconductive polymer system based on silylene-silicone copolymers is 
proposed for evaluation as a base resin for spacecraft coating materials. These 
coatings can be tailored to provide low solar absorbance, high emissivity at 
ambient spacecraft surface temperature, atomic oxygen resistance, and resistance 
to surface charging by ion and electron impact. The coatings are tough, abrasion 
resistant, 100% solids formulations; no solvents are required. Cure of the 
coating is initiated by irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) light, which allows 
cure control that is independent of temperature and provides long shelf life. 
Our approach to the formulation of spacecraft coatings will involve the 
synthesis of a curable resin containing polysilylene chains. We believe that 
polysilylene chains terminated with epoxy substituted polysiloxanes (silicones) 
afford the most viable route to a curable system. We will use the established 
photoconductivity of the polysilylene fragments to achieve an illuminated (light 
or ionizing radiation) conductivity for neutralizing deposited charge and their 
reactivity toward atomic oxygen to provide erosion protection. Polysilylenes 
form monolayers of silica during attack, which can effectively block further 
reaction. We propose to fill these systems, at or below the percolation limit 
with glass particles that are coated with a conductive indium/tin oxide layer to 
tailor their absorbtivity and emissivity and to provide the surfaces for 
generation of free-charge carriers. Previous work at Adherent Technologies has 
resulted in polysilylenes that have reactive ends capable of copolymerization 
with epoxy-terminated siloxane oligomers to form crosslinkable resin systems. 
Suitable tailoring of these copolymers should give liquid, ultraviolet light 
curable resins that can be the basis of solvent-free coating systems.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Initial applications will be in government-sponsored space and communications programs. However, the materials should find niche markets in areas where high temperature stability, corrosion resistance, and shielding or static discharge mitigation are required. The properties expected for these resins are unique. We anticipate that new and unpredictable applications will evolve as the resins are characterized. This is a new system, with an unusual combination of co-fragment characteristics that may well become of general interest. They will provide an example of molecular engineering to achieve a specific goal.

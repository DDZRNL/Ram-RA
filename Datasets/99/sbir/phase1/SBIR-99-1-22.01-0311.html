<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Current field emission electric propulsion (FEEP) thrusters are limited by low 
thrust, high power consumption and very high voltage operation. In this project, 
we propose an innovative approach to obtaining enhanced emission of highly 
ionized, uniformly sized clusters from these types of thrusters that can 
dramatically increase the thrust producing capabilities. The proposed 
modification, namely use of electrohydrodynamics based modulation of the 
emitting liquid surface will also produce more uniform size distribution of the 
emitted clusters. In Phase I we will build and test a simple geometry thruster 
and demonstrate enhanced emission. We will also install the new thruster in the 
Thruster Test Facility at Princeton University and measure the increase in 
thrust resulting from the use of the enhanced emission mode. In Phase II we will 
build an ultra-compact MEMS based field thruster that will utilize the 
enhancements demonstrated in Phase I. The use of MEMS structure will enable to 
dramatically decrease the high voltages needed for beam extraction. We believe 
that the innovations proposed in this project will result in a very compact, 
lightweight, low power consumption thruster that will be suitable for small to 
medium satellite applications.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   The <b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b> of this field emission thruster technology include use in commercial communications satellites and emerging commercial spacecraft industries. In addition, the core field ion and droplet emission technology has applications in focussed beam repair systems for integrated chips, multi-chip modules and flat panel displays. Furthermore, this core technology can be used for rapid prtotyping applications as well. The field ion emission is very similar to the rapidly emerging field electron emission technology that is useful in huge markets such as field emission displays, coolers, printers, x-ray sources and high performance vacuum microelectronic devices.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  A new and original "G-Cycle" design combines with an innovative research 
approach to answer a fundamental question regarding the role of centrifuge 
induced acceleration in countermeasure technology. The novel device allows 
ground-based exercise with pure +Gz acceleration, tolerable rotational rates, 
reduced gradients, and greater comfort. Further, the ability to measure and vary 
exercise resistance and work rate is provided. For the first time, the effects 
of hypergravity can be studied as a true independent variable, isolated from 
increased force. 
<br><br>
Exercise in 1g maintains musculoskeletal homeostasis and is superior to exercise 
in 0g. If exercise in 2g enhances training over exercise in 1g, a dose-response 
effect of acceleration will be demonstrated. Intermittent 2g exercise would 
likely be an effective countermeasure to the adverse effects of prolonged 
spaceflight. 
<br><br>
This proposal enumerates the advantages of the "G-Cycle" that distinguish it 
from the offerors' original Space Cycle invention and other self powered human 
centrifuges. 
<br><br>
This Phase I SBIR proposal encompasses the actual design, construction and 
physiologic testing of this unique device. Phase II will scientifically 
determine if muscular training is enhanced in hypergravity compared to 
Normal gravity using the device. All other variables, including resistance, will 
be held constant.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   If hypergravity training enhances performance, independent of load, NASA would 
benefit with strong evidence of a truly effective countermeasure to prolonged 
spaceflight. 
<br><br>
Basic science mechanisms of muscular training and homeostasis would be revealed 
with this powerful research tool in the hands of the academic community. 
<br><br>
A commercial product that has been scientifically demonstrated to more 
efficiently and effectively train muscle is of enormous potential. Olympic and 
professional sports teams would rapidly take advantage to this new technology.
Health clubs and gyms would feature such a device. A properly designed and 
manufactured hyper-gravity exercise device could be made for home use with 
excellent prospects for success.

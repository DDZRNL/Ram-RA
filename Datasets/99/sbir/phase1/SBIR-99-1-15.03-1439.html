<P><B><b>PROJECT TITLE</b>:</B> High Performance Ulraviolet Array Detectors by 
Micromachining 
<P><B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>In Phase I of the program LEEOAT Company will develop and optimize 
  the design and fabrication process of a high performance, stable, robust and 
  cost-effective UV focal array detector and system for space application, based 
  on LEEOAT Company proprietary micromachining technology. The effort will also 
  include a theoretical modeling of the expected detector and system performance 
  (sensitivity, quantum efficiency, signal/noise, resolution, Modulation 
  Transfer Function). On the basis of the theoretical results, the detector and 
  system components will be optimized. Compatibility of the UV detector and 
  system with present and future space and other commercial applications will be 
  also evaluated in the optimization effort. Finally, LEEOAT Company will 
  estimate the cost/effort of the fabrication and testing of the detector and 
  system to be performed in Phase II of the program. <BR><BR><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The development of the cost-effective high-performance 
  miniaturized UV array imager will open a large window of opportunity for 
  commercial, medical and military applications. Estimate commercial market can 
  exceed 200 M per annum. <BR><BR><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 03.05-1460A (Chron: 991771 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>On-Line Propellant Monitoring System </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>Current rocket engine test, propellant quality sampling techniques require multi-point sample extraction and laboratory analysis. This is time consuming and expensive. NexGen Research proposes to develop a remotely distributed, multi-point, in-line, continuous monitoring system that will detect both particulate matter and trace contaminants in propellants and support gases in real time. NexGen will integrate miniaturized fiber optic based turbidity sensors and state-of-the-art fiber optic micromirror chemical sensor technology with remote, microprocessor based, signal processing to yield a low cost, reliable propellant system monitor that is intrinsically safe for explosive mixtures and free from electromagnetic interference. The fiber optic nature of the sensors (small size, light weight, low power requirements, ruggedness, reliability, and long distance telemetry) will allow for many low cost sensors to be distributed throughout the facility at critical points, including supplier inlets and test article supply ports. Real time, multi-point, monitoring will improve the overall quality control and lower facility operational costs. This Phase I project will demonstrate the proof of concept by fabricating and testing a small fiber optic based turbidity sensor for the detection of particulate mater, and two fiber optic chemical sensors for the detection of hydrocarbon and water trace contaminants. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The distributed, multi-point, fiber optic based sensor is a novel approach to both chemical sensing and turbidity measurement and will have wide spread uses in both military and commercial applications. The turbidity sensor can be used anywhere particulate contamination in liquid or gas is of interest and samples are being taken. This includes such applications as: aviation fuel monitoring, industrial process monitoring, water production, and waste water treatment. The moisture and hydrocarbon sensors also have many uses in industrial and environmental monitoring applications. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The objective of the proposed research is to establish the technical viability 
of a process that will enable production of cast precision membrane structures 
of virtually unlimited aperture. Very large membrane structures are required for 
many concepts currently being considered for space-based large telescopes and 
other NASA science missions. The current state-of-the-art fabrication process 
for dual curvature (parabolic) shapes, developed by SRS Technologies, requires a 
single piece mandrel the size of the final membrane structure. SRS has 
fabricated precision thin film structures of up to 5 meters in diameter using 
this method. This technique could probably be extended to manufacture components 
up to approximately twice this size. However, new technology is required to 
fabricate very large membrane structures that are needed for many future NASA 
applications. This effort will result in development of a solvent welding 
technique to join film sections much more reliably and with much less variation 
in seam material properties than is achievable at this time. Additionally, new 
mandrel technology will be developed to enable larger films to be cast on 
lighter weight, less expensive tools.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Very large thin film membrane structures are critical for NASA missions in Solar 
Thermal Power and many other areas. The technology developed under this effort 
will focus on enabling construction of very large (>> 10 meter) precision-cast, 
doubly-curved membranes for future very large aperture space telescopes. 
However, this is truly a cross-cutting technology development effort. Large 
doubly-curved membranes are also needed for solar concentrators for solar 
dynamic or other space power applications, advanced solar thermal propulsion 
concepts, and many antenna applications. Additionally, the solvent welding 
technology to be developed has direct application to manufacturing large flat 
membranes that are required for linear solar concentrators for power generation, 
solar sails, and star occulters. This effort constitutes a high payoff 
technology investment due to the wide range of future applications.

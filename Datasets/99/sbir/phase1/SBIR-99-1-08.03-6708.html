<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Structured Photocatalyst for the Control of Cabin Air Quality </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>Air pollution by trace contaminant gases, microorganisms in the cabin of spacecraft can be a problem in space exploration. Conventional methods suffer from the disadvantages of secondary pollution, high energy consumption and limited effectiveness toward only certain pollutants. An innovative structured photocatalyst is proposed for the photocatalytic destruction of the microorganisms, VOC’s and TAP’s. The process is anticipated to be highly efficient because charge recombination is eliminated in the photocatalyst. The structured photocatalyst will be designed, synthesized and evaluated in a bench top photocatalytic reactor to establish proof of the concept. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>In addition to cabin air quality control, the proposed innovation can be applicable to indoor air quality control, effluent treatment from painting and coating operations, air stripping in water/soil remediation, solvent related operations in semiconductor, electronic, fine machinery and chemical industries, effluent treatment from incineration and combustion processes, water purification, water splitting, CO2 reduction and etc. </P>

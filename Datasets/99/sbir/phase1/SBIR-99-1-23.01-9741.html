<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 23.01-9741 (Chron: 991417)</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Integrated Optical Sensor Analysis Environment </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>This proposal addresses the solution of key problems faced today by the developers of advanced optical sensor systems. The problems are the efficient utilization and interfacing of the large number of sensor design, modeling and simulation codes and the effective collaborative interaction of multiple domain experts on the development team. These problems must be solved while embracing a Faster Better Cheaper philosophy that limits time and </P>
<P>resources available to go from concept definition to optimized finished design. The solution proposed is an integrated systems analysis environment that will support a wide variety of optical sensor development applications.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>We will accomplish this by integrating the best existing software tools in an environment with shared interaction control and database capabilities. The solution will be based upon the Spacecraft Simulation Toolkit being developed by PRA under contract to AFRL and currently being employed on the Goddard NGST program to develop end-to-end simulations for that application. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The software implementation of the proposed systems analysis environment will be applicable to a wide range of optical sensor design problems that are of interest to NASA, the DOD and commercial sensor developers. Although the emphasis will be on space-based sensors this environment can be extended to ground and aircraft based systems as well. The flexibility of the environment will allow it to be adapted to new applications by adding new software </P>
<P>tools with tailored capabilities. This will broaden the market for this environment and will make its extension to other sensor classes an attractive commercial business area. </P>

<P><B><b>PROJECT TITLE</b>:</B> Optimum Design of Composite Sandwich Structures for 
Damage Containment 
<P><B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sandwich structures have shown improved structural efficiency as 
  compared to monolithic structures. However, one area of concern in sandwich 
  construction is the durability and damage tolerance of these structures. This 
  concern is more severe in sandwich structures with composite face sheets as 
  in-service foreign object impact can cause core damage and affect the load 
  transfer between the face sheets. Damage due to sharp foreign objects such as 
  engine blades, forklifts, etc. can penetrate through one or both the face 
  sheets and result in the core damage. <BR><BR>The proposed research program 
  will develop and verify analytical tools for the optimum design of composite 
  sandwich structures for damage containment. A mathematical method of analysis 
  will be developed rather than a finite element technique. The analytical tool 
  will evaluate if a damage arrestment mechanism is necessary in a sandwich 
  structure. If arrestment mechanism is necessary, the analytical tools will 
  suggest if it is needed in one or both the face sheets. In addition, the 
  analytical tools will recommend the optimum size and spacing of the arrestment 
  mechanism. The software program developed for mathematical analysis will be 
  operational on a personal computer or a workstation. <BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The proposed program will develop and demonstrate the design and 
  analysis techniques that can be used for optimizing sandwich structures. The 
  analytical techniques developed in the proposed program will provide efficient 
  tools that can be used by the aerospace design personnel to design 
  structurally efficient sandwich structures. This will significantly reduce the 
  design time of aerospace structures. <BR><BR>Sandwich structures technology 
  has high potential applications to commercial aircraft. The software will 
  assist in making decisions whether conventional skin/stinger type of 
  construction or sandwich construction is more economical. R-Tec plans to 
  market the software to commercial and military aircraft manufacturers. R-Tec 
  plans to provide support services for the software to the users, maintain the 
  software, and continuously add new capabilities. <BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>ORBITEC proposes to conduct innovative research and development that would culminate in an Aerodynamic Fluid Physics Research Facility (AFPRF) technology demonstration on the International Space Station serving one or more critical experimental needs of the NASA mg Program. The AFPRF would serve as an innovative microgravity apparatus that would virtually eliminate g-jitter and provide a gently controlled acceleration environment. The innovation is based on: the use of a new type of gas-flow generator, an expert system software architecture concept, a non-contact approach for on-orbit position control of spherical liquid samples, and a non-contact fluid motion exciter. Prescribed acceleration levels can be accurately introduced through controlled pulses/oscillations or spin/rotation/vibration of the large and small floating fluid samples. We propose to develop a prototype flight unit to be tested on a reduced-gravity parabolic aircraft in Phase I. In Phase II, we will develop a space-qualifiable AFPRF system that can be used on the International Space Station to satisfy current and future fluid physics flight experiments. The AFPRF would become a powerful research tool with a very low-g, vibrationally isolated, float zone capability combined with a controllable acceleration and disturbance levels that would enhance future fluid physics experiments. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The AFPRF facility would provide the opportunity to conduct fluid physics research experiments in a controlled acceleration, vibrationally-isolated, containerless environment. This environment would be much more conducive to sensitive fluid physics research needs than current approaches. A near-term application of this technology is the study of turbulence in a broad-band spectrum of capillary waves that run around the surface of a containerlessly positioned drop of liquid in microgravity. The use of aerodynamic levitation solves a number of significant complexities present in magnetic, electrostatic, and acoustic approaches. This system would also allow the investigator to control the acceleration levels during the experiment. AFPRF would reduce the need for "quiet time crew scheduling" as research experiments can become independent of crew activities or other vibration generating activities or operations. Many space flight hardware spin-offs of this technology are possible in the microgravity program. Additionally, the gas-flow generator has good potential for development in many terrestrial commercial products including: inertial measurement units, laboratory gas-flow devices, robotic end effectors, EVA-based systems, cooling devices, destructive resonance frequency test devices, microgravity crystal growth systems, ground-based containerless materials processing, resonance frequency educational demonstration devices, biomedical rehab devices, and novel radios. </P>

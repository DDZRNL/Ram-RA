<P><B><b>PROJECT TITLE</b>:</B> Superresolution optical monitor for PVT crystal growth 
experiments 
<P><B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Proposed innovation: Non-invasive, ultra-high resolution 
  instrumentation is needed to monitor crystals grown in microgravity furnaces 
  by Physical Vapor Transport (PVT). We propose an optical Superresolution 
  Crystal Monitor (SCM) capable of reconstructing subwavelength object features 
  that classical imaging systems cannot detect. <BR><BR>Project objectives: The 
  central goal is to show that well-known superresolution methods can be used to 
  monitor samples in microgravity furnaces. These methods are established for 
  use in telescopes, spectrometers, microscopes, and other optical instruments. 
  <BR><BR>Effort proposed: 1) breadboard a Phase I SCM that can be configured in 
  multiple test geometries; 2) implement several prototype SCM systems and test 
  their performance on model PVT crystals; 3) establish and document the 
  best-performing system(s); and 4) verify that critical SCM components can be 
  flight-qualified. <BR><BR>Results anticipated: Phase I determines SCM 
  feasibility by establishing that a flight system can achieve the ultra-high 
  resolution needed to successful monitor PVT crystals during growth. Phase II 
  centers on the design, development, construction, and delivery of a near 
  flight-qualified SCM. <BR><BR>Expected NASA applications: Compound 
  semiconductors grown by PVT processes have critical features as small as 
  several nm. The SCM supports understanding sample health and status for these 
  and other interesting materials grown in microgravity furnaces. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The proposed sensor will be rugged, compact, and suited to 
  deployment in demanding field and industrial environments. As computer chip 
  features and components become extraordinarily minute, the major chip 
  manufacturers will require new, ultra-high resolution instrumentation that 
  exceeds current performance. These trends are well established and are not 
  expected to change. We anticipate that the microcircuit industry will generate 
  an extremely high demand for the SCM. We will work with a partner to produce 
  marketable units. to plant operators in process industries - such as chemical 
  manufacturing and electrical power generation - where any human error results 
  in extremely costly plant down-time. <BR><BR><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B><b>PROJECT TITLE</b>:</B> Chemically Stable 5V Cathode Materials for Lithium and 
Lithium-ion Batteries 
<P><B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Lithium-ion batteries, successfully commercialized by the 
  Japanese, have found an important niche in powering consumer electronics 
  products such as laptop computers and cellular phones. Nonetheless, lithium 
  and lithium-ion batteries with both higher voltage and higher specific 
  energies are required for 21st Century applications by NASA and our domestic 
  aerospace industry. Preliminary work at Covalent has demonstrated that 5V 
  cathode materials with enhanced safety characteristics and improved energy 
  densities may be synthesized by a simple route which is amenable to industrial 
  scale-up. In Phase I we will synthesize, characterize and demonstrate both 
  cycle life and high specific capacities of these novel materials.

<P><B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Stable, high voltage transition metal oxide cathode materials with 
  theoretical specific energies in excess of 1200 Wh/kg are the key to advanced 
  lithium and Li-ion batteries for both military and commercial applications. 
  Such batteries will be employed in portable computers, hand held communication 
  devices, satellites and electric vehicles. <BR><BR><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

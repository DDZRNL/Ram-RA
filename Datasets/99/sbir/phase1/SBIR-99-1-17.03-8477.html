<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) represent a critical technology for both 
aerospace and land based turbine applications. As the need to develop greater 
engine efficiencies in aircraft engines and land-based turbines continues to 
grow, the requirements imposed on TBC applications become increasingly more 
demanding. The development of quantivative design criteria and methods of 
assessing combined material effects becomes more difficult as both the number 
and complexity of potential TBC material constituents expands. This proposal 
Focuses on the development of a simulation based design tool to assist TBC 
designers in assessing the potential performance implications of a given set of 
TBC material design options. This tool will consist of a set of both finite
element modeling modules and a design optimization package, allowing the 
designer to accurately determine the quantitative perfomance of a given TBC 
material system, and adding an additional level of sophistication to the
design process by providing a means of visualizing the development and evolution 
of internal stress fields within a given TBC. The optimization software package 
will promote more rapid determination of optimal design criteria from a given 
set of potential design combinations, and thus promote the development of more 
cost efficient physical testing plans.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   This software system will permit designers for the first time to rapidly visualize the material mechanisms at work in a given TBC system, as well as provide a means of developing an optimized design scheme based on Simulated predictions of the performance of a given set of design options. Simulation based cracking assessment will provide an additional design criteria for predicting potential TBC life. Economically, the proposed design tool will Provide substantial finacial benefit in terms of reducing very costly physical testing, by allowing designers to optimize the physical testing design matrix to maximum efficiency.

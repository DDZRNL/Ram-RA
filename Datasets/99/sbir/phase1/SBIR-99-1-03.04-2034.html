<P>This Phase 1 SBIR Project investigates nonmetallic cooled-composite structures for application to lightweight rocket engine components such as nozzles and ramps. The preform consists of nonpermeable low-expansion tubing that is integrated with a 3D fiber preform tailored for thermal and structural effectiveness. This preform is infiltrated with a structural ceramic matrix selected for high temperature performance in a rocket exhaust environment. Preliminary analysis based on additive property assumptions predicts component weights less than 2lb/ft2. The materials and processing methods are affordable and scalable to launch vehicle engine sizes. Phase 1 effort shall focus on fundamental composite materials properties to support design of lightweight rocket engine components. ESLI shall measure burst pressure and thermal conductivity of composite tubing specimens at ambient temperatures. Selected specimens shall be tested at high temperature. Draft design of a composite nozzle or ramp will be developed including manifolding and substructure connections. Phase 2 would produce hot-fire test coupons for evaluation by NASA and fabrication scale up. </P>

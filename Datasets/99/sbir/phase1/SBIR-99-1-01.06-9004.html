<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 01.06-9004 (Chron: 992324 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Crashworthy Seat Cushion Replacement </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Dynamically certified seats (16g seats) are being fielded in all jet transports certified since 1988. In addition, the airlines are steadily replacing their older seats with 16g compatible seats in the older aircraft certified prior to that date. The implementation of the dynamic seat requirements has encountered one unanticipated problem.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Under normal use, seat cushions must be replaced with identical cushions every 3-5 years, and sometimes sooner.  To maintain an aircraft's type certificate, the replacement seat cushions must be identical those installed for the original certification tests. Airlines are frequently unable to obtain identical replacement cushions. The airlines' only option, in this case, is to recertify the entire seat with a replacement cushion by conducting a full-scale 16g dynamic seat test. This is expensive since it not only requires the use of expensive laboratory equipment, but also because it destroys a seat frame. The best solution for this problem is the development of an inexpensive component test that can be used to certify replacement cushions. Such a test will provide a needed tool for the development of aircraft seats using a systems approach to crashworthiness and thus contribute to both safety and lower costs for the entire industry. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The short-term commercial application of this technology are in the form of an engineering process that will enable JBDA to recertify airline seat cushions, for dynamically tested seats, at a far lower cost than is possible under current certification procedures. In the longer term, the test technique developed in this project will significantly contribute to a systems approach to the design and certification of accident mitigation technologies. </P>

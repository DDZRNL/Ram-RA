<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 08.06-9992 (Chron: 992362 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Advanced Sensor Suite for Robonaut Hand </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) project will demonstrate the feasibility of using fiber-optic sensors on the human-scale robot hand that has been developed by the Robotic Systems Technology Branch at the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC). The fiber-optic sensor approach will provide an innovative way to measure the forces involved with dexterous grasps and power during extra-vehicular activity (EVA) on-board the International Space Station (ISS). The fiber-optic sensors are immune to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and they are extremely small, light weight and easy to install. They can be multiplexed so that at least twelve sensors can be used along a single fiber-optic cable. This will provide a significant reduction in cabling size and weight over conventional strain gauge systems. A miniaturized data acquisition system can be utilized to provide further weight reduction and robustoness when used in the extreme environment of space. This innovation is relevant and important to meeting the technology need of NASA by providing a light weight and technologically improved method to measure force feedback that will provide operator awareness of gripping forces and force moments due to contact with external objects. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>This fiber-optic sensor capability is needed by NASA, DoD, FAA, and DOT. The technology is also needed to mechanical properties by the commercial aviation industry and airline companies. Deepwater drilling and production risers have a need for this technology due to the concern over fatigue failure from VIV that is created from ocean currents. There is a substantial potential for commercialization in developing viable technological improvements over the current methodologies. </P>

<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 04.02-3917 (Chron: 992081 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>High Speed Aero Diesel Demonstrator </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>This proposal outlines the manufacture and testing of a compact, lightweight, direct fuel-injected, sub-scale Aero-Diesel technology demonstrator with an integral turbo-supercharger. This innovative, high-speed, Heavy Fuel Engine (HFE) design achieves a power density of 1 lb./hp. Maximum air breathing is achieved using an integrated turbocharger. The synergistic, compact component arrangement minimizes size, weight, and thermal losses while enhancing propulsion efficiency. The engine delivers 8 power strokes per crank revolution resulting in an efficient, direct drive propeller. This multi-cylinder radial layout has perfect balance and no rocking couples without needing counterweights. The engine has a high firing frequency and low weight from just five dynamic components. The innovative, desmodromic crank mechanism reduces costs, vibration, and propeller noise due to the inherent 2:1 direct output drive. The Technical Objectives include investigating a suitable, high-speed diesel fuel injection and combustion system capable of 5,000 RPM on Jet A and DF-2 kerosene-based fuels. This combined-cycle design uses standard materials and low-cost commercial components and/or parts readily manufactured using CNC machine tools. Demonstration of the sub-scale technology demonstrator during the Phase I effort will ensure success of the full scale, 200 hp. model under Phase II. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The phase I sub-scale technology demonstrator will be introduced to the commercial motor/glider industry for early test flights. Phase II will result in a full-scale, General Aviation Aero Diesel Engine in the 150-200 hp. class.</P>

<P>The compact, modular design lends itself to multi-row radial configurations. One of these configurations defines a 2 row/8 cylinder as a 300-400 hp. module, while a 3 row/12 cylinder layout option is suitable for a 450-600 hp. aviation applications. The overall compact, high power density virtues of the design lend themselves to all commercial applications while retaining low cost due to the minimum components and ease of manufacture. </P>

<B><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b>:</B> 99-1 08.03-9500A (Chron: 990370) 
<P><B><b>PROJECT TITLE</b>:</B> Spectroscopic Humidity Sensor For The Space Station 
<P><B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>We propose to build a portable high speed, accurate, 
  spectroscopically-based water vapor (relative humidity) monitor for use on the 
  Space Station. This instrument would be light-weight, consume minimal power 
  and be user-friendly. It would be capable of measuring water vapor with a 
  signal to-noise of ~300 ppm (± 0.5 K dew point or ± 1 ability to make fast and 
  accurate measurements. This technology offers great advantages in size, 
  weight, accuracy and precision compared to existing technologies such as 
  chilled mirror and capacitance- based hygrometers. <BR><BR><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Possible applications include situations at high temperatures and 
  in 'dirty' environments which include the presence of soot, aerosols, liquid 
  droplets and corrosive gases. The other major application is that of 
  environmental Control such as grain silos, museums and other locations where 
  accurate control of relative humidity is important and low cost is not a 
  particular issue. <BR><BR><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

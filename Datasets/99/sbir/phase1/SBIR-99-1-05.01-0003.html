<BLOCKQUOTE>
  A program for the development of an active control system for controlling 
dynamic stall on rotor blades is proposed. The system utilizes an array of 
pulsed jet actuators near the blade leading edge to control unsteady lift
and flow separation during transient pitch-up. The ability to control these 
processes will alleviate problems which currently limit rotary-wing vehicle 
performance. The control system, which has previously been tested at
low-speed, will be refined and tested on a small-scale rotor blade section 
mounted in a transonic wind tunnel at Ohio State University. The ability to 
control and delay dynamic stall events during oscillatory pitching of 
the model will be evaluated in open-loop experiments. Results from the tests 
will be used to develop parametric scaling laws to aid in designing an actuator 
system for full-scale rotors. The experimental results will be used as 
guidelines for the design of a Phase II prototype control system for large-scale 
testing at flight conditions.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   The performance of both commercial and military rotorcraft will be enhanced through the application of the proposed control system. The system will alleviate rotor blade stall which currently limits high-speed forward flightand produces excessive noise in certain flight regimes. The successful development and application of this control system will result in the design of more versatile and quiet rotorcraft and VSTOL vehicles.

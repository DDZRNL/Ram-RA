<P><B><b>PROJECT TITLE</b>:</B> Electrostatically Focussed TWT for Space Communications 

<P><B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is a significant and growing NASA requirement for small 
  efficient space communications amplifiers in the range of five- to 50-watts at 
  20 GHz and above. These powers are too high for solid state technology. 
  Traveling wave tubes, on the other hand, are not very efficient at these low 
  power levels as currently constructed. Also, their price per-watt is high, as 
  is their size and weight per-watt. We propose to close this technology gap 
  with a revolutionary miniature TWT design that can be constructed for under a 
  few hundred dollars and utilizes cathode ray tube design and assembly 
  technology. It will be electrostatically focussed and use a ladder-type slow 
  wave circuit. Feasibility will be tested in PHASE I using sophisticated 
  computer modeling tools for the RF and focusing structures. A prototype beam 
  tester will be constructed to analyze beam- focussing parameters and a slow 
  wave structure will be constructed and cold tested. The objective is to 
  determine </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Rapidly expanding commercial demand for high data rate 
  communications makes this a timely innovation for both terrestrial as well as 
  satellite applications. High-resolution video and high-speed internet require 
  more bandwidth and higher frequencies. Video telephones and HDTV will require 
  simultaneous transmission over many channels. These applications are pushing 
  up bandpass, power and frequency requirements above what existing technology 
  is able to offer. The proposed amplifier offers a low cost solution.

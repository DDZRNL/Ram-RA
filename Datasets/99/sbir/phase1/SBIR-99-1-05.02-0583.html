<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Present pressure sensitive paint (PSP) measurement approaches are limited in 
speed or accuracy by the presently vailable CCD camera. This lack of pressure 
measurement accuracy vs time curtails hypersonic wind tunnel effectiveness for 
creating accurate design models for avionics. While manufacturers make fine 
cameras for many cientific applications, pressure sensitive paint, a flourescent 
technology, puts unusual constraints on the camera.  Shot noise, caused by the 
limited number of photons that a CCD camera can process per frame, is the issue. 
The lourescent photons produced by the PSP are inversely proportional to the 
pressure. Accuracy is worse where you ant it most, at high pressures. The 
optimum solution for reduced noise is to gather more photons (signal). 
Of the hree ways to do this, 1.a brighter light source will destroy the paint. 
2. Frame-frame addition lowers effective uantum efficiency and is too slow. 3. 
MOSAD©, for Multiplexed OverSample Analog to Digital converter, a new, 
innovative, imaging approach from Amain solves this problem: The oversample 
approach collects more hotons per unit time to achieve required accuracy, and 
the imaging process is continuous with no dead time so ransient phenomena can be 
recorded. This proposed development can be the first of many imaging solutions
throughout NASA based on the new MOSAD © concept.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   This project has direct commercial applications for military, government, and industrial applications. The product ill be a new Digital Video Camera chip competing to fill some of the sockets now filled by CCD camera chips.This project will provide the design. Manufacturing will be outsourced. Distribution will be accomplished in house.  Amain will market a device with improved sensitivity, continuous digital video imaging and snapshots, designed for use with a computer, at lower cost than the digital snapshot camera on the market today.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The objective of the proposed program is to develop a catalytic system for 
efficient conversion of carbon dioxide and hydrogen to carbon monoxide and steam 
(reverse water-gas shift). The technical objectives will be achieved by 
optimizing both the catalyst material and process operating conditions. Alumina 
and metal oxide supported copper has been shown to be an effective catalyst for 
the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, but investigations of copper 
exchanged zeolite catalysts have not been reported. Given the unique 
characteristics of aluminosilicates as a catalyst support, the application of 
copper exchanged zeolites to RWGS catalysis possesses a high probability of 
demonstrating unprecedented activity and selectivity. Copper exchanged catalysts 
of zeolite Y and ZSM-5 will be tested for RWGS activity, and variables such as 
inclusion of alkali promoters, CO2:H2 feed ratio, and temperature will be 
optimized. The incentive for this project is to provide a simple, cost-effective 
method for the condensation of potable water from an otherwise uninhabitable 
Martian atmosphere. Additionally, potential application of the same technology 
to terrestrial chemical industry provides an excellent opportunity for 
procurement of Phase III funding.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Highly active and selective catalysts discovered under this contract will be immediately applicable toward terrestrial CO2 remediation efforts and environmentally responsible production of CO. Carbon monoxide is a valuable raw material utilized for the industrial production of many commodity chemicals including methanol, formaldehyde, and acetic acid. The RWGS reaction is very likely to prove an economically competitive route to conventional carbon monoxide formation processes.

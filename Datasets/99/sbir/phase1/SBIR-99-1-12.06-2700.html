<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 12.06-2700 (Chron: 992576 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>A Wide Area Soil Moisture Measuring System Using Commercial VHF/UHF Signals </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>An innovative, wide-area, multi-method, multi-frequency groundwave system capable of measuring the average value of absolute soil moisture from the surface down to approximately 10 cm using commercial VHF/UHF radio, television and possibly GPS signals is described. Our innovation lies in using a combination of methods operating at different frequencies to accurately determine the constitutive parameters of the ground and hence the absolute surface volumetric soil moisture. The work proposed will determine the best combination of methods and frequencies as well as data links to meet the accuracy and resolution goals to economically provide the wide area coverage. The resulting system will provide for near-real time monitoring of soil moisture over a resolution cell of 20 by 20 km to validate the L-band satellite-borne radiometer, at an estimated not-to-exceed acquisition cost of $7.50 per square km. </P>
<hr>
<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The system envisioned may be suitable for use by farmers to assess the volumetric moisture content of surface soil in their fields and within their crops. Other government agencies, such as USDA, NOAA and DOD are interested in remote sensing of soil moisture, snow moisture and detection of near-surface buried objects. </P>

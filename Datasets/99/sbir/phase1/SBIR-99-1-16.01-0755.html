<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 16.01-0755 (Chron: 992248 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Efficient, Ultrastable 1Watt Laser using Ytterbium Fiber Amplifier </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>A space-qualifiable laser with extraordinary frequency stability, small size, and high efficiency is required for proposed metrology systems. Nonplanar ring oscillators (NPROs) are the baseline technology for these systems.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>NPROs can reach the 1-Watt power required for proposed systems. However, we believe that a system built around a single, high-power NPRO is not the best design. An approach which will have lower linewidth, and lower power consumption, is a low-power NPRO amplified to a power of 1-Watt and greater by an Ytterbium-doped fiber amplifier (YDFA.) </P>

<P>The advantages of an oscillator / amplifier configuration, compared to the conceptually simpler high-power oscillator, are that the frequency stability of lower-power oscillators is better than that of higher-power oscillators, and that Ytterbium fiber amplifiers are about twice as efficient as Neodymium oscillators, primarily because they do not require active cooling of pump diodes. An amplified system would have the good linewidth of the low-power NPRO, but with the low power consumption of the Ytterbium fiber amplifier. The goal of the proposed research program would be to experimentally demonstrate a laser source with the power, frequency stability and efficiency needed for use in a space-borne interferometer. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>There are two major in-space applications for highly coherent lasers with output powers near 1 Watt. The first is interferometry, such as for gravitational wave detection or precision distance measurement. An important likely commercial application which needs an almost identical laser source is satellite-to-satellite coherent communication.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The Teledesic "internet in the sky" program will probably use coherent 1.064-µm optical inter-satellite links.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>For a coherent communication link, each of these links would have one high-power source for the transmitter and one low-power source for the receiver local oscillator. Each source would be based on an NPRO oscillator. The high-power sources would be NPRO lasers amplified by YDFAs. The laser source for the communication laser would be essentially identical with the interferometry source. The Teledesic system is expected to require over one thousand such lasers. By using an identical architecture for its system, NASA will get a more reliable product less expensively than if it developed a laser meeting only the unique needs of NASA. </P>

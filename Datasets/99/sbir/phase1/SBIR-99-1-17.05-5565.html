<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 17.05-5565 (Chron: 991565 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>A High Isp Hall Thruster for Advanced In-Space Propulsion </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>Ambitious near Earth and interplanetary missions require long life, high efficiency, high Isp primary propulsion. To address this need, Busek proposes to develop a Hall thruster with increased performance, reduce mass, reduced complexity and lower cost over state-of-the-art ion propulsion systems. In Phase I, using an existing nominally 2 kW thruster we propose to evaluate several innovative methods of achieving high efficiency, high Isp performance, </P>
<P>including two-stage thruster concepts. Also in Phase I we will design a two-stage magnetics thruster to be built and tested in Phase II. Achieving the targeted 3200 sec Isp, 100 mN thrust at 2.3 kW thruster input power will result in a significant reduction in propulsion system wet mass at higher thrust density than grided ion engines. </P>

<P>In Phase II, the most promising approach for achieving the targeted performance will be selected for further optimization. At the conclusion of Phase II, Busek will deliver to NASA an advanced laboratory prototype thruster for independent performance testing. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>A high Isp, high efficiency Hall thruster will find application as primary propulsion to perform aggressive space science and near earth missions, including orbit topping, repositioning and station keeping. The two-stage thruster concept can be applied over a wide range of thruster powers including very high power (&gt;50 kW) Hall thrusters for affordable in-space transportation. In addition, the high Isp Hall thruster can achieve keV level ion energies and find terrestrial uses in ion milling, implantation and etching. </P>

<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 03.06-2624 (Chron: 991906 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>In-Mold Electron-Beam Curing of Large Resin Transfer Molded Composites </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Radius Engineering proposes to develop in-mold electron-beam (e-beam) curing of large, one-piece, integrated composite structures produced by resin transfer molding (RTM). The key to in-mold e-beam curing lies with the unique open lattice tooling structure and materials that have been engineered by Radius to minimized attenuation of the e-beam during curing. The open lattice structure results in a tool that is nearly an order of magnitude lower in density with a concurrent increase in curing efficiency than current tooling approaches. Electron-beam curing of large integrated composite structures is estimated to reduce the cost of these parts by 25 to 50 %. This innovation will help NASA make access to space affordable so the potential for scientific discoveries and for commerce in space can be realized.</P>

<P>The Phase I project will demonstrate feasibility of the e-beam RTM process using Radius' proprietary electron "translucent" tooling materials and structures. </P>

<P>In the Phase II project, the process will be further developed and scaled up to produce large composite structures.  In Phase III, Radius will use the Phase II-developed process to fabricate composite structures for evaluation and for possible flight tests by NASA, along with developing equipment and processes directed towards Radius' commercial customers. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>There is strong commercial demand from Radius' current customers for large, integrated composites formed as a single piece. These customers span a wide range of industries and products including, aerospace (Boeing, Lockheed, Thiokol, etc), automotive (Rexnord, Johnson Controls, Volvo, etc), and recreation (Trek Bicycle, Callaway Golf, Titleist, etc). In addition, Radius' customers include several NASA centers, who can also make use of this technology.</P>

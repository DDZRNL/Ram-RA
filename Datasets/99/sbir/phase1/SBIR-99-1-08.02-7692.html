<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 08.02-7692 (Chron: 991942 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Semi-selective Optical Sensor Arrays for Microbiological Monitoring </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Echo Technologies, Inc. proposes a Phase I program to demonstrate a new type of optical biosensor for monitoring the integrity of water reclamation systems being developed for manned spacecraft. The technical approach departs from the conventional "one-sensor, one-analyte" paradigm and will demonstrate the utility of an array of semi-selective optical transducers to detect classes of microorganisms. This approach is particularly useful when the specific nature of the biological contaminant may not be known in advance. The system operates as a continuous, in-line detector to ensure the proper functioning of water reclamation systems; to monitor biocide efficacy; and to provide an early warning of incipient filter breakthrough, catastrophic failure, or inadvertent contamination. Alternatively, the sensors can be configured as biofilm detectors to monitor in remote, hard to access locations. The sensors offer inherent simplicity, and unlike antibody or DNA probes, require no consumable reagents or sample preparation. The optoelectronic design is modular so that new sensing capability can be added easily and cost effectively. Also, the use of miniature, off-the-shelf integrated optical and electronic components ensures low power requirements and system reliability. These features will result in more </P>
<P>effective use of disinfection and will minimize overall manning and expertise requirements. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The proposed sensor array can be used by the Armed Forces to verify the integrity of source waters, and by state and local municipalities to ensure the safety of public water supplies from natural contamination or terrorist act.</P>

<P>Commercial applications include food safety (e.g., meat and dairy processing), semiconductor fabrication (where ultrahigh purity water is a necessity) and in biotechnology processing. The sensors can also be reconfigured for use as biofilm detectors to monitor microbially induced corrosion (MIC) in power plants, industrial processing.</P>

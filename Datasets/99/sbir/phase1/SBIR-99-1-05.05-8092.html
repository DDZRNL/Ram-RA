<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>An innovative effort to incorporate the dynamic assessment of risk in the knowledge-base closed-loop control of flow calculations is proposed. Example control decisions involve changing flow solving parameters or restarting from previous checkpoints to reduce the need for manual monitoring and intervention. One significance of the proposed innovation is a formal, rigorous, yet practical KB means to dynamically control the execution of CFD codes by interpreting solution metrics within the context of larger project-related factors. Such factors include but are not limited to the desired solution fidelity, resource limitations such as budget and time, and related previously completed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses. We also propose innovative work to begin the design and development of tools to help characterize and predict the benefits of employing particular knowledge-based (KB) technologies that are intended to improve the CFD process. Currently, the CFD community lacks the means to gather and analyze the information needed to decide if and how to use any CFD-KB technology. A significance of this second innovation is to provide CFD users a means to assess the potential benefits of employing different KB technologies, such as the proposed KB control of flow calculations. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The need for tools to help reduce CFD analysis cycle times, improve the quality of results, and to predict the benefits of using assistive KB technologies is sorely needed. Currently, CFD engineers spend a significant amount of time "babysitting" simulations. They also, at times, must also consult others having detailed knowledge about the use of codes. KB technologies and systems have matured sufficiently to be capable of employing complex domain knowledge to dynamically monitor and adjust simulation activities. Having this capability helps reduce the need to manually watch flow simulations. It also helps facilitate the rapid transfer of emerging CFD technologies to the commercial sector by reducing the need to consult experts. Automating some of the knowledge and strategies for deciding how codes should run and adjusted helps to increase the likelihood of reaching an acceptable result sooner rather than later. </P>

<P>These aspects combined with tools to help the CFD community assess the benefits of using KB technologies suggests that there is a strong potential for extending the results of a successful Phase I effort into commercially viable applications. This view is based on expressed interest by knowledgeable and experienced practitioners in the CFD community. </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>For propulsion related applications, materials must be able to demonstrate excellent ablation and oxidation resistance at temperature approaching 3500?C, adequate load bearing capabilities, non-catastrophic failure modes, and ability to withstand transient thermal shock. Advanced Ceramics Research, Inc. (ACR) has developed low cost, flexible-manufacturing processes for Zr &amp; Hf-based carbon fiber reinforced composites, materials with good oxidation and ablation resistance up to 3500ºC. This process, called Continuous Composite Co-extrusion (C3), incorporates carbon fibers to fabricate 'in-situ' carbide and boride-matrix/carbon fiber composites. In this Phase I program, ACR proposes an innovative solid freeform form fabrication (SFF) approach to produce Hf and Zr based ceramic composite components reinforced with continuous carbon fiber tows for critical structural components such as tubes and blisks. The process is simple, robust and will be widely applicable to a number of material systems. In this program, ACR will collaborate with Professor Jack Gillespie at the Center for Composite Materials at University of Delaware (UD), who has been a principal contributor to the development of non-autoclave curing and fabrication of polymer matrix composites. In phase I, UD will assist in fabricating 2-D composite panels at UD. ACR will perform mechanical testing and microscopy on the panels. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The solid freeforming of 'green' continuous fiber ceramic composite by the co-extrusion process along with non-autoclave curing for final consolidation will lead to a low cost processing technique for fabrication of continous fiber ceramic composites (CFCCs). This will make CFCCs very attractive for use in propulsion related applications. </P>

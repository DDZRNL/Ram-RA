<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Non-Flammable Hydrophobic Aerogel Composite Insulation for Cryogenic Storage </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>In contrast to conventional hydrophobic aerogels that are flammable, Aspen proposes to develop hydrophobic / non-flammable reinforced composite aerogel insulation for numerous applications where both humidity and high oxygen atmosphere are present. Recent preliminary tests at Aspen demonstrated that a halocarbon compound used as a doping ingredient during the silica aerogel preparation has great potential for satisfying both requirements. Detailed material characterization and performance evaluation in terms of hydrophobic property, non-flammability and thermal insulation will be conducted. In Phase II, this and other means of achieving the dual objectives will be further explored. Flight qualification testing and production scaleup (utilizing Aspen's 1000 liter pilot plant to be installed by September 2000 under a separate project) will also be accomplished in Phase II. This product, if successfully developed, will be an excellent substitute for the expensive and cumbersome vacuum-jacketed Multi Layer Insualtion (MLI) for cryogenic insulation as well as other applications. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>Successful completion of this project will lead to a widespread use of aerogel insulation in cryogenic to medium high temperature applications where the insulation might be exposed to humidity or water and non-flammability of the insulation (especially in oxygen rich atmosphere) is important. The applications will include aerospace, automotive and marine, medical, food processing, chemical processing, cryogenic storage and transport, skylights and appliances. </P>

<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>A Refractory Composite X-33 Thrust Chamber </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>Lightweight, lower life-cycle cost and increased performance for next generation space propulsion systems such as ucooled thrust chambers and nozzles are essential to achieve the goals of the Access to Space Initiative.</P>
<P>The weight of the X-33 thrust chamber now made in silicated columbium can be reduced by at least 75% when constructed in SiC/SiC composites as well as providing increased temperature performance. A team of MER and Aerojet proposes to optimize reinforcement architecture in SiC/SiC composites that have five times the thermal conductivity of state-of-the-art SiC/SiC which dramatically reduces thermal stresses including investigating matrix doping with ZrC to minimize nozzle erosion and increase operation temperature and performance. The composite properties will be modeled to design an X-33 thrust chamber which will be fabricated in Phase I for test in Phase II. </P>

<P><B><b>PROJECT TITLE</b>:</B> A detachable heat switch for ADRs 
<P><B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Energen, Inc. proposes to develop and demonstrate a high 
  conductance detachable thermal link for operation at sub-Kelvin temperatures 
  using high force, long stroke cryogenic magnetostrictive actuators. Such 
  mechanical heat switches are an important component for calorimeters and 
  adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators (ADRs) which are increasingly being 
  considered for instrumentation and detector cooling. In Phase I of this 
  effort, Energen will design, build and test a prototype heat switch for 
  sub-kelvin operation based on magnetostrictive materials.

<P><B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mechanical heat switches are a critical component of sub-kelvin 
  refrigeration systems such as ADRs. An efficient, high conductance switch 
  enables more efficient heat flow and disengagement and thereby reduces the 
  number for cascaded stages of refrigeration required to achieve a desired 
  cooling capability. ADRs are a critical component on such space missions as 
  the upcoming Constellation-X mission and future space telescopes such as STEPS 
  where the detectors and instruments are being cooled to sub-kelvin 
  temperatures to increase their sensitivity. <BR><BR>Heat switches can be used 
  in cryocooler systems to reduce the cooling time by using the higher capacity 
  of upper stages. Present solution are not detachable and therefore represent a 
  continuous heat leak to the lower stages thereby reducing net cooling 
  capacity. <BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Visidyne proposes to satisfy NASA's requirements for smart, small, rugged, 
inexpensive gas sensors with wide dynamic range by developing a mass 

spectrometer system that contains significant innovations relating to ionization 

efficiency, focusing, and vacuum hardware. Visidyne projects that the accuracy 

(estimated 3r) and dynamic range (10e6 for one second integration time) 

are as good or better than those of very expensive systems. The proposed mass 

spectrometer system is rugged enough for space applications and inexpensive 

enough that a sizeable market for the instrument exists.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   The advantages of a mass spectrometer based system are (1) the dynamic range 

available, and (2) the versatility,in that the system can be reprogrammed to 

monitor different species as requirements change. The proposed instrument will 

find a sizeable market because of its light weight, low cost, and ruggedness. In 

addition to NASA applications, we have identified universities as a viable 

market (in the thousands), along with industrial process monitoring, and 

possible use in explosive or chemical agent detection and monitoring.

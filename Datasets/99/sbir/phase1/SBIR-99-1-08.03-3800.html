<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 08.03-3800A (Chron: 991646 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Carbon Dioxide Compressor for Air Revitalization System </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>The advanced air revitalization system for the International Space Station will include a system to recover oxygen from carbon dioxide removed from cabin air. To maximize the benefit of oxygen generation from carbon dioxide, a compact and efficient vacuum pump, or compressor, is needed to remove carbon dioxide from a molecular sieve and store it in an accumulator. We propose to develop a high-pressure ratio compressor for this task using Creare's diaphragm technology. The innovation is a multi-stage diaphragm compressor that meets NASA's requirements for CO2 pumping and is compact, efficient, and highly reliable. In Phase I we prove the feasibility of the CO2 compressor by (1) demonstrating in the laboratory that a diaphragm compressor can perform as a high-pressure ratio vacuum pump, and (2) developing a conceptual design for a compressor that is sized for service in the advanced air revitalization system. In Phase II we will develop, test, and deliver a complete prototype compressor. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The proposed compressor is compact, efficient, and highly reliable. There are numerous applications for the compressor beyond the International Space Station. Commercial applications for the compressor include heat pumps and low-cost, closed-cycle Joule-Thomson cryocoolers for communications and medical applications. The basic technology can also be used for portable and aerospace power systems. Other government applications include cryocoolers for IR sensors, HTS electronics, and spacecraft cryocoolers. </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>Hydrazine and monomethylhydrazine are used in large quantities by the military and aerospace industries as rocket fuels. These are highly toxic and carcinogenic materials and their presence must be constantly monitored to insure safety of the workers. This proposal will focus on the use of electrochemiluminescence for the rapid detection of these materials. In electrochemiluminescence, light is generated at an electrode surface from the reaction between an electrochemically produced species and a coreactant. In one form of electrochemiluminescence, intense emission is observed from the reaction between an oxidized form of an organic ruthenium complex and a strong reducing agent, such as hydrazine. The light emitting ruthenium complex is continuously being regenerated at the electrode surface and emission continues until the coreactant is consumed. The ability to continuously recycle the light emitting species is a superior advantage over conventional chemiluminescence where the light emitting reagents are consumed and must be replaced. Immobilization of the ruthenium complex directly on to the electrode surface, through the use of molecular self assembly, will be explored in an effort to reduce the need of extensive pumping. This proposal will also address the limit of detection, response time, selectivity, and immunity from interferants. </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>Benefits include: the development of rapid, fieldable, inexpensive sensors for the detection of hazardous vapors by electrochemiluminescence. Applications of this development are: monitoring of process and production facilities for the chemical, pharmaceutical, and agricultural industries. Also this method might be applied to the detection of explosives and the location of land mines for humanitarian demining efforts, and for law enforcement and security efforts. </P>

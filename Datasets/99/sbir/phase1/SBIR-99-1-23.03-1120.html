<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The innovation proposed by MACRO Analysis, L.L.C. (hereafter referred to as MA) 
is an automated system for modeling incongruent interfaces in finite element 
analyses. This system will support assembly of component parts, interfacing of 
incompatible fields of finite elements, local-global analysis; automated mesh 
refinement, and coupling of multi-physics analyses. The innovation will directly 
support SBIR Task 23.03 Modeling, Simulation, and Asynchronous Technologies for 
Life-Cycle Integration, Validation, and Distributed Collaboration by improving 
the responsiveness of the analysis subsystem. It will also enable development of 
an advanced software architecture for the analysis subsystem of the ISE that 
will allow simulation systems to be quickly assembled and tailored for specific 
vehicles or missions. The proposed development is a critical path technology for 
an intelligent analysis subsystem that supports the ISE. The automated system 
for modeling incongruent interfaces is enabling technology for a robust analysis 
system that will allow the ISE to attain the goal of reducing design time by 50%.

   MACRO Analysis has identified a significant opportunity for impacting the product development environment by providing rapid simulation tools for design and collaboration. The tools MACRO envisions will comprise set of integrated solutions for product development and simulation centered on the proven FEA technology of NASTRAN. This set of CAE tools will provide the foundation for an intelligent analysis system that will enable companies to utilize their intellectual capital to deliver better products faster. The technology developed as a result of this SBIR effort, coupled with our existing FEA product, MI/NASTRAN, will form the basis for this integrated suite of analysis tools.

<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 04.01-7808 (Chron: 991439 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Aircraft Landing and Obstacle Avoidance for General Aviation </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>To improve pilot situational awareness and aid the pilot in decision making in all weather landing conditions, WaveBand proposes to develop an innovative aircraft landing and obstacle avoidance (ALOA) system for the general aviation market. With a target price of 5,000 dollars, the system design fits within the AGATE goal of a 100,000-dollar aircraft. The system will make use of WaveBand's slim profile scanning millimeter wave antenna, low cost radar components derived from the automotive industry and low cost processor derived from Marconi Astronics (formerly Lear Astronics Corporation) ALG. The system will display images on a low cost HUD, such as that under development by Crew Systems. </P>

<P>Toward the stated objective, WaveBand, using its existing relationship with Marconi Astronics will analyze the operational scenario, develop system requirements and specifications, design a system to be demonstrated in Phase II, look at installation and certification issues, and estimate system production costs. Once implemented the</P>
<P>proposed system will greatly advance the utility and safety of general aviation. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>Commercial applications of the ALOA are in the instrumentation for general aviation aircraft, including helicopters. </P>

<P>Genetic Search -based Robust Controllers for Microgravity Vibration Isolation </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of using genetic search methods for the design of a fixed-order robust controller for the microgravity isolation system. The microgravity isolation system is a good application for mixed H2/H-infinity robust control, and a fixed-order controller is desirable from an implementation standpoint. Several authors have presented numerical algorithms for finding fixed-order H2/H-infinity controllers, but these algorithms have not been entirely satisfactory due to the complex nature of the algorithms. Thus, the potential of this type of control has been difficult to exploit. Genetic search methods are an emerging technology useful for highly nonlinear, discontinuous, and non-convex design optimization problems. These techniques can provide a superior approach for synthesizing fixed-order robust controllers. A fixed-order robust controller could provide substantially improved performance over existing controllers, implying that microgravity experiments and processes would be at less risk. Phase I will establish the feasibility of the concept. Phase II research will produce a complete design environment for the synthesis of fixed-order, mixed H2/H-infinity controllers. This design environment will be commercialized. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>A fixed-order dynamic compensator design methodology has numerous applications is flight control and process control. Vibration isolation technology has widespread applications in industry. Motion sensor calibration and industrial metrology are two such applications. Communication technology can also use the vibration isolation methods developed under this project. </P>

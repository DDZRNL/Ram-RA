<BLOCKQUOTE>
We will develop an integrated test of postural control, oculomotor control and 
dynamic visual acuity that can be applied to conditions involving whole-body 
perturbation that are common in aerospace operations and in the activities of 
daily living. Our dynamical sensorimotor assessment test (DSAT) is innovative in 
that (a) it can be applied under controlled laboratory conditions as well as in 
simulated operational conditions, (b) it is commensurate with common practices 
and procedures in optometry and neurology, and (c) it allows for differentiation 
between ophthalmic and neuromuscular causes of impaired dynamic acuity. These 
unique characteristics of our innovative test are relevant to Topic 08.02, Human 
Health Monitoring and Countermeasures, because they can enhance "understanding 
of the effects of microgravity and other components of the space environment on 
the physiological systems of the body" by allowing for standardizable 
quantification of visual acuity and coordination of the associated neuromuscular 
systems through "novel software methods for documentation, storage, retrieval, 
analysis and diagnosis of crew health." Moreover, by enhancing diagnostic 
differentiation and generality, our innovative test can support the development 
of "countermeasures against deleterious changes in body systems in flight or 
upon return to the ground [including]... post-flight reduction in neuromuscular
coordination."

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   - Flightdeck controls & display design and evaluation within NASA HEDS R&D <br><br>
- Use in Biomedical research to provide valuable information on the functional 
consequences of such sensory and motor disorders in medical specialties ranging 
from ophthalmology to neurology. <br><br>
- Screen aviators for the effects of medications, the effects of environmental 
stressors (hyper-g, sound), the effect of fatigue, and the efficacy of training 
countermeasures within both DoD aviation and Commercial aviation. <br><br>
- Screen elderly or physically challenged drivers during DMV testing; screen 
commercial drivers for the effects of medications, the effects of environmental 
stressors(vibration, sound), and the effects of fatigue. <br><br>
- Supplement testing battery within ophthalmology and optometry to better 
determine appropriate treatments for those with challenged dynamic visual 
acuity. <br><br>
- Bundle with currently existing devices used for diagnosis or rehabilitation in 
the various medical specialties concerned with oculomotor control or postural 
control (e.g., neurology, otology, physical therapy, occupational therapy, 
osteopathy, and geriatrics).

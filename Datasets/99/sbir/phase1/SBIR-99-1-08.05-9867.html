<P>NASA's present Portable Life Support System (PLSS) for extravehicular activity uses a conventional water pump requiring maintenance every 180 hours, not practical on long manned missions such as a Mars mission. A pump using smart materials, having essentially no moving parts, could operate for a long time without maintenance. A Terfenol-D magnetostrictive pump, built in 1997 by SatCon, was quiet and robust, but too large for the next generation PLSS. Spinix Corp. proposes to use NiMnGa, a new magnetic shape memory alloy, instead of Terfenol-D, to build a smaller water pump, 4.5" long and 2.5" in diameter, pumping 30 ml/sec at 5 psi, and consuming 20 watts of electric power. In Phase I, we will grow a NiMnGa rod of the required size (1.5" long and 0.5" in diameter) and properties. Free strains of 5% at 4000 oersteds have already been demonstrated by Robert O'Handley of MIT, who will be a consultant on this project. A pump will be designed using the measured properties of the NiMnGa rod, and the experience gained from the Terfenol-D pump, whose principal investigator Michael Gerver will be hired by Spinix for this project. A self-contained pump will be completed in Phase II. </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>A magnetic shape memory alloy pump similar to this one would be useful in remote locations where maintenance is difficult. At larger output power, for which ohmic losses would be less important, a magnetic shape memory alloy pump could compete with conventional pumps in size and efficiency, for example in hydraulic shipboard pumps,and in manufacturing and process control. </P>

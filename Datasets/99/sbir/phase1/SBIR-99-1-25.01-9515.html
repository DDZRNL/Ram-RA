<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Measurement of debris cloud parameters following HVI penetration of MLI using op </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>The significance of this innovation is the development of a high-speed digital camera system and technique to image Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) debris clouds caused by hyper-velocity impacts (HVI) of meteoroid and orbital debris. The data from these images can be used for the development of penetration equations and more accurate damage models for MLI ejecta. Imaging MLI debris clouds through traditional techniques, flash radiographs, has never been conducted since MLI is an extremely lightweight material (low density), and is not amenable to being imaged with flash X-rays. This innovation addresses the objectives of SBIR 99-1 Subtopic 25.01, Space Environment Effects and Contamination. Large Optical systems such as Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) are expected to employ large solar shades constructed with MLI that will be impacted hundreds times over their life span by Micrometeoroids and Orbital Debris (MOD). The degradation to the optical components and the residual performance of these systems can not be adequately calculated without accurate damage models and characterization of the environment effects of MLI debris. The proposed imaging system and technique would facilitate and allow the collection of the data to develop more accurate damage models, and help to ascertain the contamination effects of MLI debris. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>With the increasing number of satellites in orbit, governments and commercial enterprises rely heavily upon protection of these valuable assets. There are many satellites that are currently in orbit that use MLI for both thermal shielding and collision protection. By the year 2000, USSPACECOM estimates that the U.S will spend more than $250 billion in space efforts and an additional 1,800 satellites will be in orbit by the end of the next decade. Furthermore, as the monetary cost of space utilization increases, insurance companies are interested in insuring that the satellites have sufficient protection from MOD so the likelihood of a large claim is reduced. At the same time, the cost to place any additional weight, such as increased protection systems, is very great. With the rapid growth in earth observing satellites for resource management, satellites incorporating optical elements such as cameras and telescopes can be adversely affected by deposition of such contaminants. This research will provide, for the first time, data on the type and distribution of contaminants formed from the penetration of MLI. As this data is understood, engineers can better design satellites to operate in the expected environment, mitigating the effects of MLI debris contamination. </P>

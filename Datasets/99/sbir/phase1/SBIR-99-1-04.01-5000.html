<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 04.01-5000 (Chron: 992610 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>SATSNet an Extranet for the Nation's Small Airports </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>A critical barrier for GA to serve as viable fast personal transportation is the lack of a uniform, yet open-growth, travel information infrastructure. Dynamic Systems Integration's (DSI) vision is to create an innovative small airport-based information system for the 21st century GA traveler - SATSNet will serve as a vital enabler for NASA's General Aviation Transportation Vision. DSI will use its network expertise to first create a standard small airport software and hardware package. The main technical element will be an airport to community dynamic information structure allowing remote hotel, car attraction information &amp; reservations, as well as current weather (voice, graphics or text) </P>

<hr>
<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>Commercial applications include the installations at most of the 5,000 GA airports in the country. This product will also be designed for use by airport and community businesses. Spin offs may include other software &amp; hardware applications related to GA travel. DSI estimates sales revenues of $5 Million per year upon launching Phase III commercialization. </P>

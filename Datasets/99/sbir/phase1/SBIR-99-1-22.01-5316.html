<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>Space Photonics, Inc. proposes the development of a miniature radiation tolerant, IEEE 1394, fiber optic transceiver multi-chip module with three redundant links for use in government and commercial spacecraft applications. The current 1394 commercial implementation uses a copper twisted shielded pair cable in its Physical Layer. The preliminary IEEE 1394B standard for commercial fiber optic interfaces specifies non-radiation tolerant devices. Our innovation replaces this unacceptable commercial Physical Layer with redundant, radiation tolerant, integrated fiber-optic transceivers capable of data rates from 200 Mbps to 3.2 Gbps that are more compatible with low power spacecraft applications. Our design approach follows the planned evolution of the IEEE 1394B standard toward higher speed fiber optic interfaces, while providing space-grade physical layer components by following the guidelines in the new IEEE 1393 Standard for Spaceborne Fiber Optic Data Busses. We will also investigate porting the COTS ICs to a rad-hard foundry, which is required for space-flight worthy 1394 interfaces. The fiber-optic Physical Layer will eliminate the RFI and EMI problems common to copper cabling; and, our use of advanced microelectronics and optoelectronics packaging technologies significantly reduces the size, weight, power and cost of on-board subsystem interface electronics. </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>Our advanced high speed 1394 fiber optic network transceivers are primarily intended for the commercial and government spacecraft markets, and not intended to compete in the terrestrial commercial market. The key benefit is to the satellite systems integrators requiring much higher data transfer rates, ease of integration and test, and lower costs. Through our collaboration with Litton and Orlando &amp; Associates, Inc., our commercialization plan targets customers that include ITT, Loral, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, TRW, Hughes, and Ball Aerospace. Our estimate for spaceborne fiber optic and free-space laser communications markets over the next 10 years is between $500M and $1B. </P>

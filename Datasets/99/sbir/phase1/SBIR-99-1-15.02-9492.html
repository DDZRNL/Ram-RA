<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 15.02-9492 (Chron: 991813 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Superconducting Tunnel Junction Arrays on Membranes for Imaging X-Ray Detectors </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>Superconducting tunnel junction X-ray detectors provide high energy resolution (2eV at 70eV, 29eV at 6 keV), high count-rate capability (&gt;10,000 cts/sec) and the ease of use of conventional preamplifiers. They provide a unique set of capabilities unmatched by other detectors that make them attractive for a variety of uses in X-ray microanalysis and astrophysics. In this project we propose to radically improve our devices by developing STJ detectors on thin membranes. If successful, this should almost entirely eliminate the substrate events observed with these devices and improve our overall signal to noise ratio. The design of the detectors developed in this project would provide the foundation of our proposed architecture for large imaging arrays of X-ray spectrometers interfaced to conventional preamplifiers. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The large area, high count-rate capability, high energy resolution, and ease of use of the proposed detectors will make them uniquely suited for commercial application in X-ray microanalysis in SEMs and for X-ray fluorescence. In these applications, these devices will yield about an order of magnitude improvement in resolution over conventional detectors, easily allowing the resolution of X-rays lines of light elements, while providing performance that is otherwise comparable. </P>

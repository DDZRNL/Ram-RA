<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 08.04-1856 (Chron: 992181 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>CERL: The Complex Event Recognition System </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>The Complex Event Recognition Architecture (CERA) provides five major innovations: (1) The Complex Event Description Language (CEDL): a declarative language for describing complex events: that is, events that can occur across time, be sensed from multiple channels, and be composed of the conjunction, disjunction or negation of other complex or simple events; (2) The Complex Event Recognition Language (CERL): a declarative pattern language for recognizing the occurrence of complex events; (3) The Complex Event Recognition Algorithm: an algorithm for recognizing instances of complex events using the Complex Event Recognition Language; (4) CERA software modules for integrating complex event recognition into existing software systems; and (5) CERA software for the display, tracking and management of complex event occurrences.</P>
<P>Significance: CERA allows systems built for robust planning, task execution, operations, and fault recovery to have a rich, unified model of complex events which goes beyond simple telemetric data or propositional forms. People managing complex systems, automated diagnostic reasoners and task planning and execution software can use the CERA software to accurately and richly monitor critical events.</P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The Complex Event Recognition Architecture will provide a flexible, generally applicable software system for describing complex events and recognizing event occurrences. It can be applied to any area of auto-mated control, including life support systems, terrestrial and extraterrestrial planetary exploration, and home and factory control. Other commericial applications will arise wherever complex events occur, including financial markets, automated workflow, and activity on the World Wide Web.</P>

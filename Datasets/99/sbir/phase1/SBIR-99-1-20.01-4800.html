  The proposed innovation combines a unique turbo-coding algorithm, developed by 
NASA-JPL, Nyquist pulse shaping, and a breakthrough in phase-coherent 
modulation, SiQAM, developed by SiCOM. The result will be a high-order 
modulation turbo-coded modem/codec application-specific integrated circuit 
(ASIC) which dramatically improves data capacity on bandwidth-limited and power-
limited data links. SiQAM optimally matches nonlinear high-power amplifier 
(HPA) characteristics to minimize HPA peak power requirements. Turbo-coding, a 
remarkable development in forward-error-correction, substantially improves error 
rate for any received signal-to-noise ratio, and Nyquist waveforms optimally use 
available signal bandwidth. The particular form of turbo-coding proposed herein, 
developed by NASA-JPL, is known as serial concatenated convolutional coding, 
abbreviated as, "SC3," which will also be used in this proposal. Linking these 
complementary breakthrough technologies is in itself an innovative breakthrough 
which reduces the demands on satellite-based HPA technology. In Phase II/III the 
solution will be designed in low-cost integrated circuit technology which will 
dramatically provide very high data rate (622 Mbps) bandwidth- and power-
efficient low-cost digital modem/codecs.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   SiCOM currently competes in the high-speed wireless data market with its state-
of-the-art modulator and demodulator products (BitFLOW), initiated under a 1996 
NASA SBIR project. In the proposed project, SiCOM will prove the feasibility of 
BitFLOW-SC3 (Serial Concatenated Convolutional Coding) modems, through 
simulation. Success in this phase will lead to a comprehensive product 
development program to prototype the BitFLOW-SC3 design in breadboard form, 
first using SiCOM's BitFLOW 2 modulator and demodulators currently in 
development, and an FPGA implementation of the SC3 circuitry, followed by 
development of the BitFLOW-SC3 capability in productized ASIC form, using 
private funding. The contemplated commercial venture will mirror SiCOM's 
BitFLOW modem project, where SiCOM won NASA SBIR Phase I and Phase II contracts, 
and received supplementary funding from SiCOM's own profits and from its 
financial partner. With completion of the proposed SBIR project, SiCOM will push 
the state-of-the-art with new "BitFLOW-SC3," products that will outperform any 
competing product, including BitFLOW, by three to five dB in signal-to-noise 
ratio for comparable error-rate. This success will enable designers to use much 
less costly power amplifiers, dramatically enhancing the viability of the NASA 
architecture in establishing a widespread, high-performance, low-cost role for 
satellite communications for NASA missions and the many commercial systems 
currently implementing the NASA architecture for terrestrial broadband wireless 
access. These products would be used in both space-based (e.g., Spaceway) and 
terrestrial-based communication systems (e.g., Local Multipoint Distribution 
System) that must serve next-generation requirements for high-performance data 
links and data-on-demand. The project will directly support NASA's Direct 
Digitial Distribution (D3) program.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The AMT Chip-In-Board (CIB) electronics packaging concept offers a high 
performance, low-profile thermal management solution for miniaturized, high 
power dissipating electronics products. The tailorable coefficient of 
thermal expansion (CTE) of this passive thermal management approach will also 
allow for high heat producing, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components to be 
integrated into reliability-critical applications, such as military spacecraft 
and avionics products. The advent of faster, higher performance level lectronics 
components, i.e. microprocessors, has resulted in an increasing need for more 
effective means of removing heat from the component. Without adequate thermal 
management, allowing a processor chip, for instance, to operate at temperatures 
higher than its rated limit will result in intermittent logic errors and early 
failure, even sudden, irreversible failure. Conventional thermal management 
methods include heat sinks and heat pipes bonded to the "backside" of the heat-
producing electronic component. This is often a bulky or complex result. The CIB 
approach will allow for a surface mount (SMT) component to be "flipped over" and 
either wirebonded or solder "bumped" to a circuit substrate with a high thermal 
conductivity core. This "flipped" SMT component will be mated directly to the 
core, which will provide a direct pathway for heat to escape.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   The commercial potential for this extends beyond military space and avionics into high power dissipating, size-limited consumer electronics products, such as next generation notebook computers, personal communications devices, and increasingly sophisticated automobile engine, brake, and handling (i.e. accident avoidance, traction control, anti-skid) control electronics.

<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 05.04-0660 (Chron: 991385 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Constrained Layer Piezo Film Composites </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Mid&eacute; is proposing an innovative concept for the reduction of vibration and noise in aircraft. A constrained layer composite where Piezo Film (PVDF) layers are laminated between Aluminum or Fiber Composite layers is proposed. The laminated composite can also include polycore layers that are currently successfully used to reduce noise and vibration in automotive vehicles. Passively the constrained piezo film will increase the transmission loss coefficient across the composite while active/passive shunting techniques are proposed to frequency tailor the loss coefficient of the layered composite. The proposed team has substantial experience in acoustic noise reduction, fabrication of layered Polycore&acirc; composites and active/passive shunting techniques.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Phase I will evaluate the performance improvement offered by the proposed concept over standard composite materials. Performance will be predicted for aircraft vibration reduction, noise reduction, as well as the control of high-frequency aero and aero-acoustic loads. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>Adding the ability to tailor the vibration and noise reduction performance of composites will allow wider use of these, already popular aircraft materials, to more applications. Cost effective reduction of vibration and noise in motor vehicles, air-conditioners, processing plants, ducts, aircraft and spacecraft will be enabled. Operator comfort will be improved, operator and aircraft fatigue will be reduced. Equipment will last longer and require less maintenance without significant increase in acquisition cost. </P>

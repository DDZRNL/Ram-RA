<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Ultra-Compact Heat Exchangers for Space-Borne Cryocoolers </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>Low-temperature cryocooler systems need recuperative heat exchangers with extremely high-thermal effectiveness (0.997 or greater) to achieve cooling in the 10 K range. For space-borne cryocoolers for sensor cooling, these recuperators must also be compact, lightweight, and cause minimal pressure losses in the gas stream. To meet these challenging requirements, we propose to develop a radial flow heat exchanger (RFHX) fabricated from advanced materials. These advanced materials must have an optimal combination of thermal conductivity, strength, and formability to create a highly efficient RFHX recuperator. During Phase I, we will prove the feasibility of an ultra-high efficiency recuperator by (1) demonstrating key steps in the fabrication process using advanced materials, (2) producing a conceptual design of the RFHX, and (3) performing cryocooler system trade studies that demonstrate the performance benefits of advanced materials. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>Advanced materials will enable sensor cryocooling systems that are compact, lightweight, and consume minimal power. Government applications include space-based sensors for reconnaissance and missile-defense systems, aircraft oxygen generating systems, and field hospitals. Commercial applications include oxygen production for medical purposes and laboratory- and industrial-scale cryogenic refrigeration and gas liquefaction systems. </P>

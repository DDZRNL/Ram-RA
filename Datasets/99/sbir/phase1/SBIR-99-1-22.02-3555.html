<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Multifunctionally Integrated Class PB Systems for Precision Space Optics </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>Future class space exploratory missions designed to perform astrometry and produce images of dim, compact stellar objects will be utilizing new approaches to optics where high precision angular resolution and figure control is critical. Under exploration at NASA is the use of the new generation of induced strain actuators that use piezoelectric or electrostrictive polymers, ceramics and composites as integral to attaining ultralight and integrated </P>
<P>astrometric systems meeting astrophysics requirements. This technology is increasingly attractive due to high precision and force displacement characteristics available in lightweight and compact packages. However, the advantages of lightweight, compact and easily attachable/embeddable systems are quickly overshadowed by concerns of structural integrability that requires new volumetric, packaging, power consumption and thermal </P>
<P>emission solutions. Existing technology cannot meet most of the proposed requirements. Recent mission studies by NASA (LaRC, JPL, GSFC and MSFC), TRW, Lockheed, Ball and Raytheon (HDOS) have all identified drive electronics as providing critical technology obstacles. QorTek proposes the new concept of charge retention electronics and associated Class PB actuation systems to meet these challenges. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>he concept of compact lightweight electronics that has extremely low noise/thermal/EMI pollution fills an existing need in many applications under commercial development using induced strain (e.g. piezoelectric or electrostrictive) actuators. QorTek is already exploring applications of this technology with INO (Canada), Raytheon, Ball and </P>
<P>TRW. The ability of the proposed charge retention electronics to operate over long time-intervals with only compact (portable) power supplies to run precision systems is also attractive for many applications. Two important potential commercial spin-offs using compact and/or low profile Class PB systems will be jointly explored with commercial partners. </P>

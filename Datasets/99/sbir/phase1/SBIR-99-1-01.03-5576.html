<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 01.03-5576 (Chron: 992479 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>An integrated, multi-sensor system for cloud particle classification </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Droplet Measurement Technologies proposed to develop a compact, integrated, multi-sensor system for the airborne characterization of cloud icing conditions. This system will measure cloud particle size, number concentration, mass and phase, as well as temperature pressure and airspeed. This combination of measurements allows the system to operate in a stand-alone mode for situations where the instruments could be used on commercial aircraft for gathering data on icing conditons or for icing certification activities. The range of particle</P>
<P>sizes and supercooled water content are broader than currently required by FAA icing certification regulations (FAR-25) and provide excellent resolution at the larger drop sizes that are presently being studied as particularly hazardous for flight operations. The built-in redundancy also improves data quality and operational reliability. </P>

<P>The culmination of Phase I activities will be a prototype instrument consisting of an integration of five sensors into a single, streamlined package that minimizes drag and mounts easily to an aircraft fuselage or wing. This proof-of-concept development will use laboratory testing to show that particles in the proposed size range can be accurately measured and that the integrated system fits in a package that is aerodynamically stable without disturbing the particle measurements. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The proposed system will make measurements that have formerly required three separate systems. The cloud research, aircraft icing and icing wind tunnel communities will benefit from this development because of its decreased volume and weight. This same instrument will be attractive to the agricultural community since it can also be used in a number of applications where measurements of spray characteristics would improve irrigation, crop dusting and other liquid dispersal systems. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The innovation proposed here is the use of carbon thin film cathodes as an 
electron source for electric propulsion for microspacecraft applications. Hall 
and ion thrusters are two types of electric propulsion systems that are commonly 
used on earth-orbiting spacecraft and very recently on interplanetary probes. 
These propulsion systems use hollow cathodes to thermionically emit electrons 
that are used for propellant ionization and ion beam neutralization. These 
cathodes require propellants and heaters that place lower limits on their size 
and power scalability and efficiency. Field emission cathodes compatible with 
electric propulsion systems will fill voids in electric propulsion technology 
that are needed for deep-space microspacecraft applications. Other field 
emission electron sources such as metal microtip cathodes are unstable and 
strongly susceptible to damage in the thruster ion environment. Preliminary 
tests on carbon film cathodes show them to be much more robust. We propose to 
demonstrate the feasibility of using carbon cathodes in electric propulsion 
systems for microspacecraft applications.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   NASA is concerned about obtaining electron sources for specific thruster applications. This market itself will be significant, especially in view of the fact that these sources will also be ideal for space tether applications to propel or decelerate satellites to and from orbit. The technology to be developed under this program would be relevant to many applications besides low power satellite thrusters. The two most significant alternative applications are gas sensor applications and displays; the total display market is billions of dollars. Display applications will be the major driving force to commercializing technology developed under this program.

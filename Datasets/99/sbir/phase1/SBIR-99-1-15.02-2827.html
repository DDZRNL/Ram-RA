<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>A new silicon microchannel plate technology is proposed that can significantly improve the performance of particle detectors, astronomical observation instruments and night vision systems. The silicon based technology allows many material systems to be used that cannot be used in traditional glass microchannel plates due to the temperature processing requirements. In particular, the silicon technology allows high secondary yield materials to be used on the front end of the microchannel plate to enhance the first strike statistics, improving both device gain and increasing noise immunity. Phase I will explore front end engineering of silicon microchannel plates by applying a high secondary yield coating to the front end of a silicon microchannel plate. Phase II will further develop the engineering of silicon microchannel plates and investigate the use of other high secondary yield front end coatings. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>Silicon microchannel plate technology can be used in a variety of image intensification applications including medical imaging and night vision. New commercial opportunities will open in optical telecommunications as low cost, high performance devices become available. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Long duration space missions either to the moon or to Mars will require food provided from plants grown in life support bioregenerative chambers. These systems will integrate food production with atmosphere regeneration and water recycling, increasing self-sufficiency and decreasing the need for expensive resupply from earth.
  <br><br>
Since maintaining crew health is of utmost importance, food must be produced and 
processed under highly sanitary conditions to minimize the risk of food borne 
diseases. New sanitation methods and procedures are urgently needed to meet this 
challenge. This proposal concerns the use of a new, totally enclosed vapor phase 
sterilization system. The device is unique because it operates without using 
consumable chemicals carried on board or resupplied from earth. The disinfectant 
that is generated acts against a broad range of potentially pathogenic 
microorganisms and it is generally safe to apply directly to foods. The 
disinfectant can also be externally applied to utensils, food preparation 
surfaces and processing equipment and there are no harmful wastes produced that 
could impact an integrated bioregenerative system. The proposal includes 
preliminary test results demonstrating the device's operating characteristics. 
The aim of Phase I is to demostrate the method's feasibility as a food 
sanitizing agent. The long-term goal is to provide sanitation hardware to NASA 
for use in food processing.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Food borne illness is one of the most serious public health problems facing the United States. Food poising accounts for thousands of deaths each year and the estimated cost to the Nation is between  billion and  billion annually. The food sanitation equipment described in this proposal could be used in industrial and commercial food establishments to minimize the risks associated with contaminated food.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The greatest obstacle in determining protein structures by x-ray crystallography 
is obtaining crystals of sufficient size and quality. Growing large high-quality 
crystals is dependent upon determining the optimal growth conditions, a 
difficult process with current technology due to the large amount of purified 
protein required. Many proteins can not be crystallized because of this 
requirement. The proposed project will give researchers the ability to 
Screen conditions using much less protein, thus opening the technology of x-ray 
crystallography to thousands of new proteins and making it easier and more cost 
effective for thousands of other proteins. This innovative system will
immediately benefit scientists pursuing drug development, and ultimately the 
general public who will experience the benefits of new drugs to treat currently 
untreatable diseases or improved treatment over current therapies. As additional 
proteins are crystallized, the need for microgravity research will also increase 
with the need to optimize rystal growth.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   There currently exists a great demand from pharmaceutical companies and research scientists for better methods to rystallize proteins, a basic part of the process of structure-based drug design. Traditional screening methodsrequire large amounts of purified protein, which is expensive to produce for many proteins and virtually impossible o produce for others. The proposed innovation will decrease the experimental substrate to a micro-array format equiring much less protein to screen multiple conditions. This will considerably reduce the protein purification xpenses of pharmaceutical companies as well as open up the availability of x-ray crystallography for numerousother proteins. High-throughput screening will be a boon to crystallography and would facilitate the conversion of proteome information to potential drug discovery targets.

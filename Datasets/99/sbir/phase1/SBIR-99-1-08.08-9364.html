<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 08.08-9364 (Chron: 991861 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Smart Self-Repairing Cryoseal Technology </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>Shape Change Technologies, LLC proposes to deliver engineering designs for a prototypical smart self-repairing cryo-fluid seal for remote applications, such as deep space, lunar or planetary environments, such as on Mars. The seal utilizes new material solutions of cryogenically compatible elastomers and discrete smart actuation materials to provide a seal surface which can be shielded from debris, allow for shape recovery after being compressed from sealing or from local damage. The concept includes a smart shroud to protect the cryocoupling and seal from debris. This elastomeric shroud serves as a reusable, low power, retrofittable secondary seal with embedded sensors for leak detection. The technology scales with size, so both small and large cryo- seal applications are accessible with this technology. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>Commercial applications for subcomponents of this technology are in two areas, the seal technology itself and the shroud technology. Markets for general seal applications that would utilize this technology are in biomedical infectious waste containment, self-activating fire seals and for high-end food waste storage for domestic use and in restaurants. Self-repairing seal technology solutions are envisioned in hostile environments, such as isolated oil rig seals and marine seals. </P>

<P>Smart Shrouds markets would also be for hostile environments, where the seal surface needs to be protected from sand, snow, ice, debris, biofouling etc. Markets for this are again in oil drilling, oil and water pipelines and electrical power plants. </P>

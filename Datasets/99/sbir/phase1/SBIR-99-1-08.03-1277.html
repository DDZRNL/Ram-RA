<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The Y2 Ultra-Filter Technology proposed for this SBIR will provide NASA with a 
more efficient and cost effective Air Revitalization System (SBIR subtopic 
08.03) for manned space vehicles. This newly tested technology can capture 
particles down to 0.01 micron with an efficiency of >99.999% and has the 
potential to remove odor-causing molecules. The Y2 Ultra-Filter Technology will 
offer the advantages of lower power consumption, reduced maintenance, lower 
cost, and most importantly, reduced logistic and resupply costs compared to 
existing Air Revitalization Systems for the International Space Station. 
Furthermore, by applying special bacteria-killing coatings currently available, 
the Y2 Ultra-Filter Technology has the potential to capture and kill bacteria. 
This system not only has the potential to allow astronauts to work in a cleaner, 
safer environment, but could set the standard for a wide range of future 
commercial and defense applications. Y2 Ultra-Filter, Inc. has already performed 
substantial testing and has done extensive research to gain confidence in the 
Technology. Under this SBIR, we will develop a product design optimized to meet 
NASA's hardware and filtration requirements for manned space flight. We will 
also conduct limited testing and analysis to confirm our claims.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   The fast-growing market of &quotair purification" is over $30 billion in the US 
alone; the worldwide market is many times that amount. As a result of studies 
and analysis performed to date, the company has identified over eighty (80) 
product application areas, each of which represents a market segment into which 
the Technology should be able to penetrate and have a significant impact. The 
success of this SBIR will allow us to use the test data to verify our claims in 
very contaminated environments, as the conditions imposed by the NASA 
requirements will be more extreme than any of the commercial applications.

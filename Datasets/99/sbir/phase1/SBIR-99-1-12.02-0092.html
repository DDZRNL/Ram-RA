<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Identifying Laboratory Spectra Within Mixed Remote Sensing Coastal Data </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>The central problem associated with the exploitation of remotely sensed data is to find methods that can accurately and consistently detect laboratory or known spectral signatures in sensed data. Current approaches provide a wide range of capabilities but essentially lack a connection to the underlying dynamical and physical processes or systems responsible for the differences observed between the lab and sensed spectral signatures. Remotely </P>
<P>sensed data includes the use of hyperspectral imagery. These data sets contain large amounts of data that are difficult to exploit by manual means because they are comprised of multiple bands of image data that are not easily visualized or assessed. An automated system that utilizes Universal Robust Filter is proposed to analyze multiple band imagery with capabilities to perform automatic detection, recognition, materials identification and data </P>
<P>visualization with hyperspectral imagery with emphasis on coastal monitoring. Commercial applications include the use of these methods for water quality, fishing and the detection of subsurface deposits through surface microseepage detection. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>This project will lead to innovative large volume imagery exploitation algorithms and software tools which have wide commercial applications, such as assessment of environmentally sensitive locations, detection of potential fishing problems, disaster monitoring and assessment of microseepage in relation to deposits of various minerals and hydrocarbon sites. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  An optical fiber based hydrogen sensor technology is proposed. The proposed 
sensor is based on utilizing the changes in the optical excitation of surface 
plasmon waves in palladium caused by the interaction of the metal with hydrogen. 
This technology will have many fold improved sensitivity and response over 
existing optical hydrogen sensors. Due to complete optical operation in the 
sensing area, the proposed technology will provide enhanced safety and EMI free 
measurements. In addition, an array of such sensors can be easily multiplexed 
into an integrated network to monitor a large area and provide localized 
accurate measurements. The innovation will find application in HYPER-X, X-33, 
RLV and other hypervelocity vehicles to detect hydrogen through their 
entire flight envelope, where the smallest hydrogen leaks in confined spaces can 
be extremely dangerous. In Phase I, a hydrogen sensor system will be designed 
and fabricated, and the feasibility of sensing hydrogen with improved accuracy 
and sensitivity compared to the existing technologies will be demonstrated. In 
Phase II, the sensor system will be integrated, fine-tuned for performance, and 
packaged for commercialization. Cost cutting efforts will be seriously pursued 
to enhance commercial viability.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   The broadest anticipated market for the proposed innovation is in the health monitoring of advanced aeropropulsion systems such as the X-33, X-34, RLV, NASP, and other hypervelocity vehicles through their entire flight envelopes where fast and accurate detection of hydrogen leaks is critical. A large market potential is anticipated in health monitoring of hydrogen fueled future power plants and automobiles.

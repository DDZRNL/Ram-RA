<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Parallax Research, Inc. proposes to develop an elemental analysis technique we call "Confocal X-ray Micro-Spectroscopy" for the purpose of identifying potential biological micro-objects during space missions or in returned samples. This new method utilizes Parallax's ability to make unusual grazing incidence x-ray collection optics, Parallax's background in designing x-ray elemental analysis instrumentation, and optical aberattions 
which have previously been considered dis-advantageous in grazing incidence x-ray optics. With this technique, we expect to be able to use an extended x-ray source with a concentrating optic to produce a high x-ray flux region on the sample and a collection optic to collect a large solid angle of x-rays emitted from the sample. By using an
aberattion of the grazing incidence optic, we will be able to limit the area seen by the detector to a tiny micro-structure. With this device, NASA will have the ability to sort samples into those containing small amounts of C,N,O,S,P, and other light elements found in life forms and reject those not likely to contain life. In addition to space applications, Parallax will have several commercial applications for the technology developed in this 
program.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Parallax has an immediate commercial application for this device in the semiconductor industry to look at the elemental constituency of features on micro-chips. We would probably make these instruments and they would be sold by a larger x-ray instrument company.

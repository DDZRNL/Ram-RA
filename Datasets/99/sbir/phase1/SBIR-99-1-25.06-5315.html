<P><B><b>PROJECT TITLE</b>:</B> Superior Low-cost Coating System for Light-weight 
Ceramic Insulation 
<P><B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The objective of this proposal is to develop a better low-cost 
  coating system than the state-of-the-art RCG or TUFI coating for light-weight 
  ceramic insulation. The research involves the development of a new, preceramic 
  polymer coating system which may penetrate into the porous ceramic insulation 
  surface so as to enhance the toughness of that surface. This new coating 
  system involves the development of a high-temperature, 
  silicon-carbon-boron-based preceramic polymer by sol-gel techniques, which 
  system may then be used to toughen the surfaces of porous ceramic materials 
  such as Space Shuttle tiles by a simple process. <BR><BR>* A number of 
  boron-modified silicon-based preceramic polymers will be synthesized.<BR>* 
  Coating of the preceramic polymer matrix on the surfaces of porous ceramic 
  materials will be performed. <BR>* The toughness of the pyrolyzed composite 
  surfaces will be evaluated. <BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The coating system to be developed in this research should prove 
  to be a superior, low-cost, light-weight, more easily processed, thermal and 
  surface protective system. The new coating system can be used as thermal and 
  impact resistance shields for light-weight ceramic tiles for space vehicles as 
  well as for future commercial spacecraft applications. The high-temperature 
  and high- impact resistance coatings also have numerous applications on Earth, 
  such as enhancing the impact protection of light-weight, porous ceramics for 
  application in the automotive, aviation, public transportation, home and 
  factory construction industries. <BR><BR><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

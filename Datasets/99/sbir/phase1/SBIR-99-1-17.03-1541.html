<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 17.03-1541 (Chron: 991475 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>High Temperature Coils for Electrical Machines </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>This proposal addresses the development of reliable, inexpensive, high temperature coils for electrical machinery in future aircraft propulsion systems. The innovation lies in a novel configuration featuring a helical conductor and ceramic insulation material formed into a compact block. For a typical coil geometry, the dielectric breakdown voltage will be a factor of 25 higher than possible with current approaches. The fabrication cost is </P>
<P>estimated to be about 25% of state-of-the-art high temperature coils. The proposed concept will enable the development of high temperature magnetic bearings, motors, generators, and actuators that will be found in More Electric Aircraft (MEA). </P>

<P>In Phase I, the feasibility will be demonstrated with design studies and proof-of-concept tests. The system will be built and tested in a high speed, high temperature engine rig in Phase II. </P>
<hr>
<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>Magnetic bearings, generators, and actuators integrated into future gas turbine engines will require high temperature coils. These machines would be sold to engine manufacturers. </P>

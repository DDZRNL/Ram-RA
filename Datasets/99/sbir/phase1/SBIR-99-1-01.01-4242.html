<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>The proposed wrist-worn alertness feedback, maintenance and recorder device (FMR) will provide NASA with an innovative and cost-effective method for collecting fatigue and circadian data from transmeridian flight pilots. In addition the FMR will allow pilots to plan ahead their sleep/wake and light/dark patterns to maintain optimum alertness during on-duty time. This unique tool will automate a state-of-the-art alertness model by collecting its users circadian, sleep/wake, activity and light/dark rhythms. Its intuitive interface will allow its user the ability to project his or her alertness into the future as well as alter their current circadian phasing. All the while the device will be recording levels of alertness, the first data of this kind ever to be able to be recorded on the job in large numbers. Phase I objectives are to: Select the most practical, non-invasive way for the FMR to collect core body temperature; determine the best alertness modeling methodology given certain hardware constraints; and develop an intuitive and useful interface. The result of Phase I will be a design prototype of the FMR tool. The design can then be prototyped and tested in Phase II. </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>Transmeridian pilots, both commercial and military, can potentially use the proposed FMR. FMR will help these individuals to monitor their state of alertness and to regulate their sleep patterns when crossing multiple time zones. Frequent international travelers might also find the device useful in helping them to minimize the effects of jet lag. </P>

<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Sensory Activated Stimulation (SAS) System </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>The Sensory Activated Stimulation (SAS) System is an innovative approach to integrate sensing to human tactile feedback to provide an operator of a robot or virtual object with additional environmental characteristics such as contact and force. SAS utilizes sensing capabilities and tactile stimulation to the operator to provide information that would greatly increase the work efficiency and safety of work environment. SAS uses proven stimulation technology that was developed by ORBITEC, combined with current technologies to provide the sensing of necessary forces. The key innovation and development is the integration of the sensing and the feedback stimulation, which has no requirements of the robotic control system, thus no added delay or modifications to a robotic controller is necessary. SAS is designed to be independent, portable from one system to another, adaptable to differing configurations, and easily interfaced to the operator. The sensory data (such as force) that is used for active stimulation could also be made available to be collected for other purposes. SAS provides NASA with the opportunity to increase operator safety and efficiency by providing the feedback to operators of robotic and virtual systems. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>Commercial applications include feedback interfaces for hazardous waste redemption; rehabilitation medicine for blind, deaf, insensate, and disabled; virtual reality training and entertainment systems; and feedback for calibrated and remotely controlled tools. An immediate application and implementation will be natural for the advanced robotic hand development at NASA currently known as Robonaut. Specific commercial areas to be investigated further include: (1) software and entertainment interface equipment, (2) interfaces with current commercial robotics hardware, (3) sound interpreters for the deaf, (4) prosthetic hand sensory augmentation, (5) augmented surgical and instrumented tools, and (6) graphics display for the blind. </P>

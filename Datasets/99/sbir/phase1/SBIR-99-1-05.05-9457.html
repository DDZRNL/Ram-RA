<BLOCKQUOTE>
  An automated documentation and reporting system for computational data is proposed. This system will automatically collect and store calculation data, such as input values, grid parameters, and solution quality measures, and will store this information as text, numerical data, and graphics in a structured database. The data will be tagged with further information that defines the calculation context. The reporting mechanism will allow
users to request relevant information, and it includes a method for integrating data from a variety of sources so they can be viewed in a multidimensional design space. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the concept by developing a preliminary version of the system. The technology for developing each component and the integration of these components will be addressed. The result will be a system that provides an automated means of determining and archiving both calculation input information and solution assessment information; thus it 
can greatly reduce the labor required for manual documentation. It also provides a means of retrieving and presenting relevant information in a report format so that it can be easily interpreted by the user. This system will benefit NASA or any organization that performs numerous engineering calculations.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   The increased documentation of engineering knowledge and efficiency in managing this knowledge will benefit design and analysis groups in aerospace, hydrodynamic, automotive, and energy industries. The ability to archive and reference a vast database will decrease the risk and cost of the design process, thus improving the competitiveness of these industries.<br><br>

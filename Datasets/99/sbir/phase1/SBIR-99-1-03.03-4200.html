<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 03.03-4200 (Chron: 992401 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Space Durable Flexible Tether </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>On this Phase I Program, Triton Systems will develop a novel and innovative multifunctional, multi-strand space tether that will have lower weight, lower volume, and improved flexibility compared to state of the art electrodynamic tethers. Our innovative approach will use an available high strength metal clad fiber with proven space environment resistant coatings that provide tailorable surface emissivity and conductivity. The new tether can be woven or braided into a multi-strand tether. The Phase I effort will characterize different size fiber and weight % of metal cladding for candidate tethers, leading to a down-selected tether type. In late Phase I and early Phase II, developed tethers will be measured for diameter, weight, strength, flexibility, thermal-optical characteristics, conductivity and insulation properties. The Triton team will develop, with NASA testing, a Phase II Prototype tether, and Triton will then develop a Phase III commercial tether product. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>There is significant commercial potential for the space tethers to be developed under this program. All space vehicles in LEO orbit could use electrodynamic tethers for reboosting, deboosting, and for end of orbit to minimize space debris. Tethers of the type developed here will be needed on most or all future space vehicles. </P>

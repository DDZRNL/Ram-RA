<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 08.03-5000A (Chron: 991809 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Regenerable Seed Plugs from Formed Plant Fiber </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>The objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate regenerable plant supports from inedible plant fiber for use in Advanced Life Support (ALS) System plant growing units. Plant supports of interest include seed plugs, seeding mats, root/shoot barriers, and plant "fences". The innovation is to develop totally regenerable plant structures that retain sufficient structural integrity for plant support over one crop  cycle, that can be fabricated on-site, are non-toxic to plants, and which do not require separation from the inedible plant waste stream. By forming expendable components from inedible plant material already in the ALS system, resupply mass can be significantly reduced (an annual supply of non-regenerable seed plugs is about 124 to 3000 kg depending on the type). Harvesting procedures would be simplified since support structures would be processed directly as part of the inedible waste stream. The use of regenerable seed plugs would also reduce crew time, and simplify the mechanization of seeding and harvesting processes. Proposal tasks involve processing plant fibers, fabrication of prototypes, and mechanical and biocompatibility testing of the prototype regenerable seed plugs. The anticipated result of this project is a process and associated technology to produce regenerable plant supports meeting ALS operational requirements. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>NASA Related Applications-The near term application of this technology is in ALS testbed plant growing systems. One testbed, the BioPlex facility at JSC, will have 90m2 of crop growing area with the potential to produce several crop cycles per year at high planting densities. Incorporation of an in-situ regenerable plant support production capability would increase testbed fidelity in addition to providing cost savings over the use of non-regenerable materials, reducing labor required for harvesting and waste processing operations, and simplifying integration with mechanized harvesting. The ultimate end use of this technology would be as a component of a space based ALS. Commercial Markets-Seed support structures from agricultural fibers may be competitive with plant support structures currently fabricated from non-renewable materials (e.g. peat-moss, rockwool, or plastic). This has occurred to some degree in the area of landscape fabrics, with agri-fiber materials replacing some non-renewable materials previously used. The primary market would be in the greenhouse and nursery industry, a 36 billion dollar retail market. Potential products include plant stakes and supports and horticultural growing containers like seedling trays, root trainers, propagation trays, plug flats, starter pots and 'root cubes'. </P>

<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 05.03-9077 (Chron: 992264 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Flight Testing of a New Design Concept for Axisymmetric Inlets </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>This proposal identifies a flight test program on the F-15B at NASA Dryden to obtain off-design performance of high-speed inlets that incorporate a unique variable geometry system. The proposed effort accomplishes two objectives; validation of engine face distortion prediction by complex CFD codes and validation of a unique new approach to variable geometry for high-speed inlets. For supersonic cruise, this variable geometry concept allows the consideration of very high performance axisymmetric inlet designs that normally have required complex, heavy variable geometry concepts to effect the necessary throat area variation. The proposed concept also provides increased design options for hypersonic inlets. Aerodynamic design, model fabrication and flight testing of two inlets, one with the unique variable geometry and a baseline configuration, will be completed. This proposal responds to the SBIR subtopic by proposing a study in which prediction of inlet distortion by using complex CFD codes can be validated by comparison with data from a flight program. It is expected that this effort will also verify acceptable lower speed performance for an inlet designed to utilize the concept of this proposal. This advance in inlet technology will enable development of efficient and safe propulsion systems for supersonic or hypersonic vehicles. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The commercial benefit of a validated code for distortion prediction is the enhanced confidence that is provided to the designer of inlet systems. The commercial application of the proposed new inlet design is based on the expectation of acheiving acceptable inlet perormance at the lower speed flight Mach numbers. If acceptable performance is obtained, this concept will allow axisymmetric inlets with very high performance, high operability margins, reduced weight, and sufficient transonic airflow cabability to be considered for both HSCT and hypersonic applications. The design options offered by the proposed new inlet concept will enable the development of propulsion systems for high-speed aircraft that offer increased range, payload/profit, and safety.</P>
<P>Commercial applications include aircraft used for transportation of people and packages throughout the world and access-to-space vehicles </P>

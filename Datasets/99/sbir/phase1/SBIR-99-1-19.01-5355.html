<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>Earth and space science missions are evolving towards the use of distributed networks of individual spacecraft. In this scenario, a decentralized state estimation and fusion scheme is more practical and robust than a centralized one. The implementation of a decentralized state estimation and fusion strategy however faces the problem of taking into account the unknown correlations between different state estimates during fusion of information. We propose the use of a Covariance Intersection algorithm which leads to stable and robust estimation, as opposed to a standard Kalman filter which ignores these unknown cross-correlations and may have convergence problems. In Phase I, we will develop several centralized and decentralized Kalman Filter architectures. The performance of these schemes will be compared using (i) the Covariance Intersection algorithm, (ii) independence assumptions on different estimates, and (iii) an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm with multiple cross--covariance models. Performance assessment will be carried out in terms of computational complexity and robustness against communications failures and unknown cross-covariances. Specific tasks to be performed are: (1) Problem formulation and data acquisition; (2) State Estimation Algorithm Development; (3) Performance sensitivity analysis; (4) Algorithm testing and tuning; and (5) Final report. Phase II will extend the work to a particular NASA mission, with specific communication schemes/constraints, specific sensor configuration and relative position/attitude requirements. </P>

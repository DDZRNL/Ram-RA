<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Software Environment for Investigating Decentralized ATM Concepts </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Air-traffic management concepts being investigated by NASA range from ground-based techniques to fully airborne solutions. One of the difficulties in assessing the relative merits of these strategies is that they are developed on diverse air-traffic management simulation environments using different sets of assumptions.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>This makes it difficult to make quantitative comparisons in a given air traffic management scenario.</P>

<P>This proposal advances the development of a software environment that can be used to assess the air traffic management strategies from a control theoretic point-of-view. This point-of-view enables the use of concepts such as stability margins and robustness in the air traffic control environment. The proposed software environment will incorporate NASA-developed air traffic simulation software as a central element. It will allow the analyst to augment the simulation to include other elements of the air traffic management system such as the communication, navigation and surveillance systems, decision support systems and decision execution methodologies. It will also provide an analysis environment for determining the effectiveness of air traffic management strategies.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Phase I research will develop a prototype of the proposed software environment and will demonstrate its operation in several air traffic management simulations. Phase II research will develop the complete version of the software environment. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>Software developed under the proposed research will aid the researchers synthesize and refine new air traffic management strategies. This will result in more effective implementation of future air traffic management concepts.</P>

<P>The software environment will also be useful for modeling and analysis of other multiple flight vehicle systems such as formation flight. </P>

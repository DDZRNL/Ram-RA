<BLOCKQUOTE>
 NASA has several projects requiring intelligent control of advanced robots such 
as the Robonaut and the EVA Robotics Assistant. These robots are capable of many 
tasks but only if accompanied by a flexible intelligent control system. S&K 
Electronics(SKE) and Real-Time Innovations(RTI)propose a real-time control 
system development tool that integrates expert system with an object-oriented 
framework for robot control, with which developers can specify the system 
behavior symbolically as well as numerically. Two software technologies, 
ControlShell from RTI and CLIPS from the software Technology Branch at NASA/JSC 
have already been deployed successfully in several NASA applications. 
ControlShell is an object-oriented framework that supports design, composition, 
testing and maintenance of sophisticated real-time software. It also provides a 
superb integrated platform for intelligent control. CLIPS, which stands for "C 
Language Integrated Production System", is an expert-system tool that supports 
rule-based programming and is suitable for embedded applications. We propose 
integrating these two technologies, ControlShell and CLIPS, into a coherent 
package so that NASA can leverage the modern graphical, component-based tools 
provided by ControlShell and the symbolic reasoning facilities provided by 
CLIPS.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   SKE and RTI have agreed to aggressively market the results of this research to 
the aerospace community, commercial institutions and the CLIPS user community. 
SKE is an established contractor within the NASA community. It has connections 
with the Air Force Research Laboratory and other aerospace companies such as 
Lockheed Martin and Boeing. RTI has considerable direct sales experience in the 
aerospace market surrounding Kennedy Space Center and Ames Research Center. This 
experience includes both personnel that have worked as engineers in the 
industry, as well as having experience selling products to the target companies 
and organizations. RTI has built strong relationships with major players and 
distributing channels in the real-time market. Their products are sold both 
directly by them and Wind River Systems, and distributed world-wide. Since RTI 
already has a strong foothold in the market, the new CLIPS component will be 
marketed by them with SKE and RTI establishing sales agreements with Wind River 
Systems, Inc. to market our product to their large customer base. Another 
stragegy is to acquire a record of the CLIPS registered userbase and introduce 
this site to the new product.

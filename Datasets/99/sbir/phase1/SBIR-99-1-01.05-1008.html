<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 01.05-1008 (Chron: 992339 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Distributed Fiber Optic Structural Health Monitoring System-Aerospace Vehicles </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>The proposed project will develop a distributed fiber-optic structural health monitoring system for aerospace vehicles. This system will measure and record the stress cycle histories at hundreds of critical locations on a vehicle in real-time. The information can be used on-line in a program to schedule maintenance and direct inspections for more efficient and safer operations. This benefit directly addresses the expressed goal of improved transportation safety in the 21st century. The proposed innovation lies in the use of low-cost fiber optic strain sensors combined with a predetermined global strain-to-local stress transformation that converts spatially averaged strains to local stresses at a sampling rate commensurate with the dominant modes of the primary structure. This proposal directly addresses the targeted solutions of (1) "Structural fatigue, life cycle, static or dynamic load monitors," and (2) "Model-reference or model updating schemes based on measured data that operate autonomously." </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>This system has both immediate and long-term uses. Its primary purpose is to provide an onboard intelligent real-time structural monitoring system to monitor stress levels at critical locations. In the long term, the system will provide information for future design in the form of a design database. Stress cycle histories can be used to schedule and pinpoint inspections and to perform crack growth analysis. In addition to NASA applications, strong commercial potential exists in applications to both military and commercial aircraft. </P>

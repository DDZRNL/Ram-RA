<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 12.01-3100 (Chron: 992534 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Multi-Spectral Membrane Mirror Light Shutter System for Lidar Applications </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>This SBIR Phase I project is concerned with the development of a low-cost, compact, large-area, high-speed multi-spectral (UV and NIR) light shutter system for use in lidar and laser-ranging systems. The proposed device is based on membrane-mirror light modulator technology, and the goal of the program is to design, construct and test a shutter system with sub-microsecond rise times and a contrast ratio of 1000:1. A prototype shutter and driver electronics system will be built and delivered at the end of the Phase I program. Phase II will focus on miniaturizing the driver electronics, designing the device so it can handle high optical power densities (&gt;1 kW/cm2), and testing the device in a lidar test bed that will be provided by ITT Systems Division. The anticipated results of the project are a rugged, low-cost, high-modulation-rate shutter that should significantly enhance the performance of current imaging laser radar systems. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The large-area membrane-mirror light shutter will find commercial applications in laser radar systems, high-speed photography, laser printing, engraving and trimming, and as a phase modulator for optical beam spoiling. </P>

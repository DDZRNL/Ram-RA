<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 08.01-3102 (Chron: 991524 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Simultaneous Production of O2 and H2 Using a Novel Ceramic Catalytic Membrane </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>This proposal is in response to NASA SBIR Solicitation 99-1 Topic Number 08.01 In-Situ Resources Utilization of Planetary Materials. The stated objective of this topic is to develop novel methods or processes to making maximum use of local, indigenous materials as a source for propellants, life support consumables, radiation protection, and construction. This proposal is specifically directed at the simultaneous production of oxygen and hydrogen from water using a catalytic oxygen-ion/electronic conducting ceramic membrane reactor without applying any external electric potential. The surface of the novel membrane reactor will be coated with a mixture of catalysts for decomposing the water molecule into hydrogen and oxygen ions at a temperature of 400o to 900o C.</P>

<P>Driving by the potential gradient, the oxygen-ions conduct through the ceramic membrane and form oxygen molecules by giving up electrons at the other side of the membrane, while the hydrogen ions gain electrons and form hydrogen molecules at the catalyst surface. The high purity oxygen may be used for life support as well as a propellant for transportation systems, while hydrogen may be used as fuels or promoting reverse water gas shift reaction with carbon dioxide to product more water.</P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The initial targeted market for this novel technology will be aiming at manufacturing of small portable devices for high purity oxygen and/or hydrogen production. As an oxygen supply device, it can be used as breathing oxygen for remote locations (non-centralized system). Also, it can serve as a steady source of high purity hydrogen for fueling analytical instruments (e.g. gas chromatography) in laboratories. This will eliminate the need for transporting and handling of high pressure cylinders in thousands of public and government laboratories across the country. </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Laser spectrometers operating in the mid-infrared spectral region have been used on airplane-based platforms to measure the composition of the Earth’s atmosphere. Because the lasers used in these instruments require cryogenic cooling, these instruments cannot be adapted to the more demanding requirements of a mission to study planetary atmospheres. Other mid-infrared laser sources now under development, including quantum cascade lasers and antimonide diode lasers, also suffer from the need for cryogenic cooling. Our innovation is a compact continuous-wave laser spectrometer which does not require cryogenic cooling and which converts electrical power into optical power efficiently enough to be flown on a planetary mission. At the same time, our instrument will have the sensitivity, selectivity, and response time needed to make quantitative measurements (including isotope ratio measurements) on gases important to the scientific study of planetary atmospheres. During Phase I we will prove feasibility by altering the design of the optical element which produces the mid-infrared radiation is such a way that the conversion efficiency needed for planetary missions is achieved. In Phase II we will prove practicality by producing and delivering a prototype laser spectrometer tailored for detection of a specific gas of importance to NASA planetary scientists. </P>

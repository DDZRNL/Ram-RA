<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 15.02-6481 (Chron: 991605 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Cryogenic Detectors with Advanced, High-Speed Readouts </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>This proposal describes three technical innovations in an effort to develop cryogenic detectors for the UV and x-ray regions. Specifically, the development of improved superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) detectors and arrays using advanced process technologies, single-stage SQUID amplifiers with ultra-low input current noise, and fast, wideband feedback electronics based on a novel high-frequency flux modulation technique. These advances are expected to reduce detector costs and improve detector performance, including the ability to detect and resolve very fast signals. The potential for integration to build large-format arrays also is discussed. This effort directly benefits SEU programs and addresses specific needs for cryogenic detectors and arrays with sensitive, high-speed readouts. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The cryogenic detectors and fast readout electronics will directly benefit numerous applications in astrophysics where improved energy resolution and sensitivity are required. In addition, these detectors and readouts will be very attractive for other important applications such as x-ray fluorescence microanalysis and mass spectrometry. The total commercial potential for cryogenic detectors and accompanying readout electronics in these instrumentation markets is substantial. </P>

Flowfield Predictions 
<P><B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>An innovative effort intended at understanding and predicting the 
  transition to turbulence on rotary/ wings is proposed. The proposed approach 
  involves a two level analysis - one for the overall flow field, and one for 
  the transition regions. The overall flow field will be computed using a 3-D 
  Navier-Stokes analysis. Transition will be monitored on microzones located on 
  the rotor surface. In the microzones a nonlinear perturbation form of the 3-D 
  Euler equations will be solved. A strategy is proposed for moving these 
  microzones, until transition is detected at a number of radial locations on 
  the rotor blade. The global flow field analysis and the transition analysis 
  are Tightly coupled to one another, each influencing the other. <BR><BR>In 
  Phase I, a 3-D dynamic stall experiment conducted by Piziali, and the surface 
  pressure data for an UH-60A rotor tested by Lorber will be used to calibrate 
  the proposed approach. In addition to engineering quantities, this approach is 
  expected to yield a wealth of information about the behavior of flow fields in 
  the vicinity of transition lines - invaluable in examining existing transition 
  criteria and developing new ones. In Phase II, microzone transition analysis 
  tool will be developed and interfaced with NASA Ames overset solver OVERFLOW.

<P><B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The proposed use of embedded microzones in a global field and the 
  use of perturbation form of the Euler equations has several potential 
  commercial offshoots. The study of fluid-mechanical micro-electro-mechanical 
  (MEMS) devices, sound generation in boundary layers and high-speed transition 
  are some examples of direct applications of the proposed methodology.

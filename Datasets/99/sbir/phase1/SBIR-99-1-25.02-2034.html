<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Photon sail propulsion enables missions not possible using conventional chemical
or electric propulsion, particularly high velocity missions to explore beyond the 
solar system. The usefulness of a photon sail to perform useful mission propulsion
is critically dependent on its areal mass, optical properties, and temperature 
limitations. Conventional sails are based on polymeric films that have severe limitations.
This Phase 1 Sbir project investigates novel fiber-based sail materials and architectures 
for high performance photon sails that offer significant improvements in mass, stiffness,
and temperature capability. Phase 1 shall investigate fiber-based sail fabrics suited for
photon propulsion. Mechanical and optical materials properties of lightweight sail materials
will be measured. Lightweight methods to increase optical reflectivity and to provide attitude control with these materials will be assessed. Draft designs of sail materials for ground tests and near-term space experiments will be prepared for potential Phase 2 development.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Lightweight sails have near-term application to sail propulsion experiments and longer-term application to space propulsion and attitude control systems. Lightweight materials have broad applications to spacecraft antennas, mirrors, sunshades, thermal insulation, and gossamer spacecraft structures.

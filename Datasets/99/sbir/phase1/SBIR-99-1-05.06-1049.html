<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 05.06-1049 (Chron: 991216 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Innovative Analysis Tool to Solve Unsteady RBCC Ramjet Combustion Problems </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>We propose to develop an innovative analysis tool to solve unsteady combustion problems in the ramjet combustor and the scramjet combustor of the independent ramjet stream (IRS)RBCC concept. The analysis tool is based on the innovative space-time conservation element-solution element (CE/SE) method. In Phase I, we will calculate the unsteady flows in the ramjet combustor based on a quasi- 1D formulation and a 2D axisymmetric formulation, respectively. The chemical reactions will be treated using the full reaction mechanism. 3D</P>
<P>calculations will be conducted in Phase II. Unsteady flows in a scramjet combustor and the interactions between the flow-field due to the ramjet combustor and the flow-field due to the rocket will be considered in Phase II as well. Unstructured grid approach will be adopted for Phase II calculations. The outcome of the proposed SBIR program is an analysis tool that can numerically predict the flow-field for the whole process of an IRS RBCC, from lift-off to entry to orbit. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The product of the proposed project will help the development of IRS RBCC as a single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicle. Such a launch vehicle will drastically reduce the satellite launch cost and will have great economic benefit given the fact that up to a few hundred satellites are expected to be launched in the next twenty years. The resulting numerical platform of the proposed project can also be used to solve fluid dynamics problems in fields such as the aerospace industry, the auto industry, the power generation industry, and environmental sciences. </P>

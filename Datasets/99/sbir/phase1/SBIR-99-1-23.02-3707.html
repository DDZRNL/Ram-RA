<P>The Automatic Simplification Tool (AST)proposed by Technology Promotion International, Ltd. (TPI) substantially simplifies and accelerates the visualization and simulation of large, complex CAD models. The AST takes a complex mechanical assembly, simplifies it and then exports the simplified visual assembly model with a link to the original CAD model. The resultant visual model is viewing angle and orientation independent. This tool tremendously reduces the time and effort for a simulation application. The Phase I effort will demonstrate the ability of the AST for simulation simplification. During Phase I, CAD models of a test assembly will be used to demonstrate the concept. A fully functional AST system will be developed during Phase II. </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The Automatic Simplification Tool (AST) would allow NASA engineers to speed up the process of modeling and simulating of large spacecrafts and aerospace vehicles. The AST system can be used for simulation applications such as 'removal path study' and 'virtual integration and assembly' and would greatly reduce the simulation time. Virtual reality creations and entertainment displays will also benefit from the simplification tool. The tool allows CAD vendors to display and modify large models quickly. There is already sufficient interest by General Dynamics Corp. who will be utilizing this technology in 'Virtual Integration and Assembly' of future amphibious vehicles. </P>

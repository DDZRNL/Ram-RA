<P>NASA is interested in innovative manufacturing methods and materials that will significantly reduce the cost and weight of general aviation aircraft, while improving cabin comfort and crash-worthiness. Energy absorption, in the form of projectile impact and crash protection, and fire resistance are major safety benefits, and noise reduction is a serious comfort consideration. Several engineering materials offer very attractive specific mechanical properties (the ratio of properties to the density of the material). But a material being developed by Touchstone Research Laboratory, Ltd. of Triadelphia, WV, is unique in its combination of these properties with fire resistance, impact resistance/energy absorption, and the potential for large-scale, low-cost manufacture with relatively simple processing equipment. It is a lightweight foam made by the thermal decomposition of petroleum or coal precursors. Shown in the figures below, it can be fabricated in a variety of densities and cell structures to meet the weight, mechanical, and energy absorption requirements of a given application. Carbon foam offers the aviation industry a lightweight, structural material with superior energy and thermal-absorbing properties and enhanced fire protection.</P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>Carbon foam is an innovative technology with excellent mechanical, fire-resistant and energy-absorbing properties. As such, the material is applicable to a broad spectrum of defense, aerosspace and commercial markets, including fire-resistant and heat-resistant core material for polymer composites and other structures; ballistic impact shielding for structures, vehicles and personnel; energy-absorbing, corrosion-resistant fuselage panels and aircraft doors. </P>

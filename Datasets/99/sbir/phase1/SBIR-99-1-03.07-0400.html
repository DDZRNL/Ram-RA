<P><B><b>PROJECT TITLE</b>:</B> Low Temperature Active Metal Joining of Aluminum Alloys 
for Space Structures 
<P><B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>An enabling joining technology for aluminum, aluminum-lithium and 
  aluminum composite fabrications used in space structures is proposed. Thermal 
  management and the control of large temperature differences in space 
  structures require extensive use such alloys but to date, joining has either 
  relied on epoxy or mechanical fastening techniques. The high thermal 
  conductivity of the proposed metal joining process and its low joining 
  temperatures will increase thermal performance while lowering the cost of 
  component fabrication. Additionally, the proposed process will permit rework 
  and repair, further lowering fabrication costs. <BR><BR>Key to the proposed 
  S-Bond process are a new family of active low temperature(200-450ºC) 
  Sn(Zn)-Ag-Ti-X alloys that can wet and bond to aluminum and many metals. The 
  objective of the proposed Phase I work is to demonstrate the fabrication of 
  aluminum and aluminum composite components using MRi's Low temperature active 
  metal joining process. This will be accomplished by testing joints on a range 
  of Al-alloys and aluminum composites to corrosion resistant or low CTE metals. 
  Phase I will also demonstrate a simulator component to test the assembly of 
  aluminum radiator panels for space probes that require joining aluminum fins 
  or fabric to metal cooling fluid tubes (stainless steel or Kovar®). 
  Additionally, flanged components and/or optical instrument support simulators 
  will be bonded to tank, truss, and bulkhead simulators. Phase II will center 
  on process optimization and full size component fabrication.

<P><B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Low temperature active metal joining has the potential to be a 
  major technology advance that enables fabrication of aluminum and aluminum 
  composite structures being designed for many aircraft, aerospace and satellite 
  structures. The process simplifies and lowers fabrication costs, permits easy 
  rework and while it enables new designs without fasteners. Applications 
  include commercial and military aircraft, commercial satellites and in high 
  speed precision machinery (e.g for microelectronics fabrication) where thermal 
  control, low weight and low thermal expansion is a concern.

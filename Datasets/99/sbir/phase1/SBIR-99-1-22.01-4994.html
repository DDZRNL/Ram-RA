<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 22.01-4994B (Chron: 992035 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Novel Amplifier Technology for Low-cost Microwave/millimeter wave Transmitters </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>We propose a novel amplifier device technology which has the potential to produce low cost amplifiers at X- to Ka-band with power greater than 1 W. </P>
<hr>
<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>An inexpensive amplifier for higher power transmitters would be extremely valuable for satellite-based cellular (LMDS) Ka-band communication systems for high bandwidth data transmission. Arrays of such amplifiers could be employed in phased array/beamformer systems in which each array element is buffered with a transmitting amplifier (and an LNA on receive), to achieve very high power, electronically steerable transmitters. Such arrays also open up entirely new possibilities for military applications, such as very high power electronically steerable antennas for millimeter wave radar applications. Also, a 1-100 W amplifier is very appealing for vehicle-mounted communications uplinks to satellites for high bandwidth data sharing, such as video and mapping. </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>A forward-looking scanning Doppler lidar is proposed to be used onboard various commercial aircraft to sense the vector wind field and global turbulence parameters ahead, in the vicinity of the flight path, particularly those associated with intense turbulent wind structures. The goal is to provide a closed-loop flight control system with an accurate measurement of the upcoming vertical velocity and turbulence intensity at sufficient look-ahead distance that the loads on the aircraft and occupants can be significantly reduced. In addition, pilot situational awareness can be improved through visualization of hazards ahead. The proposed effort leverages several ongoing development and demonstration efforts of airborne Doppler lidar sensors, including those associated with NASA's Aviation Safety Program. The Phase I program will evaluate scanning and processing concepts appropriate for the measurement objectives. Simulation-based demonstrations of system concept capability will be developed in Phase I. The Phase II effort will focus on the development and demonstration of a detailed, high-fidelity aircraft simulation for evaluation of concept robustness and interaction with pilots. Companion scanning Doppler lidar flight testing, especially that in companion with the Aviation Safety Program, will be utilized in Phase II to validate the lidar subsystem performance. </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>Primary applications are directly related to commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers. Tailored versions of the system can address hazard mitigation for cruise and descent aboard both large and small airliners. Airborne measurement of wind environments, including gusts and turbulence, wind shear, wind profiling and wake vortices is also useful to validate, and extend, the descriptions of the wind shear environment used in flight simulators for pilot training. </P>

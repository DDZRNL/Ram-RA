<BLOCKQUOTE>
  SHAI proposes the development of an Intelligent Operations Scheduling System (IOSS). It will automatically schedule and optimize processing operations and utilization of resources, including floor space. It will be based on a general scheduling approach where every decision is made by a general constraint satisfaction inferencing engine using knowledge entered by domain experts. It may therefore be readily applied to many different domains. It will also include spatial constraints scheduling. Using on our extensive intelligent scheduling system experience, we have systematically examined each decision made in a wide range of scheduling systems and are proposing an IOSS which subsumes a large number of scheduling problems by making each decision customizable. Proposed Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques include Constraint Satisfaction, Intelligent Entities, Case-Based Reasoning CBR), and Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA).  
  <br><br>
  In phase I we will knowledge engineer expert KSC schedulers, develop applicable 
knowledge representation and AI scheduling techniques, investigate the integration requirements with existing tools, design the full-scale system,and develop a limited, proof of concept prototype.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Applications include Scheduling Libraries, Manufacturing-related Scheduling, and Project Management. Manufacturing Production Scheduling is similar to IOSS and makes up $89M of the $625M Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) industry and will grow 40 percent  annually to $482M in 2002. Both the United Space Alliance and Cocoa Expo Sports Center have sent letters of interest. to plant operators in process industries - such as chemical manufacturing and electrical power generation - where any human error results in extremely costly plant down-time.

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Composite Technology Development, Inc. proposes to develop a composite material for use in deployable space structures. The material will use a polymer matrix and graphite fiber reinforcement, in a fully cured, ready-to-deploy composite support structure that has significant advantages over current space-cured materials. The material can be deformed for stowage, then deployed to its original shape by simple heating, with no loss of mechanical or physical properties. The deformation process will be reversible, and provides positive fiber alignment, desirable packaging characteristics and satisfactory mechanical/physical properties, thus enhancing reliability and ease of handling. In Phase I an initial feasibility demonstration will be performed using flat panel laminates and simple tubular </P>
<P>structures. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>Inflatable and deployable structures may become an important part of spacecraft design within the next few years. Current applications under consideration include sunshields, inflatable solar arrays, and communication antennas.  Additional potential uses for the technology include planetary rovers, pressurized habitats in space or on planetary surfaces, solar concentrators and optical telescope mirrors. With the large number of commercial and government satellites to be launched in the next 20 years, the commercial potential of this technology is quite large. </P>

<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Micro-pulsed Pulsed Plasma Thrusters for Microsatellites </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>The primary objective of Phase I will be to develop and fabricate a breadboard version of a revolutionary onboard spacecraft propulsion modular "mechanical thruster" component (the coaxial pulsed plasma thruster (PPT)) that, when integrated with advanced PPT electronic components, will reduce onboard propulsion system mass and volume roughly by a factor of two compared to equivalent propulsion systems. Innovative external circuit and thruster design improvements will take advantage of PPT technology and advanced energy storage units now in development under NASA contract, and coupled with the proposed thruster, will allow significantly increased PPT performance during Phase II of this program. The resulting advanced propulsion system will result in reduced mass and launch/spacecraft cost for small satellites, and will be applicable to precision attitude control and station-keeping as is required for formation-flying in the NASA mission Space Technology 3. The results of the Phase I research will validate the approach for incorporating coaxial PPTs with an advanced-architecture micro-pulsed storage circuit, leading to a low-cost advanced flight-qualified system in Phase III. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The resulting revolutionary pulsed plasma thruster will result in significant cost, propulsive mass and volume reductions, benefiting NASA low-power satellites such as formation-flying satellites for long-baseline interferometry, as well as commercial satellites. The system can operate in clusters of three for attitude control, or can combine a larger number of PPTs into a single thrust vector to make higher levels of thrust available for spacecraft deployment (aperture filling), orbit transfer and drag makeup. The results of this R&amp;D effort will improve system simplicity, reduce propulsion and structural subsystem cost and weight, and increase propulsion system reliability. </P>

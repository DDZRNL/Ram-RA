<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>The technical problem addressed in this Phase I SBIR project is the development of CMOS Active Pixel Sensor (APS) image sensors that are well suited to support astrobiology studies. CMOS APS image sensors can be designed to be high resolution (millions of pixels) and low power (tens to few mW). In the field of astrobiology studies, CMOS APS image sensors will be a welcome alternative to the incumbent imaging technology, charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensors. CMOS APS image sensors perform as well as CCDs, with the added benefits of lower power (10 to 100 times less) and integration of electronics (enabling miniaturization), thus allowing them to provide opportunities to expand the existing image sensor market. Because of their inherent advantages of minimized weight, volume, and power requirements, the proposed CMOS APS image sensors and the technical advances associated with their development are also very important for other NASA applications. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The proposed image sensor and the technical advances associated with its development are very important for consumer camera markets (digital still cameras, camcorders, video cellular phones, and high-end video conferencing). In addition, technical advances in the manufacture of high-resolution, low-power image sensors that are expected to result from this SBIR, will directly benefit Photobit's high volume, high-resolution, low-power sensor product lines (for example, machine vision and digital still camera). An additional market that is important is that of digital cinematography. </P>

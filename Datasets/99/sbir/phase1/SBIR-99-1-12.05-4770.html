<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Fast High-Fidelity Atmospheric Correction for Hyperspectral Imagery </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>The viability of commercial remote sensing with hyperspectral and multispectral imagers depends critically on the ability to perform fast and accurate correction for the effects of the atmosphere. Great strides have been taken in development of correction algorithms and their implementation in research-level, analyst-driven codes. However, there is still need for a commercial product combining speed, autonomy, and high-fidelity correction. Therefore, Spectral Sciences, Inc. proposes to develop the Fast Automated Atmospheric Correction for Earth-observing Terrain Sensors (FAACETS) code, designed to provide 10- to 100-fold or greater increases in speed over current atmospheric correction codes without loss of fidelity. One of several key concepts enabling the speed-up is the use of a pre-computed sensor-specific MODTRAN4-based Giant Look-Up Table (GLUT) that encompasses the entire operational envelope of the sensor. The Phase I technical objectives include: (1) generation of a GLUT for the AVIRIS sensor, (2) integration into our current state-of-the-art atmospheric correction code and evaluation with data, and (3) definition of Phase II software and hardware taking advantage of efficient coding and a parallel processing architecture. In Phase II, FAACETS will be fully implemented, tested, and delivered to NASA. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The FAACETS commercial product will be a fast and automated atmospheric correction software package for satellite and airborne multispectral and hyperspectral visible/near-infrared imaging sensors. This encompasses a diverse range of commercial applications such as precision agriculture, mineral prospecting, forest management, ocean resource mapping, land use planning, and surface pollution monitoring. FAACETS will also find widespread military utility where rapid and accurate remote detection and identification of terrain and target features are critical.</P>
<P>NASA has a multitude of ongoing and planned multispectral and hyperspectral sensor programs (e.g., EOS/MODIS, CRSP, AVIRIS,) that will also benefit from this product. </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>The proposed innovation to be addressed in this work is the development of a low-cost and ultra-compact HDTV CMOS APS digital camera-on-a-chip for Earth Science Information Technology to use for hyperspectral aerospace instruments as well as for commercial color imaging. This system-on-a-chip technology was recently invented and developed by the Photobit's founders during their former employment with the JPL and in the past three years at Photobit. It is a high performance, low power, very compact and cost efficient CMOS image sensor technology that provides resolution, sensitivity and dynamic range competitive with CCDs yet offers significant system advantages. In Phase I, optimal architectures to achieve both excellent image quality and the world smallest active pixel size (3.6-micron) will be investigated. The technical feasibility of obtaining ultra-high resolution conforming to the HDTV standard (1,920 x 1,080), a dynamic range of over 60dB (10bit), a frame rate of 30Hz and an output data flow of approximately 1Gbit/sec will be studied. The main circuitry to implement this multi-million pixel camera-on-a-chip will be designed and simulated. The physical layout of the pixel array, row and column drivers, analog and digital signal processors will be performed. Special considerations for the system design will be suggested. </P>

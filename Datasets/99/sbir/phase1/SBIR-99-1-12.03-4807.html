<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 12.03-4807 (Chron: 992624 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>High-Power Narrow-Linewidth Two Micrometer Semiconductor Seeder Laser </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>We propose to develop a single-frequency, narrow-linewidth semiconductor laser operating in the 1.8 - 2.1 um wavelength band for injection seeding high-power solid state lasers or for use as a local oscillator in coherent lidar systems. Reliable, low-cost, semiconductor laser sources are not available at these wavelengths. The laser will consist of discrete fiber-coupled master oscillator(MO) and power amplifier (PA) modules. The MO module will utilize a fiber Bragg grating in conjunction with a semiconductor optical amplifier to create a highly-stable, narrow- linewidth (&lt; 150 kHz) optical source. To facilitate differential absorption lidar (DIAL) and coherent lidar applications, the operating wavelength can be tuned over a range of more than 1 nm by either temperature or strain tuning the fiber grating. The PA module will contain a high-power tapered semiconductor optical amplifier chip that amplifies the signal from the MO increasing the available output power while maintaining the spectral purity of the MO. The MO-PA semiconductor laser will be designed to provide more than 50 mW of diffraction-limited optical power from a single-mode optical fiber. This innovative approach promises to provide NASA with a compact, efficient, reliable, and low-cost injection seeder or master oscillator source for 1.8 - 2.1 mm lidar systems. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>Narrow-linewidth semiconductor lasers operating in the wavelength range between 1.8-2.1 um will be used in numerous commercial and military applications. Some direct applications include trace gas detection, and chemical/environmental monitoring. There are also numerous medical applications including human health diagnostics through breath analysis using isotope-ratio spectroscopy. </P>

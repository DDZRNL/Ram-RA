<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>An innovative Liquid Oxygen transfer pump for space applications will be developed, built and tested that will greatly reduce weight and power requirements over current pumps in use. The pump will run at higher speed to maximize pump efficiency and minimize size and weight. A hermetic design will be utilized that eliminates the troublesome mechanical seal used in most Liquid Oxygen pumps. The sealless pump will have a canned rotor and stator for compatibility with Liquid Oxygen. A partial emission design will provide optimum efficiency for the relatively low flow requirement of the transfer pump. The prototype pump developed in Phase I will provide the stepping stone for great reductions in power consumption and weight for all cryogenic transfer pumps used for future space missions. </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The final unit design developed in the Phase II effort will have immediate use in Liquid Oxygen transfer applications for any spacecraft. As commercial space launch requirements continue to grow, the needs for this type of pump will increase. The innovative lightweight design concept could be scaled up or down to meet requirements for any possible space transfer application. The low NPSHa (or two-phase flow) aspect of this pump has significant immediate commercial application. If the Phase II effort is funded and two-phase flow capability can be developed for this type of pump, it could be used in numerous commercial applications including petroleum refining, chemical production, nuclear, power plant, and waste management industries. </P>

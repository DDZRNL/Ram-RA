<P>Brazed Aluminum Matrix Composite Material for Cryotanks, Lines and Ducts </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>The next generation of reusable launch vehicle and satellite structures require new materials to meet aggressive program objectives such as decreasing vehicle weight in order to increase payload, and reducing cost per launch in order to decrease cost per pound of payload. Materials which have improved specific strength and specific stiffness, especially at cryogenic and elevated temperatures, will enable NASA to meet these aggressive program goals by supporting the development of stronger, lighter and more thermally stable launch vehicle and spacecraft components. Touchstone's Brazed AMC material demonstrates all of these desired properties. This material has close to double the specific strength and specific stiffness of structural aluminum alloys. It also maintains these properties at higher temperatures than current aerospace alloys. As such, Touchstone's material can serve as an enabling technology for many launch vehicle and spacecraft applications, including engine and thrust structures, lines and ducts, cryogenic tanks, and satellite structures. This proposal discusses a new material system which can be an enabling technology in the development of these new launch vehicle and spacecraft components. The new material system consists of a continuously-reinforced aluminum matrix composite (AMC) material manufactured using techniques commonly used to produce polymer matrix composites (PMCs). </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>Touchstone's Brazed Aluminum Matrix Composite material could be used in numerous applications where high-specific strength and stiffness are required at a wide temperature range (cryogenic to more than 600 degrees F). Such applications include components in spacecraft, aircraft, automotive and other transportation applications. </P>

<P><B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The demands for lighter, lower cost optics for space and aircraft 
  are constantly increasing. These demands are being driven by the costs 
  associated with aunching in spacecraft or costs associated with flying bulky 
  payloads in aircraft. The payload weight factors into these costs. These 
  demands must be met while maintaining or improving the performance of the 
  optical system. It is proposed that a mirror constructed with metal coated 
  carbon fiber reinforced cyanate ester facesheets and lightweight core can meet 
  all of these requirements. The facesheets and core must be designed using very 
  high modulus, thin facesheets, and a stable and uniform core structure. It 
  will be demonstrated that a thin metallic coating on a composite face sheet 
  and a lightweight core structure can be diamond turned to a figure of ¼ wave 
  @.6328 microns or better while weighing less than 7 kg/m2 and remain stable 
  over a wide temperature range. <BR><BR><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

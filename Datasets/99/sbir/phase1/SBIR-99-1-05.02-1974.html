<P>Low Profile, Autonomous, Remote, Integrated Sensors for Aerospace Vehicles </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Improved sensors are needed in nearly every complex engineering system. Among the unmet needs for sensors are autonomous sensors; i.e. those have an on-board, independent power supply. The purpose of this work is to develop miniature, remote, sensors, with an on-board power supply, consisting of an energy scavenger (such as photovoltaic cells) and microscopic batteries developed by Bipolar Technologies. In addition to the power supply, the sensors will contain a plurality of sensor elements (i.e. pressure, velocity, temperature, etc.) and a signal transmitter. A low-power, programmable, microprocessor is at the core of the device, which converts the analog information from the sensor elements, processes and converts it to a digital form. The sensor platform can accommodate other microsensor elements with convenience, depending on the needs of the user. The sensors will acquire information from their environment, and then send the information through as transmitter to a (distant) host.</P>

<P>They will operate at average power levels of &lt; 1 mW, occupy ~ 1 cm2, and will be energy-independent.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>During Phase I, a low profile (&lt; 0.025 cm) sensor, including pressure and temperature sensing elements, will be demonstrated. During Phase II, more mature devices employing additional sensing elements will be built. </P>

<P>A Novel Closed-Water Loop Cooling System for EVA Applications </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>A unique highly porous fullerene-based adsorbent material has been found to exhibit a significantly higher carbon dioxide gas adsorption capacity than conventional activated carbon and zeolite adsorbents. In this Phase I research, a novel closed-water loop cooling system using the endothermic process of CO2 desorption from the fullerene adsorbent is proposed for EVA applications. By replacing the water tank in the EMU and utilizing the CO2 gas collected from the Air Revitalization System (ARS) of the space shuttle, maximum use can be made of the resources brought from the Earth by the space shuttle. Efficient cooling can be achieved with reduction in system weight, volume, operation cost and increase in mission reliability, durability, and productivity. In this program, the synthesis of the fullerene adsorbent will be optimized and the cooling performance of the proposed system will be tested. The system integration and overall viability of the proposed technology to meet NASA requirements will also be assessed. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The proposed technology may also find commercial applications such as high density oxygen storage for home oxygen therapy or oxygen supply for military and civilian aircraft, carbon dioxide separation in space shuttle, natural gas storage for next generation vehicles, and gas or liquid stream purification applications. </P>

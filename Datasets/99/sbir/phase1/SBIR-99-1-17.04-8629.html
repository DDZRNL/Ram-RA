<BLOCKQUOTE>
The pulse tube cycle, using the inertance tube concept, is currently one of the most efficient regenerative cryocoolers. In addition, the absence of cryogenic moving parts eliminates both the principal life-limiting elements and the main source of vibrations. If the operating range of the pulse tube is to be extended below 20K, improvements in regenerator performance are necessary. In the proposed effort, neodymium perforated 
plates will be fabricated. Previous analysis and laboratory measurements have shown these to have high potential, but fabrication difficulties have been a barrier. The proposal covers an innovative fabrication method that should overcome these barriers, and make the high performance regenerator concept available for testing. In Phase I we propose to fabricate a neodymium composite rod that can be cut and etched into perforated plates. The plates will
have a passage diameter of 30 microns, an open area of 10% and an overall diameter of 25.4 mm. The plate thickness caan be selected during the slicing process. The plates can be tested in various cryocooler systems in a Phase II follow-on program.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   The <b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b> fall in two areas. For aerospace applications, the concept could lead to a reduction in cryocooler input power to cool a specified load by 50% or more. This power savings could result in significant savings in spacecraft weight and cost. For commercial applications, the concept could lead to a doubling of the refrigeration capacity of helium temperature Gifford-McMahon cryocoolers. These are widely used as shield
coolers on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines. Both the applications have a  relatively high "value added" and could sustain a small production facility. In both cases, the new regenerator concept will be a direct replacement for regenerators using existing technology. Therefore, if the proposed effort is successful, a market for the material can be developed rapidly.

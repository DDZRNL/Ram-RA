<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 18.05-2413 (Chron: 991283 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Doodlebug - Miniature Detector for Chemicals and Microorganisms </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Doodlebug is a solid-state biochip technology capable of achieving exceptional specificity, sensitivity, and rapid response. Doodlebug’s unique, ‘specific transduction’ approach makes it possible to determine the specific identity of each target captured by a given biomolecule, even when cross-reactive biomolecules are used. Because any type of biomolecule can be used, Doodlebug can identify targets ranging from heavy metal ions and halogenated </P>
<P>hydrocarbons to bacteria and viruses simultaneously. Solid-state transduction makes it possible to monitor vapors directly, as well as analyze aqueous media. The biomolecules themselves can even be analyzed, to determine when they are denatured and need to be replaced. Because the biomolecules are used to purify the sample by concentrating </P>
<P>targets selectively, the sample preparation/purification system is readily miniaturized as a biomolecule microarray.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Two approaches for manufacturing Doodlebug’s transducer at the mesoscale have already been prototyped; an innovative variation holds the potential for truly miniaturized sensors. The feasibility of using Doodlebug to identify toxins and microorganisms has already been shown. The SBIR will demonstrate the feasibility of using Doodlebug to detect cadmium, chromium, ammonia, sulfate, and carbon tetrachloride, and to specifically identify these targets </P>
<P>as well as others that bind to the chosen biomolecules. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>Near-term applications include monitoring reclaimed space station water and wastewaters from electronics manufacture. Targets to be detected on Phase II are also representative of contaminants that must be monitored in wastewaters from industries involved in metal coatings, non-ferrous metal smelting and refining, paint and ink production, petroleum refining, iron and steel manufacture, photography, leather tanning, wood preserving, and </P>
<P>battery manufacturing; in ultrapure water for use in electronics manufacture; and in surface and groundwaters at contaminated sites. Compact, rugged, user-friendly equipment that can simultaneously detect and specifically identify hundreds of different chemicals and microorganisms will serve a host of other applications in industry, </P>
<P>medicine, and research in the future. </P>

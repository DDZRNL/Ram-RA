<B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
S&K Electronics proposes to develop a toolkit to aid systems analysis and 
design. The toolkit will support the use of data flow diagrams for systems 
analysis and the use of Petri nets for verification of systems design. This 
Toolkit can speed analysis and design, and it can assist analysts in verifying 
designs with subject matter experts.  Innovations include graphical support for 
constructing data flow diagrams and Petri nets, using animated Petri nets
to verify software systems designs, and integrating the products of the data 
flow diagramming tool with the Petri net tool. We will also investigate the 
feasibility of code generation to initiate the development of software 
programs to implement the designs modeled in the Petri nets. This toolkit can be 
used by systems analysts at NASA/JSC to analyze and design new software more 
quickly and more accurately. It can improve the communication between
subject matter experts and software analysts to ensure usable, useful software 
systems. The specific domain of applications to focus the Phase I effort is 
development of software to support NASA/JSC mission operations, with
specific attention to software that supports the Station Duty Officer position.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Systems analysis and software design are performed by a vast number of 
commercial concerns. Because our proposed toolkit is applicable to such a wide 
range of domains, the size of the potential market is extremely large.
We have a unique competitive advantage because there are no competitors which 
offer the integrated support for data flow diagrams, Petri nets, and code 
generation. Our toolkit is also unique in its use of Petri nets for modeling a
broad range of business software applications and in its support for 
communications between software analysts and domain experts. We intend to bundle 
the toolkit with examples showing non-engineering applications and emphasize 
their use in a wide variety of domains. This product is similiar to other 
products under development at S&K Electronics, in which advanced engineering 
techniques are made easier to use by a graphically oriented tool for designing 
and modifying them. Finally, one of the consultants contributing significantly 
to the Phase I effort routinely provides consultation services to a number of 
companies. He can help us find an appropriate partner for developing the toolkit 
into a commercial product.

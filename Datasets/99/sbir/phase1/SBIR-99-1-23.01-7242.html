<BLOCKQUOTE>
We propose to develop an innovative software architecture for automated, 
distributed planning and coordination of constellations of satellites. This 
architecture will support the creation and maintenance of adaptive, hierarchical 
social structures that will enable large satellite constellations to manage 
themselves with minimal human oversight. Because developing such a system 
represents a challenge, we suggest an integrated approach drawing upon a broad 
range of AI techniques. Advanced planning and scheduling algorithms will permit 
the system to quickly create complex plans satisfying intricate time and 
resource constraints. A fast reactive planning component will furnish the 
ability to deal with unexpected, time-critical local events such as system 
failures. In addition, a sophisticated knowledge base will store information 
about the satellites' capabilities and commitments that will be used during the 
distributed planning process to properly allocate tasks to the satellites best 
suited to perform them. The resulting system will provide the capacity for 
robust, scalable management of satellite constellations, with the end result 
being reduced costs, increased operational efficiency, and improved robustness. 
We will absolutely demonstrate the feasibility of our ideas through the 
development of a Phase I, proof-of-concept prototype.

<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 01.02-8700C (Chron: 992126 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Departure Noise Avoidance Planner </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Aircraft noise mitigation is a major issue in the design and establishment of departure procedures in busy terminal areas. Even with the establishment of Noise Abatement procedures, there is a significant need for improvement in the mitigation of noise created by aircraft operations. Some Noise Abatement procedures are difficult to implement for the controller, pilot, or both. In such cases, automated assistance for the controller may improve the effectiveness of the Noise Abatement procedure, by allowing aircraft to be vectored to follow the procedure more accurately.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Metron has advanced the state of the art in aircraft noise modeling to the point that it is now possible to conduct noise modeling in real-time with sufficient accuracy to support controller decisions. This proposed effort will investigate the feasibility of a system which will predict noise footprints for individual flights based on current atmospheric conditions. These flight-by-flight analyses will then be used to generate alternative routes if the noise footprint is found to impact areas of significant population density. The generation of departure routes to decrease the impact of noise will then result in departure vector advisories to be displayed to the controller. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>As this effort is focused on the development of innovative techniques for Air Traffic Management, the primary sources for non-SBIR funding are the organizations and agencies that maintain and improve the ATM systems of the United States, and of the world. Metron has previous involvement in many areas of development of the National Airspace System (NAS) of the United States.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The commercial product that is contemplated to result from this SBIR effort is a proof-of-concept Noise Management system that can be customized and implemented under contract to international or domestic ATC service providers. Dependent on the operational characteristics and requirements of the customer, the prototype system will be modified, enhanced, documented and tested to the customer's requirements.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Metron is also on the leading edge of private-sector funding of such ATM system projects. Through close coordination with the FAA, Metron has identified a number of methods by which private industry and airspace users can fund some of the required development and maintenance effort that is required for systems such as Collaborative Decision Making (CDM). The commercialization of this technology will be pursued both domestically and internationally. </P>

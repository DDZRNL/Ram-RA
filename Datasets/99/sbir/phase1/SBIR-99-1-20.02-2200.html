<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>High Performance CMOS APS for Optical Communications </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>The proposed innovation to be addressed in this work is the development of a high performance and low-cost CMOS APS focal-plane-arrays for Optical Communications with potential opportunities for use in defense industry as well as commercial high-speed imaging systems. </P>

<P>The CMOS APS technology was recently invented and developed by Photobit's founders during their former employment with the JPL and in the past three years at Photobit. It is a high-performance, low-power, very-compact and cost-efficient CMOS technology that provides resolution, sensitivity and dynamic range competitive with CCDs yet offers significant system advantages. </P>

<P>In Phase I, optimal architectures to achieve high-speed, high-QE, very-low noise, large-field-of-view and small-pixel will be investigated. The technical feasibility of obtaining high-resolution (1Kx1K), 5-micron pixel, QE up to 50%, dynamic range of over 80dB(12bit), frame rate up to 500Hz, and an output data flow of approximately 5Gbit/sec will be studied. The possibility of increasing the resolution to 2Kx2K and decreasing the pixel pitch to 3.5-micron using more advanced CMOS process will be investigated. The main circuitry to implement this Megapixel focal-plane-array will be designed and simulated. The physical layout of the most innovative parts will be performed. Special considerations for the optics and system design will be suggested. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>This high-resolution CMOS APS technology is expected to be suitable for many consumer, commercial, scientific and military applications ranging from astronomy and biology, HDTV and digital photography, medical and computer imaging, security and home video, to star tracking, target detection, vehicle navigation, automatic inspection, optical communication and the other machine vision systems. </P>

<P><B><b>PROJECT TITLE</b>:</B> A Novel Volumetric 3D Display for Satellite Data 
Visualization 
<P><B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The primary objective of the SBIR effort proposed herein is to 
  develop the hardware and software prototype of a novel high-resolution 
  volumetric three- dimensional (3D) display system that is suitable for 
  visualizing various types of 3D data collected by satellite sensors. The 
  proposed volumetric 3D display technique has a 360 degree look-around group 
  viewing capability and allows a group of viewers to simultaneously view and 
  analyze 3D data (such as hyperspectral data sets, multi-variate geospatial 
  data, remote sensor data, etc.) without wearing any special viewing aid or 
  goggle. <BR><BR>Due to the complexity of satellite data analysis and 
  visualization, the ability to provide sharable three-dimensional visualization 
  and measurement would significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of 
  decision making, validation, and collaborative development environment. A true 
  3D volumetric display device would literally add a new dimension to the 
  advanced human/computer interface. <BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The market for volumetric 3D display systems is sizable, and 
  applications are enormous, including both military (e.g. air traffic control, 
  battle management, submarine navigation, telemedicine in battle field) and 
  commercial (e.g., virtual reality, computer aided design, visualization of 
  multidimensional data, medical imaging, surgery assistance, education, 
  scientific computing, video games, stadium displays, etc.) The 3D display 
  systems will provide a new level of realism and literally add a new dimension 
  to the dynamic interaction between human and the world around us.

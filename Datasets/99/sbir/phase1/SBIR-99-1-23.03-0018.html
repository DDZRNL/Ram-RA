<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>An Analysis Model Bus for Distributed, Collaborative Engineering Modeling and Si </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Next generation design software will support fully associative geometric and physics-based analysis models throughout the entire product life-cycle. Most current CAD systems directly support finite element systems, but use proprietary database formats that do not promote diverse tool use and may not exist throughout the entire product life-cycle. Model sharing in common practice has been limited to exchanging model instances (without parametric information) via data interchange files (e.g., STEP) or data translation software interfaces (e.g., Parametric Technology's Associative Topology Bus). This approach makes parallel, multi-corporation design inefficient.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Additionally, although CAD systems support finite element analysis, this capability usually does not support coupled multidisciplinary, multiple level-of-fidelity analysis models, and so significant effort is expended preparing models for analysis. Software integration packages such as Engineous' iSIGHT and Phoenix Integration's Model Center provide intuitive tools for automating analysis by linking legacy codes together, but do not simplify the development of the analysis model itself. Alternative solutions such as TechnoSoft's AML are more flexible, but require an object-oriented software developer to generate source code for each model. This research will develop a lightweight, platform-neutral analysis model bus (AMB) that exploits Internet data modeling and collaboration technologies to make possible the widespread, distributed storage of and collaborative access to diverse analysis models. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The Analysis Model Bus has the potential to make the collaborative sharing and distribution of engineering analysis models as pervasive as the common web page. It will serve as middleware software in the form of a distributed component that will be accessed by future and current CAD and product data management software packages. To promote widespread use, the underlying data model used by the AMB will be freely distributed. A Java- or C++-based application programming interface (API) developed with this research will be sold to CAD vendors, general product data management software vendors, researchers, and advanced end-users. Future CAD and other software systems that integrate the AMB API will operate like current web-browser's, providing access to complex and distributed analysis models by entering a uniform resource locator string. This capability will potentially be at the core of next-generation collaborative design environments that support diverse, geographically-dispersed design teams. </P>

<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 01.05-7909 (Chron: 992227 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>On-line Engine Health Monitoring using a Model-Updating Scheme </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>The firm proposes to conduct a research on a software toolkit (or middleware) to perform on-line engine health monitoring. The toolkit will allow on-line information extraction from measured data and will facilitate decision making. The ultimate goal of the toolkit will be to reduce the life cycle cost of an engine/flight vehicle fleet while maintaining flight safety and availability. Initially developed for turbine engine health monitoring, the toolkit is expected to migrate to other flight systems with a low-to-medium level of modification.</P>
<P> </P>

<P>The underlying methodology of the on-line engine monitoring toolkit will include an adaptive model-updating scheme based on measured data that operates autonomously. The methodology will also proactively determine/recommend engine maintenance schedule, effectively functions like a life-cycle monitor. </P>
<hr>
<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>Potential products from the proposed project is a software toolkit that can be implemented on an engine diagnostic unit to increase engine maintainability and reduce life cycle cost. The software toolkit can track the health and remaining safe life of engine components, it can also recommend maintenance decisions.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The anticipated benefits of the on-line engine monitoring toolkit are: </P>
<P>§ Durability/readiness enhancement. </P>
<P>§ Life cycle cost (LCC) reduction. </P>
<P>§ Enabling technology for on-line, real-time health monitoring. </P>

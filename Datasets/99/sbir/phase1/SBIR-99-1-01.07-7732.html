<P>Two-Photon Confocal Imaging of Intelligent Coatings for NDE of Corrosion </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Systems &amp; Processes Engineering Corporation (SPEC) and Dr. Richard E. Johnson of LeTourneau University propose to develop a compact two-photon confocal imaging system for detecting, measuring and monitoring intelligent coatings. The proposed imaging instrument will be designed to take advantage of newly developed fluorescent probes which are embedded into different flight hardware polymer paint layers. These fluorescent probes act as "intelligent coatings" providing fluorescence map images of corrosion by-product formation, bonding</P>
<P>information between layers, and polymer coat thicknesses. These measured parameters can be used and correlated with known fatigue and stress models associated with aircraft or flight hardware flaw prediction and adhesive joint models. Two-photon confocal laser scanning microscopy (2PCLSM) has several advantages over its single-photon counterpart. One of the obvious advantages arises from the quadratic dependence of the two-photon induced fluorescence intensity on the excitation intensity. Under proper excitation power, this </P>
<P>property limits the fluorescence emission to the vicinity of the focal point, thus providing excellent depth resolution even without using a confocal aperture. The resulting instrument will be low-cost, compact and easy to use in NDE test environments. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>Typical confocal measurements are expensive and the equipment is difficult to maintain and operate. The advances developed in this Phase I program will provide a rugged, easy to use, and low cost alternative to current confocal fluorescence microscopy systems. Because the fluorescence-based detection system can be designed to specifically and selectively measure a number of markers or chemicals of interest, this system will be easily reconfigurable for a multitude of applications. </P>

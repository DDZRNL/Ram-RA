<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 03.01-0822 (Chron: 992054 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Expert System for Missile and Launch Vehicle Base Heating </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Base heating environment prediction for launch vehicles and missiles due to propulsion system exhaust plume/plume and exhaust plume/external flow interaction currently a complicated and very labor-intensive process.</P>

<P>Experienced analysts using data, empirical methods and/or Computational Fluid Dynamics models currently perform this process. Plumetech proposes to develop a Windows-based Expert System software package that integrates an experienced based convective base heating methodology with recently developed Artificial Intelligence methodologies for computing exhaust plume flowfields. With NASA becoming more directly involved in base heating environment specifications for new launch vehicle concepts, it is essential that plume induced environment models be developed that can be used to accurately evaluate launch vehicle design changes. </P>

<P>There are very few analysts left that possess the experience and expertise required to produce accurate missile and launch vehicle base heating environments. Accurate launch system design evaluations must be performed without compromising the quality of the analysis because of the lack of experience of the analysts with the current prediction techniques and models. The proposed Phase I study is innovative in that it combines recent advances in</P>
<P>Artificial Intelligence applied to plume modeling with new base heating methodologies that allow easy, accurate, and rapid computation of launch vehicle base environments. </P>
<hr>
<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The initial use for this technology is the specification of thermal design environments due to rocket exhaust plume/plume and plume/external flow interactions on launch vehicle and missile bases. The Phase II product will provide an accurate low cost product that can be used by private industry and government agencies to provide design environments and rapidly address the impact of design changes on safety margins of any system that is subject to base heating. This package will be easily marketable based on its versatility, simplicity, accuracy and ease of use by non-experts. </P>

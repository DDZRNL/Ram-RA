<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>VISim: A New Simulation Architecture for Spacecraft Modeling </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>There is a critical and growing need to achieve better spacecraft designs, with fewer resources, with less experienced engineers. This proposal discusses an innovative simulation architecture that permits users to easily simulate spacecraft with complete control over the model content and level of fidelity. The system is built around a configuration management system that provides complete traceability. The interface to the system is through a graphical user interface with a built-in interface to CAD tools. The system permits east access to external data. As part of the project an API will be developed to allow easy access by external software packages. The entire package is Matlab based and will be delivered as part of the final report. </P>

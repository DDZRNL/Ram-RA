<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>High-Efficiency, Low-Cost Photocatalytic Air Purification System </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>The ever-growing concern over air quality has led to considerable legislation to control atmospheric concentrations of ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and volatile organic compounds. However, much work remains before an acceptable measure of indoor air quality is adopted. This is due in part to the lack of universal standards for indoor air quality. These issues and the abundant evidence of so-called sick building syndrome will lead to the need for indoor air quality regulations and the means to attain those standards. The development of innovative and cost-effective control measures for indoor air pollutants has thus become nearly as important as those already developed for atmospheric pollutants. While the control of airborne contamination in the aerospace cabin environment has been established, the need for a low-maintenance, self-cleaning, and regenerative air purification system still remains. In this project, Ultramet will demonstrate the feasibility of a photocatalytic cabin air purification system using a novel reactor based on a titanium dioxide foam having high surface area, high absorptivity, and low pressure drop, which functions as a fixed catalyst bed. The Phase I work will set the stage for further development of the technology in Phase II and beyond for use in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in homes, offices, and factories, where indoor air quality is receiving much attention because of volatile organic compound pollution emitted from new construction materials, cigarette smoke, and bioaerosols. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The applications for a highly efficient air purification system are numerous. Application of this technology to the indoor air quality arena alone offers a sizable market, including residential, commercial, and hospital applications where sick building syndrome is of increasingly great concern. In addition, with more than 65 metric tons of hazardous solvent waste and 60 metric tons of other chemical wastes generated annually by the chemical process industry, the need for such remediation technology is immense. Semiconductor clean rooms and military installations are also in need of advanced air purification. </P>

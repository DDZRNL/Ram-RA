<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 25.04-1980A (Chron: 992033 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Plasma Deposited Dendrimer Coatings and Dendrimer-Fullerene Nano-Aducts for Lubr </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project has an objective to study the possibility of synthesis of dendrimer coating over the surfaces of materials which are candidates for Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), such as nonoxide and oxide ceramics, etc. It also aims at studying the possibility of synthesis of dendrimer-fullerene nano-aducts by plasma polymer deposition techniques. The idea to use these structures for lubrication at micro- and nano-scale capitalizes on the Newtonian-liquid-like behavior of dendrimers. </P>

<P>The experiments will be performed in cold RF and DC plasmas in order to study mechanisms and sites of activation/ionization, dependence of those mechanisms on type of plasma and on parameters in the reaction zone.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The studies conducted through the realization of this program will contribute to the general knowledge on behavior of fullerenes and dendrimers and will increase the body of experimental data on their reactivities in different plasma environments. It will also increase the scope of materials candidates for application in MEMS for different aspects of their functionality. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The main commercial potential of the anticipated coatings and molecular structures is in the big market of self-lubricating materials and lubricant additives. The niche of lubricants for rotating and moving parts in microelectronic devices deserves a special consideration. Another potential field of commercialization may be application as an efficient optical limiting coating. Potential applications in electronic industry and electrochemistry </P>
<P>should not be excluded. </P>

<P>Ultra-performance of laser remote sensing technique requires substantial laser sources which have the properties of high power, wavelength tuning capability, and better beam quality. High power edge-emitting diode pumped Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG lasers have been the mainstay of the laser remote sensing applications in the past. However,the usefulness of high power (&gt;150mW) edge emitting lasers is limited by many unfavorable characteristics including astigmatic, highly diverging or spatially incoherent outputs, multi-longitudinal and transverse mode operation, poor temperature performance and high production costs. Therefore, substantial technology and sub-system improvement is required for providing high electrical-to-optical efficiency and better system performance. Princeton Electronic Systems, Inc. (PES), has a strong background on high power VCSELs and diode pumped solid state lasers, proposes to develop a novel Yb:YAG based laser transmitter based on high power, two dimensional coherently coupled VCSEL arrays providing unparalleled performance including high power (100mW-10W+ CW, 2-1000W+ pulsed), low divergence Gaussian beam outputs, single mode operation. In addition, PES will develop microlens arrays which will allow the outputs of many VCSEL arrays to be combined effectively for very high power applications (2000W+ range or more). In phase I of this program, PES proposes to demonstrate a highly efficient, extremely compact DPSS laser transmitter with 100 mW-2 W output power in the wavelength region of 1029 nm. PES will fabricate the high power VCSELs and develop micro-lens arrays in phase I using the already developed technology and couple them for DPSS longitudinal pumping. PES plans to commercialize the laser system immediately after development. </P>

<P>Training simulators are frequently used in fixed wing flight training programs but their application to rotorcraft has been limited by the difficulty in providing sufficient fidelity for training at an affordable cost. Affordable and effective rotorcraft training simulators can improve rotorcraft safety by providing a controlled training environment to augment flight experience. This is particularly true for autorotation training since this emergency procedure is an actual or potential factor in nearly 50% of rotorcraft accidents. Advanced Rotorcraft Technology, Inc. (ART) is an Industry leader in the development of high fidelity rotorcraft dynamics models. Coupling this expertise with recent breakthroughs in the computational power of PCs and low cost electric actuators for control loading and motion platforms, ART has prototyped a reconfigurable, affordable, high fidelity rotorcraft simulator. ART has also developed an R-22 dynamics model for a NASA/FAA Light Helicopter Accident Investigation. In Phase I, this model will be used with our prototype simulator to produce an R-22 autorotation trainer that will enhance aviation safety through affordable training. ART will coordinate with Certified Flight Instructors at Helicopter Adventures, Inc. (HAI), to test the suitability of the R-22 autorotation simulator for training and to integrate it into an effective training program. </P>

<P>Under this SBIR, ART will develop an affordable R-22 autorotation training simulator and demonstrate its utilization in a helicopter flight training program. No such product currently exists for any helicopter and this product is greatly needed by the helicopter community to enhance the relatively poor safety record for helicopter operations by providing effective, affordable training. Commercial applications include utilization by flight training schools to augment in-flight training, utilization by commercial operators to maintain proficiency, and support of accident investigations. A prototype of ART's innovative reconfigurable helicopter simulator, HeliFlight, will be used as the basis for a low-cost emergency procedures training simulator, focused on autorotation training. The initial simulated vehicle will be the R-22, a representative light, piston-engine helicopter commonly used by training schools. Development of a Bell 206 model in Phase II will address the turbine engine helicopters commonly used for commercial operations. The ability to reconfigure the simulator to different rotorcraft will enhance the costeffectiveness of this product. Under Phase II the FAA certification process will be initiated for three HeliFlight architectures; a desktop simulator, a fixed base simulator, and a motion base simulator. Phase III investment will be used to complete the certification and commercialize the product. </P>

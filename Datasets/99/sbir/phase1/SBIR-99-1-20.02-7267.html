<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>MMIC Filters for Ka-Band Receivers </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>Spacecraft for deep space exploration are small vehicles carrying sophisticated payload for data collection and transmission. The payload for those missions must be built into a miniature package without sacrificing performance standards. This proposal addresses a method of reducing the size/weight of Ka-band transponders used in deep space vehicles. The proposed size reduction is accomplished by the use of active tunable filters built into MMIC (Microwave Monolithic Integrated Circuits) chips. Due to limitations of MMIC processes, it is not practical to replace all existing filters with MMIC filters. Instead, novel concepts of inserting MMICs in strategic positions for image rejection and channel selection are proposed. The proposed MMIC filters consist of a Ka-band band-stop filter and an IF band-pass filter. This approach side-steps current limitations of active filters, namely the noise figure and the dynamic range. Hittite Microwave Corporation has demonstrated active filter concepts for both band-stop and band-pass filters operating at lower frequencies. The proposed program will extend this technology to Ka-band frequencies, reduce power consumption, increase out-of-band rejction, and reduce noise figure. The proposed filter technology will have a major impact on the size of satellite transponders and enable integration of miniature payloads in small space vehicles. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>Products to be derived from this program will be applicable to all data link terminals that require filtering for image rejection and channel selection. In Ka-band frequencies, the filter products will be useful in Ultra Small Aperture Terminals (USAT) and point-to-mulitpoint and point-to-point terrestrial radio links. </P>

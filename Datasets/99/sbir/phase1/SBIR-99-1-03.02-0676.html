<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Investigating what lies just outside our solar system has become important to 
understanding the dynamics of our solar system -- even to understanding the fate 
of our race. The possibility exists that large-scale future events, such as an 
increase in local interstellar gas density caused by an approaching dust cloud, 
may impact human existence.  Such possibilities necessitate an active 
exploration of deep space to understand just what is out there. We propose to 
reinvestigate the concept of nuclear-device driven spacecraft for deep space 
missions. We intend to examine the feasibility of developing very low yield 
devices that will produce a suitable impulse to a specially designed craft.  The 
impulse may be delivered to the craft by impact, ablation, or coupling to a 
magnetic field. We will also assess the architecture requirements for missions 
to 500 AU, to design a system that could perform such a mission, and to design a 
proof-of-concept experiment that would demonstrate a technology which is the 
basis of the system.

Development of a system capable of delivering megajoules per kilogram will allow 
highly instrumented platforms to make fast missions to great distances. Such a 
development will open the trans-Pluto-neighborhood to humanity.

  The commercial applications of nuclear devices has been examined in the past in 
Project Plowshare at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Though several were 
identified, the use of nuclear devices in the public domain is clearly not an 
option. Thus, we do not propose to develop commercial applications of the 
nuclear systems other than for future space missions. However, we do foresee 
several commercial possibilities for the techniques and computer codes that will 
be developed to complete this project. The MHD coupling of high-density,
low-temperature plasmas to magnetic fields is an undeveloped realm in plasma 
physics. Extension of our capabilities to model such conditions could have 
application in fusion concepts, plasma deposition of materials, and the design 
of radiation shielding for future communications satellites. In addition, the 
application of plasma to enhance the properties of material surfaces is a new 
exciting region of research. Much of the work in this project involves accurate
modeling of the plasma interactions with the surfaces of materials.

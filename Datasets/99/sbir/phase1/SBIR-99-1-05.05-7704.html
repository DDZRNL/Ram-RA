<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 05.05-7704 (Chron: 991329 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>An Interactive Visualization System for Multi-Parameter Design Spaces </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Visual Solutions proposes to develop a powerful interactive visualization software system that aerospace researchers and engineers can use to efficiently visualize design data consisting of any number of independent parameters and associated variables. The software will enable the user to set individual parameter values using interactive controls that will update the plot of the associated data values 'on the fly'. This technology will </P>
<P>allow scientists who perform parametric design analysis to quickly understand the impact that each parameter has on the overall performance of the design. It will replace the current tedious method for studying parametric changes which consists of trying to visually compare a series of several individual plots.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The software will be designed to facilitate rapid continued development, cross-platform consistency and compatibility with larger, more comprehensive software systems such as a collaborative, web-based engineering environment. This flexible design approach will lead to the development a state-of-the-art visualization system which will maintain steady growth to serve increasing numbers of applications areas and to take full advantage of</P>
<P>rapidly-changing computing environments. </P>
<hr>
<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>In addition to advanced aircraft design research and analysis, the proposed visualization technology will be useful to any organization involved in doing parametric analysis of designs. The industries that will benefit from this technology include aerospace, automotive, power generation, medical technology and many others. </P>

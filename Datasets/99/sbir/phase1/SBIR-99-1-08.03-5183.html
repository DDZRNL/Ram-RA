<P><B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>An electron beam (E-BEAM) water treatment system is proposed that 
  can reduce the level of organic contamination in water to very low values, 
  remove ammonium ions, and cold-sterilize by electron irradiation. The 
  innovative aspect of the E-BEAM system is that it uses electrons in the 
  relatively modest 100-200 KeV range. It irradiates water through a thin (10µm) 
  but mechanically strong boron nitride (BN) window, allowing over 90oy organic 
  contaminants with great efficiency and eliminate microorganisms. When the 
  radiation chemistry goes to completion, even the most resistant aromatic 
  organic contaminants are mineralized to carbon dioxide and water. The 100-200 
  KeV E-BEAM system has key advantages over catalyst-based, high temperature, 
  high pressure water purification technologies. It offers a continuous stream 
  of highl </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The 100-200 KeV E-BEAM system will be applicable to situations 
  where there is an intermittent but essential need for safe, high quality, 
  cold-sterilized drinking water. As a compact, mobile unit combining easy and 
  safe operation with portability and energy efficiency, it is expected to have 
  competitive advantages where a need exists for a self-contained water 
  purification system. The 100 KeV E-BEAM water treatment system can play an 
  important role as the end station in desert countries removing organic 
  contaminants that are only incompletely eliminated by other water purification 
  techniques such as distillation or reverse osmosis. An additional niche market 
  exists in settlements on permafrost where underground sewer systems cannot be 
  built. </BLOCKQUOTE>

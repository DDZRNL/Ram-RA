<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Future synthetic aperture interferometric radiometers, such as JPL's New 
Millenium Program, Geostationary Synthetic Aperture Microwave Sounder (GEO/SAMS) 
instrument, will employ a thinned array of hundreds of miniaturized receivers 
and a massively parallel cross-correlator system for digital signal processing. 
The objectives of Phase I are to develop, fabricate, and test a proof-of-design 
of a 64-baseline, 1-bit encoding, cross-correlator chip operating at clock 
frequency of 120 MHz to provide the critical design information for the 
development in Phase II of a radiation-hard, 1024-baseline correlator chip and 
of an engineering model of a 16,384-baseline cross-correlator system dissipating 
less than 8 W. To achieve the stated objectives, the following synergistic 
combination of approaches will be used: a) innovative expandable architecture to 
enable the construction of cross-correlator systems with any number of antennas 
, b) new bit-systolic arrays for operation at high frequency with low power 
consumption, c) novel radiation-hard digital circuit techniques, and d) advanced 
sub-micron CMOS fabrication technologies. The cross-correlator chip proposed in 
this project, if successfully realized, will enable the implementation of low-
power cross-correlator systems for spaceborne synthetic aperture interferometric 
radiometers that will be capable of performing breakthrough measurements of the 
Earth's environment.

<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>The Role of User Controlled Feedback in Accelerating Learning and Performance. </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>This SBIR Phase I project will explore the basic principles of learning revealed by one of our more highly successful technology implementations, in which user knowledge and performance with the system was found to be critical.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The data involved were collected on 3500 shopfloor personnel that were given an activity based training exercise on a complex computer technology. Our training was based on research showing that experienced adults learn complex concepts in the context of solving problems at work and rely on self directed feedback to guide their development.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The trainees’ acceptance and rapid development as ‘expert’ users suggests that a particular set of principles used to design the training may be a key element in learning complex technologies. Further the later rapid development of improved efficiency and reliability of the work done may indicate an important role of feedback in innovation. Our workplan proposes to identify the important mechanisms of learning and find ways to broaden their application. In particular, we want to provide the foundation for designing methods of accelerating learning and performance that can be part of the context of the actual work activity or system and not require the considerable expense and lost productivity incurred with off-line training. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>WTRI has conceived of a software product family called ITIM TM, or Iterative Technology Implementation Model. It is based on a proven method that will increase technology deployment success rates from the current 20% to over 80%.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The proposed effort supports the development of WTRI’s strategic business plan for the ITIM TM product family by providing a solid understanding of the mechanisms that make ITIM TM so effective. Preliminary partners have been identified that can participate in taking the ITIM TM products to market. Joint activities are already underway with Spear Technology, the largest developer of decision support technologies for transit, and Oracle, the world’s largest supplier of enterprise-wide database products. These two firms are potential channels for ITIM TM. </P>

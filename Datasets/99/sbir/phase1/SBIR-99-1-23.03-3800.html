<BLOCKQUOTE>
Monolithic software for modeling of complex space vehicles and systems is costly 
and difficult to develop, update and maintain, and does not have the flexibility 
to quickly adapt to new configurations or to the full life-cycle of the system. 
The proposed software uses a highly modular object-oriented structure that 
incorporates full inter-networking of graphics, simulation models, and 
databases. It is designed specifially to allow very rapid assembly of system 
models over a network, graphically, and without programming. Both existing 
legacy modeling codes and new "native" model objects can be utilized. All 
capabilities are accessible using standard web browsers. In Phase I, we will 
develop a proof-of-concept package that operates on standard networks and 
includes a graphical user interface, components for one specific class of 
system, and a computational sequencer. During Phase II, we will generalize the 
modeling system, add more components, validate the software, and deploy the 
package for beta tests at NASA.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   The proposed software will dramatically improve the capabilities, development time, and cost-effectiveness of models for complex systems and can contribute directly to the NASA Intelligent Synthesis Environment initiative. It will have direct application to the design and operation of space vehicles, missions, and other complex engineering systems. It will be commercialized, following the successful path of other software we have developed for NASA.

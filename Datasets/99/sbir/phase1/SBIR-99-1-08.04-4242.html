<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>The proposed Crew Performance Analyzer (CPA) will provide NASA with an innovative and cost-effective method for automatically identifying selected categories of crew performance from videotaped records. The CPA will be more efficient and more accurate than using human observers to process the information from the tapes. CPA will be based on computer-based video processing algorithms developed under DARPA's Visual Surveillance and Monitoring Program. The tool will provide an automated means for determining the time and number of occurrences of a limited number of crew activities, including time spent in translation; human involvement will be minimal. Phase I objectives are to 1) select and prioritize the crew activities that CPA must analyze, 2) design and conduct a pilot test for proof of concept, and 3) determine necessary refinements to adapt the existing algorithms for the space environment. The result of Phase I will be a software product design concept that can be coded and tested as a working prototype tool in Phase II. </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The proposed Crew Performance Analyzer (CPA) has potential application by researchers using videotapes to record the behavior of participants in simulator-based research. Automotive and truck manufacturers, research universities, airframe manufacturers, railroads, trucking companies, NASA, the military, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) all employ simulators and videotaping for both research and training. CPA might also be used for analyzing the movements of animals in a zoo or research environment. </P>

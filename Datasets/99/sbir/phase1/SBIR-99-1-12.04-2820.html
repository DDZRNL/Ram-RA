<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>Under the proposed program, Visidyne will develop a Spectral Imager capable of acquiring high resolution spectral data and, simultaneously, high resolution 2-D spatial data. The instrument consists of a focal plane array camera combined with a Fourier transform interferometer having a rapidly repositionable moving mirror. The design is innovative in that it provides for a complete trade-off between frame rate, spectral resolution, spectral coverage, and sensitivity, and permits such tradeoffs in real time in the field or in orbit. Key to the design is the capability to precisely and rapidly position the interferometer moving mirror, allowing the system to fully sample interferograms or, with simple command changes, to selectively under-sample interferograms by various programmable factors. This capability makes it possible at one extreme to generate broad-band images (imaging radiometer mode), while at the other extreme maintaining spectral resolutions of 0.1 cm-1 (hyperspectral imaging mode). In the latter mode, the rapid mirror positioning capability selectively under-samples interferograms, in order to produce spectra across various combinations of disjoint or contiguous passbands. The concept addresses NASA's stated need under this subtopic for spectral instrumentation having flexible or band aggregation capabilities, along with reduced volumes of collected data. </P>

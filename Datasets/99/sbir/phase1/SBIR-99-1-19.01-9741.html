<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Invariant Subspace Filtering and Control for Formation Flying Spacecraft </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of an innovative systems strategy and algorithmic approach for the combined optimization of navigation and control in autonomous formation flying spacecraft. Due to the high level of accuracy required in controlling the relative distance and attitude alignment between spacecraft it has been established that conventional approaches that treat navigation and control as separate problems are insufficient to the task. The proposed approach offers for the first time a unified systematic framework for analyzing and treating the combined optimization problem, which is instrumental in enabling the highest precision formation flying. Our innovative methodology is based on optimal invariant filtering and control. This </P>
<P>involves projecting the navigation/control problem into a subspace where undesirable common factors such as systematic measurement errors and disturbances can be cancelled while the observability and controllability conditions are greatly enhanced. To identify the optimal invariant subspace, we expand the methodology and algorithms of optimal experiment design of dynamic systems that we successfully applied to ultra-precise fringe tracking in spaceborne interferometry. The results of this project will provide a way to establish the limits of control performance for ST3 and future multiple spacecraft missions. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>Commercial applications of this technology can fall into two major categories: aerospace and civilian. It is inevitable that the formation flying paradigm will be extended to other satellite constellations, and the need for navigation and control toolkits is an open opportunity. Inherent to formation flying is also collision avoidance. This is a need in all </P>
<P>types of transportation - civilian and military air operations, naval battle groups, and automated high-throughput highways. This problem is much less complex, but the need for systems-level approaches with reliable navigation and control algorithms is a major deficiency at this time. </P>

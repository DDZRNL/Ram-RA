<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Autonomous Requirements Definition for the Control of a Planet Finder Spacecraft </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Planned missions within the Origins program demand the development of a multi-level hierarchy of intelligent, self-reliant control systems in order to be successful, ranging from global control of the spacecraft constellation down to individual low-level control loops. We propose to develop a new adaptive methodology which combines proven technologies to form the next layer above the lowest level of adaptive sensory/motor control systems. Our study will focus on the autonomous supervision of a vibration control subsystem consisting of a number of control loops, each individually controlled using adaptive controllers we have previously demonstrated for similar applications. This supervision will consist of allocation of requirements to each controller to meet a global optical performance goal while also minimizing power consumption and providing fault-tolerance. A simulation of the scheme will be conducted using test data from an existing four-meter telescope-like structure, the Multi-Hex Prototype Experiment. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The technology developed on this program directly benefits NASA's Origins and similar Air Force programs, providing for reduced costs associated with ground support. In addition, this new capability for adaptive supervision of lower level adaptive control systems has the potential for application in our products for telecommunications and manufacturing process management, among otehrs. </P>

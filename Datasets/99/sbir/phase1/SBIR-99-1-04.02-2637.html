<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The stationary regenerator barrel cam engine addresses the needs of the GAA 
engine subtopic by providing:(1)very large reductions in life cycle cost (40% 
better fuel economy, reduced aircraft and engine weight, less maintenance), 
(2)substantial performance improvements, (3)increased safety and reliability 
(diesel-like engine features, safer fuel, ease of operation), and (4)improved 
environmental compatibility (reduced noise and emissions, heavier fuel). The 
objective of this program is to combine two engine technologies: regeneration 
and the axial cylinder, barrel-cam engine. Regeneration has been under 
development at Caterpillar, ReJen, and elsewhere, under NASA, Navy, and 
Caterpillar funding. The barrel cam engine is being developed by Lowi with some
NASA support. The successful merging of these two, synergistic, technologies 
will result in a new type of engine with outstanding applicability to GAA 
propulsion. The barrel cam engine circumvents several of the more severe
problems confronting regenerated engine development at Caterpillar, and the 
regenerated cycle reduces the peak cylinder pressure loads on the barrel cams. 
In Phase I the feasibility and basic design will be established. A
technology demonstrator engine will be built and tested in Phase II.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   In-Cylinder regeneration can have a huge impact throughout the power generation, earthmoving, and transportation industries. Ultimately, this new engine technology could find its way into nearly all reciprocating engines withdramatic effects on world- wide fuel usage, the national economy and employment, and US technological leader ship (see results of Caterpillar market study in Part 10). It is most especially applicable to aircraft, where its compact size, exceptional fuel economy, and other features will result in a substantial reduction in aircraft life-cycle cost, increased performance, and improved reliability and safety. This new approach of a barrel-cam regeneratedengine, proposed herein, offers a means to bring this technology to market sooner and to further improve its performance and applicability to aircraft. It offers a means to most dramatically revitalize the GAA industry.

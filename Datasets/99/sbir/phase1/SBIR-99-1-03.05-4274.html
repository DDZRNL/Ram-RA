<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Miniature, low cost, high-temperature instrumentation is needed for rocket propulsion testing and other aerospace applications. F&S and their development partners propose a miniature sapphire propulsion sensor suite capable of measuring hydrogen, temperature, pressure, and wall shear stress to temperatures in excess of 1500oC. Each of these sensors uses F&S' patented extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometer (EFPI) technology to measure critical propulsion test parameters. During this Phase I program, F&S will focus on developing and demonstrating sapphire hydrogen and temperature sensors for propulsion test applications. These sensors will then be integrated with sapphire pressure and wall shear stress transducers currently under development by F&S through development of a common, low cost, high frequency, multi-channel measurement system. In the Phase II portion of
this program, F&S will focus on ruggedization, optimization, and commercialization of the multi parameter measurement system and demonstrate the system at NASA Stennis Space Center and industry beta sites. F&S has a successful history of bringing novel fiber optic sensing concepts from the laboratory to marketable products and will use this experience to ensure near-term markets of the system.

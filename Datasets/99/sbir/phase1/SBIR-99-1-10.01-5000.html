<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 10.01-5000 (Chron: 991286 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Sonic Pump Automation Robot Technology Application (SPARTA) </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>ORBITEC proposes the development of a Sparta IVA Robot for Microgravity Experiment Support. </P>
<P>SPARTA would provide a mobile platform with manipulative capabilities for task performance within the prearragned volume of the International Space Station. This device will increase the productivity of orbit time by allowing the operator--either ground-based or in-orbit--to interact with the internal environment of the Space Station.</P>

<P>Propulsion is provided by a small ducted propeller with attitude control provided by voice coil gas jet rectifiers that provide gas momentum transfer without the use of a compressed gas air supply or without crew-obstructing cables. Phase I will involve definition of system requirements, preliminary design, and conduct of key component feasibility demonstrations on an air bearing table. Phase II would involve technology demonstrations of the SPARTA system on an air-bearing table and low-g NASA parabolic aircraft. Phase III would involve </P>
<P>technology verification on a space flight followed by production of the units needed for operations on the International Space Station. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>SPARTA is ideally suited to operation in the Space Station environment. It could provide remote maintenance and optical evaluation within the habitat. It will have the ability to free-float critical experiments that need very low g-levels. The gas jet rectifier has good potential for development in many commercial products. Inertial measurement units, laboratory gas-flow devices, robotic end effectors, EVA-based systems, cooling </P>
<P>devices, destructive resonance frequency test devices, microgravity crystal growth systems, ground-based containerless materials processing, resonance frequency educational demonstration devices, biomedical rehab devices, and novel radios are applications where gas jet rectifier technology could be developed/marketed. The work will also lead to advancements in the use of cableless remote feedback control, particularly the use of adaptive fuzzy logic control software. These software advances will be applicable to object recognition, stereo vision control and vision processing, and collision detection and avoidance. </P>

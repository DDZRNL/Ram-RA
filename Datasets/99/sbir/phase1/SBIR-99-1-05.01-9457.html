<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The objective of this proposal is to apply a new high-order accurate in space computational 
approach in the OVERFLOW code in order to resolve the essential features of helicopter 
flowfields more efficiently. The potential of the proposed method to improve resolution of tip vortices and rotor wakes at reduced computational cost will be demonstrated. The innovative aspect of the method is that the high­order of accuracy of the implicit operators is obtained at very little additional computing cost by applying compact space  discretization. The proposed method yields time­accurate numerical solutions of the inherently unsteady helicopter rotor flowfields more efficiently than current methods. Tests for time integration of wave­type and inviscid flow problems showed that the new, implicit, high­order accurate in space method is superior in terms of achieved accuracy versus computational cost when compared with classical second­order accurate in space implicit methods. The ADI high­order method will be extended to curvilinear meshes and viscous flows to obtain solutions for realistic problems. In Phase I, the method will be implemented in the OVERFLOW code and the vortex blade interaction problem will be solved and in Phase II solutions of helicopter flowfields will be obtained.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Low­cost prediction methods are needed to improve rotor blade design and to obtain advanced analysis tools for rotor aerodynamics. Development of efficient and accurate numerical methods for the prediction of rotor aerodynamics has potential for applications in industry and contributes to efforts for improving helicopter flight and noise emission characteristics while reducing analysis and design cycle time.

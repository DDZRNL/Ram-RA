<P>This project entails the development of a rotorcraft reconfigurable control architecture that incorporates the functions of aerodynamic redundancy management, fault detection and isolation (FDI), controller reconfiguration, and fuzzy logic enhancement. Fuzzy logic is exploited to deal with complicated, nonlinear, high order uncertainty in the rotorcraft redundancy management scheme to enhance the FDI and reconfiguration control design. Applications and integration of various advanced techniques, including redundancy management, fault detection and isolation, controller reconfiguration, and fuzzy logic enhancement, are emphasized. Designing a rotorcraft reconfigurable control system from this integration perspective enables a coherent treatment of mission planning, communication, navigation, sensor measurement, data processing, command generation, and rotorcraft control in a systematic manner. The rotorcraft performance, reliability, and survivability can be substantially improved without introducing significant hardware modifications. The developed techniques and final results will be transferred to our commercial product, Integrated Reconfigurable Flight Control Toolbox, which has wide application potential in civilian and military areas. </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>The development of a versatile gas sensor for use in gravitational studies and/or long-term monitoring of biological systems in space must address a number of constraints beyond those found in Earth-based systems.Southwest Sciences proposes to combine a new type of laser with high sensitivity detection methods to develop a multiple gas sensor with application to biological measurements as well as health monitoring and fire safety in space environments. This sensor would provide excellent long-term stability, accuracy, reliability, and space worthiness. The results of Phase I shall provide the critical design information required to build a deliverable prototype multigas sensor in Phase II. The Phase II effort will lead to the commercialization of a rugged, compact multigas sensor for use by NASA in space applications as well as in the commercial sector. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b> for the Federal Government include space-based </P>
<P>sensors for the study of biological systems, spacecraft safety, testing advanced fire suppression methodologies in reduced gravity and could also be used for scientific measurements relating to habitability, study of combustor performance, and use of natural resources on the moon and Mars. In the private sector, there is a need for low cost solid state sensors to replace more expensive existing commercial sensors sold for health and environmental monitoring of toxic gases, stack emissions, and chemical process streams. In addition, these could be used for ambient air monitoring in commercial aircraft, semiconductor production facilities, ship holds, fuel storage tanks, etc. </P>

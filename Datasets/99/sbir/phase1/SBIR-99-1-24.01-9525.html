<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>An integrated arm-head system appropriate for use with modern rovers will be developed, with the automated control of the mobile manipulator guided by stereo vision. The excitement created by NASA's planetary exploration program has motivated numerous organizations to seek technology development rovers, with the logical expansion of capabilities to include manipulation and stereo perception. Metrica's research indicates both an emerging market for rover compatible arms and heads, as well as a distinct lack of commercial products that meet rover requirements. Metrica proposes to develop a new, integrated arm-head system that is targeted towards a set of commercial rovers, indoor mobile bases, wheelchairs, and industrial AGV's. Like the Sony Walkman, the portable arm-head unit will create a new market by re-engineering technologies that are currently used in static operations, developing a lightweight system with integrated avionics and control processors that delivers high bandwidth eye-hand coordination. At the subsystem level, head innovations will include a rugged design capable of surviving rover rollovers while tracking the arm, with its light weight design, 2:1 strength to weight ratio and a novel stow geometry for a smooth profile and minimum inertia pose. Several of the targeted rover vendors eagerly await Metrica's development of this product. </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The emerging market for mobile manipulation has its roots in the DOE applications of the 1980's, with new found interest generated by NASA's planetary science missions with rovers. The immediate market is the robotics community's desire for rovers that interact with their environment, with Metrica receiving several requests per week for portable arm and head products. With customers in academia, national labs and overseas, this diverse group has seen our small manipulators and stereo vision heads in use at NASA, and is interested in their rover applications. Outdoor rovers will be outfitted with the new arm-head system for hazardous applications, security, agricultural and inspection tasks. Indoor mobile robots will use the arm-head system for service tasks, parts handling and transport, inventory control and office automation. Wheelchairs with the new arm and head will allow disable persons to perform domestic and office tasks. AGV's with this new system onboard will expand industrial automation with the ability to operate doors, hatches and bins that require human assistance for these existing machines. </P>

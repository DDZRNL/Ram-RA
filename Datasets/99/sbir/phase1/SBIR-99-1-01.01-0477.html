<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>EDAptive Computing, Inc. presents a Rapid Eye Tracking and INtegrated Application Toolkit (RETINA) concept for Topic 01.01: Human Factors in Aviation Operations. RETINA applies a low-cost, totally-passive eye tracking technology to enable rapidly building customized software applications that utilize eye tracking data (including gaze or glance information). It will enable real-time eye tracking, accurate to within +/-0.5º, at video frame rates, using only a low-cost digital camera. Our Phase I Objectives are to (1) confirm certain existing eye tracking capabilities" ability to satisfy the tracking requirements, (2) experimentally determine RETINA"s ability to satisfy the rest of the system performance requirements, (3) produce a preliminary design, and (4) produce a preliminary commercialization plan. Our Phase I effort includes (1) determining requirements, (2) configuring a test system, (3) conducting feasibility experiments, (4) preparing a preliminary design for Phase II, and (5) preparing an initial commercialization plan. The Phase I results will be experimental results and analytical proofs of feasibility, a preliminary design for Phase II implementation, and the preliminary commercialization plan. RETINA will support critical NASA research such as: (1) vision science research; (2) automated eye control of systems; (3) user interface development/testing; (4) crewstation design/testing; and (4) human perception research.</P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>Commercial applications are many and varied. In addition to hands-off control of computers and systems and handicapped-assistant applications, RETINA"s general purpose eye tracking capability may be used for (1) assessment of system users" behavior and effectiveness (how often and in what patterns they look at a certain region of a screen or machine they are operating), and (2) safety or attentiveness analyses (drowsiness or fatigue indicated by eye-movement patterns). Many market analysts foresee the advent of hands-off control of </P>
<P>everything from computers to automobiles. Furthermore, the use of such control to assist handicapped individuals is significant, as are the effectiveness and attentiveness analysis applications. Hence, the ability to work with a system which can track the eye motion and queue the machine or report the point-of-regard is paramount to these industries, and the volume of potential users for RETINA is enormous. Many coalitions of researchers are already forming, and we expect to find these organizations, participate with them, and bring RETINA to their attention as the tool of choice for their needs.</P>

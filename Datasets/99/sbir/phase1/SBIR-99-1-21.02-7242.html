<BLOCKQUOTE>
 We propose a new autonomous Web assistant that draws on a number of innovative 
technologies in order to intelligently mine information with a minimum of human 
interaction. The Active Web Assistant (AWARE) will utilize a novel two-promged 
approach to information retrieval. By simultaneously acting as a context-
sensitive search engine and as a proactive information resource development 
system, AWARE will be able to autonomously acquire and organize information 
resources in the context of their everyday work. Additionally, AWARE will work 
in the background to provide continuously improving results over time by 
applying progressively more sophisticated document clasification, document 
summarization, and graphically facilitated relevance feedback techniques. 
AWARE will provide NASA personnel with a dramatically improved awareness of Web 
information pertinent to their ongoing tasks. The prototype tool developed in 
our Phase I effort will prove the feasibility of our approach and provide the 
basis for a complete Phase II implementation of AWARE.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Scientists, managers, and other Internet users will benefit greatly from the development of AWARE by drastically reducing the amount of time spent engaged in information retrieval tasks. By improving the way in which the user accesses information, our tool will save time and money. to plant operators in process industries - such as chemical manufacturing and electrical power generation - where any human error results in extremely costly plant down-time.

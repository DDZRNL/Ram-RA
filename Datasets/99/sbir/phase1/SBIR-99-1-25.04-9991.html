<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>SSG proposes the development of an innovative, low-power, low-cost, high reliability, high acutator-density Deformable Mirror (DM). The concept is based on the application of an advanced PMN actuator array, developed by Lockheed Martin, for sonar applications. The innovative comb of actuators is produced with a very high purity (allowing thin active layers and reducing power requirements), bonded together to form compact arrays of actuators with small actuator to actuator separation (2 mm instead of the traditional 7 mm spacing), and addressed though a direct surface mount technology which eliminates the individual interconnects/wires to each discrete actuator. The device provides several critical benefits compared with existing technologies: reduced power (40 Volts peak voltage as opposed to the traditional 100-120 volt); reduced mass (due to the reduced power requirement, and the thin profile surface mount technology); improved reliability (due to the elimination of all of the individual interconnects to each actuator, through the surface mount connection technology); improved thermal stability; improved spatial resolution (2 mm actuator to actuator spacing); and  reduced cost (due to significant fabrication differences). These performance/cost benefits are critical for a number of next generation NASA mission concepts, where deployable, active optical systems are needed (ie; NGST). </P>

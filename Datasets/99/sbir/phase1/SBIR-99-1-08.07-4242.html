<P>Single-Walled Nanotubes for Improved Space Structure Adhesives </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Adhesives for space structures are often filled with metallic particles or other fillers to enhance thermal conductivity. Filled systems include both elastomeric adhesives such as the RTV silicones and high Tg thermoset adhesives. Addition of metallic fillers at the required levels results in a significant increase in weight and may degrade the strength or other mechanical properties of the adhesive. Foster-Miller is developing technology for the incorporation of functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes with extremely high (up to 5000:1) aspect ratios and thermal conductivity similar to that of diamond into a variety of organic materials. When these materials are dispersed into the organic matrix they can impart conductivity at low loading levels and can act as reinforcing agents, increasing the strength and stiffness of the matrix rather than degrading it. The functionalized nanotubes exhibit enhanced compatibility with the organic materials and can be chemically bonded to the matrix to enhance the reinforcing effect of the filler. Foster-Miller proposes to evaluate the performance of single walled nanotubes in one of several candidate adhesive systems as a function of purity, functionality and loading level. The thermal and mechanical properties of the adhesive system will be demonstrated, and target applications will be identified. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The proposed use of nanotube reinforcement of organic adhesives or composite matrix resins will result in lightweight, highly conductive adhesives and structural materials which are required for a wide range of military and commercial aerospace applications and thermal management of electronic systems. They will be used for attaching integrated circuits in electronic packages and as enclosures for electronic components and systems.</P>

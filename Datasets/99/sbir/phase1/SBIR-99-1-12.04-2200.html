<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>4K x 4K and Larger Detector Arrays Sensitive in near UV with large well depth </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>The overall objective of this SBIR Phase I research project is to explore the feasibility of very high resolution CMOS APS image sensors intended for use in near ultraviolet imaging for atmospheric and Earth surface studies.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Special attention will be paid to specifications dictated by NASA requirements, including pixel count, power consumption, array format, pixel design, and pixel size, with a specific focus on sensitivity in the near ultraviolet (300-400 nm). The effort in this research project has three specific technical objectives. The first one is to complete an architectural study for near ultraviolet(grayscale), large format CMOS APS image sensors tailored to NASA requirements. The second specific technical objective is the design and simulation of essential circuits required to enable the design of these image sensors. The third and final specific technical objective is to fully integrate a CMOS APS pixel array along with required periphery circuits. The integrated design will be verified and made ready for submission to the foundry for fabrication. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The high-resolution, low-power CMOS APS image sensor will fill a performance vacuum in the image sensor market, enabling high-resolution, low-power, miniature cameras at lower cost. The fact that Photobit CMOS APS image sensors can perform as well as CCDs, with the added benefit of lower power (10 to 100 times less) and integration of electronics (enabling miniaturization), allows them to not only compete in the same markets as CCDs, but also provide opportunities to expand the existing image sensor market. The proposed image sensor and the technical advances associated with its development are extremely important for other NASA space applications.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>They are also very important for consumer camera markets (digital still cameras, camcorders, video cellular phones, and high-end video conferencing). In addition, technical advances in the manufacture of high-resolution, low-power image sensors that are expected to result from this SBIR, will directly benefit Photobit's high volume, high-resolution, low-power sensor product lines (for example, machine vision and digital still camera). An additional market that is important in establishing Photobit's preeminence in the image sensor community is that of digital cinematography. The resolution required for a film movie camera replacement is minimally 2K x 3K pixels, going to 2K x 4K pixels. </P>

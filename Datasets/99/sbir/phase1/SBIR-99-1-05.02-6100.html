<BLOCKQUOTE>
The proposed Sanders Aerospace ModelMaker (AMM) system provides an innovative 
rapid prototyping method of fabricating aerospace wind tunnel test models that 
dramatically increases instrumentation effectiveness with reduced complexity, 
cost and construction time. The AMM uses an in-situ layered deposition process 
to build ceramic test models that withstand high temperatures and have fully 
integrated sensor instrumentation interconnectivity features. The process uses a 
novel variation of proven low temperature, co-fired ceramics (LTCC) technology 
employed successfully by the microelectronics industry. The AMM system enables 
Layered fabrication with CNC precision, accuracy, surface smoothness, and high 
fidelity scale test models of up to eighteen inches. The finite layer resolution 
allows detailed, high fidelity construction. Composite fabrication enables the 
body core, low thermal conductivity outer surface, sensor interconnect wiring, 
and hollow cavity structures as an integral model. The integrated 
instrumentation wiring can be used to form temperature sensing thermocouples by 
coating the model with nickel (the thermocouple is formed at the junction of the 
wire and the nickel) or used in pairs of conductors to connect resistive thermal 
detectors (RTD's) at up to 128 selected test points. The AMM will revolutionize 
the aerospace wind tunnel test model construction process and reduce model cost, 
complexity, and construction time.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   The U.S. Aero-Space Technology Enterprise must develop new tools, techniques, and technologies to reduce the aerospace vehicle development cycle by one-half. To ensure continued leadership in this multi-billion dollar industry, the U.S. will benefit by reducing the cost, complexity, and time to fabricate high fidelity wind tunnel with the use of the Sanders Aerospace ModelMaker system. This dual use technology will also find use in high temperature remote sensing for aerospace, industrial and chemical processing applications.

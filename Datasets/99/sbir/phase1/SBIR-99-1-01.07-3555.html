<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 01.07-3555 (Chron: 991724 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Wideband Tunable Fiber Laser </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>QorTek will develop an advanced hardware demonstration of a compact and functionally integrated tunable laser. The prototype will demonstrate a new dually opposed wideband extension-compression piezo-actuated approach to modulation that will enable larger wavelength excursion at sweep frequencies needed for emission or damage detection by NASA. The demonstration prototype will be VME board fiber modulation system that integrates dichroic and Bragg grating reflective optics, fiber laser tensioning assembly, piezoelectronic power electronics and polymeric damping. The project will yield an advanced wavelength tunable system and power electronics in more compact, higher performance package, suitable for densely populated VME integration. The result for this program shall be an advanced fully integrated development demonstration prototype. The prototype will be continuously tunable over ±10 nm (with ±10 nm extended goal) centered at 1550 nm in a 0.2 ft3. The design will be suitable for integration into a fiber-optic gas leakage and structural fault-detection system for NASA critical platforms such as X-33 and space shuttle. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>Several corporations including NorTel, MCI and ONI to commercial fiber communication and CiDRA for oil &amp; gas exploration are already seeking the Phase I design for possible commercial sale. The proposed tunable fiber modulation system is attracting interest from Boeing ISDS Phantom Works, Seattle WA. Boeing has immediate needs for optically integrable modulation for automated fault detection on JSF, space vehicles and aging aircraft. </P>

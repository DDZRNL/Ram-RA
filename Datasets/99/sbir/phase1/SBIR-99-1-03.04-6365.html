<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Solid Freeform Fabrication of ZrC/WRe Composites for Propulsion Applications </P>

<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>The goal of this program is to develop a rapid and low-cost solid free form fabrication (SFF) technique to produce critical non-eroding propulsion components. The propulsion materials required for these applications must be able to demonstrate excellent ablation and oxidation resistance at temperature approaching 3000 deg. C, an adequate load bearing capabilities, non-catastrophic failure modes, and be able to withstand transient thermal shock.</P>

<P>Under previous NASA program ACR has developed carbide-based Fibrous Monolith composites and High Pressure Extrusion Rapid Prototyping of Ceramics. Recently, ACR has had success with the consolidation of FM composites by Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP). The implication of this success is that green ceramic parts grown directly from a Rapid Prototyping Machine can be directly loaded with no additional tooling into a HIP and consolidated to near net shape, regardless of their geometric complexity. This eliminates labor intensive hand lay-up processing, tooling, and costand process limitations of Hot Pressing. To this end, ACR proposes to develop a SFF processing and HIP consolidation to fabricate low cost near net shape ZrC/WRe FM ceramic composite components for propulsion-related applications. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The proposed technology has tremendous potential for commercial applications. Ceramic composites produced by Fibrous Monolith technology are proven materials propulsion-related applications. In conjuction with SFF and hot isostatic pressing, these materials will be produced at a lower cost and faster rate, making them more attractive for high temperature propulsion related applications.</P>

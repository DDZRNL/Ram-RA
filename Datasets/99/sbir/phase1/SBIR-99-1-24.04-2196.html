<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Three Dimensionally Reinforced Membranes for Space Inflatables &amp; Deployables </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>NASA's Ultra Long Duration Balloon and Aerobot programs are seeking innovative and cost effective solutions to provide: high strength to weight composite envelope materials; efficient cost-effective seaming and fabrication techniques; deployment and inflation of balloon envelopes in planetary atmospheres; and innovative balloon design concepts. The proposed 3DR technology can meet all these challenges by providing: locally reinforced materials to optimize strength to weight; innovative gore fabrication and joining techniques to produce almost seamless structures; envelopes designed to efficiently handle multiple loading conditions including deployment and inflation; and adaptability to wide range of innovative designs and shapes. </P>
<P>The project's phase I objectives include analysis of factors for a prototype mission, definition of the required process, design specifications, cost estimates and a Phase II fabrication plan. The Phase I effort evaluates the feasibility and develops the specifications for a prototype design. The Phase II effort demonstrates the technology with a prototype that is designed and tested for an actual mission. The successful Phase II demonstration will trigger the necessary investment to develop a commercially viable technology. NASA's investment in this cross enterprise technology supports several of its critical thrust areas and provides an enabling technology for new innovative applications. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The proposed 3DR technology is adaptable to a wide range of commercial space, planetary and terrestrial applications. The ultra lightweight structures are specifically applicable to products including lighter-than-air vehicles for NASA's Space &amp; Earth Sciences and Planetary Aerobots programs, terrestrial atmospheric and climate studies, military and commercial communication and remote sensing applications. The technology also has application to space deployables such as solar sails, booms and large antennas. 3DR technology can provide more efficient structures with lower mass and smaller packed volumes than competing technologies. </P>

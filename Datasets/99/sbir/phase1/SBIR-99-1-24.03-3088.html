<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>In response to NASA’s requirement for advanced tele-operating robotic systems, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a high-fidelity, two-way video communication system that can ensure reliable video communication via progressive transmission and quotient coding modulation. During Phase I, POC will conduct two major efforts: (1) develop a scalable wavelet coder to compress the video data to reduce bandwidth and storage </P>
<P>space, and (2) develop a quotient coding modulation for compressed data to ensure low bit-error-rate data communication. A scalable coder will compress the data and arrange them from more important to less important bits. The bit stream can be truncated at any point and still retain a perceptible reconstructed image. After the coder, the video data will be further modulated with the quotient coding to increase its bit-error-rate performance. After the completion of this Phase I project, a software-based simulation system that can perform scalable two-way video data communication will be demonstrated. In Phase II, a two-way video communication system with an efficient user interface that facilitates intensive manual activities will be built. This system can provide improved operator efficiency for tele-operating robotic systems. </P>

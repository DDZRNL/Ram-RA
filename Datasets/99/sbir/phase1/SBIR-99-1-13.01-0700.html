<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>High-Output Cryogenic Actuator System </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Space-based optics systems require high-authority actuators that can be operated in cryogenic temperatures. The Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) has requirements of 6 mm of stroke and 2 nm of resolution at temperatures of ~35K. These systems must be robust to the extreme environment, highly reliable, and compact to meet increasingly more strict size and weight constraints. Few smart materials possess the required energy density or the ability to operate efficiently at cryogenic temperatures. For instance, the performance of piezoceramic materials as well as existing polycrystalline magnetostrictive materials (i.e Terfenol-D) drops off significantly (by ~65% and 95%, respectively) at low temperatures. As such, there is a need for advanced smart materials that are designed to operate in cryogenic environments and provide sufficient actuation authority. In addition, the mechanical design of the actuator system also is extremely important. It is necessary for the actuator to utilize the material in the most efficient way possible given it’s practical limitations. Herein, ACX proposes to develop and characterize a novel, high-efficiency, cryogenic actuation material, as well as develop an actuation system that makes use of the material. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The proposed actuator system would prove useful in a variety of applications which include underwater sonar systems, industrial valves and pumps, and process controls equipment. Industrial valves and pumps that are required to operate in cryogenic temperatures would especially benefit from the proposed program effort. </P>

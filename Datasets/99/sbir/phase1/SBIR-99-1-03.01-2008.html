<BLOCKQUOTE>
SECA, Inc. proposes to develop computational methodology to predict the effects 
of acoustic pressure oscillations on combusting flows in liquid rocket engines. 
The proposed methodology will serve to explain the causal physics of combustion 
driven acoustic resonances in liquid rocket engine combustor environments 
Relevant to the design strategy for controlling pressure oscillations and 
combustion instability. Problems arising from these processes are destructive 
pressure oscillations and temperature excursions which induce low and high cycle 
Fatigue in hot section components and in extreme cases engine failure. Such 
problems are particularly acute in hydrocarbon fueled engines which utilize 
impinger injector elements. Critical components of this methodology are: the 
computational algorithm in the flow solver, the chemical kinetics and spray 
dynamics of the combustion process, the turbulence model, the method of applying 
time accurate boundary conditions, and the geometric configurations of the 
propellant feed system and of the combustor. The proposed methodology will 
minimize the need for extensive, expensive trial-and-error testing which is the 
current design practice. The Phase II research shall validate the combusting 
flow methodology with an experimental study of subscale, but realistically 
configured, hydrocarbon liquid rocket engine combustor and analyze several full-
scale combustors.

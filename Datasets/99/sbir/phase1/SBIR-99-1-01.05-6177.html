<BLOCKQUOTE>
  This SBIR research (Phase I & II) is to develop a smart nondestructive testing 
(NDT) system for improved on-line inspection of composite structures in 
aircrafts, spacecrafts, and launch vehicles. The system uses a unique flexible 
surface-mounted transducer array to replace the conventional bulky and time-
consuming scanning mechanism for C-scan plot generation. It also draws on 
advantages from ultrasonic testing, mechanical impedance method, and frequency 
response (modal analysis) technologies. In Phase I, the new transducer element 
will be fabricated and tried out on composite specimens with different defects 
implanted. The transducer parameters will be optimized through experiments. 
Pattern recognition methodologies will be identified for defect 
characterization. The expert system for defect detection will be developed for 
the composite test specimens. Finally, the prototype setup for the NDT system 
will be tested to demonstrate its sensitivity for flaw detection. A successful 
research effort will provide NASA with a flexible, smart NDT system that works 
faster and more accurately than conventional methods. A further development of 
this AI-based NDT system may lead to its application in automation and robotics, 
where similar NDT tasks can be carried out in adverse or hostile environments.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   A flexible, smart NDT system with high reliability and low operating cost 
developed in this effort (Phase I & II) may be used for improved on-line NDT 
inspection on composite materials of NASA's interest, particularly on the 
composite parts with irregular surfaces. The equipment will have tremendous 
potential for commercialization in the rapidly growing market of composite 
materials worldwide. Further extension of this concept may result in its
application on metal and geologic materials.

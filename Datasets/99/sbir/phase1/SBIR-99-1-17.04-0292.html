<P><B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the last 40 years, hundreds of person-years have been spent by 
  NASA and others developing software that accurately predicts the behavior of 
  complex thermo/fluid/structural systems. In the last 15 years, these tools 
  have been made easier to use with graphical user interfaces and increased 
  connectivity between codes. However, almost all of this investment has been 
  made in point design simulation tools: given a specific design, the software 
  predicts how the design will perform under a specific set of conditions. This 
  approach has become so engrained that most engineers have forgotten that 
  what?s needed is precisely the opposite: given performance requirements and 
  goals, find the best performing design. Moreover, environmental conditions and 
  many performance characteristics are rarely known exactly, but rather 
  statistically: a single point design evaluation is by itself nearly 
  meaningless. <BR><BR>Fortunately, prior investment in infrastructure can be 
  applied to the next generation of tools that we propose to build. 
  <BR><BR>Variability is the key to the success of future design tools. 
  Parametric CAD systems are becoming the norm, but most mechanical analysis 
  tools have not kept pace. We led the way in NASA?s standard thermal control 
  analyzer, even introducing built-in design optimization and data correlation 
  modules. Now it is time for the next step. We will develop a means for 
  characterizing designs statistically, allowing a designer to understand the 
  risks in any design along with the cost of reducing those risks. We will also 
  develop advanced statistical design synthesis tools that can handle difficult 
  tasks such as selection problems and complex objectives. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Previously developed thermal/fluid design optimization tools are 
  already being successfully commercialized, and concurrent developments are 
  targeting optimized thermal/structural integration of electronic packaging. 
  The commercial demands for high-level design optimization tools will assure 
  the commercialization of the resulting software, including the results of the 
  Phase I project. <BR><BR><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

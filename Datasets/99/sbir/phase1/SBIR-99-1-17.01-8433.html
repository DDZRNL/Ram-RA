<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>Attitude Control for Satellite Flywheel Energy Storage Systems </P>

<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>Integration of two primary, housekeeping functions aboard all satellites is possible with the entrance of the flywheel energy storage system. The energy storage function is easily identifiable. The enabling technology that allows the storage and retrieval of electrical energy in this system is the ability to rotate a flywheel rotor at very high rotational rates. Accelerating the flywheel rotor with an electric motor changes the electrical energy into angular momentum.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Converting the stored angular momentum in the rotor back to electrical energy is accomplished using the same electric motor as a generator. The second housekeeping function that is implied by the conversion of electrical energy to angular momentum is the attitude control function usually associated additional hardware aboard the satellite. The attitude control function normally relies on a combination of momentum wheels, control moment gyroscopes and attitude adjustment thrusters. USFS proposes to eliminate both the electro-chemical battery system and any existing attitude control system hardware by incorporating both functions into a single Momentum and Energy Storage Subsystem. User requirements, present flywheel technology capabilities and gimbal systems are combined integrating the energy storage and attitude control housekeeping functions required by most satellites. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>The suggested substitution of a Momentum and Energy Storage Subsystem into future satellite programs sponsored by the NASA relates equally well with both Department of Defense and the growing telecommunications industries’ future satellite programs. The potential savings in launch weight and volume will allow all satellite programs to realize the payback in proceeding beyond the SBIR Phase II program. Improvements in the total system life are also significant USFS has a unique competitive advantage as one of the oldest and most advanced flywheel companies in the United States (over 20 years’ experience). The company is on its 3rd generation FESS design; the prior two have demonstrated success in all objectives. USFS has been selected as the flywheel contractor to develop hardware for the planned International Space Station flight test experiment. </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>
<P>This proposal presents an innovative application of pulse detonation combustion (PDC) technology by combining a gas turbine (GT) cycle with pulse detonation combustors to create a hybrid GT/PDC engine. The proposed hybrid GT/PDC engine would offer significant performance advantages compared to constant pressure combustion engines, for SSTO low speed propulsion and hypersonic propulsion. In addition, the hybrid GT/PDC engine could result in a size, complexity and cost reduction relative to multiple engine "over/under" and variable cycle engines currently proposed for low and high speed applications. </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>
<P>The innovation described in this proposal would provide an important advance in the state of the art for high speed airbreathing propulsion systems. The hybrid GT/PDC engine developed under this program would enable the development of many vehicle specific applications, including supersonic transports, commercial </P>
<P>launch vehicles(Multi-STO, SSTO), UAV's, UCAV's and wide variety of missiles. The hybrid engine would expand the flight envelopes of such platforms into the supersonic and hypersonic realms. Many commercial applications exist for Pulse Detonation Engine (PDE) technology. Some promising commercial applications appear to be those in which the PDE is integrated with traditional propulsion devices to form combined-cycle or hybrid systems (the subject of this proposal). Potential hybrid propulsion system applications include Single-Stage-to-Orbit (SSTO),and supersonic and hypersonic vehicles such as the High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT). </P>

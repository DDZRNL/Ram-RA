<P><b>PROPOSAL NUMBER</b> 99-1 24.04-9500 (Chron: 991284 )</P>
<P><b>PROJECT TITLE</b></P>
<P>A Lightweight Modular Solar Array Subsystem for ULDB Missions </P>
<hr>
<P><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></P>

<P>The NASA Ultra-Long Duration Balloon (ULDB) program will extend the capabilities of the existing high-altitude scientific balloon program. ULDB objectives include developing a low-cost, integrated system capable of supporting operations above 100,000 feet for durations as long as 100 days. The ULDB power system must provide up to 2 kW for missions from polar to equatorial latitudes. Global Aerospace Corporation has examined power generation subsystem alternatives and has developed an innovative design which is lightweight and meets the requirements with a very low mass and cost. </P>

<P>The major innovations proposed are: </P>

<P>* Concept for two-axis Sun pointing which does not require rotation, </P>
<P>* Lightweight mechanism for deploying and restowing a solar array, and </P>
<P>* Lightweight solar array based upon solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle programs. </P>

<P>During the Phase I program we will: design and prototype the deployment, tracking and restowing subsystems; design the modular power generation unit; and develop a solar array subsystem specification. In Phase II we will complete the detailed design, development, and fabrication of a demonstration model of the solar array subsystem. </P>

<P><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></P>

<P>A lightweight and modular ULDB solar array subsystem will minimize mission costs through reduction in fabrication and operations costs. By reducing costs, more NASA missions are enabled and commercial interest is enhanced. In addition, the low mass design provides more mass to enhance scientific payload capability. This solar array subsystem design will also provide a low cost, high power option for conventional short duration NASA balloon missions and Air Force and other international balloon programs. In addition, the unique features of the solar array pointing design has future application to the pointing of balloon-borne antennas, reflectors, instruments, and to the pointing of commercial, terrestrial solar array systems. </P>

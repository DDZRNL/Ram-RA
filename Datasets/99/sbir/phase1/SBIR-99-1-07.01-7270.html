<P><B><b>PROJECT TITLE</b>:</B> Oxygen/Carbon Dioxide Miniature Sensor for Space 
Bioreactors 
<P><B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Giner, Inc. proposes to develop a miniature electrochemical sensor 
  that detects, in a single sensor, dissolved O2 as well as CO2 for use in space 
  bioreactors. The proposed sensor will be insensitive to membrane fouling and 
  hydrodynamic effects, providing accurate measurements without recalibration. 
  The oxygen detection method will use a novel mode of sensing that is 
  insensitive to fluid flow and membrane fouling. By using a CO2 sensing scheme 
  that involves chemisorbing a "reduced-CO2" species on a platinum electrode and 
  then stripping by anodically ramping, we can measure CO2 using the same 
  working electrode or a second working electrode within the same sensor. Signal 
  will be linearly related to pCO2, rather than logarithmically related as in 
  conventional (Severinghaus) CO2 detection, leading to greater accuracy. A 
  periodic, steady-state oxygen measurement will indicate the extent of fouling 
  and a correlation will be developed to correct the CO2 measurement.

<P><B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>A miniaturized dissolved O2/CO2 sensor that is insensitive to 
  fouling is anticipated to have widespread application in the biotechnology 
  industry. There is a growing recognition that controlling O2 and CO2 levels is 
  essential to optimizing the production of human therapeutics using mammalian 
  cell culture. Bacterial, plant and insect cell cultures can also benefit from 
  close monitoring of dissolved gases. There are no commercial combination 
  O2/CO2 sensors and even the availability of dissolved CO2 probes is very 
  limited. The Giner, Inc. proposed miniature sensor would be less than a third 
  the diameter of current commercial probes and will be less sensitive to 
  fouling and stirring than current products. <BR><BR><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

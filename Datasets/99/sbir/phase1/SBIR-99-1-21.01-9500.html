<P><B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will 
  examine the feasibility of developing autonomous control software for a 
  scientific instrument that detects atmospheric trace gases using infrared 
  tunable diode lasers (TDLs). Tunable diode laser instruments provide selective 
  and extremely sensitive detection of trace gases, and could play a major role 
  in in-situ atmospheric measurements that complement and support NASA's broad 
  array of space-based measurements in the Earth Science program. However, 
  current TDL instruments require frequent intervention by a human operator. 
  Recent advances in information technology provide computational techniques 
  that can automatically perform the functions of the human operator. In 
  particular, through an innovative combination of advanced automation 
  techniques from robotics and machine learning, an autonomous TDL instrument 
  for atmospheric monitoring will be developed. <BR><BR><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The ease of operation of the autonomous TDL instrument will 
  greatly increase the opportunities for deployment and create new commercial 
  markets for this instrument. In the research arena, infrared tunable diode 
  laser instruments could be used for in-situ measurements of atmospheric trace 
  species. In addition, TDL instruments will be well-suited for use in state and 
  federal automobile emissions monitoring programs once the current research 
  type instrument is redesigned into a more fully autonomous and robust field 
  instrument. Trace gas detection is also commercially important for industrial 
  process monitoring in the semiconductor industry, for petroleum exploration, 
  and for industrial combustion monitoring. The innovation proposed here would 
  make the TDL instrument more attractive and economically feasible for these 
  applications. <BR><BR><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

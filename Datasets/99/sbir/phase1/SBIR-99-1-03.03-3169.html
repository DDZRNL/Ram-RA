<BLOCKQUOTE>
  A major objection to the use of nuclear energy for space applications is the 

perceived risk involved in the launching of a fully fueled nuclear reactor. Even 

when it is pointed out that the fuel is in fact not radioactive, concerns 

persist. It is acknowledged that to design a reactor able to withstand all 

conceivable launch accidents would result in an impractical heavy design. 

To avoid the above problem and to put to rest any concerns, it is proposed that 

the reactor be launched without fuel or partially fueled to avoid any 

possibility of the reactor attaining criticality in the event of a launch 

accident. This SBIR proposal describes an innovative approach to permit the 

reactor to be fueled in space in a simple operation.

<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   It is acknowledged that full commercialization of space will require major 

sources of energy in a compact form. The only currently feasible energy source 

for the foreseeable future is nuclear. The use of nuclear energy has been

repearably frustrated by the concerns described above. Whether or not those 

concerns are viewed as realistic, in the current climate it is unlikely that 

nuclear energy will get off the ground unless these concerns are satisfactorily

addressed. The approach described in this SBIR effectively puts these concerns 

at rest.

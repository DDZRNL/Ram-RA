<P><B><b>PROJECT TITLE</b>:</B> Sensor for SOx Species by Ultra-Sensitive IR Quantum 
Cascade Laser Absorption 
<P><B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) proposes to develop a compact, 
  portable, ultrasensitive SO2/SO3 sensor system based on quantum cascade laser 
  absorption in the 7 to 9 µm spectral region. The sensor will have applications 
  in laboratory and combustor test stand measurements related to the development 
  of advanced gas turbine engines for subsonic jet aircraft, and specifically 
  addresses the need to characterize proportionation and atmospheric 
  environmental impacts of oxidized fuel-bound sulfur in the engine exhaust. The 
  use of novel quantum cascade laser technology in the sensor will enable the 
  first high-sensitivity detection of SOx species at mid-IR wavelengths with a 
  near-room temperature, single-mode laser. The proposed Phase I effort will 
  demonstrate the feasibility and sensitivity of detection of SO2 by this 
  method, and will design a prototype instrument for delivery to NASA in Phase 
  II. <BR><BR><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The SOx sensor has commercial potential in the aerospace, 
  chemical, petrochemical, and environmental monitoring industries. The sensor 
  can be used as a fenceline contamination or pollution monitor at airports, 
  petrochemical processing plants, or combustion-based power generation 
  facilities. <BR><BR><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

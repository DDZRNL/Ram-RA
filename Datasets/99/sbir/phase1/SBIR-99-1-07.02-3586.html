<P><B><b>PROJECT TITLE</b>:</B> Using Magnetic Levitation to Study Gravity's Effect on 
Protein Crystal Growth 
<P><B><b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>This project deals with determining the differences between 
  protein crystals grown in a microgravity environment and those grown in a 
  mangetic levitation environment. It will thereby work to determine if magnetic 
  force levitation has a role in simulating microgravity. If so, magnetic 
  levitation can make it possible to test a Space Station protein crystal growth 
  experiment before it is flown on the Space Station. Once fully developed and 
  demonstrated, this capability will be a vital tool in growing crystals that 
  can yield high resolution data for structural based drug design and for 
  government, industry and university macromolecular researchers.

<P><B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The commercial application could take the form of a commercial 
  magnet and dynamic crystal growth facility for routine processing of 
  bio-crystalline materials. There is also the potential for developing a 
  commercially Available instrument. Like other large-scale instruments based on 
  magnetism, it could be used in either the private sector or at a National 
  Facility. <BR><BR><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

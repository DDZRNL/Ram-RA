<p>6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>Due to stringent quality demands placed on military and civilian structures, 
novel materials such as composites are finding increased use in high performance 
applications. Recently, F&S and research team members successfully addressed the 
processing and cost issues associated with composite materials by introducing a 
novel fabrication method that uses thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer 
(TLCP) reinforcement fibers. The TLCP reinforced composites are excellent for 
cryogenic applications because they offer a barrier to liquid hydrogen, liquid 
nitrogen, and liquid oxygen and the TLCP fibers have no measurable thermal 
expansion over a wide range of temperatures, thus significantly reducing 
structural cracking resulting from thermal cycling. During the Phase I program, 
the F&S team will focus on designing and fabricating composite storage tanks 
that are lighter in weight than existing tanks, more cryogenically stable, and 
non-reactive to liquid oxygen. The approach involves using a rotational molding 
process to produce a pure TLCP liner that will serve as the cryogenic liquid 
barrier that will be filament wound with bicomponent polyolefin/TLCP fibers to 
provide strength and stiffness. This program supports the rapid growth area that 
exists for composite materials in the next generation of cryogenic structures 
where composites can provide significant advantages.  </p> 

<p>7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>The inherent advantages of composite technology in cryogenic environments will 
enable significant market penetration in industries where non-magnetic, light-
weight, thermally stable, and non-reactive components are required. These multi-
billion dollar markets include, 1) the magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) 
industry that will benefit significantly from non-metallic cryogenic system 
components, 2) medical treatment facilities and hospital operating theaters 
where liquid oxygen systems will function with increased lifetime and 
reliability due to non-reactive composite storage containers and ducts, and 3) 
the food processing industry where belt freezing systems are used for high cash 
value food.

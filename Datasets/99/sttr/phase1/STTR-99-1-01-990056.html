<p>6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>NASA has determined that there is a high payoff in developing carbon  nanotube-
reinforced composites for applications in aerospace  transportation, molecular 
devices, electronics and other space-related  technologies. However, such 
projected benefits have not been achieved due  to the difficulties in aligning 
and dispersing the nanotubes in a  composite matrix. In addition, fibers at 
fracture surfaces show poor  adhesion between the resin and the nanotubes. </p>

<p>Recently, Advanced Ceramics Research Inc. (ACR) showed that it is possible  to 
induce orientation of fibers during the extrusion process and control  the 
properties of the resulting parts. ACR and the University of Arizona  (UA) have 
developed an extrusion freeform fabrication (EFF) process for a  range of 
ceramics and polymer matrix composites. Complicated silicon  nitride blisks and 
nozzles have been fabricated successfully with a high-  pressure extrusion head 
retrofitted to a Stratasys Fused Deposition  Modeler (FDM) equipment. </p>

<p>In the proposed STTR Phase I program, the ACR/UA team will produce high- 
strength composites, transparent coatings and electrically conductive  materials 
from polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and epoxy reinforced with  single-walled carbon 
nanotubes. Melt blending will be used to mix the  nanotubes and the resin. The 
extrusion during freeforming will produce  large extensions and induce 
orientation of the nanotubes. The composite  properties will be controlled by 
depositing fibers at different  orientations to the sample axis. The University 
will optimize the  composite system, as well as test the mechanical, optical and 
electrical  properties of the parts. </p>

<p>7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>Solid freeform extrusion of carbon nanotube reinforced polymers would  
successfully demonstrate the promise of carbon nanotubes to create  advanced 
high-strength composites and other nanotechnology devices. This program would 
allow ACR to enter four commercial areas. These would  include: (1) freeform 
fabrication of carbon nanotube reinforced composites  and parts as a service, 
(2) sales of retrofit equipment to companies  wishing to perform their own 
fabrication of nanotube reinforced composites  in-house using current FDM 
technology, (3) sales of feed material to those  fabricating nanotube reinforced 
polymer parts in-house, and (4)  development of feedstock material for use by 
FDM and other freeform  fabrication techniques such as Shaped Deposition 
Modeling. Other possible  uses for carbon nanotubes would be as a reinforcing 
component to improve  the strength and maintain the high fracture toughness of 
ACR's Fibrous  Monolith composites.

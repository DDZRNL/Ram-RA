<p>6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>Future space-based telescopes will require large aperture primary mirrors 
ranging from 8 meters for Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) to 20 meters 
for N-NGST within several decades. Such large aperture telescopes will enable 
unprecedented resolution and light-gathering power; but these desirable merits 
come with the requirement of significant advances in materials and processing 
for reasonable weight, cost, and lead-time. We propose to investigate novel 
processing methods that enable the shaping of polymer films into an arbitrary 
prescribed surface intermediate between a flat, stress-free, state and a concave 
shape achieved by a thermoforming process. Once the prescribed surface has been 
achieved, the films can be incorporated as off-axis conical sections of a 
deployable segmented mirror incorporating active surface control. Alternatively, 
the polymer film mirrors could be used as seamless large aperture mirrors due to 
their intrinsic packaging capability. In our approach, we will exploit the 
unique characteristics of shape memory polymers to release stored mechanical 
energy by retracting upon heating to a critical temperature. More specifically, 
we will use a focused and rastered laser beam to locally induce retraction while 
monitoring the local surface normal with a second probing laser beam. </p>

<p>7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>There are numerous applications for shape-memory polymers including: pipe-  
fitting; electronic equipment; automotive parts; devices for dilation of blood 
vessels; clothing; padding materials in shoes; eye-glass frames; auto-chokes for 
engines and sensors; toys; containers; sporting goods; and packaging materials.

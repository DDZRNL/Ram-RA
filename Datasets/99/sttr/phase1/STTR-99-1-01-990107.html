<p>6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>The recent development of methods to create multi gram amounts of carbon 
nanotubes in aligned arrays is yet to be exploited for the fabrication of 
structural composites. Busek proposes, along with its team member Boston 
College, to create composites based on in-situ grown, aligned arrays of carbon 
nanotubes. A composite that harnesses the unique properties of carbon 
nanotubes(CNTs) will have exceptional strength and high specific  stiffness. 
Other properties may be thermal conductivity, chemical inertness and high 
electrical conductivity. Busek Co. Inc. developing CNT based field emission 
cathodes for aerospace applications and we are herein proposing to apply their 
experience to structural applications of CNTs as reinforcing fibers in polymer - 
ceramic matrix composites with the assistance of Dr. Z. Ren, at Boston College, 
who, while at SUNY Buffalo, developed a technique to align nanotubes during 
their growth. </p>

<p>In Phase I, Dr. Ren's nanotube growth technique will be transferred to Busek, 
who will begin to synthesize aligned arrays of nanotubes. Busek will prepare 
composites using the aligned nanotubes, which will be characterized and 
mechanically tested at Boston College.</p> 

<p>The ultimate goal of the program is to develop the entire process for the 
production of nanotube composites, aligned and optimized for structural 
applications. Success will enable the production of continuous CNT filaments and 
crystaline ropes for applications such as space tethers and as light weight 
electrical wires.</p> 

<p>7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>Carbon nanotubes can greatly improve the properties of structural composites. 
CNT stress transfer efficiency is estimated to be at least an order of magni-
tude larger than in conventional fiber-based composites.  This is expected to 
result in composites with higher specific strength, stiffness and/or toughness 
depending on the application. The corresponding weight reduction will benefit 
all military and commercial aerospace vehicles. CNTs can also reinforce 
composites with metal and ceramic matrices. </p>

<p>The proposed program will also benefit other non-structural applications of CNTs 
including those in the microelectronic, microelectromechanical(MEM)industries.</p>

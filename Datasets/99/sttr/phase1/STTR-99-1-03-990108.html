<p>6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>'Free-Space Activated Optics' promises to very substantially reduce development 
time and lifecycle costs to meet objectives proposed for Origins, Explorer and 
DS missions. The percentage of mission costs being absorbed by the need to 
develop more sophisticated and expensive optic/optoelectronic systems to meet 
the increasingly stringent requirements for precision detection and measurement 
is constantly rising. Not only expenditure, but complexity of active optics that 
include induced strain actuators with their wiring bus, power electronics, 
control/filter electronics and "local" sensing electronics needs is 
exponentially increasing. This raises serious concerns in regard to reliability 
and repeatability, lifetime, fabrication costs (overruns) and manufacture 
tolerance and long development times that are increasingly application specific 
and quickly redundant. Free-space activated optics offers a compact and low 
power solution that simplifies and decouples the wiring bus, power electronics 
and control from the primary or secondary optics. Not only will this technology 
substantially reduce mission costs and but it offers to realize previously 
unobtainable implementation of key mission requirements for many deep space 
astrophysics platforms providing a new level of resolution capability. </p>



<p>7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>The results of this research are important for 'real world' NASA, military and 
commercial applications. QorTek is exploring with Raytheon Optical Systems and 
Boeing ISDS the introduction of a practical compact, lightweight solution system 
to a wide range of earth communication and observation satellites. The multiple 
commercial applications of the proposed technology have surfaced for Raytheon's 
worldwide markets in optical telescope and particularly adaptive correction.</p>

<p>6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>In this project, a lightweight membrane mirror device will be integrated into an 
adaptive control system, capable of correcting static and dynamic primary-mirror 
shape errors in a space-based telescope. The core innovation will be the use of 
a multi-zone, deformable mirror fabricated by thin-film surface micromachining. 
Contour shape of the mirror membrane will be controlled by an array of 
electrostatic actuators, each of which can deform a local subaperture. 
Electrostatic actuation holds considerable promise for membrane mirror shape 
control because it offers nearly reversible (i.e. low power) actuation, no 
hysteresis, and nanometer-scale precision and repeatability. Prototype 
micromachined deformable mirror (µDM) devices show promise: they are one hundred 
times faster, one hundred times smaller, and consume ten thousand times less 
power than the commercially available macroscopic DMs. The project team has 
produced the first continuous membrane zone-controlled µDMs: a critically 
important step in the development of large-aperture, space-based, lightweight 
mirror systems. Core research areas to be addressed in this project include 
development of optical thin-film reflective coatings for µDM membranes, 
demonstration of feasibility of a µDMs in a closed loop adaptive optical system, 
and design improvements to µDMs to allow more actuators, larger apertures, and 
curved substrates. </p>


<p>7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>Micromachined deformable mirrors (µDMs) promise to alter the field of adaptive 
optics by providing a low power, compact, high performance, economical 
alternative to existing systems. The emergence of µDMs is likely to extend the 
field of adaptive optics from its roots in astronomical imaging systems to the 
commercially important, emerging areas such as laser based communications, 
biomedical imaging, laser welding, and terrestrial imaging. Also, because of 
their compactness and low power, such devices may find significant applications 
in space-based optical imaging systems that require dynamic or static 
compensation of flexible or segmented primary mirrors. A low-cost, low-power, 
modular deformable mirror system is likely also to find considerable market in 
the emerging area of image enhancement and beam formation.

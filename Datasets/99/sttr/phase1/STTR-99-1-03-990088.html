<p>6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>The proposed program would demonstrate the feasibility of electrostatic self-
assembly (ESA) processes for the low-cost fabrication of adaptive reflector 
membranes for space-based optical systems. ESA processing involves coating solid 
substrates by the alternate adsorption of anionic and cationic complexes of 
polymers, metallic nanoclusters and other molecules from water-based solutions 
at room temperature and pressure. By controlling the molecular structure created 
in the resulting multilayer thin film, materials with different properties may 
be formed, including optical filters and mirrors, electrostrictive actuator 
elements, ultrahigh conductivity interconnecting thin film leads, and ultrahard 
surface protection coatings. NanoSonic has licensed nine strategic ESA patents 
from Virginia Tech to enable materials and device commercialization. During the 
Phase I program, NanoSonic would work with Virginia Tech to demonstrate the 
feasibility of the ESA process for integrated reflector/actuator device 
fabrication, high conductivity element interconnects, and surface protecting 
coatings. Several large industrial partner companies would provide input during 
Phase I concerning ESA process scale-up and device testing, and would offer 
opportunities for Phase II development partnering. </p>



<p>7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>New ESA-formed optical, electrostrictive, conductive and abrasion resistant thin 
films have widespread applications in adaptive optical products for space-based, 
industrial and consumer use. The ESA process allows a powerful tool for the low-
cost manufacturing of these and other thin films, devices and ferroelectric-like 
materials.</p>

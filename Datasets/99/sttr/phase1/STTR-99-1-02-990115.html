<p>6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>NASA's objective for affordable access to space requires inexpensive production 
of rocket fuel. The key to achieving this objective is the production of 
hydrogen, since hydrogen accounts for more than 80% of the fuel cost. TDA 
Research, Inc. (TDA), collaborating with Louisiana State University (LSU), 
proposes a novel hydrogen production method that offers significant advantages 
over conventional hydrogen manufacturing technologies, including process 
simplification, milder reforming reaction conditions, elimination of the need 
for shift catalysts, and improved energy efficiency. The novel process can use a 
very low steam-to-carbon ratio in the steam reforming process to decrease the 
cost of operation. </p>

<p>The key research problem is the development of a catalyst that can operate 
effectively in the reformer under the process conditions. In Phase I, TDA will 
formulate the catalyst, determine its activity under simulated conditions and 
evaluate the economics of the process. </p>

<p>7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>The system produces hydrogen with high efficiency and at low cost. Hydrogen 
markets are growing rapidly, and lower cost hydrogen is crucial to many 
industries. Hydrogen is used in petroleum refining (to improve gasoline yields 
and quality, producing cleaner burning gasoline) and chemical manufacturing 
(ammonia synthesis, production of methanol and Fischer-Tropsch liquids.</p>

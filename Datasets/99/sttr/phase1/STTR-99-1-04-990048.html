<p>6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>The objective of this proposal is to develop a highly automated software system 
for rapid geometry modeling and grid generation for turbomachinery applications. 
The proposed system features a graphical user interface for interactive control, 
a direct interface to commercial CAD systems, support for IGES geometry output, 
and a scripting capability for parametric definition of geometries and for 
obtaining a high level of automation. In addition, the scripting facility 
enables elaborate end-user customization of the tool. </p>

<p>The design of the proposed system and the beta testing of the software will be 
done in collaboration with the Center of Gas Turbines and Power at Penn State 
University (Dr. Lakshminarayana) and Dresser Rand (Dr. Lee Hill). </p>

<p>In Phase I, a prototype of the system will be developed and demonstrated on an 
important subclass of turbomachinery geometries, such as impellers. This Phase 
will demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. In Phase II, the full system 
will be developed and tested on a wide variety of turbomachinery geometries. 
Additional industry participation is also planned.</p>



<p>7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>The proposed system addresses an important need in the turbomachinery design and 
analysis world; therefore, a significant interest from this industry is 
envisioned. The script based, parametric geometry and grid generation system has 
tremendous potential in a large variety of applications: from simple but 
repetitive geometries (electronic cooling, MEMS, heat exchangers) to parametric 
changes in more complex shapes (turbomachinery, airfoils). The parametric 
capability can also impact the design and optimization process of fluidic 
applications by providing a rapid turnaround on grids/models, essential in a 
design setting.

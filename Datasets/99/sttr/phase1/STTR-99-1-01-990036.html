<p>6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>Tailored carbon nanofibers are under development at Florida Atlantic University. 
These materials exhibit an uncommon double-layer capacitance at high requencies; 
this feature makes them desirable for electrochemical  capacitor applications. 
Their power and energy characteristics may be  dramatically improved by surface 
functionalization using processes  developed at Inorganic Specialists, Inc. 
Functional groups are attached  which undergo reversible redox reactions (i.e., 
they provide  pseudocapacitance). Preliminary results show that unctionalization 
increases the nanofiber's stored energy by 100 to 400%, and that the energy 
enhancement occurs at both low and high frequencies. </p>

<p>The Phase I objective is to establish that surface-modified nanofibers can  be 
made into exceptional high frequency energy storage materials. The  work has two 
components. 1) High frequency capacitance nanofibers will be  tailored with a 
maximum amount of edge plane sites. This should foster the  attachment of a 
maximum number of energy-enhancing surface groups. 2) Surface functionalization 
procedures will be further developed, and  functionalized nanocarbons will be 
tested for performance and  electrochemical stability. Based on these two 
studies, an optimized  material will be produced; its performance will show the 
feasibility of  functionalized nanofiber materials. </p>

<p>7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>Energy storage materials with high frequency capacitance and high power  are 
needed for wireless digital communication applications and pulse  digital 
technology. The largest markets are in cellular phones and  pagers; other 
applications are in satellite and defense technology. The  development of new 
high-power, high-frequency capacitance concepts is  consistent with the ever-
increasing powers and frequencies required in new  generations of these 
applications. </p>

<p>The surface modification procedures of this proposal have broad  applicability: 
they can improve the power and energy storage of any carbon  or nanocarbon 
material. Phase I will demonstrate feasibility and  practicality, and is 
anticipated that Phase II will yield materials with an  eight- or ten-fold 
improvement in energy/power over the best nanocarbon  capacitor materials 
currently available.</p>

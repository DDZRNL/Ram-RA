<p>6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>The proposed actuator is an innovative combination of reliable electro-magnetic 
(EM) motors and a sprag locking mechanism. It provides reliable accurate 
positioning with zero hold power and a long 6 mm stroke in a compact package. It 
is also rugged, capable of operation at cryogenic temperatures and contains no 
high-cost materials. It is designed to position and align the deployable primary 
mirror segments of space-based observatories such as NGST. It may also be 
capable of providing the additional force required for static deformation of 
primary irror segments.</p> 

<p>The concept consists of two electro-magnetic motors that simultaneously unlock 
sprag devices and apply a motive force to moving slide element. The actuator 
locks against bi-directional forces and allows precise positioning over a large 
range of load conditions. </p>

<p>When the coils are unpowered, two three-dimensional sprag mechanisms lock the 
load securely in place. Sprags provide mechanically leveraged locking action. 
Relatively small preload springs hold the sprag arms in place where they can 
support much larger launch loads. Lorentz-force motors simultaneously apply 
force to the load slide and the sprags. Motion is initiated when the motor force 
exceeds the sprag spring release force. </p>



<p>7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>Near-term aerospace applications include NGST and other deployable 
observatories. Additionally, the large-aperture ground-based telescope community 
will also be able to utilize it for segment control once it has been developed 
and proven. When cost has been reduced, the actuator will also be useful for 
alignment of smaller optics in a larger variety of programs. It is possible that 
large-aperture membrane mirrors may become more feasible with this technology. 
LHDC's competitive edge is and will continue to be the development of cost-
effective approaches to providing actuators with extended performance 
capability.</p>

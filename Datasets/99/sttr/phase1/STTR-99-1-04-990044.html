<p>6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>The goal of the proposed Phase I STTR effort is to develop silicon-based 
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) synthetic microjets to actively control 
aerodynamic flow in turbine engines. Synthetic microjets are small, lightweight 
fluidic actuators that create small-scale flow perturbations to effect large-
scale changes in the overall flow field. The inherent size and weight advantages 
of silicon-based synthetic microjets make them highly attractive for flow 
control in aerospace systems, where macro-scale actuators and complex flow 
control systems are generally not feasible. In Phase I, microfabrication 
technology for silicon-based synthetic microjets will be developed to 
manufacture a 3 by 3 array of microjets to be characterized using Schlieren 
photography and hot-wire anemometry. In parallel with hardware development, 
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) calculations will be performed to investigate 
the feasibility to improve the compressor flow separation characteristics and to 
control the aerodynamic vibration and noise of the turbine.  </p>



<p>7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>The proposed effort will develop a design methodology and manufacturing process 
to fabricate miniaturized MEMS-based microjet devices, thereby reducing the 
size, cost, and integration issues associated with conventional flow control 
systems. This enabling technology will yield performance benefits to a wide 
range of NASA and commercial applications including turbine engine rotor/stator 
flow control, aircraft flight control augmentation, aircraft performance 
enhancement, and active rotorcraft vibration and noise reduction.

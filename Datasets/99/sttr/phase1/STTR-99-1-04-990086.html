<p>6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>Computation of flows in turbomachinery blade rows is critical to aircraft engine 
design optimization. Past techniques have fallen short because they require an 
assumption of steady or unsteady flow when these flows are known to include both 
steady and unsteady effects. The proposed CE/SE method is a breakthrough CFD 
technique, allowing the treatment of steady and unsteady problems with the same 
calculation. Developed originally at NASA GRC, this technique has never before 
been applied to turbomachinery. This innovative STTR program proposes to apply 
and validate this new technique for turbomachinery for the first time, offering 
a step increase in computational accuracy for analysis of turbomachinery. 
Improved understanding of steady and unsteady blade-row interaction effects will 
lead to reduced engine design cycle time, improved design capabilities, and 
reduction in testing requirements. Better understanding of blade-row 
interactions, and how to account for them in design, could lead to greater 
engine stable operating range, reduced specific fuel consumption, longer engine 
life, and improved safety. This technology could be applied to meet several key 
identified needs at NASA, including new analytical methods for computational 
aeroacoustics, fan/jet flow management, and rapid generation of detailed 
geometry for turbomachinery to reduce engine design cycle time and cost. </p>



<p>7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>The proposed technology will have broad commercial use in CFD programs for 
design optimization of aircraft turbine engines, plus a tremendous array of 
industrial equipment, such as industrial compressors, turbochargers, 
refrigeration compressors, turbopumps, and both steam and gas turbines for  
power generation and marine applications.

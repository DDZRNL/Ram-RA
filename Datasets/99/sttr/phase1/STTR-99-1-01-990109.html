<p>6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>Composite material processing routinely uses continuous and/or woven fiber 
systems as reinforcement. This STTR project will develop continuous micron-size 
fibers made of single-walled carbon nanotubes aligned within a polymer binder. 
These fibers can be manipulated, layed up, processed in tows, wound, and even 
woven using current manufacturing expertise. Nanotubes are expected to have 
tremendous properties (strength, stiffness, thermal and electrical conductivity, 
etc.) and to be of practical use when well aligned. This project will produce 
nanotubes in a configuration that will realize such expectations. The proposers 
have already produced prototype fibers of micron size using vapor grown carbon 
mulitwall tubes mixed with a polymer. The prototypes demonstrate an easy way of
delivering nanotubes which easily can be chemically and physically  manipulated. 
The focus of this project will be to optimize the single-wall nanotube 
continuous fiber for improved strength so that polymer nanocomposites can be 
subsequently developed based on these new fibers. The goal of the over-all 
product development (Past Phase I-II) is to produce a range of nanotube 
continuous fibers that optimize structural, electronic and thermal properties. </p> 

<p>7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>The exemplary properties of carbon nanotubes are well known but utility in 
materials science has been limited due to the minimal knowledgebase at nanoscale 
manipulation. The deliverables of this proposal will have a direct market inlet 
into advanced composites manufacturing and their products, with a US market 
estimated at 10 billion USD. In addition, NCFs will contribute to unique 
products in thermal and electrical management composites.

<p>6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>This study will demonstrate the feasibility of using emulsified nanoscale iron 
particles to remediate pools of DNAPLs (Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids) through 
the use of an in-situ dehalogenation process. The emulsified system will consist 
of a surfactant stabilized oil-in-water emulsion with the nanoscale iron 
particles contained within the emulsion particles. DNAPLs, such as TCE, diffuse 
through the oil membrane of the emulsion particle whereupon they reach the 
surface of an iron particle where dehalogenation takes place. The hydrocarbon 
reaction by-products of the dehalogenation reaction diffuse out of the emulsion 
particle and vent to the ground surface. The method of emulsion delivery can be 
applied to DNAPL pools under buildings without interruption of usage of the 
facilities. Direct treatment of the DNAPL pool will avoid long-term 
contamination of groundwater as the DNAPL slowly dissolves. Unlike pump and 
treat, which has failed to remediate DNAPL pools, this methodology possesses the 
potential to totally eliminate pools of DNAPL. Because no successful in-situ 
methodologies currently exist for DNAPL remediation, the successful 
demonstration of the proposed methodology would lead to widespread commercial 
usage. </p> 

<p>7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>Remediation of chlorinated hydrocarbon plumes is a high priority for Federal and 
private organizations. Pump and treat is still the most common methodology 
applied to remediate chlorinated hydrocarbons plumes, although innovative 
approaches such as permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) are gaining acceptance. In 
a cost metrics comparison of treatment technologies for chlorinated 
hydrocarbons, pump-and-treat costs were estimated at $9.8M per site and PRBs 
costs at $3.9M per site. The same economic analysis estimates costs for 
accelerated source treatment at $1.3M per site. </p>

<p>The Department of Defence (DoD) alone owns over 3,000 chlorinated hydrocarbons 
contaminated sites. A review of these sites indicates that at least 270 DoD 
facilities have defined DNPAL sources. Using 1.3 million dollars per site 
estimated cost for accelerated source treatment, implementation of the proposed 
approach over pump and treat could rempresent a market size of over 300 million 
dollars. Expanding this analysis to include other federal and industrial 
organizations and the market size could easily exceed $1 billion.</p>

<p>6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>NASA is considering an electromagnetic catapult, the "MagLifter" to lower the 
cost of cargo delivery to space. A carrier sled levitated and propelled by 
magnets provides the initial velocity to a space transportation vehicle. 
Superconducting magnets enable higher fields at lower weights than normal  
conducting magnets and consequently a significantly larger clearance between the 
guideway and the carrier sled. The reduced weight of the carrier sled and the 
relaxed mechanical tolerances of the guideway not only lead to cost savings in 
construction and operation of the MagLifter system, but to a more robust system 
with higher operational reliability. </p>

<p>A superconducting magnet system is proposed for the MagLifter carrier sled and 
will be compatible with most guideways. The modular design will allow scalable 
configuration to accommodate the full range of required payloads. The 
superconducting coils operate in a persistent current mode, eliminating the need 
of a power source during the launch. A conceptual magnet design including the 
cryostat will be performed in Phase-I of this STTR. A prototypical magnet with 
its charging unit will be built and tested during Phase-II. </p>

<p>7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>Enabling technology for commercially competitive space launch infrastructure. 
The potential applications include the various proposed maglev systems currently 
under construction or development, military launch systems, like catapults for 
aircraft carriers, magnetically levitated mining vehicles, and even amusemenet 
rides. </p>

<p>The proposed application of cable-in-conduit conductor could have a significant 
impact on magnet designs for industrial applications of superconductivity. In 
particular, high operational currents, could benefit magnetic separation, 
superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), and superconducting transformers 
for commercial applications.</p>

<p>6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>We propose to develop and deliver a compact camera system that will detect ice, 
measure it's thickness and display the thickness as a false color image on a 
standard video monitor. In the visible wavelength band, ice and water have 
similar reflectance spectra and are often indistinguishable. In the near 
infrared (NIR), however, there are sufficient differences so that it is possible 
to detect "clear ice" on a variety of surfaces and to measure its thickness 
using an optoelectronic sensor. Sensors Unlimited, Inc. has a long history of 
developing room temperature NIR cameras based on indium gallium arsenide focal 
plane arrays (FPAs). Together with the Photonics and OptoElectronics Materials 
(POEM) Center of Princeton University, we have developed the foundations of a 
technology by which multiple wavelength bands can be implemented in the same 
focal plane array. During Phase I, we will develop the ice detection algorithms 
and will identify the materials and process technologies aimed at realizing an 
application-specific FPA. In Phase II, we will develop and deliver ice detection 
cameras, initially incorporating multiple FPAs and, at the end of the program, 
incorporating a monolithic multi-color FPA.</p>

<p>7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>The proposed program is aimed at the sub-topic "remote detection and measurement 
of ice buildup on flight hardware." The immediate commercial spin-offs are de-
icing of aircraft and roadway monitoring. The ability to detect and measure ice 
on military and government aircraft will also allow us to do the same for 
commercial aircraft, roadways, and bridges. </p>

<p>Also being developed is a multi-spectral imaging system with built-in image 
processing capability. By changing the wavelengths of the 3-color FPA and 
modifying the algorithms, a number of new applications can be served. This will 
allow us to address many of our already identified applications including 
machine vision with a higher performance, more compact camera system and to 
potentially serve many new applications. </p>

<p>A "futuristic" (beyond Phase II) effort would be to build this system around our 
3 inch long "mini-camera", scheduled for development during 2000.</p>

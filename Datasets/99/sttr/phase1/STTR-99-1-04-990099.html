<p>6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>MiTi proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a high performance 
oil-free bearings suitable for application to commercial, general aviation and 
military gas turbine engines. These novel journal bearings are based on 
compliant foil bearings and magnetic bearings. Key elements of the bearing 
system are the increase in compliant foil bearings to sizes approaching 150 mm 
and the ability to operate at temperatures to 1500 F. Such a compliant foil 
bearing will have the necessary capability to carry rotor loads in the event of 
a magnetic bearing overload or failure even for large gas turbine engines. To 
ensure maximum utilization of space the bearing system will be nested to produce 
a bearing system that is robust, simple in design, and is lightweight. Under 
this effort, MiTi will use state-of-the-art foil and magnetic bearing analysis 
tools and resources to establish key bearing design parameters for the high 
temperature applications. Due to the criticality of materials for this 
environment RPI will identify the needed material system for Phase II and 
beyond. Finally, preliminary conceptual designs of the tribological and bearing 
qualification test rigs needed for Phase II will be completed. </p>



<p>7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>The commercial potential for compliant foil and hybrid foil/magnetic bearings 
bearings resulting from this program is significant, including both commercial 
and military applications. System applications for the developed bearing include
gas turbine engines for helicopters, business jets, general aviation commuter 
jets, as well as gas pipeline compressors, auxiliary power units and remote 
power generation systems the employ magnetic bearings will also benefit. The 
key benefit to many of the systems is the elimination of the lubrication system 
with its high parts count, limited temperature capability, and need for gear 
driven generator system. Besides simplified designs, the new class of bearing is 
robust and permits expanded operating envelopes.

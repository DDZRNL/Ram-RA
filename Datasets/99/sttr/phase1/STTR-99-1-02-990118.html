<p>6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>Quantum Technology Services, Inc. proposes a Cryogenics Autonomous Launch 
Systems Operations. The results of this proposal will provide a considerable 
cost savings and increased operational efficiencies. This is realized by 
centralized control over the large quantities and diversity of propellants 
required for increasing the number of space flights. These improvements are 
obtained by implementing: </p>

<ul><li>Integrated liquifaction/air separation facilities, cryogen storage and automated 
supply/replenish systems in support of launch activities at the launch site. 
<li>Centralized cryogenic supply, storage and distribution systems will provide 
propellants to the use sites (launch pads and preparation/test areas). 
<li>Wireless feed-back control systems monitor requirements and initiate 
replenishment of propellants to user points based on need or minimum tank 
levels. 
<li>Potential utilization as an onsite cogeneration facility that will produce by-
product GH2, GO2 and GN2. </ul>

<p>7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </p>
<p>An integrated propellant production, storage, replenish and transfer system can 
be especially cost effective for commercial launch facilities. When future space 
vehicles carry commercial payloads in earth orbit and to the Moon and Mars, 
frequent launches will require the support of large quantities of cryogenic 
propellants. This approach can also be used to make these commodities affordable 
and quickly accessible for commercial, civil and government launch and mission 
support as well as aiding cryogenic research. For example, the same type of 
system could be used to make new concepts in automobile, civil, and military air 
vehicles.

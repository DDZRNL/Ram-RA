		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Zero Gravity Mass Measurement Device (ZGMMD) provides the ability to measure the mass of samples in a microgravity environment, like that found on the International Space Station (ISS). One of the primary measurements often taken during science experiments is mass. This is even more relevant in biology, where mass is often one of the key measurements taken for analysis. During the Phase I effort, a ZGMMD prototype was developed, tested, and demonstrated the feasibility of a means to determine the mass of samples less than 1kg, without the use of earth's gravity. The ZGMMD's innovative way of determining the mass, of low mass objects, in microgravity environments has been shown to be feasible, and effective. The Phase I prototype has shown to be able to provide great mass measurement capabilities, exceeding the Phase I requirements, specifically in accuracy and precision.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The ZGMMD has an immediate application for NASA aboard the ISS. It could be utilized right away with a number of fundamental space biology experiments that are either in progress, or will be starting soon. The ZGMMD offers a very desirable capability often utilized in most lab settings for mice, plants, and

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		ZGMMD also has the potential for uses in other Non NASA applications, for commercial companies involved with providing space research platforms, like Bigelow Aerospace, Virgin Galactic, Sierra Nevada, Blue Origins, Boeing, SpaceX, and Orbital Sciences. ZGMMD may prove valuable in not only orbital situations, but perhaps even in sub-orbital flights in which mass may be valuable to collect under those conditions.

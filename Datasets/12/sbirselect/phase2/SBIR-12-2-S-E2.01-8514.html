		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The key innovation of this effort is the development of a Metroplex-based arrival, departure, and surface optimization system which we call MetroSim.  Linking with both the NASA-developed Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) tool, the NASA-developed System Oriented Runway Management (SORM) tool, the FAA-proposed Terminal Flight Data Management (TFDM) system, or alternatively with live or recorded flight data, MetroSim allows airport planners, traffic flow management experts, airline dispatchers, air traffic controllers, and pilots to reduce the uncertainty in operations planning, recover quickly from disruptive events, maintain high throughput even in adverse weather conditions, and handle the uncertainties associated with irregular operations. <BR>Not only are we proposing innovations that improve Metroplex flight management, but we are also proposing innovations in the way aviation software is structured.  In order to manage the high volume of flights in the New York airspace effectively, and simultaneously improve the arrival stream, departure stream, and surface operations, the MetroSim architecture contains a collection of different tools, some of which are analytic computations, some of which are physics-based computations, and some of which are mathematical optimization calculations, interoperating in a distributed computational environment.  Finally, the architecture allows Metrosim to be adapted to any Metroplex.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Metrosim can be used as a research tool for NASA aviation researchers.  By experimenting with different algorithms for the Metroplex Planner or the Airport Planner, or even by providing Metrosim with a different route structure or different traffix mix, a NASA researcher can explore many areas.  Some of these areas are (1) the effect of a different route structure on the Metroplex performance; (2) the introduction of new vehicle types, such as UAS aircraft, on Metroplex performance; (3) the effect of a different traffic mix or traffic intensity on Metrosim metrics.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed solution has application in every Metroplex in the National Airspace System.  The way Metrosim is designed, it can be adapted to any Metroplex.  Metrosim can be a decision support tool for controllers, advising them on the best routes, best departure and arrival sequence for each airport, and best pushback time and taxi route to the assigned runway.  It can be used inside a human-in-the-loop simulation, as a "pseudo controller" to provide pilots with guidance.  Finally, airline dispatchers can use the tool to aid them in route planning, to clue them on what routes and taxi paths are likely to be assigned by controllers long before a flight departs or (for arrivals) enters the Metroplex

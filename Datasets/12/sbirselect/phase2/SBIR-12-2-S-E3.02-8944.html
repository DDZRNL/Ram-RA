		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Existing and proposed missions with ambitious science goals demand ever larger primary mirrors which, in turn, require the development of new light-weight, low-cost mirror technologies.  For Phase 2, Vanguard Space Technologies (VST) proposes to deliver a 2.5 meter, composite, on-axis, telescope by building upon the success of the Phase I effort.  The telescope will be suitable for use on the Super BLAST-pol mission. VST proposes building upon the success and leveraging the lessons learned from previous technology demonstration programs, leading to a successful CDR that includes a final design with budgeted errors, a detailed manufacturing plan, and a mature recurring cost model and estimate. A CDR package and one high efficiency telescope system will be provided during Phase II.  The envisioned telescope system will feature 2X lower areal mass and comparable areal cost for Unit Two+ than BLAST.  The Super BLAST-pol team at UPenn is committed to flight test this new technology on the maiden flight in 2016.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Vanguard met with Alan Kogut at GSFC on 11/7/13.  The technology may also be of interest to a future NASA GSFC program currently referred to as BOBCAT.  BOBCAT is still in the concept/design phase and open to change.  The telescope functions mainly as a "light bucket" for the spectrometer, and will not feed a large pixelized focal plane.  The current design envisions an on-axis system (similar to BLAST).  Tentative requirements include a 3-4 meter primary; operating frequency:  initially 300-700 GHz, eventually 300 GHz to several THz (submil-far infrared); operating temperature:  40K or below; system overall mass &#150; 5 metric tons (includes dewar); mid-latitude environment (not Antartica); and launched in desert environment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Northrup Grumman &#150; Baltimore, an aerospace prime contractor, was contacted on November 5, 2013, and briefly informed of our activities.  NG expressed interest in the technology and Phase 1 results.  Vanguard will meet with NG personnel within 1-2 months.  Our target application is tactical missions for DoD, possibly surveillance and/or communications related.

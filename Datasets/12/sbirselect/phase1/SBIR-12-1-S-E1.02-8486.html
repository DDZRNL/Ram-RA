		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this proposal, Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems LLC (Tyvak) will develop nano-launch vehicle avionics solutions based on the latest commercial electronics products and protocols. These systems will address the unique avionic challenges of dedicated NanoSatellite launch vehicles (NLV). Tyvak will utilized heritage and lessons learned from its CubeSat avionic systems to modify and optimize its current products for use with this new class of launch vehicles. The major technical objectives will be:<BR><BR>- Provide compatibility with the all NLV systems in development<BR><BR>- Determine and provide appropriate performance and reliability metrics while maintaining the low-cost/low-mass made possible by commercial electronics systems<BR><BR>- Determine the feasibility of the latest network protocols (in particular wireless systems) in the NLV environment<BR><BR>- Demonstrate the reliability of low-cost/low-mass/low-power GPS based automatic flight termination system (AFTS) by combining the latest generation of commercial miniature GPS systems with high performance computer systems based on mobile computer technology

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The interest in CubeSats from both a spacecraft/payload and launch perspective has grown exponentially over the last decade. NASA has played a significant role in fostering the growth of the CubeSat community.<BR><BR>Despite the growing interest in CubeSat and NanoSat missions, launch opportunities for this class of spacecraft are only available as secondary payloads. NASA and other government agencies have recently expressed interest in the development of small launch vehicles specifically designed to carry NanoSats as primary payloads. An example of this interest is a NASA Kennedy Space Center RFQ titled "Nano-Satellite Launch" (Solicitation # NNK11LB41Q). This RFQ will provide an ideal platform to develop and demonstrate the capabilities and benefits of the avionics suite being proposed. If awarded Phase I, Tyvak can work closely together with the winning contractor of NNK11LB41Q, Garvey Spacecraft Corporation (GSC), to define the avionics requirements.  If awarded the SBIR Phase II, Tyvak will develop flight hardware for integration and testing on these flight opportunities. In the past, Tyvak personnel have worked with multiple Prospector high altitude flights, providing a P-POD deployer and backup LV avionics packages. In addition, Tyvak was awarded a NASA contract to develop a CubeSat deployer for use in NLV. As part of this contract Tyvak is working closely with GSC to incorporate Tyvak development hardware in additional Prospector flights.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Currently there are over 100 CubeSat developers worldwide building CubeSats, which comprise of government agencies, commercial entities, non-profits, universities, and high schools.  With other U.S. Government agencies building technology demonstration and operational CubeSats, they will benefit from this rapid low cost access to space.  The U.S. Army currently has a program called SWORDS and DARPA has a program called ALASA, which both try to increase the technology readiness level of NanoSatellite and Small Satellite class launch vehicles.  The technology developed under this NASA SBIR, could have direct tangible benefits to these other two U.S. Government programs.

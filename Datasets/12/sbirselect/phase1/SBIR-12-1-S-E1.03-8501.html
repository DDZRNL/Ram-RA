		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Zero G Mass Measurement Device (ZGMMD) will provide the ability to quantify the mass of objects up to 2,000 grams, including live animal specimens in a zero G environment, an innovative because there currently are no such devices available to perform mass measurement of smaller masses (< 2000 grams) in space. At present there are no tools on board the International Space Station (ISS) to measure low mass objects, which is a capability that is extremely important for biological research. The ZGMMD would provide the capability to quantify the mass of an object, while limiting the acceleration applied to the object. The ZGMMD would be capable of being used in the Microgravity Sciences Glovebox (MSG) or could someday be integrated with payloads such as the Plant Habitat (PH). The ZGMMD innovation provides a fundamental capability (measuring mass of an object) that would increase the capabilities of NASA's fundamental space biology program. A significant amount of fundamental biology has occurred on the ground that has utilized mass measurements; therefore to compare zero G results with previously conducted ground experiments, mass measurement capabilities should be provided. Successful completion of Phase I and II efforts would provide these previously mentioned capabilities.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary application for NASA would be to use the ZGMMD within the LSG on board the ISS. However this device could be integrated with future payloads to provide the ability to autonomously measure the mass of objects. Integrating a device such as the ZGMMD, would increase scientific significance and data collection, while reducing necessary crew intervention for measuring mass of low mass objects.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA applications are limited because the proposed device is most useful in zero G environments; however there is some potential for use with commercial zero G flights. Should commercial spaceflight ever become common, private researchers may desire mass measurements during a time of no gravity. The measurement of the mass of an object is one of the most common measurements taken in scientific fields. ZGMMD would be available for future research needs.

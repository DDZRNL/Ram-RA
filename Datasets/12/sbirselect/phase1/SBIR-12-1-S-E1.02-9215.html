		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Ventions proposes the development of a pump-fed, 2-stage nano launch vehicle for low-cost on demand placement of cube and nano-satellites into LEO. The proposed vehicle uses high T/W and Isp pump-fed engines that operate at chamber pressures >750psi without the weight penalty of high pressure tanks, thereby realizing payload fractions in the 1-2% range.  Ventions has already completed several component-level demonstrations in the area, and is proposing additional optimization / testing of a 5,000lbf LOX / RP-1 turbopump-fed engine as part of this Phase I in-order to demonstrate a flight-ready 1st stage propulsion system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed nano launch vehicle is aimed at providing low-cost and on-demand insertion of NASA cube- and nano-satellites into LEO as primary payloads. This will change the current model of launching such satellites as secondary payloads (which are often constrained by requirements of<BR>the primary payload), thereby extending this capability to a wider range of NASA experimental missions requiring on-demand and low-cost insertion of small sattelites into specific orbits.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications for the same will include DoD and military missions requiring rapid on demand access to space from anywhere in the world (based on ground or air-launch), as well as university and research satellites. Additionally, the small-scale thrust chamber assemblies and turbomachinery technology components developed for the launch vehicle are also expected to have widespread applications in other in-space propulsion systems, upper stages, and orbital insertion / maneuvering thrusters, etc.

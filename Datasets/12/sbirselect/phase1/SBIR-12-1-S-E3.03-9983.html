		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The National Research Council (NRC) has identified the need for motors and actuators that can operate in extreme high and low temperature environments as a technical gap to exploring deeper into our solar systems.  The need for high temperature motors and actuators for robotic mechanisms is critical to explore the surface and atmosphere of Venus, Jupiter and/or Saturn.  <BR><BR>Bear Technologies, LLC (Bear) proposes to create environmentally tolerant motors for robotic missions.  As identified by NRC and NASA there are no commercial actuators or motors that can work in wide variation and high temperature environments (-50 degrees Centigrade to 500 degrees Centigrade).  The current approach has been to shield or isolate the environment from these systems. The problem with this approach is that it limits the ability to explore on surface, increases the bulk and is expensive with temperature control systems.  The need is to create tolerant technologies that can operate in the extreme environment. <BR><BR>Bear Technologies has been exploring motor design for more than 5 years.  Currently, Bear is working on a high torque direct drive electric motor under a Phase II award.   The concept proposed uses new design concepts coupled with tolerant material to create a temperature tolerant motor (TTM). The proposed motor concept has a fundamentally different design that offers offers higher torque and lower speed than traditional motor design.  This novel design will help minimize failure risks at extreme temperatures.  By combining certain extreme temperature materials with no ball bearing or lubrication, the Principle Investigator (PI) believes the motor concept has the potential to function for an increased period of time in extreme environments. Motor and actuator technologies that are capable of operating in the high-temperature (460 degrees C) and high-pressure (90 bars) Venus surface environment are needed for multiple robotic systems.

		If the concept proves out for Venus conditions, it will work for cryogenic and hard vacuum environments.

		Earth/Commercial/Science Applications<BR><BR>High pressure and high temperature motors are needed in the oil and gas exploration industry.  As the oil and gas operators increasingly explore territories with high temperature and high pressure, they are facing many challenges in downhole drilling and enhanced oil recovery systems, such as steam, flood or steam injection.  High temperature motors are used for many downhole tool applications, including Electric Submersible Pumps (ESPs).  Schlumberger, a world leader in ESPs for 80 years, supplies high temperature ESP systems with motor insulation rating at 300C .  The High Temperature Bell Motor could allow the industry operate at greater depths and higher temperature.<BR><BR>The Department of Energy has been seeking high temperature tools including high temperature motor for its Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS).  The EGS are engineered reservoirs created to produce energy from geothermal resources that are otherwise not economical due to lack of water and/or permeability.    High Temperature Bell Motor will enable the EGS technology to access the earth's vast resource located at depth.<BR><BR>Other potential application include precision munitions and weapons control , high altitude balloon maneuvering , and glass and metal work in extreme temperature furnaces.

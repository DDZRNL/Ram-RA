		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		ORBITEC, in collaboration with Lucigen, proposes a rapid nucleic acid-based detector for spaceflight water systems to enable simultaneous quantification of multiple waterborne pathogens with minimal consumables and crew time. The Rapid Multiplex Microbial Detector (RMMD) amplifies the genetic material in a liquid sample to allow near real-time identification of specific genetic sequences of predetermined bacteria and fungi. This easy-to-use device incorporates a patented polymerase enzyme that enables rapid RNA amplification by reagents with superior long-term shelf life and thermal stability. To operate, a water sample is injected into the RMMD, where it is concentrated and mixed with the reagent. The RMMD is rapidly heated and maintained at an elevated temperature for approximately 15 minutes, then quickly cooled back to room temperature to amplify the genetic material in the sample, which is detected in real time by changes in fluorescence due to dye binding, thus providing quantification. pathogenic cells in the water sample can be rapidly detected quantitatively based on the time of development of fluorescence. Phase 1 activity will result in prototype hardware and software genetic amplification and detection of several pathogenic bacteria and fungi that will bring the technology to TRL 5. The anticipated results of the Phase 2 are an engineering development unit that consists of an amplification/detection process controller, sample cartridges, and reagents, that can be tested in space.

		The RMMD provides quantitative indication of the presence of multiple waterborne pathogenic bacteria and fungi simultaneously within 60 minutes of sampling, with minimal consumable hardware. The RMMD reduces crew time by eliminating the need to unstow, check, and restow a test kit after 2 days, and again after 5 days. Unlike the Water Microbiology Kit (WMK), there is no need for a syringe of growth media, and the RMMD microbial capture device is smaller and lighter than that of the WMK. Another advantage of the rapid test is that if an infection is suspected in space, potential sources can be tested, and results determined quickly, so additional infections can be avoided. This technology can be used on the ISS and on future long-duration spaceflight missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The combined goals of this proposal will have a significant impact on terrestrial water quality management and on current diagnostic capability for detection of waterborne disease, especially in areas that are currently not well served. Enhanced access to in-the-field diagnosis of locally relevant diseases will improve sanitation among populations in resource-limited settings. The technology will also promote better understanding of the epidemiology of emerging zoonotic and pandemic pathogens in real-time, will significantly reduce the response time to serious outbreaks, and could help combat any potential future biological threats. The military can use the product for water testing in remote or resource limited environments. RMMD technology can be used for surface water quality testing for research and surveillance. In the area of potable water monitoring for pathogenic bacteria and fungi, the rapid turn-around time offered by the RMMD approach provides a benefit to the consumers wishing to quickly test samples for real estate, new well, and new construction applications. In addition, RMMD technology can be used for water quality assessment for aquaculture, an industry that provides the primary protein source for approximately one billion people. Production and food safety of all species are dramatically impacted by water quality.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Phase I objective is to develop a preliminary design and manufacturing plan for carbon fiber composite reflectors and/or a carbon fiber telescope that are traceable to the requirements of current and future CMB missions.  The Phase II objectives are to complete the design and manufacturing planning, fabricate necessary tooling, manufacture hardware components that include two reflector support structures, integrate and align the reflectors and confirm telescope optical performance via analysis of as-built mechanical alignment and surface accuracy data.  To prepare for and conduct the PDR within six months, the proposed Phase I tasks will include:  1) Develop telescope requirements in conjunction with CMB researchers and/or NASA with the goal of resolving sufficient detail to evaluate CFRP technology for CMB missions, 2) Compare the requirements to CFRP heritage, as-built results, and experience, 3) Develop a concept based upon high (currently 4-9) TRL CFRP component technologies, 4) Predict the performance of the concept, 5) Develop a pricing model to predict recurring cost, 6) Define a preliminary manufacturing plan that includes predicted versus budgeted errors, 7) Develop a summary technical/cost compliance matrix that summarizes all technical and cost predictions versus requirements, 8) Summarize all engineering, manufacturing, and cost information in preparation for PDR including the envisioned path to telescope TRL6 during Phase II, and 9) Conduct a PDR with support from mechanical, optical, structural, thermal, materials, and manufacturing engineers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The capabilities proposed are relevant to Space and Earth science missions with immediate technology insertion for CMB.  Potential applications include balloon, space, and ground-based astronomy and remote sensing missions, e.g. High Altitude Scientific Balloon Flight Program, SMLS, and CCAT.  Reflectors (mirror facets) for large concentrators are required to develop terrestrial solar devices for sustainable energy and lunar oxygen generation devices.  Mission study groups at JPL, Cornell, GSFC, University of Pennsylvania, and LaRC (LIDAR) are likely customers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Renewable energy interests have indicated a desire to field an ever-growing number of large solar concentrators. The maturing of system competencies could benefit DOE and DoD. Large, accurate, thermally stable telescopes are needed for broadband spacecraft. The need to provide Internet service in remote locations has service providers and spacecraft manufacturers considering constellations of spacecraft. Lightweight, large-aperture, thermally stable telescopes with micron level tolerances will be needed to increase traffic capacity per spacecraft.

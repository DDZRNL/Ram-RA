		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The capacity of coherent Lidar systems to produce a continuous, real-time, 3D scan of wind velocities via detection of backscatter of atmospheric aerosols in clear-air conditions gives this technology a clear advantage over other technologies. LIDAR has proven its value in a number of applications, including the detection of clear-air turbulence, wind shear, and aircraft wake vortices.<BR>Of interest under this NASA sub-topic is the development of Lidar systems capable of detecting and measuring aircraft wake vortices in order to enhance aircraft separation criteria. To perform this task well a Lidar must have certain characteristics and be paired with a highly optimized wake processing algorithm.  Key areas of development include:<BR>- Pulse energy / pulse repetition frequency (PRF) combination to adequately sample a region of space containing the wake vortices. <BR>- Pulse width for optimally sampling the wake disturbance. Determination of the optimal range resolution for measuring wakes is algorithm dependent and is an area of current research.  <BR>- Scanner capable of efficiently scanning the region of interest.  The scanner needs to be able to report the elevation and azimuth accurately so that wake positions can be estimated.<BR>- Raw data acquisition and signal processing for generating range resolved Doppler spectral estimates. Processing should produce periodograms over the 2D or 3D region of interest with adequate frequency resolution, velocity bandwidth and with minimal distortion.  <BR>- Wake vortex algorithm for detecting, tracking and estimating the circulation strength and position of the vortices from the Doppler spectral estimates.<BR>SIBELLOPTICS proposes a Phase 1 SBIR to determine the feasibility of its compact, innovative fiber LIDAR sensor, now in Phase II development, to detect and measure wake vortices using spatially dependent spectral matched filter algorithms similar to those currently being developed for NASA by Coherent Research Group.

		<BR>
		The Next Generation Air Transportation System program was developed to address the problems associated with the ever-increasing growth of aviation by improving efficiency at airports around the US. A major component of this effort is to reduce aircraft separation, which is highly dependent upon the development of instrumentation that can accurately monitor and measure wake vortices. The development and assessment of fast-time vortex models for use in optimizing aircraft separation during approach and departure operations is one example for which a thorough understanding of wake vortex dynamics is needed. At present there is no current operational system that will meet all of the requirements of a useful wake vortex sensor.  <BR>In the wake vortex sensing mode Windimager operates at a high PRF (20 kHz) and transmit a narrow pulse in order to sample the wake region with high longitudinal spatial resolution.  The localized scan and high PRF will allow Windimager to measure a tighter array of radial wind velocities commensurate with wake vortex estimation transvers resolution requirements, with range gates as short as 7.5m.  With regard to wake vortices, of significant interest is Windimager's potential to achieve relatively short pulses (<100 ns) of sufficient energy (~200 uJ). This capability, coupled with a near optimal wake vortex estimation algorithm, has the potential to yield a system that can provide very accurate estimates of vortex circulation strength and position.

		<BR>
		Windimager has been designed to be an extraordinarily flexible, general purpose, wind measurement platform with applications in a number of different industries, including: <BR>1. Wind Energy<BR>Wind energy generation is one of the fastest growing industries in the world and LIDAR technology is gaining a great deal of momentum in this market segment. Windimager can perform both wind assessment and power operations improvement, replacing multiple LIDARS or anemometer towers.  <BR>2. Yachting<BR>Maritime markets potentially include ocean-going vessels as well as subscription wind data and weather sales to harbors and ports.  There are four opportunities to address in this market: (1) the owners of luxury yachts, (2) the yacht manufacturers, (3) the yacht charter operators and (4) the harbor market where ships of all types operate. <BR>3. Meteorology<BR>Environmental scientists have successfully used Lidar systems to accurately track the direction and dispersion of factory atmospheric emissions and volcanic ash, as well conduct studies of the formation of typhoons.  <BR>4. Homeland Security<BR>With its ability to monitor aerosol movements over large areas Windimager is an ideal platform to track the dispersion of atmospheric contaminants.  <BR>5. Firefighting<BR>Successful suppression of any large scale fire depends on an understanding of environmental factors which effect fire behavior.  Wind speed and direction are among the most important environmental influences.

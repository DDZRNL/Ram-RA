		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		With the increased demand for and utility of nano- and micro-satellites, the demand for responsive, low-cost access to space has also increased. To meet this demand, multiple private companies are pursuing the development of nano- and micro-launch vehicles (NMLV). However, NMLV builders lack suitable avionics platforms for both development and operational needs. Traditional launch vehicle avionics platforms exceed the SWaP requirements of an NMLV due to their use of redundant, aerospace grade components. To service the needs of NMLV builders, TUI proposes to develop the SWIFT-nanoLV avionics platform by leveraging its existing portfolio of SWIFT software-defined radios and other small satellite component technologies. Through the careful use of COTS components, modular design techniques, and software-defined architectures, the SWIFT-nanoLV avionics platform will not only meet the SWaP requirements of an NMLV, but will also help minimize the operating costs of NMLVs. After developing a concept design and testing brassboard prototypes in the Phase I effort, TUI will build and test a fully functional avionics platform in the Phase II effort.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The SWIFT-nanoLV avionics platform will provide nano/micro launch vehicle builders with a robust, flexible, and lightweight solution for the entire life cycle of a launch vehicle, from development to operations. NASA's goal is to increase commercial access to space for low-cost, responsive missions. The primary commercial application for the proposed technology is its use as an avionics package for these launch vehicles. In addition to launch vehicles, the proposed technology is well suited for use as a high-performance bus for small satellites, including CubeSats. The tight integration of a flight computer, INS/GPS, and TT&C transceiver in a modular, SWaP efficient package means the proposed technology can be utilized in a wide variety of mission profiles. Because of their low cost, there is an increasing interest at NASA in the use of small satellites.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A number of government agencies within the DoD and private companies are pursuing the use of small satellites for a variety of missions. The availability of low-cost, responsive nano/micro launch vehicles will increase the ability for these agencies to field those missions. A modular avionics platform that is specifically designed for these launch vehicles will decrease both development and operating costs. Additionally, the proposed SWIFT-nanoLV avionics package is ideal for use as a flexible, high-performance small satellite bus. The tight integration of a flight computer, INS/GPS, and TT&C transceiver in a modular, SWaP efficient package means the proposed technology can be utilized in a wide variety of mission profiles.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this SBIR Phase 1 we propose to develop a novel microscope by integrating Fourier phase contrast microscopy (FPCM) and epi-fluorescence microscopy.  In FPCM, the high degree coherence of low power laser source provides well resolved spatial frequency bands in the Fourier plane and the retardation is generated by photo-thermally induced phase transitions in a liquid crystal by varying the intensity of the laser. Further the controlled phase shift induced by the liquid crystal cell will be utilized for quantitative phase imaging. On the whole, the system offers simultaneous recording of Fourier phase contrast and epi-fluorescence images shot at the same time (at the speed of the camera). Similarly it is also possible to perform simultaneous quantitative phase and epi-fluorescence imaging in real time. The proposed microscope offers several unique advantages over the commercially available state-of-the-art technology. Our system is physically robust, user friendly, maintenance free, with no moving parts and frequent alignment, consuming minimum power. The modular system built with inexpensive optical components is versatile. It will be extremely useful in the biological and biomedical research labs. The system can be conveniently installed in International Space Station for high throughput live cell imaging.

		If successful, this technology could be used for: <BR>� Rapid investigation of living cells: morphology and physiology.<BR>� Combined with fluorescence functionalized specificity cancer targeting <BR>� Since the imaging system of this purposed instrument is a complete optical technique, the real-time high throughput cytopathology is possible.  <BR>� Ready to be integrated to any exist microscope and this instrument can provide the most information available about the sample in real time. As a result the technology has potential to revolutionize the way we look and study live cells and organisms<BR>World microscopy market is expected to grow from $2.7 billion in 2010 to $4.5 billion in 2015, at an estimated CAGR of 10.8% from 2010 to 2015. The optical microcopy segment currently dominates the microscopy market. Technological advances that enhance ease of usage, automation, better quality imaging, faster/better analysis have also had a huge positive impact on the market. Customers would include research facilities in universities, government and industry, particularly biotech pharmaceutical and medical research. Currently prominent industry players include Carl Zeiss, FEI Company, Hitachi High Technologies, Jeol, Leica Microsystems, and Olympus. We estimate that the total addressable microscope market would be about 15% of the total annual microscope market, ~6,000 units. This is a great potential owing to the recent advances in pharmaceutical industries and nanotechnology

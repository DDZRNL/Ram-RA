		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We have developed a common architecture for laser transmitters that address requirements for water vapor as well as ground and airborne ozone lidar systems.  Our innovative approach to these requirements has the advantages of reducing size, weight and power (SWaP) as well as hardware cost for all of the applications envisioned.  Under this Phase I SBIR program Fibertek proposes to demonstrate operation of laser systems at wavelengths required for both water vapor and ozone DIAL systems and power scaling to desired levels.  In the Phase II follow-on, Fibertek will build and deliver laser transmitters and frequency converters designed to meet NASA requirements for both water vapor and ozone lidar systems.  The use common technology for the two DIAL applications provides NASA a lower cost and risk path to development of next-generation DIAL systems sought under this select SBIR opportunity.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Advances in structured heterogeneity together with nanomaterials tailoring has made it possible to create thermoelectrics using high temperature, polymer composites. While such thermoelectrics do not have the capability to approach the efficiency of top performing ceramic modules such as BiTe, they do provide two unique aspects of use in energy scavenging: the ability to conform to irregular large shaped areas easily, and the ability to integrate kinetic energy scavenging together with heat scavenging. During Phase I, the group at Wake Forest University demonstrated that the combination of thermal and vibrational power production is actually synergetic &#150;the amount of power generated is greater than the sum of the individual components. This improvement in nanocomposite thermoelectric performance, coupled with effective kinetic energy scavenging makes the piezo-thermo-electric "PowerFelt&#153;" applicable to a wide range of power collection scenarios. Although the goal of making a 1-m2 material was not completed, significant progress has been made and this capability will be available in Phase II. A sample of "PowerFelt&#153;" was sent to the National Institute for Standards and Testing for independent testing. Their results confirmed that  "PowerFelt&#153;" was significantly better than other power producing films and competitive or better than ceramics that cannot conform to the shape of the heat and vibration source. The material was successfully field tested at the Stennis Space Center at their liquid nitrogen supply facility.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The generation of electrical power from thermal sources with and without vibration has wide direct applications for NASA. This technology can be exploited by NASA R&D Centers to power remote sensors around propellant storage areas and test stands, to supplement/eliminate batteries in experimental apparatus by harvesting energy from heat sources such as pump house engines; remove the passive heat load generated by the ambient environment and active devices in order to stabilize the temperature of sensitive components; and using thermoelectrics to drive component temperatures far lower than normal to the sensitivity of detectors, CCD, thermal imaging cameras, solid state lasers and other sensors. Launch and space applications include supplemental/backup power for instrument and life support on manned space vehicles; non-manned space vehicles to supplement main power and instrument batteries; main and supplemental power source for planetary exploration vehicles; main and supplemental power source for satellites; supplemental/backup power for instrument and life support on ISS; and supplemental/backup power for instrumentation on sounding rockets and balloons.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The generation of electrical power has numerous applications for DOD including minimizing the battery weight for ground troops; electronic gun controls; electronics; missile; guidance and control systems; nuclear, biological, and chemical defense systems; micro and full sized submarines; surface ships to; aircraft for electronics and life support; unmanned aerial vehicles; and aircraft for electronics and life support. It can also be used to many power communication devises, such as between the THAAD Active Leak Sensor System and the Driver when hypergolic leaks occur during transportation and operation. Applications to the civilian market are similar to those for NASA and DOD, that is to eliminate or reduce the need for batteries and incorporation of "PowerFelt&#153;" into clothing; cell phone holsters; tents; backpacks; conventional and hybrid vehicles, including the passenger compartment electronics; and power generation during emergencies.

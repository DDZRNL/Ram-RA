		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		As the power density of advanced engines increases, the need for new materials that are capable of higher operating temperatures, such as ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), is critical for turbine hot-section static and rotating components. Such advanced materials have demonstrated the promise to significantly increase the engine temperature capability relative to conventional super alloy metallic blades. They also show the potential to enable longer life, reduced emissions, growth margin, reduced weight and increased performance relative to super alloy blade materials.<BR><BR>MR&D is proposed a program focused on improving the impact resistance of CMCs using 3D woven reinforcement. This approach was shown in the Phase I program to hold promise for increased performance is of specific interest to Rolls Royce as a candidate material for vanes and blades in their turbine engines. MR&D will expand the capability of its analysis tool which was developed during the Phase I program by incorporating failure criteria tailored for 3D woven preforms as well as executing analyses to predict the exact locations of the fiber tows after weaving. <BR><BR>Along with impact testing, an expansive testing program to characterize multiple 3D fiber architectures will be executed. The impact testing and associated non-destructive evaluation will be conducted at the University of Akron using state-of-the-art techniques to record the damage caused by the projectile in real time as well as detailed post-test evaluation. Material characterization tests will be conducted at Southern Research Institute and The Ohio State University. All of the data resulting from this extensive test program will enhance the analytical tools accuracy and utility.

		NASA Glenn has been directly involved in the effort to bring these materials to turbine hot section components.  The NASA Ultra Efficient Engine Technology program (UEET) is focused on driving the next generation of turbine engine technology.  One of the major thrusts is the development and demonstration of advanced high-temperature materials which are capable of surviving the extreme environments of turbine combustion and exhaust.<BR>  <BR>NASA Glenn Research Center has been involved with in the development of SiC/SiC for aero-turbine vanes and blades for a significant period of time.  Recent efforts include those aimed at investigating the advantages and disadvantages of SiC/SiC vanes and blades.  As part of these efforts, NASA Glenn has also conducted research on 3D woven preform design tools.  The research conducted as part of this Phase II program is directly applicable to the NASA Glenn efforts noted and can be used to complement those development efforts.  Similarly, the results from the NASA work could help to improve the materials and tools being developed in this program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In the commercial sector, the Rolls Royce Trent 1000 and Trent XWB engines are being developed for the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 XWB aircraft, respectively.  There are currently 1031 Boeing 787s on order and 812 Airbus A350 XWBs on order.  The Trent 1000 was the launch engine for the Boeing 787.  These are large markets where the benefit of this technology will have a lasting impact on efficiency and cost.<BR><BR>By working closely with Rolls Royce during the early stages of this development program, MR&D has ensured that the resulting products will meet the requirements of future customers.  Rolls Royce has expressed a serious interest in this technology and, as demonstrated above, have a sizable market for its application. A letter of support to this effect, from Rolls Royce is included with the proposal.<BR><BR>The aerospace industry is not the only potential beneficiary of this technology.  The Department of Energy (DOE) is working hard to improve the efficiency of power generators.  Just as with aircraft engines, power turbines' efficiency improves with higher operating temperatures.  As an example, current turbines operate at 2600?F, which provided a large improvement in efficiency over earlier models operating at 2300?F.  CMC turbine blades and vanes may allow even higher temperature operation and is a topic which the DOE is currently investigating.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The liberation of particles induced by rocket plume flow from spacecraft landing on unprepared regolith of the Moon, Mars, and other destinations poses high mission risks for robotic and human exploration activities. This process occurs in a combination of "extreme environments" that combine low gravity, little or no atmosphere, rocket exhaust gas flow that is supersonic and partially rarefied, and unusual geological and mechanical properties of highly irregular surface regolith. CFDRC and the University of Florida will deliver unique plume driven erosion simulation software for such environments by combining novel granular physics simulation modules developed by UF with multi-phase gas-granular flow simulation software developed by CFDRC. Granular flow constitutive models, formulated through first-principle 3-D Discrete Element Method particle kinetics and implemented in an efficient Eulerian gas-granular flow solver are the foundation of this software. The fidelity of these simulations will be advanced towards simulating particle compositions with broad shape and size variations. Novel particle kinetics modeling concepts will be applied to formulate granular flow physics models for both, realistic irregular particle shapes and dispersed particle size distributions. Phase I demonstrated the successful implementation and validation of irregular granular shape physics modeling in CFDRC's gas-granular multi-phase flow solver. An approach for extension to poly-disperse particle mixture simulations was also developed. Full integration of these models in Phase II will enable the simulation of gas flow interaction with poly-disperse, irregular shaped particle materials. Extensive verification, validation, and application demonstrations will be performed. The proposed technology development will result in unprecedented computer modeling capability for predicting liberation and flow of realistic granular material compositions in extreme extra-terrestrial environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The debris simulation tool will offer a powerful simulation capability of first order importance to the Space Exploration Program for robotic and human mission architecture definition to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations. The highest risks occurring during propulsive landing and takeoff of spacecraft require gas-granular flow simulation capabilities for designing mitigation measures. The granular flow modeling capability will be equally important for modeling regolith material manipulation for In-situ Resource Utilization such as pneumatic transport, granular flow movement in excavators, resource extraction systems moving and conveying regolith, as well as processing of regolith in reactors for resource extraction.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Many potential non-NASA commercial applications exist in civil and military industries. Multiphase flows occur in many applications in chemical, petro-chemical, energy conversion, mining and pharmaceutical industry. Industrial practitioners are well aware of the huge role particle shape plays in the flow behavior of real particulate systems. Understanding and accurately modeling such flows would lead to greatly improved designs of multiphase flow reactors. Dust, sand and snow stir-up during helicopter landing and take-off in a desert or arctic environment result in severe visibility impairment (brown-out) and danger of engine debris ingestion. Civil engineering and environmental engineering applications include wind-borne landscape erosion and dust transport to populated areas.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Fly-by-feel uses distributed sensing of forces along the lifting surfaces of an aircraft. Whether such measurements are made via hot films, pressure sensors, or strain gauges, all can provide distributed force information that must be intelligently fused and utilized to achieve performance goals. Fly-by-feel will be used to achieve robust disturbance rejection, mass property augmentation, and aeroelastic tailoring. Earlier results using acceleration measurements will be duplicated and demonstrated using strain gauge measurements. Aeroelastic tailoring is a generalization of mass property augmentation whereby the modal mass and damping of selected modes will be augmented using a set of strain sensors. Technology for the design, modeling, and construction of small vehicles with flexible wings will be transferred from the university partner. Existing vehicle models will be used and updated as needed to show the feasibility of the new technology. Transition of the technology to larger vehicles will be demonstrated using models and simulation. Hardware testing using a NextGen strain sensor array will begin in Phase I and then continue in Phase II with wind tunnel and flight testing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed program will continue the development of an innovative avionics technology called Attitude Control Enhancement using Strain sensors (ACES). This technology is a form of Dynamic Servoelastic Control (DSE). The ACES system directly supports the NASA Robotics, Tele-Robotics, and Autonomous Systems, Dynamic Servoelastic Network Control, Modeling, and Optimization topic under the NASA Small Business Technology Transfer program wherein stated objectives include "DSE control for performance enhancements while minimizing dynamic interaction," "distributed networked sensing and control for vehicle shape, vibration, and load control," and "data-driven multi-objecting DSE control with physics-based sensing." With the performance enhancement provided by a distributed array of strain gauges and fly-by-feel flight control techniques, benefits such as improved precision flying task performance, active shape control to better meet mission requirements, and assessing and adapting to major damage becomes an accomplishable proposition.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The commercial potential for the ACES concept includes the large application area of Unmanned Air Vehicles. Flexible vehicles both large and small will be able to use DSE phenomena for increased attitude performance and aeroelastic tailoring. Enabling technologies are flexible wing design, strain sensor arrays, and associated flight control. A summary of the market potential is quoted below from the Defense Industry Daily, 3rd Annual Command and Control Summit, June 29-July 1, 2011:<BR>"Market research firm Forecast International recently released 'The Market for UAV Reconnaissance Systems,' which claims that the total UAV market including air vehicles, ground control equipment and payloads is expected to be worth $13.6 billion through 2014. More than 9,000 UAVs are expected to be purchased over the next 10 years by countries in every region of the world, and Forecast International does not include funding for RDT&E and operations and maintenance in its analysis."

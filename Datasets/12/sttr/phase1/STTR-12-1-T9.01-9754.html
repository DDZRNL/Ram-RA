		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		An all electric aircraft test bed is proposed to provide a dedicated development environment for the rigorous study and advancement of electrically powered aircraft.  The new test bed aircraft will be developed from an existing conventional airframe and provide a dedicated platform to study, design, and test electrically powered propulsion systems for use in commercial, military, and general aviation vehicles and UAV systems.  The test bed aircraft will allow various electrical propulsion system technologies to be tested to determine performance, reliability, safety, and cost.  These include various motors, motor controllers, batteries, fuel cells, super capacitors, and propeller technologies.  Additionally, the platform could be used to investigate performance characteristics unique to electric propulsion, determine the most accurate methods for measuring energy used and remaining, research redundancy possibilities unique to electric aircraft, and possible hybrid-electric power plant systems.  An electric aircraft has several significant advantages over a conventional internal combustion driven aircraft.  These include zero, or near zero emissions, increased reliability and safety with only one moving part, reduced noise and vibration, increased comfort, and reduced maintenance.  RHRC and the University of Illinois propose to develop an all electric test bed aircraft able to systematically evaluate new and existing technologies, which will make these systems, safe, reliable, and cost effective.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		An advanced aircraft electric propulsion system will have significant potential application across a wide range of NASA aircraft including both manned and unmanned systems.  With two of NASA's primary goals being reduced aircraft emissions and noise, a realizable, efficient, and competitive aircraft electric propulsion system is a highly sought after commodity.  The test bed aircraft will allow NASA personnel to quickly and rigorously evaluate multiple electrical propulsion systems in a cost effective and timely manner.  The test bed will enable component optimization and a variety of operational studies to be performed, all of which will help define the important aspects and characteristics for a successful all-electric aircraft.  The test bed can also be used to study new propulsion systems such as turboelectric distributed systems and hybrid electric systems.  NASA will be eager to exploit the new test bed platform.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The potential for an advanced electric propulsion aircraft is quite good.  If results from the test bed aircraft show that an all electric propulsion aircraft can be produced which can compete with a conventionally powered aircraft on both a performance and cost basis, the system will be in extremely high demand.  The system's emissionless, or near emissionless operation will be highly desirable in an increasingly environmentally conscious world where ever more stringent emissions and noise standards are continually being enacted.  The additional benefits of electric propulsion including increased reliability, low maintenance and maintenance costs coupled with low noise and reduced vibration will make the system highly attractive to commercial, military, and general aviation markets for both manned and unmanned systems.

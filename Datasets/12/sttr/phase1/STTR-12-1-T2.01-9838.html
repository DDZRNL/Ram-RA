		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Systima in collaboration with the University of Washington will develop a high performance, advanced green monopropellant microthruster (0.1 &#150; 1.0 N) for small- and micro-satellites.  The microthruster utilizes a high energy density HAN-based monopropellant AF-M315E, and a novel injection system to maximize thruster performance.  The propellant is non-toxic making it easy to store, integrate into modular designs and launch without added costs associated with handling toxic propellants such as hydrazine.  Phase I will focus on development of the microthruster propellant injection system to deliver propellant to a miniaturized catalyst bed to provide fast response while maintaining the life of the catalyst bed.  In Phase II these systems will be integrated into the full microthruster design.  This effort will result in a micropropulsion system with a modular design that meets the needs of current and future small- and micro-satellites for NASA missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Green micropropulsion systems offer safer handling without the risk of exposure of toxic chemicals to personnel or the environment.  They offer reduced system complexity, decreased launch processing times and increased propellant performance.   There is no limitation to the NASA satellite applications to which this technology can be applied; it is suitable to large or small satellite DACS/ACS intended for low earth orbit or for geosynchronous orbit, etc.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Green monopropellants offer significant advantages in performance and reduced handling infrastructure for commercial and military vehicles and payloads and allow for modular designs for enhanced response capabilities.  There is no limitation to the commercial or military satellite applications to which this technology can be applied.  It is suitable to large or small, satellite DACS intended for low earth orbit or for geosynchronous orbit, etc.

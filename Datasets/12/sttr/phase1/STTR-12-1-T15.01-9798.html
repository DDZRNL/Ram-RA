		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		There is no rad hard SDRAM currently available to support DDR2 and DDR3 applications. Space Micro proposes to build a radiation hardened by design (RHBD) SDRAM memory, using a modified version of our HF-Core Memory Controller to solve all the single event effects issues (SEU, SEFI and multiple bit errors).  The RHBD SDRAM will be manufactured on known radiation characterized eDRAM (embedded DRAM) ASIC processes: either TSMC or IBM for a Phase II demonstration.  The resulting RH-eDRAM (our name for this device), fabricated on a 130 nm process, provides 128 Mbit of radiation hardened (SEU, SEFI, SEL and TID) memory, while a 90 nm IBM process would result in 512 Mbit of DRAM.  The RH-eDRAM solves the space reliability problems with a well-understood set of solutions applied:

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Virtually all NASA space programs have a demand for this proposed technology and resulting space qaulified product. NASA applications range from science missions, space station, earth sensing missions e.g. (EOS), and deep space missions. NASA programs/missions that will benefit include new lunar landers and orbiters, Mars missions (MAVEN), solar system exploration e.g. (Titan, Juno, Europa, comet nucleus return, New Discovery, and Living with a Star (LWS).  NASA programs which hopefully will continue to be funded by Congress include the next generation heavy launch vehicle called SLS, the Orion Multipurpose Crew Exploration Vehicle, Commercial Crew Development Vehicle (CCDev2) and Commercial Orbiter Transportation Service (COTS) would benefit.   Space products evolving from this SBIR , and marketed by Space Micro, would have been enabling for NASA programs such as RBSP, GRAIL, LADEE, IRIS, Dawn, SDO, Aquarius, Kepler, Ocean Vector Winds, and space interferometry (SIR). New missions which hopefully will be funded include BARREL, CLARREO, GEMS, solar orbiter, Osiris-Rex asteroid sample return mission, solar probe plus, and ILN.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology and evolving Space Micro products may benefit many commercial space platforms, both LEO and GEO telecommunication satellites, such as Intelsat, Direct TV, XM radio, Orbcomm and Iridium Next telecom constellation replenishment, plus standard industry busses including Lockheed's A2100, and Boeing's HS-702.<BR><BR>Civil earth sensing applications such as weather/metrology applications e.g. (NOAA GOES and Landsat) can also benefit. <BR><BR>The large DoD space industry, including USAF, MDA, NRO, and new Army nanosat programs at SMDC will directly benefit. Among these programs are AEHF upgrades, GPS follow-ons, MDA's PTSS, USAF TacSat family, Operationally Responsive Space (ORS), and Army SMDC nanosat family. The entire Cubesat initiative including NRO's Colony program and the USAF SENSE program would benefit.<BR><BR>This technology and products will also address emerging MDA radiation threats. These programs include AKV, THAAD, AEGIS, SM3 Block IIB, and GMD for Blocks 2018 and beyond. With the new challenge of atmospheric neutrons to High Altitude Airship (HAA) programs and NASA or Air Force UAV programs, this R&D and future product may be a timely solution. <BR><BR>Other military applications may include strategic missiles (Trident and Air Force upgrades), as well as many DoD tactical weapon programs.

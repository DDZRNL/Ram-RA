		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Wrong decisions during the missions can lead to an unsafe condition or immediate failure, while correct decisions can help continue the missions even from faulty conditions. In view of the lessons learned from mishaps, i.e., failed space missions, it is imminent that reliability analysis and risk assessment are kept in sync with space system design as it evolves from the concept through preliminary design, detailed design, production, and operations. Qualtech Systems, Inc. (QSI) in collaboration with Dr. John Sheppard from Montana State University (MSU) proposes a real-time health and risk assessment solution. The proposed efforts through this project in developing real-time computer-based environment for diagnosis, risk assessment, and visualization of system status will provide: (1) an environment for thorough and collaborative analysis and evaluation of a system design before the system is built and commissioned, (2) real-time diagnosis to identify Good, Bad, Unknown, Suspect, Degraded and Suspected Degraded of subsystems/components, (3) state of redundancies in real-time in case of single/multiple faults, (4) degradation status/criticality/time-to-failure, (5) risk identification of software and loss of mission/vehicle/life, (6) recommendation of a safer state to go to, and (7) visualization of risk (rank-ordered missions, probability of mission success, schedule and cost), mission criticality, and diagnostic coverage. The proposed solution should be of significant relevance to NASA's space missions because it provides capabilities in characterizing as system in its failure space as well as uncovering and managing risks as the system design evolves.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's current vision to enhance the level of autonomy for vehicle health management and mission planning based on identified risks makes the proposed effort worthy of funding from several branches within it. Clearly, establishing the technology and the software so that it readily operates as part of NASA's next generation Mission Control Technology allows NASA to utilize the continuous health assessment and mission satisfiability information from our tool for improved mission execution and reconfiguration while improving safety, mission success probability and reducing flight controller and crew workload.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Among the other agencies, DoD, US Air Force, US Navy, and SpaceX are the most potential customer for the resulting technologies. Large scale military systems (systems of systems) such as NORAD, Space Command ground segments, the Joint Strike Fighter fleet, the Navy shipboard platforms, Submarine Commands and ballistic missile defense (BMD) systems can be potential areas to field the proposed technology. In addition, UAVs, UMGs and other unmanned submersible vehicle markets could also be potential target for the proposed technology. The product is also expected to be of commercial value to the manufacturers of DoD and military's remotely guided weapons and reconnaissance systems.

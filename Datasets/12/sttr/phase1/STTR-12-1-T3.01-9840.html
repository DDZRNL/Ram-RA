		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Advances in structured heterogeneity together with nanomaterials tailoring has made it possible to create thermoelectrics using high temperature, polymer composites.  While such thermoelectrics do not have the capability to approach the efficiency of top performing ceramic modules such as BiTe, they do provide two unique aspects of use in energy scavenging: the ability to cover large areas easily, and the ability to integrate kinetic energy scavenging together with heat scavenging. Recently the group at Wake Forest University has demonstrated a novel design for internal p/n junction formation in such composites, that allows for a significant increase in thermoelectric voltage and power factor while retaining the form factor of a fabric.  This improvement in nanocomposite thermoelectric performance, coupled with effective kinetic energy scavenging makes the piezo-thermo-electric "PowerFelt&#153;" applicable to a wide range of power collection scenarios.  This Phase I program will demonstrate that the PowerFelt&#153; construct can rival small ceramic modules in overall power generation in a fully flexible, lightweight platform. Further, we will show that it is compatible with advanced manufacturing techniques such as printing, with cost profiles of ~$0.5/W.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The generation of electrical power from thermal sources has wide direct applications for NASA. Some of these for space missions include supplemental/backup power for instrument and life support on manned space vehicles; non-manned space vehicles to supplement main power and instrument batteries; main and supplemental power source for planetary exploration vehicles; main and supplemental power source for satellites; supplemental/backup power for instrument and life support on ISS; and supplemental/backup power for instrumentation on sounding rockets and balloons. Indirect applications include supplement/eliminate batteries in experimental apparatus at NASA R&D Centers; harvesting energy from heat sources such as pump house engines; remove the passive heat load generated by the ambient environment and active devices in order to stabilize the temperature of sensitive components; and using thermoelectrics to drive component temperatures far lower than normal to the sensitivity of detectors, CCD, thermal imaging cameras, solid state lasers and other sensors.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The generation of electrical power has numerous applications for DOD including fatigues to minimize the battery weight; heat from artillery barrels to minimize the battery weight for electronic gun controls; vehicles to minimize battery requirements for electronics; missile launchers to minimize batteries for launchers and guidance and control systems; nuclear, biological, and chemical defense systems to minimize battery weight; micro and full sized submarines to minimize battery requirements; surface ships to minimize battery and power generation requirements; aircraft to minimize batteries for electronics and life support; unmanned aerial vehicles to minimize battery requirements and weight; and aircraft to minimize batteries for electronics and life support. Applications to the civilian market are similar to DOD, to include clothing; cell phone holsters; tents; backpacks; vehicles, including the passenger compartment; and power generation during emergencies.

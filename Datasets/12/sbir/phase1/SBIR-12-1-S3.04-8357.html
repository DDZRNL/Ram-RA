		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Thermal Transfer is a critical part of power electronics application in both terrestrial and space environments.  Due to longer lifetime expectancies and harsh operational conditions, space vehicles require unique materials to deal with the increasing electrical and thermal loads placed upon the structure.  Increasing use of power electronics including high current carrying semiconductor devices such as IGBTs, MOSFETs, power transistors, and modules drive the need for specialty thermal management materials both in the packaging of the discrete devices as well as for the packaging of modules consisting of several or arrays of these devices. <BR><BR>The overall objective of this program (Phase I and Phase II) is to adapt CarbAl(TM)-based advanced thermal management substrates from terrestrial to space applications.  CarbAl(TM) is a carbon-based thermal composite with a thermal performance exceeding that of many metals.  The low CTE provides excellent matching to state-of-the-art power transistor dies and the low density and robustness make it suitable for space vehicle applications.   The proposed Phase I program is a continuation of the materials development completed internally at ANI.  If successful, the technology developed through this project will provide and accurate, robust, reliable and cost effective.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The initial NASA customer would be electronic drive and propulsion systems.  Specifically radioisotope and ion thrusters require high levels of heat transfer.  In the case of the RPS systems heat must be transferred from the isotope decay process into the gas propulsion system.  High thermal conductivity limits the energy loss and increased system efficiency.  Ion thruster technologies or electronic propulsion (EP) are the most direct customer.  Current systems are simply a few Watt power levels with projected increase in power to greater than 20kW.  This level of power increase will require the new transistor (SiC) which can be enabled by improved thermal management.  Ultimately, the total number of space vehicles requiring this technology may be limited but the total number of installations per vehicle could be quite large making NASA a primary customer.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Outside NASA ANI is committed to development of CarbAl(TM) related thermal management materials for other government customers.  ANI is working with the prime supplier of tactical quiet generators (TQGs) for the Army ton integrate CarbAl(TM) in an effort to reduce package size and increase power output.  <BR>The true potential for the CarbAl(TM) brand of thermal management materials lies in commercial applications.  ANI is currently immersed with two specific markets; hybrid electric vehicle drive systems and power LED luminaries.   ANI is currently engaged in high-level efforts to integrate CarbAl(TM) based thermal management materials into solid-state lighting working with a leading company to develop a drop-in replacement for street-lamps.  ANI is additionally working with a well known automotive manufacturer with integration of CarbAl(TM) into hybrid vehicle inverter packs.  Additional Market segments for power electronics include wind power converters, electricity Transportation and Distribution (T&D), rail traction and ship and vessel propulsion.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The goal of the proposed effort is to demonstrate feasibility of using selective laser melting (SLM, an emerging manufacturing technique) to manufacture a subscale combustion chamber liner that features an advanced regenerative cooling technique that combines high performance with low pressure drop.  SLM enables the ability to "print" the advanced regenerative liner in mere hours, despite the liner's inherent flow passage complexity.  This reduction in manufacturing lead time, combined with the fact that SLM manufacturing costs are driven almost exclusively by the amount of raw powder used during fabrication, results in a substantial cost reduction for future regeneratively-cooled rocket engines.  Considering that the proposed regenerative cooling approach features heat transfer coefficients 3-10 times higher and pressure drops 2-10 times lower than traditional axial channels, the proposed effort demonstrate one of the highest performing, lowest cost combustion chambers in the world.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Mars ascent vehicle (MAV) main engine is one potential opportunity, since the pressure drop penalty incurred by using this cooling approach is minimal.  A low-cost, high-performance chamber made from relatively ordinary materials could easily replace the radiation-cooled, refractory/precious metal spacecraft engines.<BR><BR>The next generation engine (NGE) will likely be an advanced expander cycle upper stage engine, and represents a NASA and Air Force opportunity for this technology.  An expander cycle engine would benefit greatly from the reduced pressure drop, either by an increase in chamber pressure and thrust or in MCC and turbomachinery life.<BR><BR>The Space Launch System (SLS) Program is another opportunity, particularly since the expendable boosters will be competed.  PWR, our commercialization partner, is working to define booster concepts, and their engines, that would also benefit from a low-cost, high-performance regenerative cooling scheme.  Since we have partnered with them on this technology, it presents an unusually good commercialization opportunity.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We will also try to capitalize on the Air Force's interest in large booster engines, such as the recently-terminated 3GRB demonstration program.  As Congress works to remove the threat of sequestration, we anticipate that the Air Force will return to previous levels of R&D investment, which may enable us to insert this technology into those future programs.<BR><BR>NASA, Air Force and Army decision makers are all focused upon the development of a small, low-cost launch vehicle capable of carrying nanosatellites and microsatellites to orbit.  A booster engine that featured a low pressure-drop cooling scheme like this one would offer higher performance than the ablative designs being considered.

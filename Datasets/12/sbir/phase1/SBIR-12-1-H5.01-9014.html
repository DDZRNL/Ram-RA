		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NanoSonic has developed a candidate state-of-the-art inflatable as a novel bladder material for life critical, space habitats that maintains low air permeability (< 0.0017 cc/100in2/day/atm) upon the triple fold cold flex test conducted at -50 ?C.  The multifunctional Thoraeus Rubber&#153; (TR) films are comprised of a low glass transition temperature (Tg), - 100 ?C, copolymer matrix resin modified with alternating layers of ultra-thin, uniform layers of proprietary nanoparticles for radiation resistance.  NanoSonic's unique molecular level deposition technique yields pinhole-free nanocomposites with that maintain radiation and EMI shielding (up to -100 dB) upon severe (50 % elongation) and repeated mechanical strain, a property that few if any inflatable exhibit.  NanoSonic proposes to produce a triply redundant bladder assembly comprised of several layers of TR&#153; films bonded with our low areal density self-healing foam, for a total areal density of less than 6 oz/yd2.  To substantiate long-term use in space, the down-selected, puncture resistant assemblies shall be exposed to gamma, electron, and heavy ions at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory via our partner, Colorado State University (CSU).  Low air permeability and flammability resistance would be verified after simulated Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR) exposure and cryogenic flex testing.  NanoSonic has teamed with seaming and space systems experts who will conduct leak and adhesion testing, and assist with habitat construction.  In support of NASA's goals for a robust space exploration program, it is anticipated that NanoSonic's lightweight, low permeable bladders shall enable space inflatable modules that exhibit long-term, 5 year, radiation resistance upon inflation, minimize launch mass, repair/maintenance, size and costs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NanoSonic's Thoraeus Rubber&#153; materials will be primarily developed as the bladder assembly for inflatable, life-critical, NASA space habitats.  The advanced lightweight bladder material offers superb cold temperature flexibility and durability to maintain low air permeability during handling and deployment in space.  The puncture resistant material will be transitioned as the multi-layer, self-healing bladder system when combined with NanoSonic's lightweight self-healing foams to ensure limited repair and maintenance.  The multifunctional TR&#153; materials formed via NanoSonic's ESA process offer EMI and radiation shielding for enhanced long-term high altitude and space durability.  Structural, yet compliant, composite materials having unique morphology and multiple controlled electromagnetic properties are possible via NanoSonic's automated spray-on ESA manufacturing approach.  TR&#153; represents a new class of robust, stowable/deployable structures for inflatable habitats and spacecraft.  Additional NASA platforms that may benefit from the TR&#153; include protective materials for Lunar systems, exploration vehicles, and satellites in LEO, GEO, and HEO.  NanoSonic's polyelectrolytes may be combined with our family of nanostructure materials produced in house for limitless combinations of multifunctional rigidizable/deployable materials for civil, aerospace, and space applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications for the low Tg TR&#153; inflatables include ultra-lightweight deployable polar habitats, high altitude airships (HAA), and rapidly deployable and reusable shelters.  Additionally, the self-healing component within the multi-layer bladder will be transitioned as long-term protective storage liners for food or other sensitive materials, self-sealing tires, anti-ballistic fuel tanks and life critical personnel protective equipment (PPE).  The EMI and radiation shielding protective constituent offer utility as cost effective protection against electrostatic charging, radiation, and abrasion.  Aerospace, biomedical and microelectronic markets would benefit from the EMI SE under repeated and severe reconfigurations.  Such EMI shielding skins can be envisioned for use on aircraft, morphing unmanned aerial vehicles, antennas and space structures.  Structural, high temperature, composite materials having unique dielectric and multiple controlled electromagnetic properties are possible via NanoSonic's layer-by-layer approach.  Spray ESA is envisioned as a cost-effective, environmentally friendly technology to displace sputtering and traditional dense filled composites.  Metal Rubber&#153; Fabrics and films can also function as conducting electrodes for high strain mechanical actuator and sensor devices, and as low-weight, electrically conductive and mechanically flexible coatings for systems requiring physically-robust ground planes or electrical interconnection.

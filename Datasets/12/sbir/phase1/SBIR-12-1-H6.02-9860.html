		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Radiation-hardened non volatile memory is needed to store the golden copy of the image(s) has not kept pace with the advances in FPGAs. Consider that a single image of a Xilinx V5 typically is roughly 50 Mb large. If a designer wants to store several such images in a satellite, then a sizable amount of highly reliable, radiation-hardened memory is needed. As a consequence, there exists a clear need and market opportunity for highly reliable NVM for storing program code, calibration tables and images of reprogrammable FPGAs. <BR><BR>The goal of this SBIR project is to develop a highly reliable and fault-tolerant, radiation-hardened Memory System-In-a-Package (Memory SIP) which can be used to configure and scrub reconfigurable FPGAs. The Memory SIP will contain a simple radiation-hardened microcontroller and a reasonable amount of commercial flash nonvolatile memory (NVM). It will support the needed standard interfaces that are commonly used for reconfiguring FPGAs, including Xilinx SelectMAP and JTAG.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Virtually all NASA space programs have a demand for this proposed technology and resulting space qaulified product. NASA applications range from science missions, space station, earth sensing missions e.g. (EOS), and deep space missions. NASA programs/missions that will benefit include new lunar landers and orbiters, Mars missions (MAVEN), solar system exploration e.g. (Titan, Juno, Europa, comet nucleus return, New Discovery, and Living with a Star (LWS).  NASA programs which hopefully will continue to be funded by Congress include the next generation heavy launch vehicle called SLS, the Orion Multipurpose Crew Exploration Vehicle, Commercial Crew Development Vehicle (CCDev2) and Commercial Orbiter Transportation Service (COTS) would benefit.   Space products evolving from this SBIR , and marketed by Space Micro, would have been enabling for NASA programs such as RBSP, GRAIL, LADEE, IRIS, Dawn, SDO, Aquarius, Kepler, Ocean Vector Winds, and space interferometry (SIR). New missions which hopefully will be funded include BARREL, CLARREO, GEMS, solar orbiter, Osiris-Rex asteroid sample return mission, solar probe plus, and ILN.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology and evolving Space Micro products may benefit many commercial space platforms, both LEO and GEO telecommunication satellites, such as Intelsat, Direct TV, XM radio, Orbcomm and Iridium Next telecom constellation replenishment, plus standard industry busses including Lockheed's A2100, and Boeing's HS-702.<BR><BR>Civil earth sensing applications such as weather/metrology applications e.g. (NOAA GOES and Landsat) can also benefit. <BR><BR>The large DoD space industry, including USAF, MDA, NRO, and new Army nanosat programs at SMDC will directly benefit. Among these programs are AEHF upgrades, GPS follow-ons, MDA's PTSS, USAF TacSat family, Operationally Responsive Space (ORS), and Army SMDC nanosat family. The entire Cubesat initiative including NRO's Colony program and the USAF SENSE program would benefit.<BR><BR>This technology and products will also address emerging MDA radiation threats. These programs include AKV, THAAD, AEGIS, SM3 Block IIB, and GMD for Blocks 2018 and beyond. With the new challenge of atmospheric neutrons to High Altitude Airship (HAA) programs and NASA or Air Force UAV programs, this R&D and future product may be a timely solution. <BR><BR>Other military applications may include strategic missiles (Trident and Air Force upgrades), as well as many DoD tactical weapon programs.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		New technology is needed to collect, stabilize, safen, recover useful materials, and store human fecal waste for long duration missions. The current SBIR Phase I proposal will examine an innovative torrefaction (mild pyrolysis) processing system that can be used to sterilize feces and produce a stable, free flowing powder than can be easily stored or recycled, while simultaneously recovering all of the moisture and producing minimal amounts of other gases. The system will also require minimal crew interactions, low energy demands, and tolerate mixed or contaminated waste streams. The objective of the Phase I study is to demonstrate the feasibility of this improved process using bench scale experiments. This will be accomplished in three tasks: 1) design and construct bench scale processing unit that can accommodate different modes of heating (conventional, microwave, radiant/solar); 2) laboratory and modeling studies on a fecal simulant over a range of process conditions (temperature, holding time, atmosphere); 3) evaluation of laboratory results and preliminary design of Phase II prototype.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed work would make it technically feasible to process human fecal waste and mixed waste streams and produce additional water in space which will benefit long term space travel, such as an extended Lunar stay or a mission to Mars and Astroids/Phobos. The proposed approach is beneficial to NASA in also allowing for solid waste sterilization and stabilization, water recovery, odor elimination, fuel gas production, in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) and/or production of chemical feedstocks and carbon materials in a single processing unit.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In the near term, the fecal waste processing component of the technology would have applications to fecal resource recovery and/or sterilization/stabilization problems in remote areas such as underdeveloped countries, arctic regions, oil production platforms, rural areas, farms, submarines, ships, etc., analogous to the uses for NASA technology developed for water purification. In the long term, the technology could be modified and integrated with microturbines or fuel cells and have widespread business or residential use for solid waste removal, water production and/or power generation. It would also be used by the DOD in military operations.

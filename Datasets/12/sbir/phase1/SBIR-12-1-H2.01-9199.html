		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Passive thermal control of cryogenic systems using foam insulations can help achieve Zero Boil-Off (ZBO). There is as much thermal energy transferred to Cryo tanks during the ascent phase as there is during 6 days of orbital operations using MLIs.<BR><BR>Spray on Foam Insulation (SOFI) still suffers from drawbacks both at chemistry and interfacial (bonding) levels. Currently, strong lightweight polymeric foam insulators cannot be (net shape) molded into larger complex shapes, using commercial foaming practices. The proposed Phase 1 research studies feasibility of an inventive (unprecedented) combination of processing and "green" foaming agents to "net-shape" mold low density robust (damage/MMOD tolerant) polymeric insulation foams into "monolithic" complex shapes (such as spherical or cylindrical shells, valve fittings). These can protect polymer matrix composite (PMC) tanks (such as COPVs) against external damages, hence enabling reliable, reusable cryogenic storage designs.<BR><BR>An added advantage of this invention is the "clean" decomposition of the blowing agent and development of an environmentally "green" insulative "net-shape" foaming technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		- Passive thermal control for Zero Boil-Off (ZBO) storage of cryogens for ground, in-space depot, short and long term missions.<BR>- Dual-purpose thermal insulation/mechanical protection in reliable reusable designs such as protection of polymer matrix composite (PMC) structures (like COPVs).<BR>- Lightweight multifunctional thermal management structures that could be applicable to crewed lunar surface landers and habitats.<BR>- An environmentally "green" insulation foam technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		1- Thermal/acoustic Insulative jackets for electronics, hot gas ducts, and fuel lines in commercial or military aircraft and vehicles.<BR><BR>2- Structural Insulation for complex-shaped medical, pharmaceutical or lab assemblies exposed to cryogenic conditions, such as cryogenic mills.<BR><BR>3- A promising large volume application is in cryogenic insulation and storage of liquid hydrogen in hydrogen-fueled vehicles

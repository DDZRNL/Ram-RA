		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The objective of this Phase I SBIR program is to develop polymer derived rare earth silicate nanocomposite environmental barrier coatings (EBC) for providing next-generation corrosion resistance and thermal insulation to Aerojet's Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) systems.  The NTP environmental barrier coatings will be developed from NanoSonic's innovate inorganic polymeric nanocomposite resins that crosslink to dimensionally stable gels under ambient conditions and gracefully transition to high temperature corrosion and thermally insulative resistant coatings at elevated temperatures.  Through a synergism of nanoparticle &#150; rare earth silicate load transfer pathways, NanoSonic's proposed EBC topcoat technology will readily absorb and dissipate high velocity impact threats while providing exceptional thermal shock resistance necessary for enhanced survivability of nickel-chromium based alloys within current and future NTP rocket engine rocket thrust chambers and nozzles.  Working with team members Aerojet and the University of Washington, NanoSonic will molecularly engineer a family of rare earth silicate polymeric precursors that are specifically optimized for rocket engines within Aerojet's NTP space technology program.  <BR><BR>For the proposed effort, NanoSonic, the University of Washington and Aerojet have created an SBIR research team to rapidly identify, optimize and transition next-generation polymer derived rare earth silicate coatings specifically optimized to extend the operational utility of NTP rocket thrust chambers and nozzles.  Within this teaming partnership, NanoSonic will continuously synthesize and optimize rare earth polymeric precursor coatings whereas the University of Washington will test coated nickel-chromium based alloys within flow conditions simulating NTP rocket exhaust. ANSYS thermal modeling will be employed to interpret and jointly optimize promising rare earth silicate coatings with Aerojet.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NanoSonic's polymer derived rare earth silicate coating technology will serve as a paradigm breaking alternative to line-of-sight vacuum assisted EB-PVD coatings and have broad utility within an array of NASA platforms.  Since the technology is spray deposited using legacy HVLP equipment under ambient conditions, literally any rocket propulsion component may be coated during a continuous or semi-continuous process during vehicle construction, as well as retrofitted on existing large area, irregularly shaped structures in need of enhanced high temperature thermal, corrosive and erosion protection.  Direct NASA benefits include improved lifetime and performance gains for nozzle, throat and core rocket engine components within aeronautical and space propulsion systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Broad secondary commercial and DoD applications exist for NanoSonic's proposed polymer derived rare earth silicate EBCs.  Of particular interest is the foreseen return-on-investment for aerospace, marine and automotive engine components and subcomponents integrating NanoSonic's EBCs for enhanced thermal insulation, corrosion and erosion durability.  Additionally, NanoSonic's polymer derived EBC coating technology may serve as an integral enabling technology for the use of fiber reinforced polymeric composites in closer proximity to engine systems by providing highly efficient, thin (<75 microns) insulative coatings.

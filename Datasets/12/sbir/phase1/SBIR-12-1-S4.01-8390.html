		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced Scientific Concepts, Inc. (ASC) is a small business, which has developed a compact, eye-safe 3D Flash LIDARTM Camera (FLC) well suited for real-time spacecraft trajectory, speed, orientation measurements relative to the planet's surfaces and evaluating potential hazards during the critical landing sequence.  ASC's Flash LIDAR has been used for autonomous berthing with the International Space Station (ISS) and is currently under development for the OSIRIS-REx asteroid rendezvous mission.  Flash LIDAR is also being evaluated by JPL and NASA for Entry Decent and Landing (EDL) for ALHAT and Mars. Through the investigations at JPL and NASA Langley a number of improvements to the technology have been identified as beneficial to landing application.   Improved range resolution, spatial resolution, increased sensitivity and greater dynamic range would increase the functionality for successful landing operations. ASC has developed the core technology for Flash LIDAR with its 3D-FPA and is developing higher resolution arrays to address these concerns.  ASC currently has on hand high sensitivity 32x32 arrays (shuttle run for the 320x320) that have not been tested with detectors.  Initial evaluation suggests that they have increased sensitivity by 50x, spatial resolution by 2.5x, and range resolution by 3x.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This sensor will increase the success of NASA operations such as:<BR>?	Mars Landed Exploration <BR>?	Exploration of Moons (ALHAT, Jupiter Icy Moons) <BR>?	Asteroid and Comet Rendezvous and Sample Return <BR>?	ISS Rendezvous and Docking (manned & unmanned)<BR>?	Space Situational Awareness<BR>?	Extravehicular Robotic Camera<BR>?	Rock Abundance and Distribution Maps <BR>?	Topographical Mapping <BR>?	Rover Mobility and Navigation <BR>NASA Langley Research Center has purchased two of ASC's existing FLVC systems for performing laboratory, field, and airborne test and evaluation of this technology for use on the ALHAT program.  A FLC been deployed for EDL helicopter and high altitude fixed wing experiments, and has shown excellent results.   ASC is continuing to develop and improve its line of 3D Flash LIDAR systems, one of which successfully flew on the Endeavor (STS-127) for AR&D testing.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		For the purposes of advancing integral field spectrograph (IFS) microlens capabilities, a new class of high-quality optics-grade nanostructured organic-inorganic nanocomposite three-dimensional (3D) gradient index (GRIN) microlens optical materials is proposed. In the Phase I program, solid state freeform (SFF) fabrication of high contrast 3D-gradient-index microlens array elements will be demonstrated using a research grade printer. A design of experiment will be conducted to optimize a series of 3D-GRIN films with axial, radial, and vertical gradient optical index patterns with microlenses of varying diameter, pitch, and focal length, including those symmetric and asymmetric. The films will be thoroughly characterized using optical coherent tomography and spectral interferometric techniques, and their power will be tested using collimated and converging light. A series of planar microlens arrays of varying shape, diameter, density, focal length will then be fabricated, and then planar films with two-surface microlens array, including masking, will be fabricated using the measured process parameters (i.e. &#916;n, &#916;n/(&#916;x,y,z), dispersion, etc.)

		NASA applications include, in-space fabrication of replacement optics, compact optical assemblies, high performance optics, on-demand production and prototyping of complex optics, and new optics techniques enabled by transformational optics.

		<BR>
		The design and fabrication of optics has not progressed significantly over 200 years. Several factors complicate the requirements placed on conventional lenses. The image is typically required to be planar (for example in film and electronic detectors), the lens must have the same optical properties over a range of optical wavelengths, and the image plane required has become quite extensive. This has driven up the production cost dramatically, significantly extended the development time of optical assemblies, and introduced substantial weight penalty. The value of the innovation is best realized in high performance systems, where the size, weight, and cost are necessarily dominated by the optics, by allowing large, complex, and thin planar optical films, including those produced using roll-to-roll methods, the innovation also benefit television displays, solid-state lighting, and 3D imaging applications.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal describes development of a new type of quantum-cascade laser for use as a local oscillator at frequencies above 2 THz.  The THz source described is a single chip solution that operates at room temperature.  In addition, a mechanism for wide tuning (2-4.7 THz) is described that requires no moving parts.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Compact and reliable local oscillators at frequencies above 2 THz are highly sought after for use on satellites such as SOFIA for studying the chemical composition of the interstellar medium.  In addition, the same technology can be used to for atmospheric OH sensing, such as in the microwave limb sounder on the Aura satellite.  In both cases our compact THz source would provide a significant size, weight, and power (SWaP) savings over current gas laser-based solutions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are many other target applications for this technology, including: drug detection/ pharmaceutical use, security screening, and medical imaging.  The narrow linewidth characteristic can provide a higher resolution alternative to time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) techniques currently in use.  The potential also exists for targeting specific resonances within target molecules or conformations, in combination with infrared or fluorescence spectroscopy, to help isolate very small concentrations in complex mixtures.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this program, Innovative Technology Applications Company (ITAC), LLC and collaborators propose to advance "synthetic phased array" technology to improve understanding of noise from landing gear. The technology, initially developed in a previous NASA SBIR project for trailing edge noise, will be applied to improve beamforming analysis methods, facilitate the design of more effective microphone arrays, and significantly enhance the understanding and characterization of noise sources from landing gear.<BR>The proposed approach involves the use of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to generate data on the nearfield unsteadiness in jet flows. The nearfield noise is then numerically propagated to the farfield phased array microphone locations. Beamforming analysis methods will be used to predict noise source locations, and these predictions will then be compared with the original LES results. Discrepancies between the phased array prediction and the LES flowfield results will be used to guide development of new and improved phased array source models, as well as develop improved methods for positioning Ffowcs-Williams Hawkings (FWH) integration surfaces around complex noise-generating configurations such as landing gear.<BR>When fully developed, this technique offers the potential for significant benefits. First, it will empower experimental aeroacoustics researchers to customize the layout of microphone arrays for a given experimental configuration. Similarly, this approach offers the potential to customize the analysis of the recorded data they take for optimum accuracy. Beyond this, the improved FWH and beamforming methods that will be developed using this technique will benefit any experiment which makes use of phased arrays of microphones. Finally, the work will add to the overall understanding of landing gear noise.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The design and development of noise prediction, measurement, and control methods for commercial aircraft is a major focus of NASA's Fundamental Aeronautics Program in Aeroacoustics.  NASA technical challenge-Quiet Low-Speed Performance under the Fixed Wing Project is to reduce perceived community noise by 71 dB with minimal impact on vehicle weight and performance.  As a result, the prospect of improved phased microphone array technology due to the application of the proposed synthetic array methods will be of interest to a broad spectrum of experimental aeroacoustics researchers at NASA.  Our proposed project deals with the development of a 'synthetic phased array' technology which focuses on improving the understanding of noise from aircraft landing gear, however, the improved beamforming methods and array designs made possible by the proposed technique can be applied to any experimental problem for which phased microphone arrays are suitable.  Thus, the range of noise source identification applications extends from landing gear to supersonic jets, rocket nozzles, flaps and slats, wake vortices, and wind turbines.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Beyond NASA's interests, the Department of Defense and airplane prime contractors also have a strong interest in technologies that lead to quieter aircraft.  The Navy, in particular, has a strong interest in finding ways to reduce aircraft noise related to carrier operations.  ITAC will work to market the proposed synthetic phased array technology to all the various industries which make use of phased microphone arrays.  These include, aircraft engine manufacturers, airframe manufacturers, the automotive industry, the wind power industry, and high-speed rail companies, just to name a few.

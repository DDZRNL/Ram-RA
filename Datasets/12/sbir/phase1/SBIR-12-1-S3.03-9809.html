		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		CU Aerospace proposes the ground test validation of a nanosat primary propulsion subsystem using non-toxic propellant with 3-axis ACS for orbit change and/or de-orbit capability, precision maneuvering, and drag makeup. Our approach, called the CubeSat High Impulse Propulsion System (CHIPS), leverages the existing Micro Propulsion System (MiPS) thruster technology development by our team partner VACCO Industries and enhances it with the CU Aerospace very high efficiency warm gas variant of an innovative resistojet that significantly boosts the performance of standard cold-gas systems. The MiPS system has been tested to 200,000 cycles without any technical issues, demonstrating excellent reliability. The 1.5U CHIPS subsystem, using non-toxic proprietary EP-76 propellant, is a compact thruster system having a total impulse of 602 N-s and a fully throttleable thrust of 50 mN. The subsystem also includes an EP-76 3-axis cold-gas attitude control system.  Approximately 25 W of primary power is required from a battery included in the 1.5U package. The value of this technology is that this low cost subsystem demonstration will pioneer a family of nanosat propulsion systems, based upon an innovative warm gas system and propellant, which will become available to the CubeSat and nanosatellite community for a broad range of propulsion needs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		CHIPS supports the NASA Roadmap for In-Space Propulsion Systems, nonchemical propulsion. CubeSats and nanosatellites with CHIPS would enable a number of different significant missions for low Earth orbits including orbit raising, orbit phasing, and/or deorbiting.  The drag makeup capability of CHIPS would allow low altitude orbits, permitting onboard sensors to operate at lower altitude.  CHIPS also has the capability for precision position adjustments, enabling such missions as formation flying.  These low-impulse operations are performed in a cold-gas mode. CHIPS would improve mission affordability for multiple CubeSats, since several CubeSats with CHIPS could be launched from a single low-cost booster and maneuvered to other orbits, then later de-orbited.  Note that CHIPS is easily scalable to smaller or larger sizes, depending on mission and payload requirements, by changing the tank volume.  Battery size can either be scaled, or kept the same size if recharging between thrust events is practical for the mission.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The CHIPS thruster provides a compact, non-hazardous, propulsion technology solution that will be made available in a family of sizes that can meet the differing needs of users in NASA, DOD, industry, and academia for CubeSat and nanosatellite missions.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA requires new instrumentation technologies that can be applied to measure dynamic quantities such as acceleration and flow velocity under extreme temperatures where traditional sensing methodologies cannot be applied.  The proposed Phase I SBIR research effort will seek to create accelerometers and flow sensors that can be applied to measure signals at temperatures in excess of 900F.  In order to accomplished this proposed task we will develop new sensor modalities built on vertically aligned ZnO nanowires.  ZnO is a piezoelectric materials that is not ferroelectric and thus it has an intrinsic polarization and no Curie temperature where traditional piezoelectric materials cease to function.  The proposed objective of this program is to advance the field of sensing through the development of a novel nanostructured sensor for the measurement of acceleration and wall shear-stress at high temperature.  The proposed sensor will provide the ability to make measurements at spatial resolutions previously unrealized through the patterned growth of the nanowire arrays thus providing a smaller footprint and an opportunity for numerous sensors on a single chip.  The nanowire synthesis process is solution based and scalable allowing sensors to be built for a fraction of the cost of the complex lithography based methods of current MEMS technologies.  These advances will allow researchers to study complex flows and dynamics such as those in turbomachinery under operational temperatures not conducive to current sensing technologies.  Our results will seek devices with previously unrealized dimensions and properties that will impact numerous fields of science including the efficiency of turbomachinery.

		<BR>
		NASA has a critical need for new sensor technology that can improve the efficiency of turbomachinery, which would produce dramatic reductions in aircraft fuel burn, noise, and emissions, as well as an ability to achieve mission requirements for, Subsonic, Rotary Wing, and High Speed Project flight regimes.   In order to achieve this efficiency enhancement new sensor modalities are required which can provide flow measurements with high spatial and temporal resolution at temperatures exceeding 900F.  The proposed SBIR program will develop a new nanostructured sensor technology for the measurement of wall shear at temperatures far beyond the combustor exit temperature.  The results will impact a wide range of NASA programs including fundamental research efforts under the Aeronautical Sciences Project.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The development of a first of its kind nano-sensor will make a broad range of impacts to the scientific community.  Wall shear-stress sensors can measure a variety of important flow parameters including the flow velocity through an enclosed region, viscous drag, turbulent flow, and flow separation.  Due to the use of nanofabrication techniques, the sensor can be made small enough to be applied in a variety of applications including in vitro blood flow sensors for making cardiovascular measurements allowing for a better understanding of vascular pathology.  Additionally, because the geometry of the ZnO nanowire array can be controlled at the nanometer level during fabrication, the sensor can be designed for use in a variety of other systems, including flow measurements in the micro channels of fuel cells, detection and control of flow separation in aircraft skins, or its use as a biological fuel cell to convert blood flow into usable electrical energy for drug delivery or other biosensors.  The proposed sensor will allow researchers to investigate fluid flow using sensors on scales never before studied, therefore leading to fundamental advances in science.  Furthermore, the device would not necessarily need to be used for a sensor but could be used as an actuator for a nano-pump or active flow control.  Due to the unique manufacturing process for the proposed sensors the technology proposed here would have far reaching applications and commercialization potential.

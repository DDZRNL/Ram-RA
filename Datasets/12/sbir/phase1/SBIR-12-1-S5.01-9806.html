		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Energy Efficiency Management Platform (E2MP) is a power-aware, "Green" computing technology for managing energy consumption on High End Computing (HEC) systems while still achieving performance targets.<BR><BR>The E2MP dynamically controls processor clock frequencies and voltages in a way as to minimize the energy required to complete the application run.<BR><BR>The platform functions by running predictive analytics on application trace data and developing a customized frequency & voltage management scheme based on characteristics of the application and input set.<BR><BR>The Phase I objective is to construct a technology demonstration of the platform using a computer server and workload (application) profile representative of NASA's HEC environment.  The demonstration, based on an application of interest to NASA (OVERFLOW) will prove the feasibility of handling arbitrary input data sets and conducting statistical power modeling, laying the groundwork for further commercialization activities in Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The E2MP can be applied to improve energy efficiency on systems in NASA's High End Computing Program and workloads of interest, such as climatology, astrophysics, and aeronautical engineering.  Implementing E2MP has the potential to achieve multi-million dollar annual savings on large-scale HEC systems.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The E2MP technology can be applied to High Performance Computing (HPC) environments and workloads at other agencies such as DoD and DoE.  With further development, the technology can be applied to Internet-scale and enterprise computing environments.  Furthermore,with additional R&D, the technology can be applied to the mobile computing domain.

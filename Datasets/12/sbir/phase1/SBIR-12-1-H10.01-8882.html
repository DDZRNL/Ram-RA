		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's "Ground Systems Development and Operations Program" is moving towards transforming parts of the Kennedy Space Center from a historically government-only launch complex to a spaceport bustling with activities involving government and commercial vehicles alike. The success of this transformation drive largely depends on achieving the ability to process multiple types of vehicles, within a rather short time and in an economic way. QSI proposes developing a COTS (Commercial off-the-Shelf) Software to facilitate 'Plug and Play Real-time Diagnosis for Ground Processing System Integration' to support achieving the objective of the program. QSI will add capabilities to their TEAMS (Testability Engineering and Maintenance System) toolset such that it will enable NASA to perform diagnostic analysis for various vehicular and ground systems without the requirement to build the analytic models and software tools from ground-up. Here, NASA is only required to build the diagnostic models (required for system integration, testing, assembly, maintenance/troubleshooting and pre-launch checkout) of the systems. Upon building, those can be used in a plug-and-play fashion through the analytic/diagnostic environment of TEAMS in conjunction with monitored data and test results from the vehicular and ground systems for obtaining diagnostic, prognostic, time to alarm, time to maintenance, etc. decisions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The ultimate goal of NASA's "Ground Systems Development and Operations Program" is to attain the capability to facilitate Ground Processing for diverse types of Government and Commercial Space Vehicles. The TEAMS-based software tools resulting from this effort will significantly reduce the time and effort to process a new vehicle or to bring a new ground support system into action. The reduction arises from reduced workload in developing the diagnostic and integration testing scheme; as well as from the seamless operation of the analytic (diagnostic, prognostic, integration testing, and maintenance support) capabilities with the ground processing assets and systems of NASA.  NASA's 'Human Systems Integration Program' and programs of 'Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) office' could be potential users of this technology. NASA centers their affiliated institutions those are engaged in developing new space assets (vehicles, rovers, satellite, habitat systems, etc.) and/or are performing upgrading of existing systems could also utilize this tool to reduce their integration testing and V&V time and cost.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Among the non-NASA Govt. agencies, DoD and Air-force and Navy are the most potential customer for the resulting technologies. The software tool can significantly aid the V&V of functionality and fault tolerance testing activities for Complex Integrated military systems (systems of systems) such as NORAD, Space Command ground segments, the Joint Strike Fighter fleet, the Navy shipboard platforms, Submarine Commands and ballistic missile defense (BMD), etc. In addition, UAVs, UMGs and other unmanned submersible vehicle markets who are putting forward vehicles of newer models in a frequent manner could also be potential target for the proposed technology. In Aircraft, maritime vehicles and advanced military hardware are common example of large complex systems that are manufactured by commercial sector and require stringent V&V of functionality, integration and fault tolerance/mitigation capability testing. Thus these industries will be the primary non-Govt. commercial sector target for the resulting software tool. Additionally, automotive industries will be targeted as another potential market segment.

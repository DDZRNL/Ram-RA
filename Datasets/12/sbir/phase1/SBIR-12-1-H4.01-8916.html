		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Traditional Extravehicular Activity (EVA) spacesuits incorporate either hard or soft upper torso subassemblies as part of their architecture.  In either case, these components are of a specific, fixed size and lack provisions to make sizing adjustments across the overall envelope of the torso.  This project will further the TRL of the prototype Morphing Upper Torso, an innovative pressure garment that allows for resizing of the torso and precise repositioning of the neck, scye and waist planes.  The concept has seen significant initial development through the research and PhD dissertation of Dr. Shane Jacobs, the PI on this proposed effort.  To date, analytical and experimental models of the full Morphing Upper Torso design (in which the back hatch of a rear-entry torso is interconnected with the waist ring, helmet ring and two scye bearings) have been used to demonstrate the feasibility of this novel space suit concept. The analytical and experimental results demonstrate that the torso could be expanded to facilitate donning and doffing, and then contracted to match different wearer's body dimensions. Using the system of interconnected parallel manipulators, suit components can be accurately repositioned to different desired configurations. The demonstrated feasibility of the Morphing Upper Torso concept makes it an exciting candidate for inclusion in future EVA suit architectures.  The proposed project will further the development from the proven concept in a laboratory setting, focusing on integration and development of wearable mockups and ultimately a useable, wearable, pressurizable prototype.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A Morphing Upper Torso would be beneficial for any future exploration mission and any future EVA suit.  The ability to resize the torso will minimize the number of sizes needed yet allow for some "customization" among individual wearers.  The additional mobility provided by such a close fitting suit for all crewmembers will be extremely beneficial for exploration of the Moon, Mars, NEOs, or future ISS construction and maintenance tasks.  Furthermore, the ability to resize the suit torso during long duration missions also provides a means to address body dimensional changes associate to long duration exposure to microgravity and thereby enhance the overall performance and efficiency of the suited crewmember.  NASA will benefit by ultimately implementing this technology into future suit designs, and hence improving suit logistics, minimizing costs and maximizing crewmember productivity.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The concept of an adjustable exoskeleton type suit is of keen interest to the United States Military.  The work performed in this project can be leveraged for military applications through the development of systems to evenly and efficiently distribute soldier-borne equipment weight.  Additionally, the design of components capable of quick adjustment can be leveraged for other protective equipment utilized in extreme environments, such as hazmat suits and firefighters turnout gear.

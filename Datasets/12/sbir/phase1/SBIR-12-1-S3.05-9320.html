		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The rotation sensitivity of a conventional optical Inertial Navigation System (INS)depends on the area enclosed by a circular optical path.  Hence, it is impossible to significantly reduce the device size without sacrificing its sensitivity.  Recent work showed that certain non-linear optical effects (fast light) can be used to increase the sensitivity of a ring laser gyro of a given size by orders of magnitude.  We propose a portable high-performance all-fiber laser gyroscope.  The device will utilize fast light produced by the Stimulated Brillouin Scattering in single-mode fibers.  Fast light enhancement will enable reduction of the device size without decreasing its performance level.  The fast light enhanced gyroscope will empower a rugged, compact, low-cost high-sensitivity INS ideal for precision guiding of UAVs, and other aircrafts.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		-Precise control and positioning of the UAVs.<BR>-Aircraft navigation  <BR>-Tracking and control of launch vehicles for placing payloads into orbital or sub-orbital trajectories.  <BR>-Precision inertial feedback during orbital maneuvers or station keeping operations on manned or unmanned spacecraft.<BR>-Actively stabilize instrument platforms during sensitive astronomical observations or scientific measurements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		-Self-guided ordinance and unmanned aerial vehicles, where traditional high sensitivity optical INS systems are too large to use.<BR>-Stabilizing weapons platforms or communications devices mounted on ground and naval vehicles of all sizes.<BR>-Commercial aircraft and marine vessels commonly use optical inertial measurement devices for navigation, stabilization, and tracking.

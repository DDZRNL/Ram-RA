		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed innovation is a propulsion technology that will help achieve NASA's Fundamental Aeronautics Program (FAP) goals of reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency for high speed flight.  NASA's objective to achieve increase the specific power of high efficiency electric components to make a 10 mega-watt onboard power generation and/or utilization feasible for propulsion requires the development of sub-scale technologies to support the development and validation of newer turbo-electric aircraft and embedded boundary layer electric propulsion systems.  Compact and lightweight generators scaling from the kW to MW class are needed to transition high speed aircraft to hybrid electric propulsion systems. Metis Design Corp is developing a lightweight, small-scale, gas turbine generator that draws on recent innovations in the fields of permanent magnet generators and turbomachinery, which has a target power density over twice the state-of-the-art and the potential to scale to 100's of kW.  The proposed turbine engine uses a lightweight, two-spool configuration that eliminates the need for the heavy reduction gearbox required by state-of-the-art systems.  Phase I of this SBIR will develop a preliminary design of the turbine generator sub-system and develop a detailed design, fabricate and test the innovative generator hardware.  A follow-on phase II effort will develop a detailed design, fabricate and test the complete turbine generator sub-system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Once this system is completed through Phase I and II SBIR research, it will be ready for deployment within several NASA applications.  Of direct immediate relevance would be for the development and validation of sub-scale hybrid electric propulsion systems for high speed aircraft.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There will be many commercial applications for this technology beyond NASA.  First would likely be for DoD Aerospace applications such as hybrid electric aircraft, UAVs and UCAVs.  Outside of DoD there are other commercial applications such as auxiliary power units (APUs) for business jets, regional jets and commercial rotor-craft. Potential automotive application include lightweight range extenders for hybrid electric vehicles. The technology is also suitable for distributed electricity generation and co-generation applications requiring low capital cost.

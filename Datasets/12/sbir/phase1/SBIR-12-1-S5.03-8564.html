		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		While it has become apparent that we can and will collect data at unprecedented rates thanks to a wide range of high-resolution high-throughput sensors, it has also become apparent that we do not have the algorithms and tools to satisfactorily analyze Big Data. Cloud computing as an infrastructure (e.g., Amazon Web Services), as a platform (e.g., Google Apps), and as a software ecosystem (e.g., Hadoop/MapReduce and NoSQL tools) offers a promising compute-and-store environment (complementary to supercomputing) to handle the massive amount of data created by NASA missions. In this proposal, we will develop a Cloud-based open architecture Analytics, Store and QUEry (CASQUE) system for data-intensive scientific computing for NASA missions. The architecture and workflow will be tailored for specific NASA missions and will be thoroughly tested in large-scale relevant cloud environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA, as part of its Big Data vision, e.g., in Open Government 2.0, can leverage similar cloud capabilities for the benefit of the research and science community via open-source data and software. Typical airborne missions, e.g., Operation IceBridge and EcoSAR, will benefit tremendously from a seamless cloud-based store and analyze system. Similarly, the seamless submission and incorporation of diverse data, open access data and information exchange, and open development of open source software and tools will allow foster the data-intensive research dependent on the success of NASA missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Big Data/cloud-based technologies are needed for the success of many military missions. IAI has already identified DARPA SMISC, DARPA ADAMS, and DARPA XDATA as possible transition programs. DCGS-N and DCGS-MC efforts are also very likely targets, where we could provide increased SA capabilities of these programs. The developed system or its various components can be also used in Big Data analytics environments  directly related to DARPA ICEWS, XDATA, GRAPHS, CINDER, Federal Big Data Initiative, Data-to-Decisions Initiative, ARO Network Science, AFOSR Complex Networks, IARPA FUSE, DARPA Insight, Machine Reading, Mission-oriented Resilient Clouds, PROCEED, VIRAT, DHS CVADA, DOE ASCR, HPSS, Mathematics for Analysis of Petascale Data, The Next Generation Networking, NIH Programs, TCIA, TCGA, NSF BIGDATA, CIF21, DASPOS, among others.

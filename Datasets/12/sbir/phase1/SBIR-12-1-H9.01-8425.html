		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The objective of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a miniature, MEMS IMU based, accurate isolation and stabilization system for beam pointing of a laser designator. Inertial stabilization and relative attitude control are the two key elements constituting the proposed accurate pointing control. Inertial stabilization allows isolation from interference and vibration. Relative attitude control is used for target tracking and to compensate pointing drift caused by gyro drift and the Earth's rotation. In Phase I of this project, first, using the simulation tools and experimental systems of AGNC, modeling and implementation evaluation of the proposed MEMS-based inertial pointing system are performed. Through the modeling and simulation of the closed loop system, the implementation method and the specification of the MEMS devices and pointing system will be further investigated. Then, an inertial motion measurement device test and tuning are performed. MEMS gyros for pointing stabilization are integrated into the platform structure. Next, system integration of the MEMS stabilization platform is investigated. An accuracy evaluation of the pointing stabilization system is performed. Finally, the mechanical structure of the stabilization platform and the integration of the MEMS with the system's mechanical and electronic components is proposed and investigated.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This stabilization pointing and tracking isolation platform is of small size, light weight, low power, fast steering, and reduced cost in design and production. It finds wide applications in spaceborne vehicles for large telescope stabilization control, optical communications, antenna pointing, telescope stabilization, laser pointing and control, and vehicle guidance.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Although the proposed unit is aimed at pointing of a communication laser beam, its properties of small size, low cost, light weight and broad bandwidth disturbance rejection allows its utilization in many commercial applications including pointing control, motion and vibration isolation. Specific examples include: target designation, stabilization control, optical pointing, laser and telescope pointing control. Also, imaging, optical communications, and vehicle control and guidance benefit from our system.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		With the increasing demands placed on extravehicular activities (EVA) for International Space Station (ISS) maintenance, there is a critical need for oxygen delivery for EVA's from on-station sources.  Since mechanical compressors have significant lifetime issues, NASA is evaluating high pressure PEM electrolyzer technology to generate and compress oxygen on the ISS.  State-of-the-art electrolyzers use Nafion&#174; and similar perfluorosulfonic acid membranes which have significant hydrogen (H2) permeation issues.  To achieve the efficiencies desired, NASA requires a 50% or more reduction in H2 permeation with less than 10% reduction in ionic conductivity.  Lynntech proposes to manufacture nanocomposite membranes with significantly reduced H2 permeation while maintaining high ionic conductivity.  Preliminary results showed an unprecedented reduction in H2 permeation with minimal reduction in ionic conductivity (which have not been demonstrated before), no acid generation, and increased water transfer capability.  In Phase I, Lynntech will further optimize the membrane microstructure to achieve a target 60 to 70% reduction in H2 permeation with less than 10% reduction in ionic conductivity.  The anticipated Technology Readiness Level at the beginning and ending of Phase II will be 3 and 4, respectively.

		In this Phase I project, Lynntech proposes to manufacture nanocomposite membranes with significantly reduced hydrogen permeation without adversely affecting the ionic conductivity.  This nanocomposite membrane can replace the commercial membranes that are used in the following applications: 1) High pressure PEM electrolyzers to compress the oxygen up to 3,000 psi for EVA, 2) PEM electrolyzers to generate oxygen for environmental control, crew life support, replenishing the oxygen for cabin, pre-breath oxygen delivery unit prior to space walking, propulsion for in-space maneuvering, in-space science activities, 3) Electrolyzers for regenerative fuel cell systems for storing energy in the form of hydrogen and oxygen, 4) Low (up to 50 psi) and high pressure (up to 400 psi) PEM fuel cells for power generation, and 5) Electrochemical oxygen concentrators to concentrate oxygen from cabin air for medical emergencies.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Proton exchange membranes that have significantly reduced hydrogen permeation have significant potential to replace current commercial membranes and becoming a new product very quickly.  Fuel cell and electrolyzer industries have been looking for a membrane with lower hydrogen permeability to improve the operational lifetime and efficiencies of fuel cell and electrolyzer stacks.  Therefore, there is a significant immediate market and a need for such an advanced proton exchange membrane.  Lynntech has already demonstrated reduction in hydrogen permeation and high ionic conductivity with its nanocomposite membrane. PEM fuel cells are currently considered to be used for power generation for portable, telecommunication back up, stationary, and transportation applications both in the military and in civilian industries.  PEM electrolyzers are considered to be used for energy storage, oxygen generation, etc. in numerous civilian and military applications.

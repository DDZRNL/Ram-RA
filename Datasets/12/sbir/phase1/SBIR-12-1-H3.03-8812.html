		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Vesitech, Inc. has developed a totally new class of water treatment technology utilizing novel carbon based electrodes that have been shown to electrochemically produce advanced oxidation (AO) species in-situ in contaminated water.  Depending upon the electrode formulation and configuration, the species produced include ozone, hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, and hydroxyl radicals, all of which are effective in destroying a wide range of toxic chemical compounds and microbial contaminants in potable water.  This technology has been proven effective in the disinfection of NSF Type I and Type II water. The device is very compact, effective, and energy efficient (< 3watts). Residual hydrogen peroxide can be produced in sufficient quantities to provide a residual effect and inhibit the formation of bio-films. These advanced oxidation electrodes represent a new platform technology which will enable effective, inexpensive, and energy efficient treatment designs for point-of-use potable water treatment systems

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The LCCE-2 Program builds off the successes of the USAF "Low Cost Cryocooler Electronics for Space Missions" Program, extending the performance of the developed LCCE to include active vibration cancellation and advanced input power bus circuitry.  The former is important for imaging payloads because the exported vibration from the cryocooler can be a major contributor to the overall image jitter.  The latter will provide the ability to safely operate the cryocooler system off of virtually any spacecraft power bus from all perspectives, meaning that the cryocooler system will be protected from transient effects from a "dirty bus," and the cryocooler will not impart back onto the power bus large amplitude current ripple that would otherwise affect the performance of other devices on the bus.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The overall benefit to NASA for space-based infrared sensing is tremendous.  The LCCE-2 will be a fraction of the cost of traditional space cryocooler electronics, yet it will have the ability to support the most jitter-sensitive payloads and/or operate on any spacecraft without special accommodation by the power bus.  This is expected to lead to flight opportunities on Earth Ventures, climate satellites, deep space astronomy instruments, and interplanetary mission payloads.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Iris anticipates LCCE-2 will supplant the electronics presently used by the prime contractors for their "core" cryocoolers, such as the NGAS HEC, the Ball SB-235, and the Raytheon RS1 and RSP2.  This will make LCCE-2 applicable for missile defense, surveillance and reconnaissance, and in short the entire gamut of DoD critical mission for space-based infrared payloads.

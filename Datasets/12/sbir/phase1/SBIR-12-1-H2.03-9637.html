		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The development of rocket-based and turbine-based combined cycle engines are a high priority for transportation into space.  In order to test components and systems, and certify life cycles for these  engines, non-intrusive flow diagnostics are required.  In particular, high-speed measurements of pressure, velocity, and temperature profiles across both inlet and outlet ducts of these engines would  provide a better understanding of engine performance.<BR><BR>Southwest Sciences, Inc. proposes to develop a high-speed, non-intrusive monitor to measure such flows.  This fiber optic sensor is based on a novel approach derived from wavelength modulation spectroscopy, in which high bandwidth measurements can be acquired and processed with simple electronics.  Phase I will focus on validating the proposed technique and in Phase II, a fully operational prototype will be constructed, tested and delivered to NASA.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Laser-based platforms provide an efficient, non-intrusive approach for measuring flow properties in both ground facilities and flight platforms.  Our new approach permits very high frequency sampling rates, enabling detailed characterization and verification of advanced engine designs.  This technology has the potential to be miniaturized for use at scales suitable for hypersonic vehicles applications.  This technology can enable a broad set of new, non-intrusive techniques capable of measuring boundary layer and core flow properties in real time to characterize critical vehicle/engine parameters such as air mass capture, stability limits, conditions leading to inlet unstart, and the progress of combustion.  These qualities relate directly to the development of the rocket- and turbine-based combined cycle engines being developed by NASA as discussed in the Solicitation, as well to unassisted hypersonic engines.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA customers include the Air Force for research and development on advanced engine concepts.  Commercial customers include jet engine manufacturers, who also do significant amounts of engine development and research. Additionally, a number of academic researchers could find this type of diagnostic sensor useful for their own laboratory programs, primarily for combustion, but also for any general high speed gas diagostic need.

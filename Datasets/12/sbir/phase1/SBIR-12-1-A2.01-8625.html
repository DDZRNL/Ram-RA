		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is leading a large-scale effort to conduct research, develop standards, and integrate technologies to facilitate the insertion of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS). One area of development to support this effort is the adaptation of existing weather technologies for manned cockpits for use in UAS ground control stations (GCSs). However, the lack of a defined concept of operations (ConOps) and specific GCS technologies for UAS integration in the NAS present challenges for proposed weather information systems. Aptima proposes to develop WINDSUN (Weather Information Display System for UAS in the NAS) as a flexible system architecture and innovative library of platform-agnostic interaction methods to support integration with various ConOps and GCS technologies. A successful Phase I effort will include: (1) a use case with a ConOps to define the core set of tasks around which the design is built; (2) an innovative system architecture that is adaptable to multiple workflows; (3) user interface designs for interaction and visualization; (4) a demonstrable proof of concept physical prototype; and (5) transition plans (implementation, evaluation, and commercialization) for WINDSUN. Phase II efforts, including (1) GCS integration, (2) experimental evaluation, and (3) transition to operational environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		WINDSUN, a decision support display system for providing relevant weather information to human UAS operators and ground control crew members, addresses a relevant, high-priority issue: safe and efficient civil UAS operations in the NAS. New and improved interface displays and interaction methods will be required to support decision making and situational awareness during both mission planning and en-route operations. Initially, Aptima intends to infuse the WINDSUN research effort into the UAS Integration in the NAS Project of the Integrated Systems Research Program (ISRP) in order to address performance and safety challenges associated with an integrated airspace. Research and development conducted on this SBIR will contribute to this project in many ways, namely by developing novel weather information displays for GCSs that present the most relevant information, use intelligent cueing to direct the operator's attention, and allow the operator to manipulate the weather information.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		WINDSUN will appeal to groups external to NASA involved in researching the safety and efficiency of civil UAS operations as well as operating UAS for such purposes as border patrol and agriculture. More specifically, our proposed solution will be an appealing decision support display for commercial markets that require novel information displays that allow users to choose which information to display, add layers of information, and manipulate the display so that it improves situation awareness for safely navigating in the NAS. Across non-government organizations, there is a large market for avionics and related technologies, such as navigation and information systems. As new display technologies are developed, WINDSUN could be acquired by either the manufacturers themselves (e.g., Boeing, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin) or sold as a stand-alone product to those purchasing GCS information displays and technology.

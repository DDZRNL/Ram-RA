		<BR>
		Energy storage devices in many aerospace applications are facing unique challenges. Most of such applications, including remote surveillance, satellites, reusable launch vehicles, etc. depend on high-performance, highly specialized batteries. NASA desires high specific energy batteries that are safe for human exploration missions. Since none exist today, they must be developed. Storagenergy Technologies Inc. and its team members propose to develop a novel core-shell structured sulfur-carbon nanocomposite and novel electrolyte systems for high performance rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries. In Phase I, the composite materials will be synthesized and characterized. The composite's electrochemical performance along with novel electrolyte systems will be evaluated in full cells. Cells with with a minimum capacity of at least 200 mAh will be fabricated and evaluated. During the Phase II, the composite's composition will be optimized further, its performance in cells with 1Ah will be evaluated, and a low-cost large-scale material production process will be developed.

		The subject Li/sulfur battery will be developed for high-efficiency power systems for the human exploration of space, which include power systems in The International Space Station (ISS) and Extravehicular Activities (spacesuit) and robotic landers and rovers for missions to outer planets, moons and asteroids.

		A lithium sulfur battery is likely to provide the right solution for the issues that are challenging the demand for lithium-ion batteries in HEVs and EVs. Lithium sulphur batteries are likely to be available at a much lower price and with higher energy density compared to lithium-ion batteries. Lithium sulphur batteries offer almost three times the energy density as the current lithium-ion batteries. This allows these batteries to run more than 300 miles on a single charge in a passenger electric vehicle. Sulphur is abundantly available, so that reduces the cost of these batteries, thereby making it much more affordable than lithium-ion batteries. These features make lithium sulphur batteries a better choice over lithium-ion batteries. Lithium sulfur battery system also promises to transform the energy storage and distribution fields. This technology, in the distributed energy storage form, reduces greenhouse emissions by serving as a gateway technology to the widespread use of alternative and more importantly intermittent energy sources, namely wind and solar.

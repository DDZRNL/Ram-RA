		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed work will provide NASA with an integrated visualization environment providing greater insight and a more intuitive representation of large technical data sets. Engineering framework tools now provide a new level of integration with systems engineering, high fidelity computation, mission modeling, and collaborative infrastructures. Innovative visualization technology is required to represent the larger and more complex outputs generated by these frameworks. Our proposed solution will address these issues by developing a visualization environment designed from the start to handle extremely large data sets and providing greater flexibility in terms of the graphical output types that can be produced. This work will involve the use of software technology to parallelize operations, use the GPU, improve memory allocation, and use modern libraries such as OpenGL for efficient rendering. Algorithms to study the "white space" in trade spaces and extend Pareto frontiers into these blank areas will be included. New data mining and clustering algorithms for obtaining insight into complex data sets, involving many parameters, will be built into the visualizer.  Features to interact with the underlying computational model (in ModelCenter) and change it easily to observe its effect on the visualized output will be provided. A representative example will be created as a means of demonstrating the new features to NASA and industry. The example will incorporate several new framework technologies (MBSE, mixed fidelity modeling, etc.) and show how the new visualization environment complements these. The new visualizer will be incorporated and commercialized within ModelCenter as a plug-in alongside existing visualization environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A major benefit of the proposed visualization environment is that it is generic and can be applied to the entire life cycle of any complex project. The new technology reaches up to the broader systems level, through MBSE tools, and down to the higher fidelity engineering levels. Target markets within NASA are expanded, therefore, to include a wider audience. These include Science, Human Exploration and Operations, and Aeronautics Research directorates. Indeed, ModelCenter and its current visualizer are used in these areas today. By providing visualization that takes a whole systems approach, involves large data sets, and allows for insightful viewing of these, opportunities beyond the traditional engineering workgroup will present themselves. Initial applications are anticipated in the Science mission area dealing with advanced opto-mechanical design of space telescopes or robotic exploration. Another ripe area is at JPL, for visualization of architectural alternatives in fractionated satellite systems. As the benefits are demonstrated, additional applications will be pursued within NASA directorates that include space transportation and air vehicle technologies. Government agencies that partner with NASA on joint programs such as DOE, NSF, and FAA could constitute a related target market. Prime NASA contractors such as Boeing, Space X, Orbital Sciences, and Sierra Nevada are strong candidates for application, several of which already use Phoenix technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Beyond NASA, Phoenix Integration's commercialization efforts will be focused primarily on the aerospace and defense sector where companies are already actively interested in the visualization technology discussed in this proposal. Phoenix Integration is well positioned to introduce this technology to leading organizations in this business sector such as BAE, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Pratt and Whitney, and Raytheon, since they already utilize the company's products. Phoenix Integration software tools are widely used by domain level engineers to analyze, design, and optimize the subsystems, components, and processes that make up complex aerospace systems. By leveraging this existing installed base, it will be possible to quickly achieve initial sales and establish a core user base for the new technology.  After establishing penetration in aerospace and defense, Phoenix Integration will build upon the successes to pursue secondary markets such as automotive, heavy equipment, green energy, shipbuilding, transportation, and process industries. Some of these industries are also already using the current visualization technology provided by Phoenix.

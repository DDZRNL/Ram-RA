		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The successful landing of the large Mars rover Curiosity on August 5, 2012 outlined the increasing complexity of safely landing large rovers on the planet. A precise knowledge of the spacecraft speed is required in order to initiate the landing sequence near 900 mph; the present method uses IMUs to determine the position and speed of the craft, which is prone to drift and highly sensitive to initial conditions. The proposed MArs VelocitY sensor (MARVY) is a short range air data sensor based on direct, or incoherent, detection of light scattered by both molecules and aerosols. The instrument operates in the presence or absence of aerosols, thus enabling operation in completely clear atmosphere.  The MARVY design will be based on micro-fabricated optical components to provide an instrument that affords all requirements for planetary exploration. This Phase I will entail modeling and design of the instrument. Critical components will be tested in Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's interest in this instrument will not only be for the target use of airspeed measurement during Mars and other planetary atmospheric entry, but also for Earth sample-return capsules and other re-entry vehicles.  NASA research involving UAVs and hypersonic vehicles would also benefit from this compact air data sensor.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The commercial impact of a micro-fabricated air data sensor receiver is substantial.  The proposed research and development opens the path to extremely compact optical air data systems (OADS) for UAVs, cruise missiles and other ordnance with significant flight time, and re-entry and hypersonic platforms.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Deployable Space Systems, Inc. (DSS), in partnership with Mark O'Neill LLC (MOLLC) will focus the proposed NASA Phase 1 effort on the development of our innovative SOLAROSA technology.  SOLAROSA, named for Stretched Optical Lens Architecture on Roll-Out Solar Array, is a new lightweight, high performance space solar array that enables missions through low cost, lightweight, compact stowage volume, radiation hardness, high voltage capability, scalability to ultra-high power, and LILT/HIHT environment operability.  SOLAROSA is a fusion of ENTECH's proven Stretched Lens Array (SLA) concentrator technology with DSS's innovative ultra-lightweight Roll-Out Solar Array deployable structural platform.  The proposed Phase 1 program is uniquely focused on SOLAROSA development that provides multi-A.U. operability and large beta axis off-pointing operational capability.  SOLAROSA promises to provide NASA/industry a near-term and low-risk solar array system that provides revolutionary performance in terms of high specific power (>400-500 W/kg BOL at wing level), affordability (>50% projected cost savings at the array level), lightweight, high deployed stiffness, high deployed strength, compact stowage volume (>60-80 kW/m3 BOL), reliability, high radiation tolerance, high voltage operation capability, scalability, and LILT & HIHT operation capability (LILT &#150; Low Intensity Low Temperature, HIHT &#150; High Intensity High Temperature).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA space applications are comprised of practically all Space Science, Earth Science, Exploration, Planetary and Lunar Surface, and other missions that require affordable and high performance photovoltaic power production through solar arrays.  The technology is particularly suited for Space Science and Exploration missions that require game-changing performance in terms of affordability, high voltage operation, radiation tolerance, ultra-lightweight, compact stowage volume, multi-A.U. operability, and operation within LILT and HIHT environments.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA space applications are comprised of practically all missions that require affordable and high performance photovoltaic power production through solar arrays.  The technology is particularly suited for missions that require game-changing performance in terms of affordability, high voltage operation, radiation tolerance, ultra-lightweight, compact stowage volume, and operation within LILT and HIHT environments.  Applicable non-NASA space missions include: LEO surveillance, reconnaissance, communications and other critical payload/equipment satellites, LEO commercial mapping and critical payload/equipment satellites, MEO satellites & space-tugs, GEO commercial communications and critical payload/equipment satellites, and GEO communications and payload/equipment satellites.  The proposed technology also has tremendous dual-use opportunities for a variety of non-space applications including both ground and roof-mount applications where low cost, manufacturability, ease of installation, compactness and high reliability is demanded.  A terrestrial version of the technology would allow for low-cost high-performance theater mobile power production for the U.S. armed forces, or mobile power production for the commercial terrestrial based user.

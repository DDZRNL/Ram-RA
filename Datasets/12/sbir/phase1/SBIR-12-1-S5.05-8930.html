		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Emergent Space Technologies proposes to develop a flexible, service-oriented Fault Management (FM) architecture for cluster fight missions. This FM architecture will include algorithms to be run on each cluster module for fault detection, isolation, and recovery, software to be used at a ground station to direct recovery actions, and protocols for communication of fault information between cluster modules and between modules and the ground station. Individual components of the architecture will be designed so that they do not work together directly, but interact through predetermined interfaces. This will allow for flexibility, scalability and robustness. During Phase 1 of the proposed research, the focus of the research will be a fault detection and isolation system to be incorporated into the FM architecture.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed FM architecture has the potential to significantly improve the robustness and survivability of missions that could not be performed with a single monolithic spacecraft, as well as those involving cooperative rendezvous and docking. Thus, the proposed system could benefit missions as basic as docking with the ISS or commercial space stations or as advanced as missions where small spacecraft work collaboratively to create sparse arrays, synthetic apertures, or other distributed sensor networks.<BR> <BR>Other applications include spacecraft that are used to assemble large space structures, like a manned mission where the Orion MPCV docks with another Orion MPCV or other spacecraft like the Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle or Deep Space Habitat. Other commercial crew platforms that could utilize this technology are SpaceX's Dragon, Boeing's CST-100, and Sierra Nevada's Dreamchaser.<BR>Finally, the technology stands to benefit cooperative satellite servicing missions as well as UAV and Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technologies developed in this project will be integrated into our work for DARPA's System F6 project.<BR>  <BR>It can also be used to support other DoD or commercial multi-satellite missions that involve cluster flight, orbital rendezvous or even docking. It is anticipated that in a few years commercial manned spacecraft will dock with the ISS or other commercial space stations.  Commercial systems are especially sensitive to size, weight, power, and cost and will benefit from the proposed FM enhancements when building rendezvous capable vehicles at any scale.<BR><BR>As mentioned previously, the applications of the proposed FM enhancements are not limited to space.  Non-space applications include flocks or formations of UAVs, groups of marine vessels, and autonomous transportation vehicles.  Any cluster of vehicles with both GPS/CDGPS navigation and relative measurements available is a potential target for commercialization.

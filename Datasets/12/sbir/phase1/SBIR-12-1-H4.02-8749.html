		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address the NASA need for an EVA information display device, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Projection/Reflection Heads-up Display (Pro/Ref-HUD) based on innovative integration of laser projectors and optics. This approach incorporates miniature full-color laser light sources and low-profile narrowband reflective, see-through toroid-shaped optics, which enable us to meet NASA EVA requirements for displays that are completely decoupled from the user's head and achieving full sunlight readability with automated rapid ambient light response. The Pro/Ref-HUD offers full-color, high-resolution collimated images, with large fields of view, highly suited to the space and weight constraints inside an astronaut's suit. POC plans to demonstrate the feasibility of the Pro/Ref-HUD system by building and testing a preliminary prototype to TRL-4 by the end of Phase I. POC plans to develop in Phase II a fully functional prototype to demonstrate sunlight readability and SXGA  resolution, investigate thermal and radiation issues, and analyze ignition safety due to a 100% oxygen operating environment and vacuum and extreme temperature storage environments. The results demonstrated will offer NASA capabilities to perform EVAs with heads-up displays internal to the helmet to improve crew safety and comfort and prevent misalignment of the display.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Pro/Ref-HUD technology will provide new capabilities for astronauts during EVA with a see-through display system that allows them to monitor the conditions around them while being provided visual instructions and direction in a hands-free format. This will allow astronauts to be more productive and take on less risk, and eventually translate to boresighted overlays for augmented-reality-based information. Applications include space walks on the International Space Station (ISS) where navigating the structure can be completed with maps and repairs completed with heads-up manuals.  Harsh-environment training can also be completed with the HUD by providing assistance and navigation for improved safety such as dealing with Martian dust storms and facilitating asteroid landings.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We anticipate widespread appeal of the Pro/Ref-HUD technology for such entertainment industry applications as gaming HUDs, gaming flight simulators, and other immersive and augmented display systems, including medical and CAD/CAE 3D image displays, virtual-reality displays for endoscopy/laparoscopy, and displays for environmentally hazardous professions such as bomb disposal and hazmat clean up. The DoD has a significant need for HMD technology, including Distributed Mission Training, pilot and combat vehicle crew HMDs, thermal weapon sights, Soldier's Integrated Protective Ensemble (SIPE), and logistics and training. HMD technology advances made possible by the successful development of the proposed Pro/Ref-HUD system will lead to cost-effective commercialization. In particular, this new HMD system will find numerous real time 3D virtual-reality applications. Medicine, avionics, education, law enforcement, firefighting, space exploration, and video games represent major markets for compact, low-cost, lightweight HMDs in the private sector.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Icing is a significant aviation hazard, and icing conditions continue to be difficult to  precisely forecast or locate in real time.  An in-situ sensor, which can be flown coupled with a radiosonde, is needed which can both measure supercooled liquid water content in clouds as well as characterize the droplet sizes.  This sensor will support the calibration and validation of remote-sensing methods used to detect icing conditions, and can also be used on its own to support operational meteorology applications.<BR>Anasphere, Inc. proposes to develop a sizing supercooled liquid water content (SSLWC) sonde which will meet this need.  It will be based on proven vibrating-wire technology which has been used for total water content measurements, but with an altogether different physical implementation that will enable droplet sizing.<BR>Phase I will involve the aerodynamic design of the SSLWC sonde, icing tunnel tests demonstrating key elements of its function, and a live flight test to gather information on the sonde's aerodynamic characteristics.  Phase II will involve further tunnel tests, laboratory calibration development, design for manufacturability, and flight tests in icing conditions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications for the sizing supercooled liquid water content sonde will include the calibration and validation of remote sensing technologies, both radar- and radiometer-based, used to remotely sense the presence of supercooled liquid water which is indicative of icing conditions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Government agencies and universities studying clouds, precipitation, and related properties such as radiative transfer will be able to use this sensor.  It will also be of use to companies developing remote sensing systems.

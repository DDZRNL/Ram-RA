		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Under this proposed effort, we plan to test the feasibility of adapting our terrestrial jammer locator system (JLOC) to locating jamming signals in space by adapting our previously developed GPS software defined radio (SDR) technology to provide an SDR waveform that can operate on spacecraft to allow detection and identification of GPS interference.  We shall also experiment with this waveform to determine how the motion of a low earth orbiting platform can be used to provide geolocation of the interference source.

		<BR>
		The use of GPS has also become prevalent in support of satellite operations, enabling improvements in operational efficiencies for orbital maneuvers, rendezvous and docking and station-keeping.  However, there is little information on the presence or effect of GPS interference on space operations.  Many GPS interference sources are unintentionally created from high power transmitters that leak interference into the GPS band.  Even unintentional interference could have significant effect on space operations.  For example, L2 is particularly susceptible to interference, but is critical for precision relative navigation operations, for example for wide-lane carrier cycle ambiguity resolution.  For low earth orbiting platforms, high powered emissions from the ground could affect their GPS operations.  It is also possible that space-based interference sources could exist that cannot be easily detected by current monitoring systems but could affect GPS based space operations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The level of reliance on GPS for navigation and positioning both in the military and private sector is very high and its reliability has become increasingly important. As a result, jamming, both unintentional and intentional, is becoming more disruptive as more users rely on this technology. While many, including NAVSYS, are looking at methods to mitigate the effect on navigation of jamming, it is also important to be able to detect, identify, and track jammers. This capability would allow for users to be aware of loss of capability and make decisions based on that awareness that could mitigate the impact. In addition, the capability to track jamming would allow a more rapid response to removing the jamming device.

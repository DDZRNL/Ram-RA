		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Sustainable Innovations, LLC, is developing an Electrochemical Methane Generator (EMG), which comprises a novel method of converting CO2 and H2O to hydrocarbon fuels (such as methane) and O2. When powered by a renewable energy source, such as solar or wind power, it can provide a method for producing high quality fuels in a distributed fashion. This is accomplished by harvesting CO2 from the atmosphere and processing it electrochemically to release methane fuel and water. Sustainable Innovations' EMG technology has the potential to lead to a global sustainable energy infrastructure and could also play a pivotal role in achieving both the energy and the life support needs of extraterrestrial bases.  For example, the Martian atmosphere, which is predominately CO2, can be directly used as a feedstock for the production of both fuel and water.  The water can then be recycled to produce breathing oxygen.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology provides the opportunity to manage carbon dioxide and oxygen in life support applications, generate potable water, and produce fuels in a distributed fashion making it ideal for an ISRU application.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology can be used to produce a variety of fuels and commodity chemicals from waste carbon dioxide in distributed form.  This can be used to generate chemical intermediates in industrial processes wile simultaneously managing carbon dioxide emissions.<BR><BR>Fuels and commodity chemicals that can be produced include methane, methanol, ethanol, formic acid, oxalic acid, formaldehyde and others.

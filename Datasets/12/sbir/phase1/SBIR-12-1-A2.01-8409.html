		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Proposed is a dual-mode sensor for use aboard unmanned aircraft for safe operation in the NAS that:<BR>1.	Incorporates high resolution Millimeter Wave radar with high resolution Electro-Optical sensor.<BR>2.	Achieves complete real time, full time spherical coverage around the UAS platform by employing two hemispherical dual mode sensors, one directed forward and one directed to the rear.[which exceeds the detection range and field-of-regard (FOR) for all nearby air platforms in FAA Regulation 7610.4 and other requirements from DOD/FAA documents].<BR>3.	Utilizes multiple coherent transceivers.<BR>4.	Meets SWaP and cost requirements for most UASs, including price (less than $3000 in quantity), size (less than 1 cubic feet), weight (less than 2 lb) and power (less than 10W).<BR>5.	Leverages as needed the Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B), which will be implemented by the FAA in the NAS. <BR>6.	Considers aircraft that operate without ADS-B.<BR>7.	Performs multiple functions; including autonomous detection, tracking, predicting of future track and specification of collision avoiding maneuvers.<BR>8.	Is self-contained, with sensor capability combined with on-board computing and flight control system, yet can be operated with sense and avoid interoperability.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is broadly anticipating future needs of the aviation industry and operations in the US<BR>National Air Space with this topic because UAS can play an increasing role in the needs of<BR>the country and its citizens if able to operate freely.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are numerous applications in commercial, military and civil aviation that could be<BR>met by UAS and/or UAV if they are certified for operation in the NAS. These involve<BR>security, surveillance, search and rescue and deliveries. Unmanned vehicles of all types are<BR>being used for DOD, Homeland Security, and Commercial uses.

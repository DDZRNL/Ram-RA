		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Hybrid-Electric distributed propulsion (HEDP) is becoming widely accepted and new tools will be required for future development.  This Phase I SBIR proposal creates a turbo-electric, hybrid electric propulsion system sizing and weight synthesis tool specifically designed for use in an MDAO framework.  It will offer significant flexibility regarding placement of the propulsive devices for top-level hybrid design, including over-wing, under-wing, split-wing, fuselage pylon-mounted, and other configurations.  The user will supply power required, fan speed, fan torque, TOGW estimation, desired power split between engines and batteries, and selection for propulsion system locations.  Sizing and weight analysis for electric motors, generators, speed controllers, gearboxes, cables, transformers, batteries, and cooling systems will be considered including structural considerations for heavily modified aircraft components for each system.  The outputs will be hybrid electric propulsion system weight, sizes for the sub-system components, and revised HEDP specific TOGW calculation.  The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a tool within a framework for top-level and conceptual hybrid electric propulsion studies.  Additionally, the fidelity of the current NASA models is based on empirical-data and extrapolations.  This proposed tool will employ physic-based models with empirical corrections, when needed.  A Phase II and future commercialization plan have been identified.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The potential NASA applications for this proposed effort will focus on integrating this tool into a larger MDAO framework for turbo-electric, hybrid electric aircraft design synthesis, benefitting multiple NRA projects, and other direct NASA efforts, both internal and external.  Several nuances native to the turbo-electric or hybrid electric distributed propulsion are electric component weight and structure, electric component cooling, and electric cabling requiring a tool such as the one proposed for initial aircraft design synthesis.  These new hurdles have not been addressed in previous textbook methods or efforts, but play a significant role in determining the feasibility of these new aircraft configurations.  One of the major benefits to a decoupled energy management system using distributed propulsion is the freedom in placing the propulsors.  The user can determine where; the options will include under-wing, over-wing, split-wing, fuselage pylon-mounted, and others.  Each configuration will inherently have vastly different structural and cooling considerations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A commercial application for top-level distributed propulsion sizing tool would be very attractive, as the industry is pressing toward hybrid-electric distributed propulsion (HEDP) concepts as new technologies for electric components and batteries develop.  This product will leverage its ability to customize the propulsion system locations, such as under-wing, over-wing, split-wing, and fuselage pylon-mounted.  This tool could also be improved as part of a Phase II effort to include fan and engine tools into a full HEDP tool, and in so doing, become significantly more attractive for commercialization.  AFRL would benefit as they are conducting in-house studies and supporting ESAero in other related areas.  IARPA and the FAA will also benefit, as the tool will be distributed within the government FOUO.  ESAero has identified the government and industry partners to develop this type of technology both near term (Boeing, General Electric, Lockheed Martin) and long term (NASA, AFRL, IARPA etc.).

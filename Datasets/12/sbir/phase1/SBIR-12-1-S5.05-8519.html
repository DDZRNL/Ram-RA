		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Fault Management (FM) is one of the key components of system autonomy.  In order to guarantee FM effectiveness and control the cost, tools are required to automate fault-tree generation and updates based on design models specified in standardized design languages such as AADL.  Accordingly, we propose a fault tree generation and augmentation environment (FTGA).  Equipped by a fault class model and an FM method catalog, FTGA evaluates not only failure behavior in the application under analysis but also FM's capability and adequacy for failure mitigation.  Moreover, when an inadequacy in FM is revealed during fault tree generation or analysis, the fault tree will be allowed for augmentation through FM method insertion and be followed by a quantitative evaluation for FM effectiveness validation.  Therefore, unlike traditional fault tree analysis which plays a passive role in FM, the automated FTGA environment actively and explicitly influence system design and updates, enabling "fault-tree-in-the-loop" for a system's life cycle.  Further, by separating its generic functions (which we collectively call "shared package") from design-language-specific functions (which we collectively call "interface package"), FTGA will be an extensible modeling environment.  The anticipated results from the Phase I project will be a preliminary prototype of FTGA and a demonstration for concept validation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		An immediate application of FTGA will be NASA missions of Science Mission Directorate.  Especially, FTGA can be applied to Spacecraft and Satellite Command and Data Handling subsystems, in order to balance between the objective for the quality of FM and the concern about the monetary budget.  Other important NASA applications include 1) design of avionics systems in spacecraft, 2) devices and computers for long-life missions for which traditional repair and maintenance are not possible, 3) deep-space network communication systems which are critical to mission control and success, 4) design of contingency plans for robotics missions to outer planets, 5) design and development of the approaching, entering, and landing processes for deep-space missions to outer planets, 6) design of fault-tolerant sequences for robotics missions, and 7) design and development of radiation-tolerant field-programmable gate arrays.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Military and commercial avionics systems, as well as command and data handling subsystems, are also very relevant for FTGA applications.  For example, AADL-model-based risk analysis and mitigation can be applied to Army's helicopter avionics systems to aid in simultaneous determination and placement of high assurance partitions and related guard mechanisms to meet application requirements on dependability, safety, and confidentiality.  All those aspects are crucial to military aircraft, including unmanned aerial/ground vehicles (UAVs/UGVs) in which data confidentiality is a critical aspect in case of a crash occurring in enemy's field.  Since our model-based, integrated method which offers not only analytic solution and results but also "prescriptive solutions" to resolve discovered risks,  FTGA applications are highly appropriate for the automobile, truck, and commercial aircraft industries of which good dependability and safety ratings are the most important criterion for manufactures to gain and maintain the competitiveness of their business.

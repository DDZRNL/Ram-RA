		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A novel composite material ablative TPS for planetary vehicles that can survive a dual heating exposure is proposed. NextGen's TPS concept is a bi-layer functional composite. The top ablative layer is a two polymer composite layer formed in a conformal shape by infiltrating ablative polymer in a Si based polymeric foam with controlled pore size distribution.  This layer is for the aerocapture portion of the mission. Underneath it is a ceramic foam core sandwiched between a top ceramic ply and the bottom structural laminated composite substrate. This layer is for the entry portion of the mission. The Si based polymer foam core is similar to the top layer but is already pyrolyzed and is not infiltrated with ablative polymer. The proposed TPS when subjected to aerodynamic heating at high integrated heat loads the foam polymer structure pyrolyzes to the high temperature structure and the filled phenolic or epoxy resin will be charred and ablated. The TPS will be designed to minimize areal density while meeting bondline temperature and ablation rate requirements. The proposed TPS is easy to fabricate in aerodynamic body conformal shapes by simple manufacturing steps. The basis for the proposed concept is recent successful TPS development work performed by NextGen Aeronautics and the University of Washington under the Air Force program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is always looking for technologies that can be used for interplanetary transport of heavy payloads. In initial studies to find a system capable of delivering heavy payloads to the surface of Mars, a conceptual vehicle that achieves orbit via aerocapture, cools down there, and then enters, descends and lands on Mars' surface is proposed. The proposed Thermal Protection System will achieve the mass efficiency necessary to enable and satisfy the mass requirement of this mission. The novel concept is applicable to other mission scenarios with extreme heating during a finite time. It is also applicable to multiple finite-time heating scenarios because of the unique multilayer design that can be optimized for the given requirements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed ablative bi-layer composite thermal protection system will be suitable for many applications with severe heat load requirements. Due to the unique fabrication and bonding/assembly methods to be developed, the structure will have good machinability in the pre-ceramic form, minimal required machining due to near-net shape casting and minimal volume shrinkage, and minimal outgassing of bonding agents from the integrated bonding approach. All of these factors and the low materials and equipment cost contribute to lower overall manufacturing cost. Additionally, the focus on near-net shape forming reduces assembly difficulties and expedites the integration process into subsystems and systems. Potential applications for this technology include high temperature structures such as hypersonic vehicles, rocket nozzles, various space structures, and re-entry vehicle parts. Other commercial products that would benefit from this technology include industrial high temperature furnaces, brake pads in aircraft or racecars.

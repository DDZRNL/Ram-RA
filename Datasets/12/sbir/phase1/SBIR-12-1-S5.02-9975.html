		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose a next-generation cloud-based social media visual analytics disaster response system that will enable decision-makers and first-responders to obtain real-time analytics (both descriptive and predictive) for situational awareness and early-warning. Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook provide rapid "sensory" feedback from "human sensors" &#150; the millions of people on the ground including those affected by the disaster as well as hundreds of first-responders and relief organizations. The problem is that this social media data can be overwhelming and noisy (lots of irrelevant stuff). Our proposed innovation is to combine and analyze this social media unstructured "big-data", together with other structured data from a variety of sources including NASA. The emphasis is on visual analytics which will allow all these diverse geospatial data to be integrated and analyzed on a real-time basis in an intuitive manner. We utilize geobrowsers such as COAST, Google Earth, and OpenStreetMap for display of the output of the visual analytics prediction system. This is an interactive system which enables the relevant users and decision-makers to provide input to the analytics process as the solution evolves.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA SSC is the first anticipated tech transfer user. NASA has several programs that can serve as Phase III sponsors and end-users. One such program is the Wildfire Research and Applications Partnership (WRAP) through which NASA assists US Forest Service (USFS) with UAV-sensor based imagery and decision support. Our tool can both contribute (data and analysis) to, as well as benefit from, WRAP data. NASA's Global Flood and Landslide Monitoring / Prediction System is a WRAP-like program which provides satellite data and imagery to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) globally to help with flood and landslide related disasters. NASA ARC in Silicon Valley has established a Disaster Resiliency Center (DRC). Pre-disaster, the DRC is an Advanced Practices and Research Institute (APRI). During a disaster, the DRC becomes a Disaster Response & Recovery Center (DR&RC). APRI is also a tech transition target for this work

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Local emergency response centers (EOCs) are the first anticipated Non-NASA customers. The Department of Defense (DoD) has many programs, especially those involving agencies like the Marines and the Coast Guard, that are in the disaster response and disaster recovery area. For man-made disasters, such as terrorist attacks, both the DoD and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have candidate programs that are targets for tech transition. Intelligence agencies like the CIA are also interested in unstructured data analytics, especially those involving the newer social media data feeds. In the private sector, emergency departments in hospitals are an example of early adopters; hospitals are interested in predictive analytics that will enable them to plan for upcoming patient admissions following a disaster.

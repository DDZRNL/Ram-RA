		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Aurora will develop a novel composite sandwich structure that is capable of providing a coupled bending-torsional stiffness with nonlinear elastic effects, capable of achieving a tailored aeroelastic response over a wide range of flight conditions.  Such a structure will make use of an additive manufactured core with highly tailored and optimized cellular substructure. The cellular structure will be functionally graded in the spanwise and chordwise directions to provide a coupled bending-torsional stiffness response.  Fiber reinforced composite facesheets will provide strength. Utilizing the core structure to couple the bending-torsional stiffness of the composite may allow the composite to remain balanced and symmetric, thus avoiding induced stresses and/or warping during manufacturing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA programs developing next-generation aircraft, such as the Subsonic Fixed Wing Project, would benefit from the technology developed in this SBIR program to achieve passive aerodynamic tailoring of wing structures.  A similar approach could be implemented using DMLS to create all-metal structures with highly tailored cellular substructures to produce thin, aeroelastically tailored wings for supersonic aircraft, including The Supersonic Project's research in airframe aerodynamic efficiency.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A manufacturable, low-weight composite sandwich structure with coupled bending-torsional stiffness can be implemented to achieve aeroelastic tailoring in many high-aspect ratio aircraft, including next generation commercial transport aircraft and long-endurance UAS vehicles, including Aurora's own Orion UAS.

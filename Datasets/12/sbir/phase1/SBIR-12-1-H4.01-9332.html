		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The current NASA spacesuit community is focusing on utilizing a 13" hemispherical helmet for the next generation of extravehicular activity spacesuits. This helmet architecture presents the end user with a myriad of positive attributes, including a large field of view, enhanced CO2 washout and improved component durability/operational life. The 13" Dome Helmet architecture has proven these attributes via the NASA MK-III and Z-1 advanced EVA spacesuit test beds. Air-Lock's 2012 SBIR proposal advances the 13" Dome Helmet from NASA prototype/test bed to EVA Acceptability for Use by enhancing the design with a fully functional Extravehicular Visor Assembly (EVVA).<BR><BR>Phase I will see Air-Lock engineers leverage current Helmet/EVVA technologies, infuse the design with lessons learned from the EMU Program and implement the resultant design into a 13" hemispherical helmet architecture; heretofore referred to as the Advanced Extravehicular Helmet Assembly (AEHA). In addition to the design facet of the Phase I task, Air-Lock engineers will develop a Verification and Validation Test Plan (V&V) based on current EMU S/AD and CARD requirements along with higher Advanced EVA operating pressures (8.0 psi). This test plan will lay the foundation for Phase 2 Acceptability for Use testing to facilitate the use of the AEHA aboard the International Space Station in support of NASA's planned 2017 ISS Advanced Spacesuit Demonstration Test.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The resultant product from this SBIR task will be a validated EVA Helmet. NASA will be able to utilize this component for government spacesuits requiring EVA Helmets. In addition to the end product, manufacturing advances will be made in the forming and coating of large hemispherical polycarbonate domes. This process can be utilized for windows on pressurized space structures such as rovers, habitats, space stations, etc. Long duration missions such as planetary exploration will utilize pressurized habitats and structures that allow crewmembers to operate in a shirtsleeve environment. Windows will need to be treated with radiation attenuating coatings to prevent cumulative exposure to harmful radiation. This coating will be shown to be capable of being applied to large hemispherical surfaces during this SBIR.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Similar to the NASA commercial application, it is believed the coating of windows with the AEHA Protective Visor coating will have merit in commercial space activities. The fabrication process developed in this SBIR will yield larger, stress concentration free, optical structures capable of providing radiation protection, impact protection and pressure retention. These optical structures can aid long duration pressurized commercial space structures (rovers, space stations, habitats); allowing habitants to operate in a shirtsleeve environment for long durations safely and efficiently without fear of cumulative radiation exposure.

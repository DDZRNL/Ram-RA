		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A significant challenge in scaling micro-propulsion devices up to 100s of Watts as well as scaling macro devices down to sub-kiloWatt level is the lack of a compatible neutralizer technology in the meso scale.  Sub-kiloWatt EP systems require cathode technology that can produce sufficient current while consuming little or no gas or power.  The most promising technology for meso-scale neutralizers is field emission.  In field emission, electrons are extracted directly from a cold bulk solid material by an intense applied electric field at the solid-vacuum interface with no gas flow and no heating required.  While many methods have been proposed to incorporate field-emission neutralizers in EP systems, the inherent fragility of the technology &#150; specifically the reliance on solid structures with nanometer-radius tips &#150; ensures that device failure due to tip degradation will be a near certainty for any application depending on field emission cathodes. The goal of research proposed here is to develop arrays of field-emission neutralizers for use in sub-1-kW EP that eliminate tip degradation not through attempts to minimize tip wear, but instead by incorporating self-assembling nanostructures that can repeatedly re-generate damaged emitter tips in space and fully restore the functionality of a damaged or degraded device.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Electron field emitters are use in numerous applications including electron microscopes, flat panel displays, and microwave generators.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Optimal Synthesis Inc.(OSI) proposes to develop an aiding tool for user interface design that is based on mathematical formalism of hybrid system theory. The correctness of information content of a user interface is ensured by a special observability test that takes into account of human cognition and psychology. A possible mismatch between an operational mode perceived by a human operator and the one active in a machine is detected via an algorithm that infers the intent of the human operator and generates an alert if a discrepancy from the mode of the machine is found. The developed tool is evaluated by considering standard operations in the national air space in the absence and the presence of a system fault.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This R&D effort will develop a procedure for user interface design for the system that can be described as a hybrid system.  While numerous applications fit the description, immediate impact will be on flight deck technologies under NASA aviation safety program and the design of ground station interface for unmanned air vehicles the integration of which into the National Airspace System is considered under Air Traffic Management Research and Development program.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The procedure and the tool developed will be applicable to any application in which an underlying machine can be described as a hybrid system. These include applications in transportation, biomedical engineering, electricity and power, mechanical devices, and many others as user interfaces are ubiquitous.

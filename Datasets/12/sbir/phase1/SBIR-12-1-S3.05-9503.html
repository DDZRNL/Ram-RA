		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The main goal of this work is to design, implement, and demonstrate a guidance and mission planning toolbox for air-launched, unmanned systems, such as guided dropsondes, sonobuoys, or surveillance aircraft, with the primary goal of enabling users to more effectively achieve mission goals by enabling multi-agent interaction and cooperation. Typical missions that will benefit from the MAMS include those where multiple unmanned vehicles are launched from one or more mother aircraft: for example atmospheric research missions making use of many guided dropsondes, missions distributing a fleet of sonobuoys, or surveillance missions requiring multiple UAVs to patrol a given area. As new vehicles are introduced to the environment (launched from the mother aircraft), or as new areas of interest arise, the MAMS will utilize a distributed network method for adjusting the fleet vehicles' trajectories to maximize the mission effectiveness.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The MAMS directly supports NASA's Strategic Goals to advance aeronautics research for social benefit and to expand scientific understanding of the Earth and the universe in which we live. These goals are supported in three direct capacities:<BR>1)by expanding capabilities of autonomous systems as outlined in the Robotics, Tele-Robotics, and Autonomous Systems (Technology Area 04) Roadmap. More specifically the research performed during the Phase I MAMS development supports these Task 04 research areas:<BR>     a.TA4.3.5: Collaborative Manipulation<BR>     b.TA4.4.5: Distributed Collaboration<BR>     c.TA4.5.3: Autonomous Guidance & Control<BR>     d.TA4.5.4: Multi-Agent Coordination<BR>2)by supporting atmospheric research through the development of more capable autonomous sensor systems and mission planning for the Airborne Science Program <BR>3)by contributing to the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) Integrated System Research Program (ISRP) for UAS integration in the National Airspace System (NAS) project through the development and testing of autonomous guidance and decision making and through expanded UAS distributed control among human participants

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Area-I's goal of developing the MAMS with a wide variety of host vehicles and mission types in mind maximizes the potential commercialization of the system with industry users. This theme is highlighted by our industry partner's willingness to support the MAMS project at this early stage of development as shown by their letter of support. Future development plans of the system include expanding vehicle capabilities to include all forms of unmanned aircraft, as well as transition to autonomous surface, underwater vehicles, and towed systems for naval uses and autonomous robotic ground platforms. <BR>The MAMS has great potential in the field of disaster and environmental event monitoring: the system could be used to more precisely monitor volcanic ash clouds, such as those that severely disrupted air travel during the Iceland volcano eruptions in 2010; to direct teams of UAVs and autonomous surface vehicles to monitor oil spills such as the BP oil spill disaster in the summer of 2010; or to provide sensor coverage to measure chemical or nuclear release such as in the Fukushima Power Plant accident in 2011. In addition to disaster monitoring, the system could also be used in disaster relief scenarios. For example, the system may be used to provide evenly distributed airdrop packages to prevent cluttering of packages which often leads to hoarding of limited supplies. Finally, there are abundant military uses for the system including multi-agent patrolling and surveillance missions.

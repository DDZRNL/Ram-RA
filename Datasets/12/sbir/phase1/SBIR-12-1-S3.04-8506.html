		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		United Silicon Carbide, Inc. proposes to develop a novel compact, efficient and high-temperature power module, based on unique co-packaging approach of normally-off silicon (Si) MOSFET with silicon carbide (SiC) normally-on power JFET in a cascode configuration. A much desired silicon MOS gate control is provided readily compatible with the conventional gate drivers, making a proposed module a plug-in replacement for conventional Si IGBT modules offering smaller size and higher power density, lower conduction and switching losses, and higher operating temperature for a wide range of civilian, aerospace and military applications, where compact power converters are needed with minimum cooling requirements.<BR>The proposed hybrid Si/SiC cascode approach offers substantial improvement in module power density, by up to 50%, with unique packaging approach, greatly reduced size of a power switch, and elimination of separate antiparallel diode, which is replaced with an intrinsically fast and efficient body diode of a low-voltage Si MOSFET. Significant reduction in static and dynamic power losses compared to Si IGBTs and SiC MOSFETs are achieved by utilization of a fast switched normally-on SiC JFET with ultra-low on-resistance and hence much lower static and dynamic losses than state-of-the-art Si IGBTs and SiC MOSFETs.<BR>It is hard to understate the need for compact power converters in aerospace applications, where the allowed on-board space and the weight for the power management systems are very limited. The proposed cascode power module will also enable circuit designers to provide significantly smaller, more reliable, more efficient and lower cost solutions for more mainstream applications such as power factor correction circuits, photovoltaic micro-inverters, power supplies, motors & pump drives, industrial power converters, and consumer appliances<BR>.

		<BR>
		Compact power management and conditioning systems are of great interest in aerospace applications, where the allowed on-board space and the weight for the power conversion units are very limited. Proposed power module will be a plug-in replacement for conventional IGBT modules, offering substantially smaller physical module size and higher power density, lower conduction and switching losses, higher operating temperature with minimum cooling requirements.  <BR>Power device modules capable of operating at higher junction temperatures with reduced conduction and switching losses can help to eliminate the active cooling, or at least reduce the size and weight of the required heat-sinks. Higher switching frequency of silicon carbide device modules will lead to significant reduction in size and weight of passive power converter's components, such as capacitors, filters, inductors.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Funding this proposal will lead to the development and commercialization of a unique compact,  efficient and reliable power SiC JFET power module technology for a wide range of civilian, aerospace and military applications, where compact power converters are needed with minimum cooling requirements.<BR>The USCi proposed solution targets the principle ease of use issue and in so effectively becomes an enhanced drop in replacement to existing Si based switches and modules. The application of present state-of-the-art Si MOSFETs, IGBTs and state of the art commercial SiC MOSFETs is limited to junction temperatures of about 150 C. The USCi proposed cascode configuration will raise the steady-state operating junction temperature to over 175 C rating. <BR>Proposed cascode power module will enable circuit designers to provide significantly smaller, more reliable, more efficient and lower cost solutions for applications such as power factor correction circuits, photovoltaic micro-inverters, power supplies, motors & pump drives, industrial power converters, and consumer appliances.  Today there is estimated to be a $15B TAM for Si power discrete devices & Si power modules, however high performance, cost effective and easy to use SiC transistor alternatives will quickly migrate into this space.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Fiber reinforced composite materials are used extensively in aerospace applications due to their high stiffness and strength to weight ratio, and superior thermal, mechanical, electromagnetic and fatigue properties. However, given their demanding operational environment, composite aerospace and aircraft structures are prone to damage and manufacturing related flaws. An accurate assessment of composite structural performance and system life management strategies requires quantitative information on the aforementioned damage states of the components. Recent advances in infra-red (IR) sensing and data processing technologies have enabled real-time thermoelastic stress analysis (TSA) methodologies to finally become viable for accurate diagnostics and prognostics of composite structures. The success of these thermography methods, however, depends strongly on the characteristics of the surface of the composite components. Materials Technologies Corporation (MTC) proposes to develop a specialized, spray-on and peel-off coating technique which would facilitate high accuracy quantitative thermoelastic analysis through improved IR response and thus enable on-going in-situ diagnostics and prognostics during component lifecycle without necessitating disassembly and off-line inspection. A major benefit of the product would be to facilitate usage of less expensive inspection systems that can take advantage of the advanced high emissivity coatings.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		For NASA, the proposed coatings would help in the Low-Cost and Reliable Access to Space (LCRATS) program. Specifically, it can be used for determining structural integrity of bonded assemblies; and non-intrusive inspection of Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPV), Orion heat shield and painted surfaces. It will facilitate detecting and pinpointing corrosion under painted surfaces; identifying composite defects and evaluating integrity; non-destructive measurement and evaluation of COPV; and damage inspection and acceptance testing of Orion heat shield.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The commercial applications are numerous. Almost all industries including aerospace, automotive, and energy sectors would need coating enhanced IR-NDE inspection systems.

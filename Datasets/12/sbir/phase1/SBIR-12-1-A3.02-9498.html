		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Core noise will become a larger component of engine noise overall, as more efficient design trends of fan and jet noise reduction technologies are implemented. The necessity to keep weight and material costs low, as well as the complex geometry and high temperatures involved with the combustion region, make the production of acoustic liners a difficult task.  CRG will develop and produce a prototype acoustic liner test sample for the combustion region that will address all of these issues.  CRG will use its Sialyte(TM) material and simple manufacturing processes to produce a lightweight, inexpensive liner, that contains inherent high-temperature resistant properties.  Sialyte(TM) is a low-cost material system developed for use in high-temperature and high-pressure applications.  CRG will tailor Sialyte(TM) liner properties to demonstrate fabrication control of Sialyte(TM) open-cell foams or combination with Sialyte(TM) honeycomb. These materials will provide broadband acoustic attenuation in relevant frequency ranges, as well as tailoring material properties for mechanical and thermal performance requirements.  The Sialyte(TM) liner will conform to complex, curved geometries and will withstand the high temperatures and stresses in the combustion region.  CRG will demonstrate performance of TRL 4 in Phase I.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Supporting NASA's Fundamental Aeronautics Program, this project's technologies directly address requirements for noise reduction concepts for commercial and military aircraft engine systems.  This project's technologies offer improved core noise reduction in a lightweight, tailorable package at a substantially lower cost than current systems.  CRG's lightweight, inexpensive, tailored Sialyte(TM) liners may have broad applicability for NASA in aerospace applications where noise and high temperatures are of concern.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Government systems that would derive the same benefits would include but not be limited to turbine engine combustor sections, solid and liquid rocket motors, automobile exhaust systems, and other future applications that will require simultaneous noise suppression and high temperature performance operated by the Department of Defense.  This technology's attributes for turbine engine combustor sections should yield a high potential for private sector commercialization for easily manufacturable, highly tailorable acoustic liners for combustor sections by GE Aviation, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce, and Honeywell to name a few.

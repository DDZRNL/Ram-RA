		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed innovation is to accuracy in timekeeping independent of any external reference time, such as UTC. Individual clocks lose accuracy as time passes due to the physical effect called bias drift. The proposed innovation is a process, implemented as a real-time computer program, for combining the time-dependent output of an ensemble of clocks to counteract this loss of accuracy by the individual clocks of the ensemble of clocks. The processing method of the proposed innovation is based on the fundamental statistical concept of confidence interval - a concept seemingly new to such an application. The benefits of proposed processing method for independent, accurate timekeeping are the following: 1) the proposed processing method based on confidence intervals is a purely statistical method of estimation of numerical quantities, and therefore does not require any mathematical modeling of sensors, here clocks, 2) no statistical models, namely no mathematical modeling of probability distributions, 3) no Kalman filter, and 4) the real-time computer programs implementing the proposed method will work with any kind of clock having digital output which can be transferred to a computer processor on which the real-time computer programs are run. The processing method will include numerous confidence intervals, which will all be time-dependent, also called dynamical. These dynamical confidence intervals will statistically characterize both the time-dependent output of the individual clocks of an ensemble of clocks, and the more accurate time-dependent combined output.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The potential NASA applications of the proposed innovation is to accuracy in timekeeping independent of any external reference time, such as UTC. This application of the proposed innovation for independent, accurate timekeeping is especially for NASA's space missions, namely NASA's Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Program.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The potential non-NASA applications of the proposed innovation is likewise to accuracy in timekeeping independent of any external reference time, such as UTC. Other government agencies which could be markets for the proposed innovation for independent, accurate timekeeping are the Department of Defense. For example, submarines could use independent, accurate timekeeping to avoid the need to receive radio signals for keeping onboard clocks running on time.

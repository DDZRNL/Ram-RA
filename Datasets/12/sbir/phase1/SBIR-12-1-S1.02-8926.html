		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has numerous missions that involve radar and radiometry. In the past, the practice has been to build each system as a one-off program, which makes MMIC design unattractive from a cost perspective. In an era of reduced budgets and the need for higher efficiencies both in R&D cost reduction and performance, a better approach is needed. Linear Signal proposes a wideband analog blockset approach, where critical design blocks can be used at multiple bands, on multiple platforms, and for both radar applications and satellite communications markets. Transceiver components can be used for chips targeted for communications application or radar application from P band through X band, for pulsed, chirped pulse and FMCW applications. The work proposed in Phase I and II would result in core IP blocks that can be quickly and relatively inexpensively adapted to a single chip radar transceiver for mission specific objectives. Linear Signal's expertise in wideband SiGe designs and beamforming applications is perfectly suited for this effort.

		This proposal offers a wideband analog blockset approach, where critical design blocks can be used at multiple bands and on multiple platforms across NASA's numerous radar and radiometry and communications and telemetry missions from P- to X- bands and accommodating pulsed, chirped pulse and FMCW applications, offering both higher efficiencies in R&D and critical program cost reductions. The beamforming, smaller size and lighter weight are also intrinsic benefits to just about any future NASA mission requiring radar and coms ability. <BR><BR>This proposal additionally and specifically addresses the solicited requirements:<BR>*	Operating frequencies: P-, L-, C-, X- bands <BR>*	Dynamic load matching<BR>*	Wideband (>50 MHz)<BR>*	High power efficiency (>30%)<BR>*	High T/R isolation (>90 dB)<BR><BR>The approach proposed will result in two or three chip designs covering MMIC pulsed radar transceivers in P through X bands and wideband functional blocks that can be incorporated in new designs.<BR><BR>It is also proposed to develop a flexible architecture and IP blockset collection from which multiple single-chip radar transceivers for various applications and various bands can be developed using a rapid-prototyping approach.<BR><BR>Both analog-only and mixed signal approaches will be explored.<BR><BR>Linear Signal has extensive prior experience in beamformed array and array feeds, RFIC/MMIC design, and radar.

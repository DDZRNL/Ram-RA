		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Cryogenic propellants are important to NASA's missions. Improvements in cryogenic propellant storage and transfer are critical to future long duration NASA spacecraft and missions. Advanced Cooled Shield - IMLI (ACS-IMLI) is an innovative ultra high performance system in which an Advanced Cooled Shield is fully integrated into the IMLI layer structure, reducing mass, forming a single robust system, with integrated cooled gas distribution in a cooled shield layer, eliminating heat flux through thermal shield tank standoffs or supports, and operable in both passive (vapor cooled shield) and active (broad area cooled shield) modes.<BR><BR>NASA's TA-02 Roadmap calls "Zero Boil Off storage of cryogenic propellants for long duration missions" the #2 ranked technical challenge for NASA mission objectives and needs.  Quest Thermal Group has developed IMLI, an advanced thermal insulation that uses proprietary discrete spacer technology to reduce heat flux. IMLI's unique structure is able to self support various loads, including a thin, lightweight vacuum shell for in-air operation, high strength ballistic layers for MMOD shielding, an external Broad Area Cooling Shield with cooling tubing, or an integrated thermal shield within the layers. IMLI's layer structure gives it unique capabilities, such as an embedded conductive, sealed thermal barrier. <BR><BR>In this Phase I program, an ACS-IMLI system would be modeled, analyzed, designed, fabricated, installed on a cryotank, and tested for structural strength and thermal performance.  Advanced Cooled Shield &#150; IMLI (ACS-IMLI) could provide a lower mass, single insulation system, operable in both passive (vapor cooled) and active (cryocooled) modes, with 3 &#150; 4X lower heat flux than IMLI alone. ACS-IMLI could help meet NASA's cryogenic fluid management requirements such as Zero Boil Off for cryogenic propellant storage and transfer.

		<BR>
		Passive and active thermal insulation improvements are critical to NASA goals for long duration missions, and are part of NASA's Cryogenic Propellant Storage and Transfer Technology Demonstration Mission.  Advanced Cooled Shield - Integrated Multi-Layer Insulation (ACS-IMLI), with an Advanced Cooled Shield integrated into the IMLI layer structure, could provide substantial improvements to both passive and active thermal insulation systems. <BR><BR>ACS-IMLI could offer a more robust thermal shield than presently available, lower mass, new opportunities to manage cooled vapor distribution and heat shield operation, as well as substantially higher thermal performance than traditional MLI.<BR><BR>ACS-IMLI could benefit NASA by advancing this novel passive and active insulation technology. ACS-IMLI could enable longer duration cryogenic powered missions, longer coast times for orbital transitions, higher payload capacity to GSO, enhancements to the workhorse Atlas V and Delta IV launch vehicle families, applicability to upcoming cryogenic upper stage designs such as ACES and Space Launch System, aid with Zero Boil Off for orbital fuel depots, preserving cryogens for NASA spacecraft and space-borne instruments, helping enable future NASA extended missions. ACS-IMLI should offer good performance, robust and repeatable insulation systems, lower installed cost, and both passive and active cooled modes customizable for specific vehicle requirements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		ACS-IMLI could enable substantially improved performance for cryogenic launch vehicles such as Centaur, DCSS, ACES and SLS.  Quest has had discussions with ULA's Advanced Programs, with interest expressed in IMLI and IMLI incorporating a thermal shield.  Reducing cryopropellant boiloff allows longer coast times and higher payload capacity enhancements for the workhorse Atlas Centaur and Delta launch vehicle families. It could be incorporated into upcoming cryogenic upper stage designs such as ULA's ACES and human rated launch vehicles, aid with Zero Boil Off for orbital fuel depots, and help preserve cryogens for commercial satellites and space-borne instruments.<BR><BR>ACS-IMLI improved thermal insulation could be useful in preserving cryogens for various industrial uses, such as insulation for dewars for LHe, LH2, LN2 and LOX used for commercial, medical, industrial and research processes. ACS-IMLI insulation for dewars would use passive cooling from cryogen boiloff to cool the thermal barrier, reducing heat flux through the insulation. Large tanks storing commercial/industrial cryogens, such as LNG, might benefit from ACS-IMLI performance. ACS-IMLI might also prove beneficial for the storage and transport of hydrogen powered aircraft and ground vehicles.

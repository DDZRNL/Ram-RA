		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		For the proposed CoNNeCT experiment, Innoflight and John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) have formed a significant complimentary union with respect to each one's expertise in space networking.  Innoflight is bringing forward design and development expertise in cryptographically secure Internet Protocol (IP) for space links per NSA specifications while JHU/APL brings formidable Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocol and application to run above the secure transport.  The two combined provide a high-value space communications solution that can be tested and refined using CoNNeCT.  In addition, each one separately provides its own independent solution for a large variety of commercial and government applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The SBIR by itself provides the maturity necessary to immediately infuse the technology into programs supporting the following NASA customers:  Deep Space Planetary Missions, Extra Vehicular Activity Office, and Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Program.  Innoflight will pursue the individual PMs of current and planned projects within these programs.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed Secure DTN technology is applicable to all aspects of space communications.  The ability to enable autonomous networking and command/control of space-based systems in a secure end-to-end manner has considerable implications for cost savings in unmanned operations.  In addition, the technology realizes a significant achievement in reprogrammable/reconfigurable communications systems.

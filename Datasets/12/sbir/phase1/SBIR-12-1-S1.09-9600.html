		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		OPTRA proposes an open-architecture spectral gas sensor based on compressive sensing concepts employed for both spatial and spectral domains.  Our matched spectral filter (MSF) core can be used as a single point detector in either point or standoff configurations or it can be coupled with a compressive imaging module for molecular imaging.  The MSF core employs a digital micromirror device (DMD) to apply reference spectra to a spatially dispersed spectrum; the dot product measured with a single element photodetector is proportional to the probability of the compound corresponding to the reference spectrum being present.  The MSF can also be used for quantification via grayscaling of the DMD.  This approach effectively performs multicomponent spectral analysis in hardware rather than software thereby reducing data bandwidth requirements.  The MFS will be designed for the 3-5.5 micron spectral range enabling detection and quantification of a range of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants.  This solution represents a significant cost and size reduction relative to commercially available spectrometers operating in this spectral range, as it does not require a focal plane array or interferometer.  Under the Phase I effort we will design, build, and test the MSF core configured for point detection.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary NASA application is initially gas detection from ground-based surface vehicles.   This solicitation describes the application of these sensors for ground based surface use as a maturation step towards the ultimate application of airborne and/or mobile missions.  Airborne missions are tasked with greenhouse gas and other air pollutant measurements.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications include remote sensing, environmental and process monitoring, and vehicle emissions diagnostics.

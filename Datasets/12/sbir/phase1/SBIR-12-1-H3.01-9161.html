		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Sustainable Innovations has developed an innovative concept for highly efficient, reliable, potable water production based on technology from a commercial line of hydrogen recovery and compression systems the company is developing.   This Electrochemical Dehumidification and Life Support System (EDLS) system utilizes a small amount of hydrogen as a working fluid, operating in a sealed cavity, and leverages a hydrogen compression cycle to provide the driving force to both remove water from the local environment, passing it into a dry hydrogen stream, and condense pure, potable drinking water.  The hydrogen compression cycle used in this process is highly efficient, approaching the efficiency of an ideal isothermal compression process, and can be achieved without moving parts.  This technology could play a key role in critical NASA environmental control and life support applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Transporting water from Earth for NASA space missions is cost prohibitive, so recycling is mandatory. Waste water must be reclaimed from various sources, including by condensing humidity from the air. Without careful recycling 40,000 pounds per year of water from Earth would be required to resupply a just four crewmembers. A highly efficient portable / transportable system for potable water production having no moving parts would significantly reduce the logistics burden.  This technology can play a key role in any NASA application where life support is critical, from manned bases to the EMU.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Because water logistics have become very important in wartime events, we see the U.S. military as a primary initial customer for this technology.  We anticipate teaming with a military equipment supplier to both finalize a product configuration and manufacture/supply the final product in accordance with applicable military standards.<BR><BR>There are many opportunities for Atmospheric Water Generators (AWG) in the commercial sector, ranging from disaster relief to water generation in remote villages.  Availability of potable water is perhaps the most critical need that mankind faces.  With bottled-water consumption increasing and water distribution systems aging, water could be the next commodity consumers will want to produce at home. Market trends appear to be in atmospheric water's favor. According to the International Bottled Water Association, global consumption of bottled water has grown 7.6 percent per year on average since 2002, reaching 189 billion liters in 2007. The United States led consumption, with 33 billion liters, but was followed closely by populous developing countries like China, Brazil, and Mexico. China's market grew 17.4 percent per year.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed load-bearing, tank-applied, multi-layer insulation system consists of a set of highly reflective radiation shields made from 1 mil thick aluminized Mylar that is supported from a "pop-up tent like" support frame.  In addition, the support frame carries the mass of an actively cooled shield and outer MLI blanket enabling ultra low heat leak storage of cryogenic fluids.  The support frame is conveniently mounted to the top and bottom center tank penetrations, eliminating any direct supports to the cryogen tank itself, which reduces the heat leak to near the theoretical minimum.  The novel design approach is significantly better than conventional MLI, which does not possess the required structural or thermal capabilities required.  The technical approach is to integrate low-risk, high Technology Readiness Level (TRL) (TRL 7-9) components into a new and unique low-cost, light-weight, high-strength, thermally efficient MLI system.  This approach enables the system to meet and exceed all requirements for reduced heat leak, low-mass, and high strength to withstand flight loads.  The NASA Cryogenic Propellant Storage and Transfer Program will directly benefit from the development of the proposed MLI system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Application of this technology would significantly reduce the losses associated with the storage of cryogenic fluids.  The advanced insulation techniques being proposed by Sierra Lobo will directly benefit NASA's Advanced Space Exploration Program.  Cryogenic fluids such as hydrogen, methane, and oxygen are required for many current and future space missions that will use life-support, propulsion, and power systems.  The targeted NASA applications for long term cryogenic propellant storage, in-space as well as on the lunar surface, include space transportation orbit transfer vehicles, upper stages, space power systems, spaceports, spacesuits, lunar habitation systems, and in situ propellant systems.  In addition, NASA spaceport operations and propulsion test facilities are both heavily dependent upon a wide range of cryogenic systems.  Improving the efficiency of these systems at these facilities using advanced insulation techniques will directly benefit the programs they support through reduced operating costs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The advanced insulation techniques being proposed by Sierra Lobo can be used in nearly any industrial, commercial, or medical application currently requiring storage of liquid cryogens such as helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.   Such fluids are routinely used in the medical industry, metals processing, semiconductor manufacture and as well as many non-NASA government agencies.  The targeted applications for the Department of Defense include Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) that carry liquid oxygen and potentially liquid hydrogen, liquid hydrogen powered ground transportation systems, space platforms using electric propulsion (xenon, hydrogen), space-based chemical lasers (hydrogen, helium), orbit transfer vehicles (hydrogen, oxygen), and orbital propellant depots/space stations (hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen).  The Department of Energy applications include reducing heat leak into liquid helium cooled superconducting magnets for particle acceleration systems.  Commercial market applications include cryogenic storage dewars for medical and process systems and over-the-road dewars for transporting cryogenics, especially the lower temperature cryogens, liquid hydrogen and helium.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We proposes to build a prototype Convective-Induced Turbulence (CIT) hazard detection system based on total lightning sensing as an indicator of the location and severity of in-cloud CIT.   Total lightning is the combination of cloud-to-ground and in-cloud lightning and has been shown to correlate well with storm dynamics. Total lightning activity will be measured globally at high temporal resolution from total lightning detectors onboard future geostationary satellites such as the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-Series (GOES-R) and the Lightning Imager (LI) on the Meteosat third generation satellites. Thus, we seek to investigate the relationship between in-cloud convective turbulence and total lightning measurements, and determine the skill of total lightning as an indicator of in-cloud CIT.  We investigate how to use proxies for GLM lightning data to enhance the diagnosis of hazardous turbulence over the Continental United States (CONUS) where verification data is readily available from ground-based (radar-based) systems.   This system will enhance safety of flight for aircraft in the CONUS as well as oceanic and global airspace.  Such a technology would be useful to all aircraft that fly, from General Aviation (GA) aircraft to Unmanned Air Systems (UASs) to business jets and commercial jets.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Our proposed SBIR product helps Aviation Safety Program (AvSP) researchers study technologies and concepts that enhance aviation safety.  The proposed product enables NASA researchers to evaluate the detection, identification, evaluation, and monitoring of in-flight CIT and lightning strikes hazards to aviation.  An example of this would be the detection of moderate or severe turbulence detected by our system, distributed to other aircraft via electronic PIREPs, electronic flight bags, voice communication warnings, or other mechanisms to tactically adjust the flight levels of nearby aircraft prior to entering into an area of MoG CIT.  Our Phase II system also provides in-cloud lightning activity, which aircraft could use for avoiding lightning strikes to the airframe.  In our R&D plan, we consider multiple sensors in combination to improve hazard detection and quantification of hazard levels in our validation work; this may also provide opportunities for data fusion of total lightning strike, NTDA, DCIT, satellite, in situ measurements, and other data for use in NextGen safety related R&D analyses conducted by NASA.  Our technology holds promise to be used as a global turbulence detection system when operating with satellite sensors, providing NASA the ability to advance turbulence sensing in oceanic and remote areas.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A commercial product can be customized and implemented under contract to Airline Operations Centers (AOCs) for use by dispatchers and ATC coordinators, or for industry ATM R&D specialists.  Airlines will find our data useful for flight planning and for safety warnings

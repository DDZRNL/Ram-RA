		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		ORBITEC proposes to develop and demonstrate the innovative Acoustic Resonance Reaction Control Thruster (ARCTIC) to provide rapid and reliable in-space impulse without the use of toxic hypergols, delicate catalyst beds, or cumbersome spark systems. The ARCTIC thruster will exceed current reliability standards, reduce RCS complexity, and provide system-level benefits by minimizing weight, decreasing power requirements, and improving serviceability.  The Phase I work will focus on the development and testing, both at sea level and vacuum conditions, of a prototype ARCTIC thruster, as well as the design of flight-weight ARCTIC thruster for Phase II implementation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		ARCTIC addresses the needs in NASA's technology roadmap, specifically Technology Area 1.4.1, which calls for low-cost, high thrust-to-weight RCS thrusters that use non-toxic propellants.  By eliminating cat beds, hypergols, and spark systems, ARCTIC will be developed into a safe, low-cost, long-life RCS thruster to support NASA's exploration activities.  This versatile thruster can be used with a wide range of fluids, including indigenous spacecraft propellants and in situ space resources.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Beyond the needs of NASA, it is expected that ARCTIC-based propulsion systems could be developed for governmental customers such as the USAF's Reusable Booster System (RBS) program as well as commercial customers such as Sierra Nevada's Dream Chaser program and Boeing's Cryogenic Propellant Storage and Transfer demonstrator.  The same acoustic resonance technology could be used in applications including rocket engine igniters, OMS & DAC thrusters, and pre-burners.  AFRL is already incorporating ORBITEC's acoustic resonance igniter technology into the Hydrocarbon Boost program.  Furthermore, ORBITEC has incorporating the acoustic resonance igniter into its propulsion systems and demonstrated the concept in a sounding rocket flight.  Ground-based commercial applications for this technology may include industrial burners and large-scale, power-generating gas turbines.

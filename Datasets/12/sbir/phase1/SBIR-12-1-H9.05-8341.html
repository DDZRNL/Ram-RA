		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		High bandwidth communication links are needed between satellites and ground stations, inter-satellite, and to airborne assets.  As data loads increase and satellites available payloads decrease keeping the information flowing becomes even more challenging.   In this SBIR program we will design and demonstrate the feasibility of ultra-low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) Micro-Laser Communications (MiLC) modules for high bandwidth (up to Gbps or possibly much higher)  data links between miniature satellites (e.g. cube-sats),  and ground stations, satellite clusters, and/or airborne assets.  One possible laser comm. modules will fit within a few cubic inch volume, require less than 1 watt of power and be able to provide ground station tracking (including orbital motion over wide angles and jitter correction) with a >100 Mbps downlink and no moving parts. Higher bandwidths are possible with trade-offs. This will be enabled by replacing heavy and power consumptive mechanical scanners with new, game changing wide angle (120o x 120o), electro-optic laser scanners.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Small satellite platforms are often highly constrained by their ability to provide high bandwidth data to the ground which often limits the relevance of even highly capable payloads due to the lack of data availability. MiLC modules will alleviate this bottleneck. Furthermore, this development is in alignment with NASA technology roadmaps and addresses NASA technology grand challenges by drastically increasing space communication link capacity at LEO/GEO from current low data rates at RF to high data rates at optical frequencies with low power/mass/size/cost.  Space communication technology development must ensure that future space missions of NASA and other agencies are not constrained by a lack of communication capability.  The demonstrated capacity will allow future missions to take advantage and to implement new and more capable science instruments that will evolve in the future.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The ultra-compact, low power, and ultimately low cost optical communication systems proposed here have numerous commercial applications.   They will be instrumental in last-mile telecommunications environments in urban setting, for field-deployable high-definition video systems for newscasters and sports casters (e.g., high-def coverage of golf tournaments is currently and outstanding challenge), and a variety reconfigurable, low-cost, commercial high-bandwidth data links. Extending the capability to space based platforms will find utility in satellite relay networks, surveillance systems, and general increased communications bandwidths.

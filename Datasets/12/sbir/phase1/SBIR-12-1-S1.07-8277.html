		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		For a wide range of remote sensing applications, there is a critical need to develop imaging arrays that simultaneously achieve high spatial resolution, high sensitivity, and sub-nanosecond timing resolution. Many of these remote sensing applications furthermore are satellite and space based, where the imaging array also needs to be rad hard; particularly for the harsh radiation environments typically found on certain deep space missions, such as to the moons of Jupiter. LightSpin Technologies is developing a high performance solid-state cross-strip anode imaging single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array technology using rad hard GaAs SPAD arrays. This approach promises substantial improvements in spatial resolution (< 10 microns), timing resolution (< 100 psec), and count rate (> 10 Gcps). LightSpin has proven the concept provides excellent performance in small arrays (8 X 8 pixels) and developed a theoretical foundation enabling rapid scaling of the arrays to achieve Megapixel resolution at low cost.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has an ongoing need for imaging detector arrays capable of withstanding the harsh irradiation environment of certain space missions.  While silicon imagers are widely available at low cost, they are generally unable to withstand harsh radiation environments.  In addition to static and video rate imaging, the development of imagers with time resolved capabilities enable time-of-flight instruments such as ladar, lidar, altimetry, and mapping.  And finally, the ability to detect single photons with high sensitivity is critical.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High performance, time-of-flight imagers are rapidly making inroads into a number of applications, including autonomous navigation (automobiles, UAVs, marine), gesture recognition, and robotics.  Current time-of-flight sensors are either too expensive (Google autonomous car system costs more than $50,000) or too limited in range (Microsoft Kinect system has a maximum range of 20 feet).  Successful completion of this SBIR project (Phase I and Phase II) will enable Kinect like pricing (< $100) for autonomous car systems (range > 1 mile).  Nearly all autonomous navigation applications would benefit, including automobile ladar (collision avoidance, pedestrian avoidance, autonomous driving), robotics (autonomous robotic navigation), airborne ladar (UAVs, airplane collision avoidance).

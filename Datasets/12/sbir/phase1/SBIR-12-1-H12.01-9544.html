		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To advance the effectiveness of exercise activities performed to counteract bone and muscle deterioration under microgravity conditions, Aurora Flight Sciences and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology propose to develop a self-contained, enhanced dynamic load sensor that can be integrated into the existing exercise equipment onboard the International Space Station.  These sensors will allow the collection of crewmember biomechanical while they are exercising on-orbit.  These data can be used to validate the effectiveness of the countermeasures and improve their impact to mitigate bone and muscle loss during long duration spaceflight missions.

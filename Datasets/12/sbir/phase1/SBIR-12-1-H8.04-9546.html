		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed SBIR project will provide a pathway to dramatically reduce the cost of multi-junction solar cells.  The project leverages a TRL6 micropackaging process with ~100% yield for cell assembly.  Cost savings are critical as space-qualified multi-junction cells render large panel applications prohibitive.  The proposed project aims to develop a greatly-simplified manufacturing process that can be performed by most compound semiconductor foundries.  Thus, cost savings can be derived from increased competition and scaling by leveraging low-cost high volume manufacturers for wireless components and LED lighting devices.  <BR><BR>The preliminary 3-subcell systems has >30% efficiency at 60C-100C. For higher efficiency, a 5-subcell system has >57% efficiency.  <BR><BR>For CPV applications, LCOE of the 3-subcell system at 630 suns is 20.96 cents/kWh (real)/27.20 cents/kWh (nominal).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The plug-and-play nature of the assembly approach allows customization for space applications while still leveraging the larger volumes from CPV.  This can be critical for space applications, as different cell materials and thicknesses can be incorporated for mission requirements.<BR> <BR>NASA applications include Solar Electric Propulsion, satellites and UAVs.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		CPV is a key application and cost driver.    <BR><BR>The availability of higher efficiency cells is also important for applications that utilize solar energy to extend the operational duration of mobile devices.

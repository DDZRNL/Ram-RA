		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology is a revolutionary solar array advancement that relies on a structurally optimized platform to provide unparalleled specific-performance and affordability for extremely large area solar arrays.  The proposed technology is comprised of a central beam tensioned membrane architecture that leverages key heritage technology elements to provide low-risk and high end-user acceptance. The proposed technology will enable emerging Solar Electric Propulsion Space Science and Exploration missions through ultra-affordability, ultra-lightweight, ultra-compact stowage volume, design simplicity, robustness and high damage tolerance, broad scalability, high strength/stiffness, high voltage and high/low temperature operation capability within many environments. Once completely optimized through the proposed SBIR program the proposed technology promises to provide NASA/industry a near-term and low-risk solar array system that provides revolutionary performance in terms of high specific power (>300 up to 500 W/kg BOL at the wing level, PV-blanket dependent), affordability (up to 40% cost savings at the array level, PV-blanket dependent), ultra-lightweight, high deployed stiffness (10X better than current arrays), high deployed strength (10X better than current arrays), compact stowage volume (>70-80 kW/m3 BOL, 10X times better than current arrays), high reliability, high radiation tolerance, high voltage operation capability (>200 VDC), scalability (500W to 100's of kW), and LILT/HIHT operation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA space applications are comprised of practically all Exploration, Space Science, Earth Science, Planetary Surface, and other missions that require high-efficiency photovoltaic power production through deployment of an ultra-lightweight and highly-modular structural system.  The technology is particularly suited for NASA's SEP missions and other missions that require game-changing performance in terms of extremely large deployed areas, affordability, ultra-lightweight, and compact stowage volume.  The technology is also well suited for applications requiring scalability/modularity, operability within high radiation environments, high voltage operation, and LILT/HIHT operation.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA space applications are comprised of practically all missions that require high-efficiency photovoltaic power production through deployment of an ultra-lightweight and highly-modular structural system.  The technology is particularly suited for SEP missions that require game-changing performance in terms of large deployed areas, affordability, ultra-lightweight, and compact stowage volume.  Applicable non-NASA space missions include: LEO surveillance, reconnaissance, communications and other critical payload/equipment satellites, LEO commercial mapping and critical payload/equipment satellites, MEO satellites & space-tugs, GEO commercial communications and critical payload/equipment satellites, and GEO communications and payload/equipment satellites.  The proposed technology also has tremendous dual-use non-space commercial private-sector applicability including fixed-ground and deployable/retractable mobile-ground based systems.

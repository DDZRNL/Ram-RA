		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Current NASA programs, such as Adaptable, Deployable Entry and Placement Technology (ADEPT) and Woven Thermal Protection Systems (WTPS) are looking to fill a gap in ablative TPS for future missions to Venus and Saturn, human missions beyond Lunar, and Mars Sample Return Missions.  Both of these programs rely on the use of 3D woven carbon fiber preforms.  Therefore, there is a need to be able to predict the properties and performance of a woven material.  Validation of predictive modeling tools would allow for the use of these tools to design and optimize the 3D weaves, significantly reducing the cost of fabrication and testing of a variety of configurations. While there are proven tools for the prediction of laminate composite properties, textile composites are relatively new materials and much less effort has been focused on modeling this class of materials. Materials Research & Design (MR&D) has experience in working with and designing 3D woven preforms for use in composite material reinforcement and has developed a suite of analytical tools to define the detailed geometry of 3D woven preforms for use in calculating material properties.  However, these tools currently do not have the capability to predict material strengths.  Within the proposed Phase I effort, MR&D will enhance the existing tool by incorporating the ability to calculate material strengths of 3D weaves.  Strength predictions will be made for two different 3D woven hybrid preform reinforced phenolic panels and compared to measured test data for validation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The successful completion of the Phase I program would directly benefit the Adaptable, Deployable Entry and Placement Technology (ADEPT) program as well as the Woven TPS program, both of which are currently focused on the use of 3D weaves in ablative TPS.  The ability of a predictive tool to generate material properties and strengths for a variety of 3D weaves would allow for the evaluation of multiple design configurations and fiber types to be evaluated in a much more efficient and cost effective manner than having to fabricate and test panels to generate data to be used for downselection of the best candidate designs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to the potential NASA applications, there is also potential for applications within the Department of Defense (DoD).  The use of 3D woven preforms in ballistic armor applications creates a need for design and predictive modeling capabilities of these materials as well.<BR><BR>There would also be potential for applications from the weavers themselves.  Companies such as Textile Engineering and Manufacturing and Bally Ribbon Mills have an interest in the predictive capabilities of both material properties and strengths for various weave configurations.

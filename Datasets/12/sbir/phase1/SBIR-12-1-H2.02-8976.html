		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Systima will develop an innovative light weight self-pressurizing pump (SPP) technology to provide a constant-pressure supply of monopropellant to a spacecraft or tactical propulsion system. The SPP does not require a helium tank and higher operating pressure have a negligible impact on the system mass.  Since the SPP has a lower weight than comparable propellant pressurization systems, it provides an opportunity for reducing launch costs, increasing spacecraft or tactical system payload capacity and significantly enhancing delta velocity/�V.  This technology can be used with hydrazine, HAN-based, or ADN-based propellants as there are no known limitations on the monopropellant that can be used in the system.  The self-pressurizing lightweight pump for advanced monopropellants offers significant advantages in applications where a large �V is required, such as large spacecraft or in applications where high-pressure is needed, such as liquid ACS or DACS thrusters.   The Phase I and Phase II SBIR will focus on development of the system for operation with the HAN-based monopropellant AF-M315E.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Green propellant delivery systems offer safer handling without the risk of exposure of toxic chemicals to personnel or the environment.  They offer improved vehicle performance, reduced costs, and permit shorter launch processing times. There is no limitation to the NASA satellite applications to which this technology can be applied; it is suitable to nearly any satellite, large or small, intended for low earth orbit or for geosynchronous orbit, etc. In addition, the reduced toxicity and handling infrastructure could be especially of interest to re-usable space vehicles and rapid access to space applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Green monopropellants offer significant advantages in performance and reduced handling infrastructure for commercial and military vehicles and payloads and allow for modular designs for enhanced response capabilities.  There is no limitation to the commercial or military satellite applications to which this technology can be applied; it is suitable to nearly any satellite, large or small, intended for low earth orbit or for geosynchronous orbit, etc. In addition, the reduced toxicity and handling infrastructure could be especially of interest to re-usable space vehicles, rapid access to space applications and shipboard missile systems. It is also possible that this technology could be applied to torpedo propulsion systems and emergency power generation systems to provide greater safety and improved handling costs.

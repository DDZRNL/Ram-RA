		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Pioneer Astronautics proposes a technology program for the development of an innovative photocatalytic oxidation reactor for the removal and mineralization of Volatile Organic Compounds to extend crewed space exploration beyond low earth orbit.  This novel technology, called the High Performance Photocatalytic Oxidation Reactor System (HPPORS) leverages recent progress in high power Light Emitting Diodes (LED) and efficient, visible wavelength photooxidation (PO) catalysts to completely oxidize Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) to carbon dioxide and water.  The basis of the innovation is the synthesis of commercial high power, high brightness LEDs with efficient geometric illumination of active visible-light activated PO catalyst in a high surface area to volume fiber optic reactor.   This combined approach leads to numerous performance benefits including high VOC conversion efficiency, compact reactor volume, and low pressure drop.  The development of the HPPORS technology will lead to a photocatalytic reactor that meets the rigorous compliance requirements of complete VOC mineralization to CO2 and H2O, while utilizing efficient visible LEDs or solar energy in a compact, scalable package.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The application of the HPPORS is to provide a compact, high performance air purification device for spacecraft environmental control and life support system (ECLSS) for extending NASA's mission beyond low earth orbit to include long-duration space habitation, Lunar, and Mars colonization missions.    This is accomplished by the innovative HPPORS device which combines energy efficient visible LED-based source illumination, high photon utilization, visible light activated photocatalysts, high reactor surface-to volume, and low pressure drop.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology applies to any system where removal of toxic industrial chemicals and pathogens are present in air, and where robust operation with minimal supply logistics is required.  Other government agencies such as the Department of Defense would benefit from this technology in similar applications such as collective protection of the warfighter from chemical-biological weapons attack.  The technology would have numerous commercial and private customers in sectors including homes, schools, commercial offices, hospitals, and public transportation.  The potential public benefits of an effective air purification system include fewer lost school and workdays due to sick-building syndrome and communicable illness.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Integrate advanced nanotechnology with energy storage technology to develop advanced cathode material for use in Li-ion batteries while maintaining high level of safety, stability and cycle life, allowing the cathodes to be tailored to provide very high specific energy or very high specific power depending on the relative ratio of the three components- active material, current conductors/collectors and binders, thus maximizing specific energy (Wh/kg) and energy density (Wh/l).
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential applications for this technology include astronaut/EVA (extra vehicular activity) equipment, human habitat power systems with large storage capability, human/robotic landers and rovers, planetary probes and inner planetary missions, earth/planetary orbiters and heavy lift launch vehicles. Additionally, this technology can be applied in the automotive industry as the main power source to drive EVs and PHEVs, as well as adapted for use in power grids for advanced energy storage solutions.

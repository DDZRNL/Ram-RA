		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Remote Sensing Solutions proposes to develop the Network-based Parallel Retrieval Onboard Computing Environment for Sensor Systems (nPROCESS) for deployment on NASA's unmanned aircraft systems (UAS).  The nPROCESS will provide a compact, efficient, reconfigurable computing environment that will achieve unparalleled real-time data processing, acquisition and distribution to provide new observations and improved sensitivity; provide a test-bed for measurement and algorithm development and testing for future mission risk reduction and demonstration; produce critical information for real-time decision making; and facilitate a path to reduce risks and installation / operational costs for deployment of new and existing sensors on NASA UAS platforms.  The proposed innovations to realize nPROCESS are: (1) reconfigurable, object orientated system architecture that will provides far greater customization and expansion, (2) modularity at the hardware, firmware and software levels to adapt to the sensors needs at minimum cost and (3) high fidelity parallel processing and data distribution capabilities. Deployed with the HIWRAP on the NASA Global Hawk, nPROCESS will provide higher quality and real-time mapping of the three-dimensional wind profiles, ocean vector surface maps and precipitation winds within tropical cyclones.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed effort will provide the NASA UAS community with a high fidelity, real-time data processing environment that will lower costs and reduce schedules in deploying new sensors on the NASA unmanned aircraft and potentially enhance the observations being obtained with current sensors.  With NASA trying to expand its UAS program the timing and capabilities of this system are a very good fit.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed effort will offer defense and commercial aerospace sectors a high fidelity processing environment that can be reconfigured for a variety of airborne mapping and surveillance activities as well as an advanced on-board processor capable of handling ultra wide-band applications and real-time parallel processing.

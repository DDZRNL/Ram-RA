		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Leveraging a rapidly evolving state-of-the-art technical base empowered by Phase I NASA SBIR funding, NanoSonic's polymer derived rare earth silicate EBCs will provide a paradigm breaking advancement for NTPs by extending the operational utility of NTP rocket thrust chambers and nozzles. Unlike competing deposition technologies severely limited by substrate size and dimensions, NanoSonic's rare earth silicate coatings may be spray deposited under ambient conditions onto large area complex substrates and converted to mechanically robust, thermally insulative EBCs on a production basis.  In fact, legacy spray equipment employed for hardcoat deposition within the marine, automotive and aerospace industries has been used for successful EBC deposition. Simulated NTP testing completed by the University of Washington on coated Inconel 625 substrates indicate five candidate EBCs have exceptional environmental, dimensional, and adhesive durability within flow conditions representative of NTP rocket engines. In fact, zero spallation, erosion, or any other form of coating degradation was observed at the thermal limit of testing of 1,950 C. All candidate resins may be transitioned to 200-gallon batch production quantities within an established manufacturing infrastructure.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NanoSonic's yttrium silicate coatings will serve as a next-generation alternative to line-of-sight vacuum assisted EB-PVD coatings for lifetime and performance gains  on nozzle, throat and core rocket engine components. Since the technology is spray deposited using legacy HVLP equipment under ambient conditions, literally any rocket propulsion component may be coated during a continuous or semi-continuous process during vehicle construction, as well as retrofitted on existing large area, irregularly shaped structures in need of high temperature thermal, corrosive and erosion protection.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Broad secondary commercial and DoD applications will be continuously sought for NanoSonic's polymer derived rare earth silicate EBCs.  Of particular interest is the foreseen return-on-investment for aerospace, marine and automotive engine components and subcomponents integrating NanoSonic's EBCs for enhanced thermal insulation, corrosion and erosion durability.  Additionally, NanoSonic's polymer derived EBC coating technology may serve as an integral enabling technology for the use of fiber reinforced polymeric composites in closer proximity to engine systems by providing highly efficient, thin (<75 microns) insulative coatings.

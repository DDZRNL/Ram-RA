		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA missions for planetary exploration require high power, long-life Hall thrusters. However, thruster power and lifetime are limited by the erosion of plasma channel walls.  Current plasma channel insulators, BN or Borosil, have the required low secondary electron emission (SEE) but are susceptible to xenon plasma erosion. AlN has exceptionally high plasma erosion resistance but suffers from high SEE yield. AlN can be a "revolutionary" replacement for BN channel insulator since it provides high plasma erosion resistance with structural robustness and high thermal conductivity if it's SEE yield can be reduced. <BR><BR>In Phase I program we demonstrated the SEE yield of AlN can be reduced to the levels of state-of-the-art BN-based materials by microstructural engineering  without sacrificing  its thermal and mechanical properties for long-life plasma channel insulators in high power Hall thrusters.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High specific impulse, high power Hall thrusters will be key for planetary exploration and efficient cargo delivery to Mars.  Project Prometheus would significantly benefit from the long-life, high power Hall thrusters afforded by the proposed channel insulators.  Long-life, high power Hall thrusters would be useful in geosynchronous communications satellites to reduce propellant mass and as primary propulsion in deep space scientific missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The United States Air Force has many missions that would benefit from small, low-cost satellites. Commercial applications include communications and imaging satellites, companions to large satellites to provide surveillance and close-up inspection capabilities, such as to monitor and assure proper deployment of solar panels, antennae and other appendages.

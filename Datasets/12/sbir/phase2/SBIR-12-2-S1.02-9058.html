		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		An improved efficiency amplifier for high power pulse applications at P-Band will be investigated that will support space based RADAR systems.  Current P-Band pulsed amplifier technologies use Silicon Bi-polar and LDMOS device technologies that have increased internal device parasitic characteristics that lead to lower gain and more difficult power matching over GaN technologies.  Integra Technologies has experience with all three device technologies.  Integra also has the design and manufacturing processes in place to optimize transistor design and amplifier design for P-Band pulsed applications.<BR>	 The phase I effort resulted in successful demonstration of  an Integra GaN device at P-Band frequencies using Class AB bias and Switch Mode matching techniques to achieve greater than 80% efficiency at 160W.     The phase II device investigation will include geometry modifications to optimize the operating voltage, chip size, and cell dimensions for the P-Band RADAR application. Ultimately, the optimized GaN device will be scaled into a 1kWatt output stage with an appropriate driver device to enable a greater than 40dB gain amplifier.  The amplifier will include material selections and layout techniques for reliability under high RF energy signal levels and low pressure environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A target application for this pulsed power amplifier can be RADAR imaging of surface features for Mars or other non-terrestrial objects, or the terrestrial surface.  The use of a very high efficiency power amplifier will allow for higher power levels in an energy limited environment such as a space craft operations.  Higher power ratings of this proposal will allow for greater standoff distances and improved signal to noise for the receivers used for an imaging application.<BR>	The successful development of this high efficiency amplifier concept can be leveraged by NASA for other RADAR imaging applications at other wavelengths, as Integra Technologies GaN devices can be used at L-Band, S-Band, C-Band and X-band.<BR>	An airborne test bed system for Biomass estimation (Airmoss) is in operation using P-Band SAR that is the precursor to space instruments.  Future interplanetary missions outfitted with the Multi-Mission Subsurface Imaging Radar (MMSIR) could use this amplifier technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The use of higher efficiency and higher power GaN pulsed amplifiers will allow for improved power management for commercial and military applications for RADAR and medical imaging systems.  Integra Technologies will continue to push the 'state of the art' for GaN devices and amplifier modules that enable imaging technologies for UHF, L-Band, S-Band, C-Band, and X-Band, which will be enabled by the technology research.

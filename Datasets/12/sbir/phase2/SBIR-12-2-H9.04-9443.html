		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		SySense, Inc. proposes to develop a framework for the design and implementation of fault detection and isolation (FDI) systems. The framework will include protocols which define how to work with an end customer so that an FDI system may be developed for a wide range of autonomous satellite, rocket, air, land, and underwater vehicle missions. The framework will define what kinds of data and information are needed a priori in order to design the FDI system, what kinds of mission requirements can be answered with the system, and how the system should be implemented in order to meet those requirements. The framework will also include the procedure to facilitate the efficient integration of our FDI methodology into both existing and planned systems. Clearly defining the FDI design process through this framework will make the technology more accessible to mission designers and lower the cost of implementation, providing more opportunities to apply this technology.  The efficacy of the framework will be confirmed by designing and implementing collocated and non-collocated FDI systems for a representative satellite mission. The framework will also include introductory tutorial material designed for mission planners.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		SySense, Inc.'s FDI methodology complements traditional system failure detection schemes and can provide additional safety and performance margins to any satellite or  spacecraft mission. A clearly defined design framework will ease the burden of integration into existing and planned missions or systems.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		SySense, Inc.'s FDI methodology complements traditional system failure detection schemes to provide additional safety and performance margins to any system that can be modeled, eg. power grids, chemical refineries. A clearly defined design framework will serve as a marketing tool for the benefits and capabilities and to also ease the burden of integration into exiting or planned systems.

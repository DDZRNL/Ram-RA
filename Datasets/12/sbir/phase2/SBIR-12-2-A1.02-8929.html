		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Icing is one of the most significant hazards to aircraft.  A sizing supercooled liquid water content (SSLWC) sonde is being developed to meet a directly related need for in-situ measurements of both total supercooled liquid water content and droplet size distribution.  This data will support the development of remote sensing instrumentation to detect icing conditions, support aircraft certification activities for flight into known icing conditions, and support the development of new icing-related operational weather forecast products.<BR>	Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of the SSLWC sonde's measurement technique.  The sonde airframe was designed, built, and tested, mathematical models relating the sonde's raw data to the target variables were completed, a data processing algorithm was developed and implemented, and a proof-of-concept sonde was built.  <BR>	Phase II will involve refining the sonde design, adapting the mathematical algorithms into their final application environments, conducting additional studies of sonde elements in an icing wind tunnel, and undertaking two field missions to obtain intercomparison data between the SSLWC sonde and other accepted approaches to such measurements.  At the end of Phase II, the SSLWC sonde will be proven to the point that it can be marketed with confidence for the application areas outlined above.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA will be able to use the SSLWC sonde to support the development of remote sensing methods for cloud properties and for fundamental research into icing.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Aircraft certification activities, private sector development of remote sensing techniques, and new icing weather forecast products are three areas of application foreseen for the sonde.  Other scientific agencies, particularly NOAA, DOE, and NSF, are likely to have applications for the sonde in the areas of in-situ cloud research and the development of remote sensing techniques for cloud characterization.  Operational meteorology applications are also foreseen for the FAA (likely through the National Weather Service) in support of new icing safety programs.

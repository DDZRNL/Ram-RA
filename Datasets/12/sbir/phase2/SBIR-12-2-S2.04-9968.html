		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Phase I project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of developing a technology that will reduce cost and manufacturing time, broaden design options, and improve performance of large space optics.  <BR>Primarily addressed is light weighting ULE glass mirrors for large telescope systems.  <BR><BR>While milling and cutting materials such as ULE or SiC is often performed at Ormond using a novel abrasivejet technology, there is a need to develop this technology to a the requirements of large optics manufacturing.<BR>In Phase I, Ormond proprietary glass and ceramic cutting and milling technologies were adapted to AMTD-2 requirements through software, process and tool development.  The technology is now at TRL5 and technology feasibility has been demonstrated.  <BR><BR>A demonstration coupon was machined based on the current AMTD mirror concept at rates several times faster than conventional grinding can accomplish.  This design has 0.75 inch deep hex cell pockets in the mirror back, the same as would exist on a full scale mirror.  Rough semi-elliptical optical surface machining was also demonstrated in Schott glass.  Tooling designed in the Phase II program will support substantial improvements in risk mitigation, tolerance holding capability and material removal rates.<BR><BR>This work will continue to be performed with close interaction with NASA and Exelis to insure that the work directly supports current and future program needs.  The Phase II program will result in a working system that is capable of completing a 1/3 scale model of the AMTD-2 mirror with tremendous cost savings, schedule reduction and risk reduction compared to grinding.  Capacity for full scale up will be demonstrated during Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Phase I program was structured to primarily support a critical need of NASA AMTD-2.  Specifically, developing a process that can safely and economically perform mirror backside light weighting of very large telescopes.<BR><BR>The Phase II project will result in a technology that will be immediately available to support broad a range of NASA space and ground based optics programs.  <BR><BR>The Phase II workscope is structured to support the 1/3 scale AMTD-2 mirror fabrication and scale up efforts, so the results of this SBIR will very likely be applied under ongoing and future NASA projects.<BR>Raytheon has stated in a letter of support that the Ormond milling technology is a critical technology to reduce machining and fabrication times, as well as risk in processing of ceramic and glass ceramic substrates.  They state that the process has potential applicability to several NASA programs including JDEM, IXO, LISA, ICESAT, ATLAST, CLARREO, ACE.<BR><BR>Trex has stated that this technology is critical to manufacturing the difficult to machine SiC optics materials that are produced there.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The developments made under the proposed SBIR support any application where brittle materials are machined, especially applications where challenging ceramics such as SiC must be machined in bulk.<BR>One large market area is the ceramic armor industry.  The developments made under this SBIR will directly support requirements of current efforts to manufacture ceramic armor at Ormond.  This application represents a huge market but there are still important developments to make.  Ormond is currently working with Army contractors to determine ballistic performance of milled ceramic armor panels.<BR><BR>The technology will be commercialized in these and other industries through technology licensing that will allow the large NASA primes to implement it in their own facilities.  Ormond has successfully commercialized technologies in the past, either through licensing or custom manufacturing system sales.  Additionally, Ormond will be capable of commercializing the technology though smaller scale manufacturing performed in-house.

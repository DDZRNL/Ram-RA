		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Radiation-hardened non volatile memory (NVM) is needed to store the golden copy of the image(s) has not kept pace with the advances in FPGAs. Consider that a single image of a Xilinx V5 FPGA typically is roughly 50 Mb large. If a designer wants to store several such images in a satellite, then a sizable amount of highly reliable, radiation-hardened memory is needed. Traditional Rad hard memory for space (CRAM, FRAM, MRAM) is not sufficiently dense and extremely expensive. As a consequence, there exists a clear need and market opportunity for highly reliable, higher density, NVM for storing program code, calibration tables and images of reprogrammable FPGAs. The goal of this SBIR project is to develop a highly reliable and fault-tolerant, radiation-hardened hermetic memory multi chip module (MCM), which can be used to configure and scrub reconfigurable FPGAs. The MCM will contain a simple radiation-hardened microcontroller and three (3) commercial flash nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices which have been radiation characterized. Our integrated device will support the needed standard interfaces that are commonly used for reconfiguring FPGAs, including Xilinx SelectMAP and JTAG. The output of our Phase II SBIR is a 32Gb device which meets at least 150Krads (Si) total dose. Space Micro has full capability to introduce and market this device into the international space business market.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Virtually all NASA space programs have a demand for this technology and resulting space qualified non volatile memory product. NASA applications range from science missions, space station, earth sensing missions e.g. (EOS), and deep space missions. This device will enable improved docking, proximity operations, and landing missions. NASA programs/missions that will benefit include new lunar landers and orbiters, Mars missions (MAVEN), solar system exploration e.g. (Titan, Juno, Europa, comet nucleus return, New Discovery, and Living with a Star (LWS). NASA programs which hopefully will continue to be funded by Congress include the next generation heavy launch vehicle called SLS, the Orion Multipurpose Crew Exploration Vehicle, Commercial Crew Development Vehicle (CCDev2) and Commercial Orbiter Transportation Service (COTS) will benefit. Space products evolving from this SBIR , and marketed by Space Micro, would have been enabling for NASA programs such as RBSP, GRAIL, LADEE, IRIS, Dawn, SDO, Aquarius, Kepler, Ocean Vector Winds, and space interferometry (SIR). New missions which hopefully will be funded include BARREL, CLARREO, GEMS, solar orbiter, Osiris-Rex asteroid sample return mission, solar probe plus, and ILN.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR will benefit many commercial space platforms, both LEO and GEO telecommunication satellites, such as Intelsat, Direct TV, XM radio, Orbcomm and Iridium Next telecom constellation replenishment, plus standard industry busses including Lockheed's A2100, and Boeing's HS-702. Civil earth sensing applications such as weather/metrology applications e.g. (NOAA GOES and Landsat). <BR>The large DoD space industry, including USAF, MDA, NRO, and new Army nanosat programs at SMDC will directly benefit. Among these programs are AEHF upgrades, GPS follow-ons, MDA's STSS and PTSS, USAF TacSat family, Plug and Play (PnP) sats, Operationally Responsive Space (ORS), and Army SMDC nanosat family. The entire CubeSat initiative would benefit. <BR>This memory product will also address emerging MDA radiation threats. These programs include CKV, AKV, THAAD, AEGIS, MKV, and GMD for Blocks 2018 and beyond. A specific example here is the CKV (Common Kill Vehicle) where the advanced missile needs high density radiation hard memory for avionics. With the new challenge of atmospheric neutrons to High Altitude Airship (HAA) programs and NASA or Air Force UAV programs, this affordable  product will be a timely solution. <BR>Other military applications are strategic missiles (Trident and Air Force Minuteman and MX upgrades.<BR>Space Micro will insert in our image processing computer (IPC-5000), star tracker, and Software Defined Radios (SDR).

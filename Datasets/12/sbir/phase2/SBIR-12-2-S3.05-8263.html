		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed innovation is a low-cost, retrievable and reusable, autonomously guided dropsonde capable of deploying from a host aircraft and performing in-situ atmospheric measurements. We have decided to name this platform the NavSonde&#8722;an autonomously navigable sonde-glider.  The proposed effort focuses on the engineering work involved with the retrieval of high altitude volcanic ash plume samples using this autonomously guided dropsonde.  Small scale particulate sampling equipment for airborne missions is not commercially available. Even for full scale manned systems, many research programs develop their own collection and sensor systems.  A small form factor unmanned aerial sampling system, capable of being deployed from a host aircraft at high altitudes and autonomously guided to regions of interest will offer atmospheric scientists an innovative research tool&#8722;particularly for those seeking unprecedented access to high altitude atmospheric sampling to monitor events that may be deemed too dangerous for manned aircraft.  Autonomously guided dropsondes have several advantages over current dropsondes&#8722;the main ones being their ability to fly to regions of interest and to perform pre-programmed actions at specified locations and/or altitudes (e.g. sample).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The ability to collect in-situ atmospheric ash samples directly related to several of NASA's core missions. NASA's Airborne Science program is the direct customer of the NavSonde, which is specially designed to be deployed from NASA's DC-8 platform. Current measurements of ash plumes, such as from MODIS have a stated need for validation, which can be provided by the sampling returns of the NavSonde.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NavSonde's greatest potential is in providing timely qualitative information to decision makers in the wake of events such as the eruption of Eyjafjallaj�kull in 2010, which was estimated to have a USD$5B negative impact on Europe's economy. By providing in-situ� measurements of composition and size distribution of hazardous particulates, the NavSonde will minimize disruptions to air traffic and other economic activity that might otherwise be impacted by overly conservative decisions made with an absence of information. Groups as diverse as universities, the DOE, and the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers have directly expressed interest in using the NavSonde to further their goals.

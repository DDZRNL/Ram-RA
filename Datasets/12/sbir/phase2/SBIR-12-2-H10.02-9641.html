		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Acute challenges are faced by the designers of fluid transport systems for spacecraft because of the persistently unfamiliar and unforgiving low-g environment. However, with modern design tools capillarity can used to passively perform critical life support functions, increasing reliability, while enabling new device functionality. Such systems are directly tied to critical life support systems: i.e., oxygen supply, air revitalization, thermal management systems, water reclamation, medical fluids, and others. <BR><BR>In this work IRPI will apply the Phase I design process toward the development of a much needed contingency waste water collection and processing device for human spaceflight. The device provides passive liquid collection, containment, bubble separation, and droplet coalescence functions for contingency urine collection in a lightweight, low volume, low cost, and potentially disposable device that may be used for subsequent sampling, metering, storage, disposal, and/or re-use. Our approach will include "fractal wetting" and design that incorporates "smart" capillary fluidics. Though the work is focused on a single application, the design approach and capabilities have a broad impact on capillary-based fluids management aboard spacecraft and on earth.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed device has immediate applications within NASA at both the device and broader design level. Fractal wetting capabilities have the potential to transform the manner in which fluid systems are designed, while the development of a contingency urinal device is an immediate need for human spaceflight that includes ISS, moon, and Mars missions. The device can also be used as a tool to monitor crew health by measuring and metering urine samples, providing commercial opportunities in life support and exploration technologies that support manned missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A byproduct of the development will be the compelling demonstration of fractal wetting design and implementation. This opens up opportunities for a multitude of both extraterrestrial and terrestrial applications including biomedicine, Lab-on-a-Chip technologies, fuels delivery, advanced heat pipe wick structures, space hardware, and others.

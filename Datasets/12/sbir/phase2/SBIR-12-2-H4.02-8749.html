		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address the NASA need for an extravehicular activity (EVA) information display device, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to advance development of a new Projection/Reflection Heads-up Display (Pro/Ref-HUD) based on innovative integration of liquid crystal display (LCD) screen projectors, partially see-through optical reflectors and unique ergonomic designs. This approach enables the displayed image to meet NASA EVA requirements and is completely decoupled from the user's head while achieving full sunlight readability with automated rapid ambient light response. The Pro/Ref-HUD offers full-color, high-resolution collimated images, with large fields of view, highly suited to the space and weight constraints inside an astronaut's suit. In Phase I, POC successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the Pro/Ref-HUD system by designing, building, and testing a TRL-4 prototype. In this Phase II, POC proposes to develop a fully functional prototype to demonstrate sunlight readability and SXGA resolution, investigate thermal and radiation issues, and analyze ignition safety due to a 100% oxygen operating environment as well as vacuum and extreme temperature environments. The results to be developed and demonstrated in Phase II will offer NASA capabilities to perform EVA operations with heads-up displays internal to the helmet enhancing crew situation awareness, comfort, and safety.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Pro/Ref-HUD technology will provide new capabilities for astronauts during EVA with a see-through display system that allows the astronauts to monitor the conditions around them while being provided visual instructions and direction in a hands-free format. This technology will allow astronauts to be more productive and take on less risk, and eventually translate to boresighted overlays for augmented-reality-based information. Applications include space walks on the International Space Station (ISS) where navigating the structure can be completed with maps and repairs completed with heads-up manuals.  Harsh-environment training can also be completed with the HUD by providing assistance and navigation for improved safety such as dealing with Martian dust storms and facilitating asteroid landings.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		See-through HMD technology advances made possible by the successful development of the proposed Pro/Ref-HUD system will lead to cost-effective commercialization. In particular, this new HMD system will find numerous real time 3D virtual-reality and augmented-reality applications. The military has significant and various needs for HMD technology, including Distributed Mission Training, pilot and combat vehicle crew HMDs, thermal sights, Soldier's Integrated Protective Ensemble (SIPE), and logistics and training. In addition, we anticipate widespread appeal of the Pro/Ref-HUD technology to such entertainment industry applications as gaming HUDs, gaming flight simulators, and other immersive and augmented display systems, including medical and CAD/CAE 3D image displays, virtual-reality displays for endoscopy/laparoscopy, and displays for environmentally hazardous professions such as bomb disposal and hazmat clean up. Medicine, avionics, education, law enforcement, firefighting, space exploration, and video games represent major markets for compact, low-cost, lightweight HMDs in the private sector.

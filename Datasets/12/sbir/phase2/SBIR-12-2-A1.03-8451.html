		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Based upon the feasibility demonstrated in the Phase I research, Optimal Synthesis Inc.(OSI) proposes to develop a software tool that can be used validate aircraft flight deck user interfaces over the entire flight envelope. The approach is based on a mathematical formalism derived from hybrid systems theory. The correctness of information content in user interfaces is analyzed by a special observability test that takes into account of the limitations in human cognition and psychology. A possible mismatch between an operational mode perceived by the human operator and the one active in the aircraft is detected using an algorithm that compares the inferred intent of the human operator to that of the machine. Metrics-based performance evaluation will be carried out to demonstrate the benefits of the prototype software developed under the Phase II research.  The feasibility of employing the software on the flight deck as a real-time pilot aid will also be analyzed in the Phase II research.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The software developed under the proposed research can support Automated Discovery of Previously Unknown Precursors to Aviation Safety, Automation Design Tools, Assurance of Flight Critical Systems, Advanced Flight-Deck Operations and Human-Computer Interactions tasks under the Aviation Safety Program. Additional programs to which the software can contribute, include Unmanned Aerial Systems integration into the National Air Space, the Automax concept, and Single Pilot Operations under the NextGen Airspace Operations program.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technologies and the software developed under the proposed research will be applicable to FAA for certifying future interface. Analysis methodologies developed under the proposed research will be useful to NTSB in flight accident investigation by detecting cognitive mismatches in a flight data record. These technologies can be used by companies developing flight deck technologies for use in the next-generation commercial and military aircraft. Other applications of these technologies are in the design of hospital equipment and human-robot workstations.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose a radical new approach for to the design and fabrication of a fiber-less Interferometric Optical Gyroscope (IOG) that enables the production of a radiation hard, very small IMU with better performance, higher reliability, high level of robustness and lower cost. We estimate that an order-of-magnitude improvement in cost and size to performance ratio of IOG sensors and their corresponding assemblies can be achieved when compared to the conventional Fiber Optics Gyroscope (FOG) implementations, enabling high level of performance in a MEMs compatible IMU size. Such a system will be of great advantage for all future NASA applications that focus on small satellites and payloads

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposal will develop the key enabling component in a low cost, high precision inertial navigation system (< 0.10 � accuracy, resolution). Low cost, higher precision and low weight/power (SWaP) inertial sensors are necessary components for future NASA applications, including Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Sounding Rocket and many other Autonomous missions as key technologies that have in NASA technology roadmap.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Navigational and high-end tactical IMU market is an expanding market with a push for improved performance. This expansion will be driven by cost and size reduction. The proposed IOG technology will be the smallest volume IMU on the market today.  It will enable new commercial and DoD applications including airborne PODs, Line of Sight stabilization, weapon designation, Interceptor technology, individual soldier navigation, battlefield management, turret stabilization, missiles, UAV, AHARS and more.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		For spacecraft design and development teams concerned with cost and schedule, the Quick Spacecraft Thermal Analysis Tool (QuickSTAT) is an innovative software suite that will significantly reduce labor costs and effort associated with the design, analysis, and optimization of spacecraft. Unlike traditional analysis where highly-trained engineers spend days to months developing, running, and evaluating high-resolution models, QuickSTAT provides the similar results in near real-time to a broader range of users. QuickSTAT will enable, on one hand, highly skilled thermal engineers to more effectively explore complex design spaces, while on the other hand give better engineering design access to less skilled engineers and program stakeholders. For thermal analysts involved in multi-dimensional trade studies, QuickSTAT provides the means to rapidly compare hundreds or thousands of discrete design points and identify trends that lead to more optimal design solutions. For designers of low-cost spacecraft, QuickSTAT can enable quick and efficient thermal design trade studies without investing in a high-end thermal analysis tools.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		QuickSTAT will enable the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate's (HEOMD) chartered responsibilities of; 1 reduce costs of future human space flight, and 2) providing a tool that will reduce the cost and time required for design and analysis of spacecraft TCS. Specifically, the International Space Station (ISS) and its visiting vehicles are programs that stand to benefit from the design tool.  Potential ISS visiting vehicles are the Orion CEV, SpaceX Dragon capsule, Boeing CST-100, and Sierra Nevada Dream Chaser.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Similarly to NASA unmanned missions, this proposed design tool will be of interest to other Government spacecraft procuring agencies such as the Air Force, Navy, National Reconnaissance Office, and Operationally Responsive Space Office; as well as, prime contractor spacecraft developers such as ATK, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Sierra Nevada Corporation, Raytheon, and Surrey. In addition, QuickSTAT will be highly useful within the CubeSat market which includes Government, industry, and university customers.  <BR>Beyond spacecraft thermal control system modeling, the proposed Phase II effort will develop a design tool ready for efficient transition to new aerospace applications as well as alternate industries. The design tool could be applied to virtually any engineering analysis, regardless of industry. Potential product extensions span from adjacent engineering analysis applications such as stress and fluid analysis, to new industries such as energy system modeling.

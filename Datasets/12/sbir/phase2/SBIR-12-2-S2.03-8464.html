		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this Phase I research, ZeCoat Corporation demonstrated a low-stress silicon cladding process for surface finishing large UVOIR mirrors. A polishable cladding is desired for SiC optics so they may be figured in less time, and so they may be polished to levels suitable for UVOIR astronomy.  ZeCoat has filed a provisional US patent application for the technology.  The proposed process is directly scalable to SiC mirrors several meters in diameter. The process is based on a novel, low temperature, ion-assisted, evaporation technique (IAD), whereby the coating stress of a silicon film may be manipulated from compressive to tensile, in order to produce a near-zero net stress for the complete layer. A Si cladding with little intrinsic stress is essential to allow thick coatings to be manufactured without cracking.  A low stress coating also minimizes substrate bending that would otherwise distort the figure of very lightweight mirrors.

		<BR>
		Normal incidence 4-meter class UVOIR telescopes have been cited as a high priority by multiple government review panels including; the National Research Council's (NRC) study of NASA's Space Technology Roadmap and Priorities, The Office of the Chief Technologist, The Cosmic Origins Program and NWNH Decadal.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The ability to apply silicon cladding over a very large area offers the possibility of coating hundreds of smaller SiC optics at a time, thereby driving the cost down.   In exceptionally high volumes it is conceivable that the price to mass produce a Si-SiC optic could become competitive with traditional Zerodur and ULE optics.   Thousands of small laboratory mirrors, high-energy laser mirrors and microlithographic mirrors, are sold throughout the world in places like "Edmond Scientific".  The ability to economically figure and polish high-performance SiC substrates, would open up many new markets.

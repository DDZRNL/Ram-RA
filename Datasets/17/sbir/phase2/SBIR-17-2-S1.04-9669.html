		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>NASA and NASA funded missions/instruments such as Aura/MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder), SOFIA/GREAT and STO/STO-2 have demonstrated the need for local oscillator (LO) sources between 30 and 300 um (1 and 10 THz). For observations &gt;2 THz, technologically mature microwave sources typically have microwatt power levels which are insufficient to act as LOs for a heterodyne receivers. LongWave Photonics is proposing to develop a high power, frequency tunable, phase/frequency-locked, single mode, External Cavity THz quantum cascade laser (ECT-QCL) system with &gt;2 mW average power output and a clear path to increase the power to &gt;10 mW. The system includes a THz QC gain chip based on SISP or metal-metal waveguide with an integrated horn or lens structure to reduce facet reflectivity. Frequency selective external feedback will be tunable over 100&#39;s of GHz, with center frequencies ranging from 2 to 5 THz. The gain chip will be packaged in a high-reliability Stirling cycle cooler with all external component integrated under the same enclosure.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications include the use of the QCL as an LO for >2 THz receivers for future missions. Here the narrow linewidth (<100 kHz) of the QCLs can be used to resolve Doppler-limited low-pressure gasses (~MHz linewidth). The external cavity QCL LO will be a frequency tunable, compact replacement for any gas-laser LO. The resulting source will be a compact, reliable, table-top sized THz high power with narrow linewidth . It will be an easy-to-use platform for NASA researchers to study the performance of other key components in the receiver such as Schottky or HEB mixers. THz QC gain chip can also be used as the power amplifier providing gain for solid-state frequency multiplier or as the low noise preamplifier in the heterodyne receiver to reduce overall noise temperature.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Initial applications for this technology are mainly research markets for low-pressure gas spectroscopy. The narrow line width and the ability to provide real-time frequency information and frequency tunability of THz radiation also has great appeal. Another potential application is to replace THz gas laser used for THz detector power calibration. Long-term applications include industrial uses for trace gas detection. For industrial applications, the use of high-reliability, compact Stirling cycle coolers would greatly increase the usability of these QCL devices, which have traditionally required liquid nitrogen cooling or larger cryocooling systems.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Integration of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) into the US National Airspace (NAS) is crucial for advancement of UAS applications in different fields like transport, surveillance, disaster management, and geospatial applications. Airworthiness certification by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is a critical step towards NAS integration. To match the expected FAA safety and reliability standards for UAS certification, novel technologies are needed. Conventional manned air vehicles meet FAA standards via hardware redundancy, an option unavailable for UAS due to size, weight, and power constraints. This challenge was addressed in Phase I via the so-called algorithmically redundant approach, where multiple fault detection and isolation algorithms work in parallel to detect faults more reliably. Using FAA-approved procedures like fault tree analysis or failure modes and effects analysis, reliability of algorithmically redundant systems is computed. This approach will be extended in Phase II to include flight control system hardware and control laws in the loop, and will involve validation via flight testing. A comprehensive methodology and accompanying software toolbox will result: STI Approach for Fault Estimation and Reliability for UAS (SAFER-UAS). SAFER-UAS is an overall reliability estimation approach based on theoretical analysis, simulation runs, and flight tests, serving as a vital step toward certification.</p>

		The proposed STI Approach for Fault Estimation and Reliability for UAS (SAFER-UAS) Toolbox directly addresses three strategic thrusts in the current NASA ARMD Strategic Implementation Plan. Thrust 1: "Safe, Efficient Growth in Global Operations" is addressed by a sustained focus on reducing UAS risks to maintain acceptable safety levels for all air traffic. Thrust 5: "Real-time, System-Wide Safety Assurance" is addressed by the developed analytic technique that mitigates UAS risks toward integrated, system-wide safety assurance. Thrust 6: "Assured Autonomy for Aviation Transformation" is addressed by the innovative FDI framework that will better enable safe integration of UAS into the NAS. Additionally, NASA is addressing air traffic management for low-altitude drones by developing a system to ensure safe UAS entry into this airspace. This rapidly growing industry includes emerging UAS applications such as package delivery, infrastructure inspection, and environmental monitoring. The SAFER-UAS toolbox will benefit this system by providing safety assurance.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The UAS industry is experiencing rapid growth the private sector. The low-altitude (200-500 ft.) drone industry is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years with the emergence of new autonomous UAS applications including package delivery, infrastructure inspection, and environmental and agricultural monitoring. It is well-known that Amazon is pursuing the use of UAS for package delivery and a successful demonstration of this was achieved in late 2016. At higher altitudes, emerging commercial UAS technologies include high-altitude communications relay systems for expanding internet access to remote areas. Both Google and Facebook are pursuing this technology and have purchased the companies of Titan Aerospace and Ascenta respectively. The proposed SAFER-UAS Toolbox will be beneficial for ensuring that new UAS in all of these applications will be safely integrated with less required hardware redundancy, reducing required size, weight, and power (SWaP), and increasing achievable performance bounds.

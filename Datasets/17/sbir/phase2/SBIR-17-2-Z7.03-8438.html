		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Deployable aerodynamic decelerators are an enabling technology for missions to planets and moons with atmospheres as well as for returning payloads to Earth.&nbsp; These decelerators require a gas source for inflation, and the objective is to provide an improvement over existing pressurized gas inflation systems.&nbsp;</p><p>A hydrogen gas generator suitable for the inflation of Hypersonic Aerodynamic Inflatable Decelerators (HIADs) was developed and tested.&nbsp; Key areas of Phase I work included the design of a heat generation and transfer system to function under zero-g conditions, component designs resistant to damage from the launch environment, design of an associated filtration and containment system, the fabrication and test of generators incorporating the foregoing designs, and the development of thermal models of the system.&nbsp; Live tests successfully proved the operation of all of the new design features developed in Phase I.&nbsp;</p><p>Phase II work will include: scaling up Phase I generator designs, building and testing larger generator examples with the largest being suited to 12-meter HIADs, environmental testing of the generators, nondestructive testing to assess the effects of environmental testing, a zero-g drop test, development of handling and lifecycle plans for the generators, and the deliverable of a fully functional generator to NASA.</p>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary NASA application will be Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerators (HIADs) as planned for use on missions to planets and moons with atmospheres as well as returning payloads to Earth.  An additional application could be the inflation of planetary balloons.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Low-cost access to space will be enabled by HIAD systems which apply this generator technology because HIADs offer a practical means of recovering launch vehicle components such as engines.  Commercial space ventures can also apply HIAD technology for the more efficient return of material to Earth.  <BR>	Separately, unattended inflation of balloons in difficult environments, such as airborne or at-sea applications, will be facilitated by this hydrogen generator.  The generator can also be used to supply hydrogen in logistics-constrained areas for balloon inflation and other purposes such as operating fuel cells.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Cornerstone Research Group, Inc. (CRG) proposes to develop a multifunctional reversible attachment method to facilitate modular in-space construction. CRG will demonstrate a mechanically robust, easily reversible, self-aligning fastener system with provisions for installation of electrical power connections. The proposed approach is highly versatile and can be extended to include other types of system support connections such as data transfer, fluid flow, or thermal load transfer. This state-of-the-art fastening system leverages CRG&rsquo;s space-qualifiable thermoset shape memory polymer (SMP) fasteners providing NASA with a scalable, modular joining capability that can be used with autonomous assembly systems. In Phase I representative SMP fastening devices successfully demonstrated &gt;50 simulated use cycles including: assembly, reaction of design loads, and disassembly. Leveraging CRG&rsquo;s prior development work on shape memory polymer fastener systems, the proposed R&amp;D herein will provide NASA with a multifunctional, reversible structural attachment system with technology readiness level (TRL) of 5 at the conclusion of the Phase II effort. In follow-on development CRG&rsquo;s joining technology will be integrated with automated assembly robotic systems in support of critical mission demonstrations.</p>

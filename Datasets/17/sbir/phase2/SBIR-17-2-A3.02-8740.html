		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Crown Consulting, Inc. (CCI) will investigate and demonstrate methods to enable rapid selection of days for scenario generation in the development and evaluation of Air Traffic Management (ATM) concepts and technologies (C&amp;T) in the NASA developed Shadow Mode Assessment using Realistic Technologies for the National Airspace System (SMART-NAS) Testbed (SNTB). The proposed capability will enable the rapid generation of highly operationally relevant scenarios for use in the development and evaluation of technology demonstrators such as the NASA Airspace Technology Demonstrator (ATD)-2 and ATD-3, as well as future ATM concepts such as Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM), and Air Traffic Management Exploration (ATM-X). The latter includes new mid-term operational concepts such as Integrated Demand Management (IDM), and far-term operational concepts such as Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Increasingly Diverse Operations (IDO), which considers the integration of supersonic aircraft, spacecraft and UAS into the National Airspace System (NAS)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The proposed innovation seeks to augment the scenario generation capability of NASA&rsquo;s SNTB with methods and tools for selecting traffic, winds and weather based on the needs of the experiment allowing for highly operationally relevant scenarios. These methods and tools would actively categorize incoming and historical data using advanced machine-learning algorithms, allowing fast access to NAS streaming and legacy data in a big-data warehouse such as the NASA&rsquo;s ATM-Data-Warehouse through queries generated via a simple user interface for specifying desired characteristics. In addition to historical data, processed data such as benefit metrics, generated by SNTB simulations implementing the concept and technology of interest, can also be categorized by machine-learning algorithms for selecting days to generate scenarios for HITL tests to verify conditions for most or least C&amp;T benefit.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed innovation seeks to overcome the current limitation of being able to select a few relevant scenario days by providing NASA with an automated way for identifying days of interest based on high-level characteristics specified by the user. This will directly lead to better scenario generation for development, integration, benefit assessment and operational feasibility evaluation via HITL simulations of near term ATM technology, such as the: <BR>*	Airspace Technology Demonstrators(ATDs): Integrated Arrival/Departure/Surface (IADS), Metroplex Traffic Management (ATD-2) and Applied Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) (ATD-3), <BR>*	Integrated Demand Management<BR>*	UTM, UAS in the NAS, Urban Air Mobility<BR><BR>This will allow Crown to easily provide advanced software components that will directly assist and enhance these ATM research projects. In addition, this software can be applied to other NASA Big Data systems for providing the same capabilities for space and autonomy research.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential customers for this innovation include:<BR>*	Government, industry, and academia researchers exploring new operational concepts for the NAS.<BR>*	FAA offices involved in development, verification, validation and approval of new concepts or procedures.<BR>*	Flight operators involved in the development, verification and validation, and implementation of Airline Operation Center (AOC) based tools to support new or existing operational concepts.<BR>*	Industry, including suppliers of decision support tools and software for the FAA and flight operators, involved in the development, verification and validation, and implementation of decision support tools and software to support new or existing operational concepts. <BR>*	Other government agencies and industries with the need to extract specific types of data from large, diverse datasets based on complex combinations of the raw data, but using well defined queries.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Legacy SDR (Software Defined Radio) has been somewhat hailed as the &ldquo;be all, end all&rdquo; solution to communications systems.&nbsp; Reality is that SDR platforms are challenged by the clock speed of the underlying processor, and the fact that waveform design is not a simple process.&nbsp; As missions keep pushing for higher throughput communications platforms, it is often the case that legacy SDR platforms cannot.&nbsp; It is also a common end result that the SDR power consumption is very high when compared to non SDR platforms.&nbsp; These factors pose quite a challenge for mobile platforms &ndash; spacecraft platforms in particular.</p><p>Innoflight is introducing advance Hybrid-SDR platforms together with Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) design flow.&nbsp; The combined technologies will provide a streamlined approach for the design of advanced multi-mode communications system that are applicable to NASA&rsquo;s NEN (Near Earth Network), SN (Space Network), and DSN (Deep Space Network) infrastructure and are ready to support next generation optical (i.e. laser) communications.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications include:<BR>1)	CubeSat missions.<BR>2)	Missions requiring advanced communications modes.<BR>3)	Lunar and deep space missions.<BR>4)	Optical communications systems.<BR>5)	Balloons and UAVs.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Unmanned platforms are being deployed in many applications in the DoD and commercial sectors.  Such platforms are used in terrestrial, aviation, and maritime applications.  Such systems rely on numerous advanced network communication systems.  Most of these applications are also sensitive to SWaP and will benefit from Hybrid-SDR performance.

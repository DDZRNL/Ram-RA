		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>C3 Propulsion&#39;s novel Hybrid Propulsion System (HPS) will be applied to a NASA-selected Robotic Science Mission. Phase I demonstrated the Proof-of-Principle and Phase II will design, fabricate, and demonstrate a flight-like propulsion system for that specific application. The HPS is non-toxic, stable, and has energy management (throttleable or pulse-width modulated) capabilities. In Phase I, C3 Propulsion demonstrated that its hybrid fuel formulations can withstand storage at -78&ordm;C, with minimal effect on its physical or ballistic properties, and is expected to be able to operate in the cold temperature of Mars and outer planet moons. Its simple design decreases risk, reduces size, reduces mass, and increases reliability. It has high volume and density specific impulses and is expected to increase performance and lower costs.</p><p>In Phase II, a specific robotic science mission will be identified to determine system issues, including thrust, total impulse, weight, and volume. The selected mission will affect the design and operation of the system and will lead to a notional HPS design.&nbsp; A mini-thruster, Hybrid Screening Engine (HSE), will be designed, based on the notional system, to complete the development of a baseline fuel formulation.&nbsp; This formulation will be thoroughly characterized for mechanical properties, including the thermal coefficient of expansion.&nbsp; A full-scale heavyweight thruster will be designed and tested at the test stand of the Propulsion Research Center (University of Alabama in Huntsville), which is being upgraded by MDA.&nbsp; A preliminary HPS will be designed to determine the volume, shape, and weight of the selected propulsion system for future programs.&nbsp; A DoT Hazard Classification for the baseline fuel will be obtained, which is expected to be no more hazardous than 1.4C.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		C3 Propulsion's Hybrid Propulsion Technology systems are applicable for any NASA propulsion needs other than space launch boosters. It is non-toxic, has the ability to pulse or throttle for complex maneuvering, perform ascent operations from planets, moons, and asteroids, perform ACS and station keeping operations, is applicable to both manned and robotic missions and can operate at cold temperatures. The thrust is scalable from a few to millions of Newtons. It has high density impulse like solid propulsion systems, has the versatility of liquid propulsion systems, and is safer and more environmentally friendly than either.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		C3 Propulsion's Hybrid Propulsion Technology can be used for any missile or satellite station keeping application when more than simple ballistic trajectories are desired. Such applications would be small tactical Army and Marine missiles such as TOW, Javelin, and Hellfire, Air Force and Navy air-to-air and air-to ground missiles such as AIM-9 Sidewinder and AGM-65 Maverick, and third stage booster ACS and Divert and Attitude Control Systems for MDA ballistic missile defense applications. Civilian missile manufacturers would be interested in the ACS for their boosters and even for the smaller boost applications. Satellite manufacturers would be interested in their position and station keeping abilities.

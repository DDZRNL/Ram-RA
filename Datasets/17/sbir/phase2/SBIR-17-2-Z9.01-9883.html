		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Due to the rapid maturity of small satellite technologies to meet near term commercial, science and military space applications there is a driving need for development of increased affordable space launch system capability. To address this need, Valley Tech Systems is proposing a SBIR Phase II development of a new solid propulsion Reaction Control System (RCS) that leverages over 12 years and $12M of parallel MDA and USAF controllable solid propulsion missile interceptor and strategic deterrent propulsion technology investments. This new technology will replace older, heavier and less preforming Cold Gas ACS products providing NASA and future launch system providers with increased capability with improved affordability. Our solid RCS is applicable to both a future commercial booster flyout Attitude Control System (ACS) applications and future Post Boost Propulsion System (PBPS) payload delta-v and ACS providing increased satellite orbital insertion accuracies. The Phase II program will mature the new solid RCS technology to a TRL-6 ready for insertion into follow-on commercial launch system integration and flight testing. The result is a new affordable solid RCS that fills an identified critical technical gap for future affordable access to space.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The new Small Satellite Launch Vehicle technology RCS has numerous direct applications including reaction control of launch booster and post boost payload control for small, medium and large satellite applications. In addition, the technology is indirectly applicable to future NASA applications such as: Mars lunar lander propulsion, Mars Ascent Vehicle Reaction Control System (MAV RCS), Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerators (HIAD) gas generation, and Towed Glider Air-Launch System (TGALS) applications. Additionally, controllable solid thruster technology is indirectly applicable to future controlled gas generation application for power generation, long duration highly accurate satellite pointing/station keeping and liquid tank pressurization.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The new Small Satellite Launch Vehicle technology is leveraging parallel DoD development efforts that is indirectly being applied to future MDA missile interceptor propulsion Divert and Attitude Control Systems (DACS) and booster ACS applications that yield ship board compatible capability with legacy liquid propulsion system like performance and impulse flexibility. In addition, the USAF is considering in-directly applying the technology to future Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) Post Boost Propulsion and booster Roll Control System applications, taking advantage of inherent solid propellant affordability, safety, storability and compatibility with parallel Navy nuclear deterrent applications.

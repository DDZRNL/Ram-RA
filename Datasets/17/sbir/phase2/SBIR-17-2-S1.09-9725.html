		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Many of NASA&rsquo;s future space science missions will utilize small spacecraft, and many of these missions will require cryocoolers for cooling detectors, sensors, shields, and telescopes.&nbsp; For Class C and D missions, the cryocooler technical requirements for performance, size, and mass, coupled with the programmatic requirements for minimal cost and development time, are extremely challenging.&nbsp; Flight&#8209;ready cryocoolers and associated control electronics developed for traditional satellites do not meet these technical, cost, or schedule requirements for future small space platforms.&nbsp; Creare proposes to develop a low cost cryocooler control electronics package that leverages technologies and capabilities previously demonstrated on prior programs.&nbsp; During Phase&nbsp;I, we developed a set of requirements, designed low cost electronics to meet these requirements, and verified production cost is low enough to compete with commercial off-the-shelf solutions.&nbsp; During Phase&nbsp;II, we will continue to work closely with our partners to fabricate and qualify protoflight electronics with representative cryocoolers.&nbsp; Successful completion of this program will enable advanced sensor systems for cost constrained space-borne science, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The successful completion of this program will provide mission planners with high performance and low cost cryocooler control electronics that are compatible with miniature cryocoolers suitable for a variety of small platform missions.  Primary emphasis will be on achieving low cost, small size, and high performance for cost constrained, small space platform missions.  The primary NASA application will be for cooling detectors, instruments and sensors for planetary and earth science missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed cryocooler control electronics are ideal for small, cost-constrained satellite missions.  Military space applications include space based surveillance for Operationally Responsive Space missions and unmanned aerial vehicles.

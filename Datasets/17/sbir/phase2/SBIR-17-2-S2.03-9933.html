		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Using technology spun out from Sandia National Laboratories, Goodman Technologies LLC with our Small Business and Minority Serving Institution partner&nbsp;(Team GT) has demonstrated the feasibility of 3D printed and additively manufactured SiC/SiC composite and Reaction Bonded SiC for low areal cost, ultra-lightweight mirrors and structures. Our technology development roadmap shows production of the first meter-class mirror segments in time for the 2020 Decadal Survey, <strong><em>and an excellent solution for multiple Priority 1, 2 and 3 Technology Gaps identified in the COR 2016 and 2017 PATRs</em></strong>. Our meter-class 3d/AM silicon carbide segments will meet or exceed all NASA requirements for the primary mirror of a FIR Surveyor such as the Origins Space Telescope (OST), and may also provide a solution for the LUVOIR Surveyor. During Phase II we achieved an areal density of 10 kg/square meter on our first attempt at a production rate of 1.44 square meter per day for a single small printer. A&nbsp;cost of $60K to 3D print/AM&nbsp; large segments looks readily achievable, as does an optical surface that has nanometer-scale tolerances. Our encapsulated lattice construction provides a uniform CTE throughout the part for dimensional stability, incredible specific stiffness, and the added benefit of cryo-damping. Our process will also allow for direct embedding of electronics for active structures and segments, and the potential for actively cooling with helium for unprecedented low emissivity and thermal control. Finally, the particulate paste extrusion process may be very suitable for printing mirrors in the zero gravity of space.&nbsp;<strong>During Phase II, we propose to optimize, mature and scale 3D printed silicon carbide mirrors and telescope structures traceable to OST and LUVOIR Surveyors through the demonstration of Pathfinder Surrogate components for a meter-class primary mirror for the NASA <em>Gondola for High Altitude Planetary Science (GHAPS) project</em>.</strong></p>

		The proposed Goodman Technologies solution is directly relevant to the NASA Technology Taxonomy and the S2.03 Advanced Optical Systems and Fabrication/Testing/Control Technologies for EUV/Optical and IR Telescope topic, and the Optical Components and Systems for potential Infrared/FAR-IR Missions subtopic, and the Large Aperture FAR-IR Surveyor Mission (e.g., Origins Space Telescope, OST, mission concept). The ultimate goal of the proposed Phase II SBIR project is to demonstrate affordable manufacturing processes for 3D printing and additively manufacturing low areal cost, ultra-lightweight mirrors and structures for future FIR (OST) and LUVOIR Surveyor missions, and then sell these products to the Government and Systems Integrators in Phase III.  We have already ascertained the interest of, and received a letters of support from 7 companies and a National Laboratory.  The NASA Astrophysics Division Roadmap Enduring Quests ? Daring Visions builds on the 2010 Decadal Survey and includes near-term, formative (10-20 years notional Surveyor missions) and visionary (20+ years notional Mapper missions). The Far-Infrared Surveyor (Origins Space Telescope), LUVOIR Surveyor, and HabEx, along with other smaller optical systems will require 1015 m2 of mirrors in the next 30 years. At the NASA target price of $100K/m2 this represents a marketplace totaling over $101M.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA applications of low cost, lightweight, dimensionally stable mirrors and telescopes for lasercom systems, complex telescopes for Astronomy, Imaging and Remote Sensing applications, including optical instruments/telescopes which enable imaging, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions for police and paramilitary units, fire fighters, power and pipeline monitoring, search and rescue, atmospheric and ocean monitoring, imagery and mapping for resource management, and disaster relief and communications. The dual-use nature of complex telescopes will bring affordability to NASA and national defense missions such as airborne, shipborne and land-based lasers as well.

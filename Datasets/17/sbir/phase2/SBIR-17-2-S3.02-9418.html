		<BR>
		<p>In response to NASA&rsquo;s need for 1,000m2-10,000m2 class solar sails for future exploration missions, Roccor is developing the composite Trussed TRAC (T-TRAC) Boom system.&nbsp;Like the original TRAC boom to be flight validated on the upcoming NEA (Near-Earth Asteroid) Scout mission (McNutt, et al [2014]), T-TRAC has a triangular cross-section that flattens and rolls around a spool for packaging.&nbsp; Unlike the original TRAC, T-TRAC is applicable to much larger scale sail systems.&nbsp; The proposed T-TRAC boom is advancing TRAC technology through: 1) scaling up the cross-section size and length of the boom, 2) light weighting the boom through material re-distribution and removal, and 3) cross-section geometric modification and closing. Preliminary analyses indicate these steps will achieve more than a 5X increase in TRAC Boom structural mass efficiency over recently developed high strain composite (HSC) TRAC Booms, while maintaining an extremely compact roll stowed configuration that leverages the solar sail mechanical design heritage established with the recent Nanosail D (Alhorn, et al [2011]) and upcoming NEA Scout TRAC-deployed sail systems.</p><p>The overarching Phase II objective is to further develop and mature the T-TRAC technology such that it can be considered for NASA&rsquo;s future mid-sized solar sail missions.&nbsp; Multi-scale micro-mechanics, laminate, cross-section, and full section analyses will be performed to optimize laminate architecture and TRAC geometry. &nbsp;The Phase II effort will culminate in the design, production and demonstration of a four-boom T-TRAC deployment system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Fibertek proposes to develop and demonstrate a spaceflight prototype of a wideband, high power 50W, 1.5-um fiber laser transmitter, supporting high data rate wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) operation for space optical communication links. The fiber laser transmitter will support up to 8x WDM channels with high power conversion efficiency. The proposed 10x scaling of the average and peak power performance for such a space-qualifiable WDM 1.5-um transmitter enables &gt;100x data-rate scaling of current space laser communication links. In Phase 1 of the program all proposed performance objectives were exceeded or achieved.&nbsp; The successful outcome of Phase II will be to develop a prototype, space-qualifiable, high-efficiency, high-power (50W), 1.5-um WDM space lasercom transmitter. This advances the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) from 3 to 5.</p>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		1) Supports NASA SCaN (Space Communications and Navigation Program) roadmap to enable large science data volume returns from deep space missions. NASA exploration mission to Mars, planets and asteroid belts will benefit from much higher data rates and longer ranges than the current state of the art. <BR>2) NASA SCaN office initiatives to support large 100G + core GEO networks.<BR>3) Space laser communication transmitter for ISS/LEO/GEO platforms, similar to NASA technology demonstrator missions<BR>4) High-data rate, multi-channel laser transmitters, as an adjunct high-volume data link for Earth Science missions, such as for hyper-spectral imaging, JPSS (Joint Polar Satellite System), Landsat, and radar/lidar missions where large data volumes are needed.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This effort supports the need for large data volume DoD and commercial GEO inter-satellite networks and high data volume downlink and LCRD (Lunar Communication Relay Demonstrator) style relay.

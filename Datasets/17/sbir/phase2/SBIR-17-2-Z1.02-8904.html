		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI) proposes to develop and advance a highly efficient regenerative solid oxide stack design. Novel structural elements allow reforming of regolith off-gases (e.g., methane and high hydrocarbons) within a solid oxide stack as well as efficient H2O/CO2 electrolysis, overcoming shortcomings of traditional approaches. The resulting design offers the potential for light-weight and simple design with high efficiency and durability. This effort would be valuable to NASA as it would significantly reduce the known spacecraft technical risks and increase mission capability/durability/efficiency while at the same time increasing the TRL of regenerative solid oxide systems for ISRU application. The technology concept of our highly-efficient regenerative Solid Oxide Stack was demonstrated in Phase I and will be advanced in Phase II.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary target application is for an advanced regenerative solid oxide fuel cell/electrolyzer that enables a balanced C-H-O cycle supporting multiple mission critical purposes within a sustainable Martian ISRU system.  The technology offers a step advance in oxygen generation and energy storage through CO2/water electrolysis as part of the air revitalization system, with added function for building up supplies of oxygen and fuel.  <BR><BR>Specific applications include Martian bases, rovers, and hydrogen docking stations. Synergies in our proposed system are expected to result in increased efficiencies, improved utilization, reduced thermal and other stresses and improved seals for improved reliability and life, and higher power densities supporting greater capability and/or reduced launch mass/cost while simultaneously reducing requirements for supplemental material re-supply. The regenerative stack can provide power for bases as well as the next generation of rover and hydrogen docking stations for missions which can provide a pathway for robotic vehicles to travel while operating on fuel cell power. This comprehensive approach is expected to benefit from multiple thermal and resource synergies resulting in potentially game-changing system applicability to multiple mission applications.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Targeted non-NASA applications include energy storage as a solution to the renewable energy intermittency problem and individual innovation spinoffs to specific SOFC and SOEC stack designs. This technology offers the potential for substantial improvement to stack efficiency, thermal stress and life.<BR><BR>Continued public focus on energy efficiency and air quality will lead to continued interest in new power generation solutions, hydrogen generation and energy storage.  Applications also include potential use in hydrogen generation electrolysis systems for vehicle refueling and power to gas applications. Vehicle refueling is a promising application as fuel cell material handling vehicles and fuel cell automobiles are entering initial markets. Power to gas is a new application for our technology in use with energy storage where this can be used to create synthetic natural gas. Other targeted non-NASA applications include military uses which will benefit from portable fuel & energy production within a single technology. We will also explore application for off-line systems for residential use for energy storage and power generation. The variable fuel capability of this system, including hydrogen, methane, and other hydrocarbons makes this technology commercially attractive to multiple domestic and international markets.

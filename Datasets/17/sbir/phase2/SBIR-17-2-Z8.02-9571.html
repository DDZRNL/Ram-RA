		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>For complex missions that are away from Earth&#39;s resources, there is an unmet need for more autonomous operations with minimal Earth contact. Additionally, secure proximity- and autonomous-communication among various types of space vehicles are needed to implement complex and time-varying networks of spacecraft and sensors, which are capable of sharing rich, near-real-time streams of information. Efficient, secure, mission-configurable, and dynamic key management and cipher suites supporting multiple QoS levels for the bundle protocol are required to augment current and future Delay and Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) solutions to satisfy these mission requirements. Antara&rsquo;s innovation will enhance the security of NASA&rsquo;s DTN implementations, specifically, the Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION), and deliver a standards driven adaptation of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) over the bundle protocol (CoAP-over-bp). Phase II activities include the development of <em>tara</em>CoAP Cyber-Physical Autonomous Asset Observation and Management module. Further R&amp;D will drive the Elliptical Curve Crypto Key Management and Distribution module, the interoperable AntaraTek Cipher Suite for BPSec, and the scalable <em>tara</em>CoAP&nbsp;to TRL-7. The AntaraTek software will also be tested with&nbsp;ISS DTN payload communications (e.g., TReK). Additionally, the software will &nbsp;be infused to rad-hard FPGAs and future compute platforms such as the&nbsp;High Performance Spaceflight Computing chiplet.&nbsp;Utilizing the ION framework will lower the cost and the time to develop a high TRL solution and reduce implementation risk. Antara&#39;s innovations will deliver higher security and performance relative to existing system technology, support complex and time-varying networks, scale to large networks, and enable secure communications for the Solar System Internet.&nbsp;Successful deployment of the innovation will address NASA technology gaps TA5.3.1 and TA5.3.3 and enhance the state-of-art for DTN implementations.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed efficient and secure low-power communications system, based on delay and disruption tolerant inter-networking, is a horizontal, fundamental enabling capability which will support multiple NASA applications and missions including the Solar System Internet. The proposed innovations will be applicable to planned and new missions by enabling the integration of standards-based, low-power, and secure key management and application communication components to the DTN network architecture/ION to provide scalable, flexible and secure bi-directional communications for swarms of spacecraft, satellite, and other applicable systems. Antara's innovations will directly support NASA use-cases such as ISS DTN communications and Autonomous Operations and Complex Network Topologies as described in TA5.3. The successful deployment of the innovations in space will help lower operational costs of systems by replacing manual scripting and commanding of individual spacecraft communications links. Additionally, the innovations will enable secure proximity communications and autonomous communication among various types of space vehicles to implement complex and time-varying networks of spacecraft and sensors that are capable of sharing rich, near-real-time streams of information.

		<BR>
		Public Service and Safety: The technology will provide interoperable communications and real-time information sharing among Department of Homeland Security/FEMA first responders during disasters to effectively mitigate against threats and hazards.<BR>Defense and Intelligence: The innovation will integrate with existing and future Software Defined Radio based communications devices and Situational Analysis/Battle Management apps to rapidly infuse emerging DTN based capabilities in order to enhance the resiliency of Mobile Ad-hoc Networks and securely extend the reach of forward deployed forces to increase tactical agility, facilitate collaboration, coordinated actions, and robust access to mission-critical data, information, and knowledge.<BR>Commercial/Internet of Things: The innovation will securely enhance IoT applications in stressed environments such as cargo and vehicle tracking, global asset tracking, smart-city Machine to Machine communications, and humanitarian relief monitoring.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>We propose a radical new approach for to the design and fabrication of an integrated Waveguide Optical Gyroscope (iWOG) that enables the development of very small IMU with near tactical grade performance, higher reliability, high level of robustness and lower cost.&nbsp; Modeling demonstrate that the iWOG will have more than an order-of-magnitude improvement in bias stability over temperature (for the same volume) when compared to the highest performance commercially available MEMs gyroscope. &nbsp;The iWOG is also inherently radiation hardened and is the ideal technology for future CubeSat applications at NASA.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal will develop the key enabling component in a low cost, high precision inertial navigation system that would have 10 x better performance over MEMs navigation systems.  Low cost, higher precision and low weight/power (SWaP) inertial sensors are necessary components for future NASA applications that include SmallSat, CubeSat, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Sounding Rockets.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A commercial market exists today for a new gyroscope technology that has a 10x improvement in bias stability over temperature and vibration when compared to best available MEMs gyroscope.  The largest market is rotation sensors for Self-Driving Vehicles.  The proposed iWOG technology will result in the smallest volume optical gyroscope on the market today.  It will also enable new DoD applications including airborne PODs, Line of Sight stabilization, weapon designation, individual soldier navigation, turret stabilization, and UAVs navigation

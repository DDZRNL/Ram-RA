		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>ProtoInnovations, LLC is developing an inventive system for wheeled mobility that exploits the geometric and mechanical attributes of tensegrity to engage with the terrain in an effective and efficient manner. Dubbed the tensegrital wheel, this unique wheel design emulates the behavior of a variable pressure tire without the need for an inflation system. The construction of the tensegrital wheel is such that it absorbs and diffuses ground forces evenly. The stiffness of the tensegrital wheel can be tuned to match the demands of a given terrain that the wheel is to operate on or can be adjusted on-the-fly. These attributes allow for better adaptation to the terrain thus increasing the amount of thrust that can be generated at the wheel/ground interface, and improving a vehicle&rsquo;s dynamic response and obstacle negotiation. We assert that the tensegrital wheel can be designed to achieve an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and capacity for long-life specifically in the context of planetary exploration. In Phase I of this SBIR we proved the feasibility of the concept through analysis, testing, and demonstrations. In Phase II we will optimize various tensegrtial wheel designs and advanced the maturity and readiness of this system for filight worthiness.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The tensegrital wheel will benefit future NASA planetary exploration missions by enhancing the mobility and controllability of surface exploration rovers. Potential missions of interest include surface missions to Mars and the Moon. The ability of the tensegrital wheel to better conform to the terrain and its inherent capacity to evenly distribute reaction loads through its structure would result in measurable improvements in in-soil traversability, obstacle climbing, stability, and response to dynamic events. The tesnegrital wheel affords significant advantages over existing wheel systems for planetary rovers. While the structural design of existing wheel systems provides compliance approximating that of a pneumatic tire, such compliance is fixed by the design. Because if the high payload-supporting capacity, very low ground pressure, and scalability this wheel design opens up a number of possibilities in planetary vehicle design and mission capabilities.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Tensegrital wheels could be applied in a variety of vehicles and field machinery in mining, design, construction, farming, and utility industries. What makes the tensegrital wheel a promising option is its adjustable compliance, great payload ratio, low-ground pressure, and scalability. <BR>Many military vehicles currently use active control of tire air pressure to adjust compliance of the tires and deal with deflation due to punctures. As with planetary rover systems, using the tensegrity wheel for this application negates the need for pumps, pneumatic lines and pneumatic rotary joints. No pneumatic tire means no risk of puncture. In addition, the tensegrital wheel offers a lightweight alternative to unconventional wheel designs such as Michelin?s TWEEL?.<BR>Farm and industrial vehicles can find application for the tensegrital wheel as well. A tractor, for instance, might negotiate cross slopes more safely and effectively by selectively adjusting the compliance of the wheels so that the uphill wheels are more compliant than the downhill wheels providing a measure of center-of-gravity control. Likewise the pose of industrial vehicles such as manlifts can be provided with additional control through the use of the tensegrital wheel technology.

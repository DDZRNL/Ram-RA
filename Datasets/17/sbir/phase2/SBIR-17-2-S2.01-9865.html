		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Boston Micromachines Corporation proposes high-precision deformable mirror (DM) systems with one hundred actuators across the active aperture, corresponding to almost eight thousand actuators in the device&rsquo;s circular aperture, using an innovative new approach for packaging and integration. The proposed work focuses on a technology gap that NASA has identified as critical for space-based exoplanet imaging: production techniques for small-stroke, high-reliability, high-precision deformable mirror systems. The main objective in this Phase II project is to substantially increase the state-of-the-art for the number of actuators in a compact MEMS DM system using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) production processes and employing a multiple-layer approach to integrating routing line layers in the device. MEMS DMs will be bonded to custom manufactured printed circuit boards using conductive epoxy bonds and flip-chip alignment based on a&nbsp;new stencil printing process demonstrated in the Phase I project. The proposed work includes testing and evaluation of surface topography of DMs before and after bonding and assessment of actuator yield and reliability.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High-actuator-count deformable mirrors have a few astronomical NASA commercial applications. The following applications apply to all Boston Micromachines (BMC) mirrors that will benefit from new manufacturing processes developed for this program and from subsequent reduced cost.<BR>     Astronomy: Post applications in this category can be broken into two categories: space telescopes and ground-based telescopes. In the case of space telescopes, there are a number of missions/mission concepts that require the wavefront control provided by the proposed high actuator count deformable mirrors.  These include the Large UV/Optical/Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) and Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission (HabEx) telescopes. For ground-based telescopes, BMC has already had success developing arrays up to 4096 actuators for the Gemini Planet Imager and multiple smaller devices for high contrast imaging testbeds at Nanjing University, Space Telescope Science Institute, and University of Nice. BMC can achieve similar results for larger arrays for other new and existing installations such as the planned Extremely Large Telescopes (Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) and the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT)).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		High-actuator-count deformable mirrors have a few commercial applications. The following applications apply to products produced by Boston Micromachines (BMC) that will benefit from increased actuator count and reduced cost.<BR>   Space surveillance: BMC has success developing arrays up to 4096 elements for astronomy which can be used for space-based systems. These programs are funded by Department of Defense administrations with classified agendas.<BR>   Optical communication: Lasercomm systems would benefit from this new architecture for long-range, secure communication.  Also, fiber optic communications can take advantage of our devices in an optical switching capacity.<BR>   Microscopy: The capabilities of many non-adaptive optics-enabled microscopy modalities' devices have reached their limits. Increasing actuator count and reducing cost of fabrication will enable users to purchase higher-resolution equipment at a lower cost for use in detecting disease. Modalities affected include two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF), second- and/or third-harmonic generation (SHG/THG), and 4Pi microscopy, coherent anti-stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) and super-resolution localization microscopy techniques.<BR>   Pulse-Shaping: Laser science strives to create a better shaped pulse for applications such as laser marking and machining, and material ablation and characterization. The use of a higher-actuator count array for these purposes will enable new science and more refined techniques.

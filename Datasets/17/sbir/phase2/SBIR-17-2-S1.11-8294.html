		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>To advance the in-situ instrument technologies and components focused on the detection of evidence of life, Q-Peak proposes to develop a UV laser with very low Size-Weight-and-Power that can be used for laser-desorption-mass-spectroscopy (LDMS) to detect bio-signatures. A miniature LDMS, has been developed for the Mars-Organic-Molecule-Analyzer (MOMA) instrument at NASA-GSFC for the ExoMars mission, expected to launch in 2020. The MOMA instrument has a UV laser that is at least three times bigger in size compared to the Q-Peak laser. The MOMA instrument can be used in future missions to Titan and Europa to study the tholins and icy water. For mission like Europa-lander a radiation hardened instrument is needed and in this program Q-Peak will make the suitable laser. The laser will have a modular form factor to produce 1064-nm as the fundamental wavelength and then frequency-upconvert in two stages; second-harmonic-generation to produce 532 nm and fourth-harmonic-generation 266-nm using the appropriate nonlinear crystals.&nbsp; When the laser is set to produce 532-nm, it is suitable to perform Raman-spectroscopy as a complementary analysis of organic molecules. When set to produce 1064-nm, it is suitable for laser-induced-breakdown-spectroscopy which is another technique to perform compositional analysis of organic/inorganic samples.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications are in the search of life in the extra-terrestrial by detecting organic/inorganic molecules by means of LDMS, LIBS, LIF, Raman spectroscopy. With slight variation when operated at high PRF such as 10-30 kHz the laser can be used for lidar, terrain mapping and autonomous rendezvous of satellite. When integrated into a mico mass spectrometer the instrument can be used for air monitoring and breath analysis for future human habitation in space.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		An ultra-compact UV laser nominally operating at 262 nm can be used in advanced research and development and industrial manufacturing such as micro-material processing for the manufacturing of printed circuit boards and electronics. UV lasers are used in biotechnology and medical markets for sterilization and disinfection of devices. UV lasers are used in cosmetic dentistry mainly to facilitate chemical bonding and bleaching of organic enamels and other procedures. Atomic and molecular spectroscopy and chemical dynamics are additional experimental uses for UV lasers. With the removal of a nonlinear crystal, this laser can operate at a 532 nm which is suitable for treatment of glaucoma. Argon Laser Trabeculoplasty and Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty use green lasers for glaucoma treatment. They are used to open up the drainage angle of the eye, allowing easier flow of fluid and relieving pressure in the eye.

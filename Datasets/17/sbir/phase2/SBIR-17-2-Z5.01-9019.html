		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Energid Technologies will develop an articulated arm for modular attachment to the Astrobee platform. The arm design includes new actuators with wiring and structural support that will robustly operate with the Astrobee platform. Arms may be attached singly, in pairs, or in multiple pairs for bracing and manipulation. Grippers will use an innovative design that allows tool-free customization to new tasks. To control the arms, grippers, and base, Energid&#39;s Actin software toolkit will be extended and applied to control the arms in manipulation and acrobatic modes. Momentum management and conservation is integral to the control during acrobatic mode. Included will be dynamic simulation software that, by leveraging Energid&#39;s commercial Actin software, will be cross platform, fast, and feature rich. The simulation, modeling both the Astrobee and the arms, will support design validation efforts as well as mission planning and testing. It will seamlessly transition between simulating terrestrial test beds and the fielded Astrobee. The full system will be validated using a custom hardware testbed and granite table operation.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The arm Energid proposes will advance the application of Astrobee by allowing it to perform more tasks in new ways. The simulation software, which includes both arm and base dynamics and sensors will support NASA and other researchers in exploring algorithms and missions before fielding. The value provided through these applications will lead to additional work for Energid from NASA. Energid will provide support for the arms and simulation software's application on upcoming missions both as a prime contractor and as a supporting subcontractor to large NASA prime contractors.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Energid has sold approximately 400 of its own robots to customers in many fields and markets. This contract will enable Energid to extend these sales into new markets, particularly for use with terrestrial quadcopters. In addition, Energid will license the control and simulation software improvements made to its Actin software toolkit. Actin is delivered as libraries and header files that can be compiled into new software. It is used in ground, air, surface, and undersea environments.  This form of Energid's technology has found application in software for manufacturing, entertainment, agriculture, and oil exploration.  Energid will license the new software and provide services to support it.

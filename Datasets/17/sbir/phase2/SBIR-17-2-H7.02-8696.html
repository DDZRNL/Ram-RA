		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Building on previously funded work by NASA and DARPA, its internal research and development projects, and manufacturing activities occurring on the International Space Station (ISS), Made In Space, Inc. (MIS) is developing the VULCAN system to address NASA&rsquo;s requirement to produce high-strength, high-precision polymer and metallic components on-orbit with comparable quality to commercially-available, terrestrial machined and inspected parts. Such capability enables the in-situ manufacturing of critical parts for human and robotic spaceflight and without dependence on terrestrial resupply. MIS combines spaceflight-proven microgravity process controls and payload support systems, such as environmental and thermal controls, with a modular manufacturing and post processing system that generates a net shape final product.&nbsp;</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The VULCAN technology is primarily intended for sustaining human spaceflight operations, first on the ISS and, later, on long-duration missions to the Moon, Mars, or other destinations in the Solar System. MIS has built industry alliances with such companies as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation, and Bigelow Aerospace to evaluate the optimal concept of operations for in-space manufacturing as an enabling technology for the NextSTEP Cislunar Habitat. MIS is also working with UTC Aerospace Systems and Paragon to develop ECLSS design principles for repair and replenishment by in-space manufacturing. <BR>Robotic expeditionary missions can also employ the VULCAN technology for autonomous repairs while building the infrastructure preceding human habitation. Local robots may retrieve and install VULCAN-generated parts automatically or via teleoperation. Such capability may be necessary to ensure continuity of operations without direct human intervention and enable human crews to focus on mission objectives.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Department of Defense has a demonstrated need for advanced manufacturing capabilities in locations and on forward-deployed platforms without regular logistical support or available resources for traditional fabrication and finishing technologies. Perhaps the foremost example is the US Navy submarine fleet. While aircraft carriers are commonly referred to as ?cities at sea? because of their size and on-board industrial capacity, the nation?s attack and ballistic missile submarines deploy for months at a time and must function as entirely self-contained units with no physical connection to the outside world. Submarines on patrol duty may only surface during departure from base and upon return. <BR>When away from home port, there are only two submarine tenders in the entire US Navy, one each for the Atlantic and Pacific fleets, which limits underway replenishment opportunities. These 23,000-ton ships carry physical plants comparable to a small city and are often retasked for mobile fleet support activities, exacerbating the need for an in-situ solution. Much like spacecraft, submarines also have limited volume and environmental constraints on their operations. <BR>A tactical version of the VULCAN device gives the DoD a modular, common manufacturing system deployable on mobile platforms, such as submarines, destroyers, transport aircraft, and trucks, and in fixed locations with limited external support, such as Forward Operating Bases and advance airfields.

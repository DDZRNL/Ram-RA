		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>UTM is a key NASA initiative, and one of UTM&rsquo;s key thrusts is to ensure safe usage of UAS. Technologies which can be used for real-time risk assessment of UAS flights are being developed by UTM Safety researchers, but there is currently no user interface to connect these technologies with the UTM managers and/or UAS operators. We propose to develop a human autonomy teaming interface system (HATIS) composed of specialized tools, multimodal interfaces, and human autonomy teaming software, which will permit human operators and UTM/UAS automation to collaborate for real-time risk management and mitigation (RMM). In Phase I, we collaborated with NASA to identify hazard categories and UTM RMM roles and automation capabilities; developed high-level system requirements and a system architecture along with three test cases; demonstrated a proof-of-concept with interactive mockup interfaces; and validated HATIS potential as a product for key market segments, including NASA labs conducting research in human autonomy teaming (HAT), landfills conducting&nbsp; real-time environmental monitoring and reporting, and UAS manufacturers. In Phase II, we will spiral the development in HATIS in two builds: 1) HATIS1, which includes both building basic interfaces that allow the operator to visualize risks and collaborate with the automation to manage risks, and conducting the first integrated test and evaluation with usability and software; and 2) HATIS2 which includes extending HATIS to include level-of-automation management, play-based control, voice interaction, and conducting the second integrated test and evaluation with usability, software, and interoperability. We will implement a comprehensive risk mitigation plan that involves creating emulators of UTM RM algorithms and testing with these emulators if direct testing with RM algorithms is infeasible, and incorporating NASA input in preliminary and critical design reviews throughout each build.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA applications of HATIS span four NASA directorates.  In the ARMD, HATIS can provide programs such as UTM, UAS-in-the-NAS, and SMART-NAS with an interface system that allows the operator to team with the UTM automation to evaluate (via live virtual constructive distributed environments) and manage risks associated with flying UAS in terminal and congested airspace.  In the HEOMD, HATIS can be integrated into human-system interaction subsystems that enable crew and ground controllers to better supervise robots in space exploration mission.  Such integration would enhance the management of risks associated robots working remotely in space.  In the STMD, HATIS can be augmented with human-swarm interaction interfaces for controlling a multi-agent system as an ensemble.  Such augmentation would enable the operator to visualize the risks and work collaboratively with the swarm automation to manage the risks associated with the swarm operations. In the SMD, HATIS dynamic function allocation capability and play-based control can be a valuable asset for astronauts to use augmented reality systems to carry out procedures through various sensory modalities, reduce dependency for ground support, enhance situational awareness, and reduce cognitive overload while performing complex tasks.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		HATIS associated support services will fulfill needs of several organizations.  The first group will be landfills that could use a network of drones for real time environmental monitoring and reporting.   The second group will be companies that build UAS (e.g., Northrop Grumman, Aerovironment, General Atomics, Boeing) and manufacture UAS avionics systems (e.g., Honeywell, L3).  As these organizations develop new technologies and new concepts of operations, they will need software such as HATIS integrated into their ground control station in order to rapidly conduct risk-evaluations of their ConOps.  The third group is made up of DoD labs researching and developing human machine teaming applications (e.g., the Air Force's Autonomous Wingman, the Army's Air Mission Commander, and the Navy's Autonomous Swarmboats).  HATIS will facilitate research on important topics such as trust, transparency, and function allocation between human and automation. The fourth group are: a) companies that have developed UAS technologies or systems for package delivery or emergency response applications (Google, Amazon); and b) cargo companies that may use UAS to transport cargo (UPS, FedEx). These companies will need to conceive, design, build, and test specific UAS, GCSs and ConOps to expand their business operations and markets. As with small UAS manufacturers, these organizations will also provide a market for actual multi-UAS GCSs.  And again, HATS Inc. will be able to fill this need.

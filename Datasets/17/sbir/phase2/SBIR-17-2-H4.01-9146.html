		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Composites Automation (CA) proposes to collaborate with the University of Delaware Center for Composite Materials (UD-CCM) and our industry transition partner ILC Dover, to develop innovative material and structure concepts for next generation Space Suit hard composite components. The SBIR goals are develop material systems that survive an impact of 300 J at &lt;0.125&rdquo; thickness and &lt;1.7 g/cc density with no leaks. Phase I demonstrated a material solution that met these requirements and the ability to balance impact and structural performance with composite design. Phase II will study additional material choices, develop and optimize composite architectures, and demonstrate impact, structure and joint/interface performance. A complete material specification including material composition, process methods and properties will be developed for the optimized solution(s) for use in product design. Phase II will culminate in the design, analysis and manufacture of a full-scale Hatch, based on NASA requirements, with the optimized composite material solutions.&nbsp;</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Increasing damage tolerance of lightweight composite structures to impact loads while maintaining leak resistance under pressure is a key performance metric for space suit hard composite components. Aerospace and satellite structures are also driven by damage tolerant design criteria and proposed concepts may enable higher design allowables and lighter weight solutions. Proposed goals will improve performance 4X the current Z2 composite design and enable lighterweight and more robust and leak resistant composite component designs.<BR>NASA has recently developed the Z2 space suit but has interest in improving the robustness required for exploration of a planetary surface. The desired improvements will allow for reduced maintenance and provide simple and robust interfaces with the portable life support system. This can potentially also be used for the International Space Station Extravehicular Mobility Unit.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Damage tolerant composite structures are used in many applications, including aerospace, automotive and marine composites, and military platforms. Post-impact mechanical performance drives composite design in these applications, such as Compression after Impact or Open-hole Tension/Compression. Mechanical fastening and joining is also common in many of these applications and resistance to damage propagation at fastener holes promotes long-term durability. Concepts/strategies that increase durability, and post-impact performance while retaining lightweight characteristics are of wide-ranging interest in the composites industry. The proposed full-component Hatch demonstrator will address all these challenges and serve as an technology maturation example for all these markets.

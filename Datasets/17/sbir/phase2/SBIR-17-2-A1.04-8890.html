		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>In order to enable widespread application of Active Flow Control (AFC) technology on commercial aircraft, Actasys, Inc. (Actasys), in collaboration with The Center for Advanced of Multifunctional Material Systems at University of California, Los Angeles (CAMMS-UCLA) , The University of Michigan (UMich), and The Boeing Company (Boeing) intend to build upon the foundational work implemented in phase I to develop and prepare for flight tests a module containing an array of &nbsp;Synthetic Jet Actuators (SJA). Over a period of 18 months, the project will be divided into two parts. The first part will be dedicated primarily to improving actuator power output as well as preparing a module prototype.&nbsp; In order to achieve the required SJA performance levels, system properties, and functionality as determined by Boeing, the team shall use the computational approach developed in phase I coupled with investigations into new active materials. In the second part, Actasys and Boeing shall collaborate on testing the prototype in order to determine flight test readiness.&nbsp; Actasys&rsquo; post Phase II plans include testing SJA module performance on a Boeing 757 commercial aircraft to demonstrate targeted aerodynamic impact and fuel efficiency.&nbsp;</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Fuel efficiency improvement of commercial flying vehicles is only one of several potential applications of the developed system within the aerospace industry. Another application that would benefit NASA is the use of the developed technology to enhance the maneuverability of a wide set of applications, including rockets, missiles, UAVs and landing payloads. By integrating the developed system into such devices it will be possible to achieve a higher degree of maneuverability with very small amount of power. Furthermore, synthetic jet technology can in principle be used to enhance cooling of computer and power electronics, a critical aspect of several NASA missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The developed technology has the potential to be commercialized in a wide set of markets and for a wide set of purposes. By leveraging its ability to reduce the drag of vehicles, the developed system can be used to increase the fuel efficiency of a range of ground vehicles, including tractor-trailers, SUV, sports cars, trains, and buses. Furthermore, similarly to ground vehicles, the developed system can be used to reduce the aerodynamic drag of large marine vessels, increasing their fuel efficiency (both in commercial and military applications). By leveraging its ability to enhance maneuverability and stability, the new system can be applied to high-speed boats (both for military and commercial applications) and to sports cars. Furthermore, it can be integrated with wind turbine blades to enhance their energy output and reduce their mechanical vibrations, ultimately prolonging their life. Finally, the developed system can be utilized to enhance cooling and heating in a variety of applications, ranging from computer and power electronics to HVAC systems in buildings.

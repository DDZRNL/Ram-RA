		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>ROI with the support of a strategic partners from the decelerator vehicle business will complete the engineering development, produce, extensively laboratory test, environmentally qualify on a relevant parachute platform, and deliver to NASA a low power lightweight, small form factor, weaved DIFOS SHM system. At the end of the Phase II program, ROI will identify a relevant parachute platform an instrumented with a large array of POF sensors weaved within the textile fabrics of the parachute. The instrumented parachute demonstration platform will be laboratory and airborne tested under simulated load test conditions encountered by NASAs decelerator systems, and it will evaluate the time synchronize data collection and wireless data transferring fidelity and quality of the DIFOS SHM system. ROI will also develop am airworthiness qualification plan, including compliance with environmental, vibration, shock, pressure, and water immersion.&nbsp;</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		All of NASA's current and future space vehicle programs will benefit significantly from this project, wherein the key technological challenge is to develop methodologies for monitoring load, stress, strain, flaws, fatigue, and degradation in large complex structures. NASA's Robotic Exploration Program has a critical need for advanced sensor systems to enhance and expands NASA's current SHM. Specific NASA applications of the DIFOS SHM system include un-attended inspections on large and complex composite structures, i.e., decelerator systems parachutes and ballutes, honeycomb structures, multi-wall pressure vessels, thermal blankets, meteoroid shields, batteries, etc., commonly found in spacecraft, and habitats, and support infrastructures.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The DIFOS SHM system represents a new, innovative, and reliable solution for the in-flight time synchronized distributed monitoring of the passive and dynamic structural state (load/stress/strain) levels of trailing body deployable supersonic decelerator technologies. Its, lightweight, compact package, self-power efficient, wireless communication, distributed and embedded DIFOS SHM network system provide unique cost affordable solution for many SHM/NDE applications. In the parachute market, the major share is controlled by the military sector, which uses them extensively on its aircraft and for use by the paratroopers. Growing conflicts and wartime scenario across world is a major factor driving the employment of parachutes in military. Further, sales of unmanned aerial vehicles have been experiencing high growth around the world. This is one major booster for the global parachute market. The DIFOS technology addresses the global SHM/NDE aerospace and avionics market expected to grow to over 6.8-billion in 2020 and with the potential to instrument over 6000 space flight vehicles, military, and commercial airplanes, and peripheral structural monitoring system with additional markets in wind turbines, energy power plants, oil & gas, pipelines, petrochemical and geothermal exploration, civil infrastructures, health-care, and security.

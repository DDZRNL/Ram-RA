		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>The proposed effort will integrate identified performance optimization approaches to produce a tunable laser module exhibiting cost and performance characteristics appropriate for NASA&rsquo;s needs. The technology will considerably improve NASA&#39;s flight test measurement and in-situ monitoring capability over the current state of the art, opening up new distributed sensing possibilities for real-time, in-situ airframe / space frame measurements. In addition to supporting distributed static strain and temperature measurements, the technology helps enable distributed modal analysis, non-destructive evaluation, and identification / characterization of transient events. With an improved understanding of distributed airframe / space frame structural dynamics, the technology will lead to improved airframe and component designs. With improved, integrated real-time feedback control signal generation and structural health monitoring, future aircraft and space-flight vehicles will operate more safely, predictably, and efficiently.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology enables acquisition of real-time, in-flight strain and/or temperature data related to structural dynamics analysis and health monitoring of airframes and space frames. In addition, the technology enables feedback control signal generation, distributed NDE / modal analysis, and distributed thermal profiling. The technology can be applied to components, structures, aerodynamic surfaces, fixed and morphable flight control surfaces, and electrical propulsion system power sources. The proposed technology has particular applicability to laboratory and in-flight testing of airframes and space frames. Distributed strain measurements can be used to infer distributed loading throughout a structure, and can additionally be used to infer shape of a structure. Most notably, the technology opens up possibilities for distributed modal analysis, distributed resonance mapping, and other sensing modalities. The technology is particularly applicable to incredibly harsh shock/vibe environments such as the launch vehicle environment.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA commercial applications of the technology include renewable wind energy, commercial aerospace & aviation, oil & gas, automotive, nuclear energy, and perimeter security. In wind energy, the technology could inform real-time turbine control decisions for enhanced power generation efficiency. In addition, the subject technology could be used to measure deterioration of blades over their operational lifetime and detect adverse conditions or damage events, informing condition-based maintenance schedules. Commercial aerospace companies would find use for the proposed technology in applications similar to those of NASA. In particular, real-time distributed thermal monitoring of critical propulsion and fuel-storage system components appears to be an excellent application for the technology. The technology would benefit commercial aviation applications by informing condition-based maintenance schedules to reduce operational cost and improve passenger safety. In automotive applications, the proposed technology could be used for real-time structural monitoring during road testing and/or crash testing. It could also be applied to thermal monitoring of electric vehicle battery banks.

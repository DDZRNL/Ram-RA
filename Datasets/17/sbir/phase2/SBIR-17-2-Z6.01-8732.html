		The computing capabilities of onboard spacecraft are a major limiting factor for accomplishing many classes of future missions. Although technology development efforts are underway that will provide improvements to spacecraft CPUs, they do not address the limitations of current onboard memory systems. In addition to CPU upgrades, effective execution of data-intensive operations such as terrain relative navigation, hazard detection and avoidance, autonomous planning and scheduling, and onboard science data processing and analysis require high-bandwidth, high-capacity memory systems to maximize data storage and provide rapid access to observational data captured by high-data-rate instruments (e.g., Hyperspectral Infrared Imager, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar).Three-dimensional ICs, after a long wait, are now a reality.

		<BR>
		Optimization of the logic base of a memory cube has not been available for any application.  Development of the design tools to achieve better optimization of these logic bases will in turn lead to a broader application base which will benefit not only the users for space applications, but will benefit terrestrial users to help improve the efficiency of their electronics by addressing SWaP issues.

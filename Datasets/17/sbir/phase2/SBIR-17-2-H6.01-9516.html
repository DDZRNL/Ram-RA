		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>QSI proposes to field a &quot;Flexible&quot; ISHM Solution for Sustainable Habitats utilizing the TEAMS Toolset and concomitant model-based and data-driven diagnostic/prognostic reasoning technologies to enable the habitat crew and ground support personnel to obtain crucial alerts that affect the operation of critical habitat subsystems. Automated health assessment, crew alerts and future degradation estimates will be generated to facilitate corrective actions in the face of off-nominal and failure conditions. The ISHM solution would reduce the cognitive load on the crew given the abundance of information that has to be reasoned upon in a timely fashion. This will be critical for improving mission and system safety. The solution will utilize habitat&#39;s real-time system health assessment, anomaly and failure detection, machine learning and active learning techniques to provide clear and concise decision support to improve situational awareness and perform proactive corrective actions. The solution provides the ability to report and incorporate previously undiscovered anomalies through a visually intuitive active learning interface. QSI&#39;s Hybrid modeling concept leverages domain information from various knowledge sources such as SysML, VISIO, etc. to augment its data-driven models with system-level interdependencies, which provide critical insight into the system when new anomalies need to be identified by the human-in-the-loop. Additionally, the TEAMS framework will enable integration of third-party Machine Learning modules to leverage best-in-class anomaly detection techniques for an integrated solution. These technologies would reduce the cost and risk of habitat operations, across all its phases: development, flight unit production, launch, and operations.</p>

		The proposed ISHM solution, aimed at improving the reliability and performance of sustainable habitats through the use of diagnostic and prognostic failure and anomaly detection techniques, active learning and trending capabilities, will allow NASA to better plan and execute future Science Missions. The technology can be leveraged to facilitate endurance in complex systems, such as NASA's long-duration missions in space science and exploration. It is envisioned that the technology will also be ready to be operated as part of NASA's next generation Mission Control Technology allowing NASA to utilize the continuous health assessment and mission satisfiability information from the tool for improved mission execution while improving safety, mission success probability and the overall operational uptime of the habitat platform. This technology can also be applied to NASA's Earth based green initiatives such as the Sustainable Habitat. The Grey Water Recycling System (GWRS) at the Sustainability-Base at NASA, ARC could be an ideal insertion point for the ISHM solution. Various other systems, besides the GWRS, are also ideal candidates for the application of the ISHM technology, including the Hot Water Pump System; HVAC: Heating and cooling system; Air Life Support System; Photo-voltaic arrays; Facility Equipment and Environmental sensors: temperature sensors, humidity sensors, differential pressure sensors, airflow sensors, carbon dioxide monitors, oxygen monitors, etc.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The application of habitats in government, industrial, and commercial applications makes them an obvious commercialization target for this technology. We envisage the proposed technology to be of significant interest inside DoD's Forward Operating Bases (FOBs), FAA, US Air Force, US Navy, and commercial space vendors (e.g., Boeing, SpaceX). The development of the various interacting technology components for health-monitoring enabled anomaly/failure and degradation detection can be easily directed towards mission assurance and will be of direct interest to large-scale military systems (systems of systems) such as NORAD, Space Command ground segments, the Navy shipboard platforms and Submarine Commands. In addition, offshore platform industry, greenhouse industry, bio-domes, nuclear shelters, and extreme weather research stations are potential targets as well. Other examples of use of this technology include manufacturing, transportation (air transport, self-driving vehicles, and electric cars), energy (smart grids), space (on-orbit inspection and repair, mining), agriculture, healthcare (prosthetics, rehabilitation, surgery), marine environments, education (inspiring science, technology, engineering and mathematics education), public safety (emergency response, hazardous material handling, bomb disposal), and consumer products (household robots). This solution can also be marketed to commercial habitat operators and maintainers.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>In Phase I we demonstrated a methodology for processing large area diamond-hardfaced composites for tribological surfaces and bearings. Sliding experiments showed low friction and wear of the superhard-faced composites at both low and high temperatures. The measured wear against sand and dust was so low that it could not be detected. In contrast, all other tested materials experienced rapid abrasive wear. Most importantly, a <em>low-cost</em> method to produce <em>large area</em> fabric reinforced diamond composites for tribological applications has been developed. The primary trust of Phase II will be to optimize the processing technology for producing tribological surfaces and bearings, and to evaluate their performance in extreme environments, such as that encountered in high temperature exploration of Venus. We will continue to collaborate with NASA and industrial partners to optimize and scale the new processing technology, and to fabricate prototype bearings for performance testing at NASA&rsquo;s test facility. Hence NASA will acquire patented technology and qualified supplier of superhard-faced composite bearings to operate in extreme planetary environments.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to high performance bearings, potential applications include diamond substrates for radiation-resistant electronic equipment, silicon-based circuits and chips.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Since the superhard-faced composites that we are developing and optimizing experience low wear in hot corrosive environments, and are relatively inexpensive to produce, they can be used in reciprocating engines, rotary engines, rock drill bits, high-speed machining, and many other applications.

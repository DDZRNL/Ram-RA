		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Robust Analytics team will add real-time speech-to-text (STT) monitoring of controller-pilot radio communications to the risk state analytical framework previously demonstrated by Robust Analytics. The combination of our successful Phase I application of STT to ATC communications with the risk state analysis data fusion and analytical framework will provide a real-time risk and safety margin monitoring capability for the NAS.</p><p>Adding voice communications monitoring remains crucial for achieving NASA&rsquo;s system-wide safety monitoring goals. Voice is still the main source of ATC-pilot communications and a large body of airspace situational awareness and operationally-related information is contained therein that never makes it effectively back into broader National Airspace Systems (NAS) use. <strong><em>Our innovation provides access to that information, in real-time, and with the built-in analytics to use that information to identify anomalies and provide alerts.</em></strong> When combined with the other factors included in our risk state assessment framework, our innovation would have identified recent crashes such as Asiana 214 and UPS 1354 as high risk flights, before the events occurred.</p><p>Robust Analytics offers a vision for NAS-wide, real-time safety monitoring based on analyzing controller-pilot voice communications for anomalies and clearance deviations, and combining that insight with information from other data sources (flight plans, position reports, weather, infrastructure status, and traffic density) through advanced analytics with cloud computing for a scalable, reliable 24/7 solution.</p>

		<BR>
		Our ILSA innovation offers a direct contribution to meeting NASA's strategic objective for real-time safety assurance. We provide a robust, extensible approach to achieve the technical challenge for terminal area safety margin monitoring. With speech-to-text capability, we add another tool to identify operational anomalies in real-time, and a continuous monitoring system that generates a new source of data for NASA safety analyses. Our risk state analytical framework offers the SWS Project a platform for testing and deploying new anomaly detection algorithms that will be developed with the new voice transcription database we will generate.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In the near term, we envision our innovation used by FAA facility shift supervisors to provide insight into potential risks. After additional validation, our innovation can provide alerts to controllers for flights deviating from clearance instructions.<BR>Preliminary discussions with airline decision support tool providers suggest interest in a version of ILSA that would operate in the AOC to provide real-time and prognostic support to dispatchers. The concept is to provide dispatchers with current and predicted information on airspace and aircraft risk status. This information, combined with data on crew and aircraft assignments from AOC information systems, can alert the dispatcher that, for example, a crew operating at the end of a long flight may be entering a region of medium or high risk. The value of this combined information is indicated by the two most aircraft rashes that occurred when the crews were flying non-normal times (0600 hours or at the end of a long trans-Pacific flight) with the ILS out, and in the UPS case with degraded weather. <BR>Operators and controllers report on recurring congestion in subsectors that cause inefficient deviations from planned routes. These inefficiencies do not typically get reported to the ATSCC and thus do not get de-conflicted in the planning process. Both the FAA and airlines would benefit from our system.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>The nondestructive<br />characterization of advanced composites, such as<br />carbon-fiber reinforced polymers (cfrp), by electromagnetic means is<br />well established [6]-[24].&nbsp; What is<br />needed to advance the state of the art are sophisticated inversion<br />algorithms that allow layup and impact damage to be determined in<br />localized regions, which means that the more traditional methods of<br />model-based inverse methods must be replaced by voxel-based methods.<br />Thus, one will be able to better distinguish such things as<br />delaminations from fiber-breakage due to impact damage, or other<br />parameters that<br />characterize the mechanical state of the cfrp structure, such as<br />elastic modulus and Poisson&#39;s ratio on a<br />voxel-by-voxel basis. This information can then be input to damage<br />evolution models.&nbsp; We describe<br />two such methods, bilinear conjugate-gradients and set-theoretic<br />estimation.&nbsp; The challenge is to extend these methods to anisotropic<br />materials.&nbsp; We do that in this project, and will develop the<br />algorithms for inclusion<br />in our proprietary eddy-current code, \vic, during Phase II.<br />In addition, we continue our program of discovering and exploiting<br />parallelism in VIC-3D(R) to speed up the modeling and processing of<br />problems that involve massive data generation.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA LaRC already owns<BR>a copy of VIC-3D(R) which it uses for modeling forward and inverse<BR>problems in eddy-current NDE.  With the enhancements proposed in this<BR>project, NASA LaRC will be able to extend its modeling capability to<BR>more accurately characterize damage conditions in cfrps, as well as<BR>run large problems much more efficiently.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are<BR>35 commercial and university research institutions around the<BR>world that own copies of VIC-3D(R) which they use for the same purposes as<BR>NASA LaRC.  They will have the same advantages with the enhanced<BR>version of VIC-3D(R).  Furthermore, aerospace companies, such as Boeing,<BR>and SpaceX (Elon Musk),<BR>that are developing vehicles that use advanced composites, such as<BR>carbon-fiber reinforced polymers (cfrp) will be<BR>able to use the enhanced version of VIC-3D(R).  A more prosaic industry<BR>that is using cfrp advanced composites in their vehicles is auto<BR>racing, especially IndyCar. With a successful Phase II, we will be in<BR>a better position to approach them and offer our services through VIC-3D(R) for<BR>inspecting their cars.  Composites are also being used in the<BR>burgeoning wind-turbine industry, and, of course, in sporting<BR>equipment, such as golf clubs and tennis rackets.

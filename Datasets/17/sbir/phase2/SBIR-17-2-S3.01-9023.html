		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Deployable Space Systems, Inc. (DSS) in collaboration with Spectrolab, Inc. has developed a modular multi-junction photovoltaic flexible blanket technology that uses innovative Spectrolab flexsheet SPM&#39;s that enable/enhance the ability to provide ultra-low cost, low mass, modularity, and high voltage operability for high power arrays to support solar electric propulsion (SEP) Human Exploration and Space Science missions.&nbsp; The proposed multi-junction flexible blanket assembly with the innovative Spectrolab flexsheet SPM technology, when coupled to an optimized structural platform (such as DSS&#39;s ROSA / IMBA solar array, and/or other optimized flexible blanket solar array structures) will produce revolutionary array-system-level performance in terms of high specific power, lightweight, rapid assembly and re-configurability, compact stowage volume, reliability, unparalleled modularity, adaptability, affordability, reliable high voltage operability, adaptability to all flexible solar arrays, and rapid commercial infusion.&nbsp; The proposed flexible blanket technology accommodates all space photovoltaics (PV) including standard XTJ PV and emerging IMM PV technologies.&nbsp; Once successfully validated through the proposed Phase 2 program, the innovative lightweight and modular multi-junction flexible blanket technology will provide incredible performance improvements over current state-of-the-art, and will be mission-enabling for future NASA and non-NASA applications.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA space applications are comprised of practically all Exploration, Space Science, Earth Science, Planetary Surface, and other missions that require affordable high-efficiency photovoltaic power production through of an ultra-lightweight, ultra-compact stowage, and highly-modular solar array.  The technology is particularly suited for advanced spacecraft that require high power / high voltage solar array arrays that require game-changing ultra-affordability.  The technology is suitable for NASA LEO, MEO & GEO, and interplanetary missions.  The technology is also well suited for applications requiring scalability/modularity, operability within high radiation environments, high voltage operation, and operation in LILT and HIHT environments.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA space applications are comprised of practically all missions that require affordable high-efficiency photovoltaic power production through deployment of an ultra-lightweight, ultra-compact stowage, and highly-modular solar array.  Potential non-NASA commercial and DoD applications span a broad range of high voltage/power applications that demand ultra-affordability.  The technology is suitable for non-NASA LEO, MEO & GEO missions.  The technology is particularly suited for missions that require game-changing performance in terms of affordability, ultra-lightweight and compact stowage volume.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Modern water vapor differential absorption lidar (WV-DIAL) uses a single frequency distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser diode to seed a pulsed semiconductor amplifier. To meet the demand of these advanced instruments, the development of DBR lasers at multiple wavelengths in the 700-950nm region is required.&nbsp;</p><p>Current DIAL systems use free-space lasers that require bulk optics and are subject to misalignment and contamination. A compact integrated laser module is desirable for future cost-effective, rugged and fieldable systems.</p><p>Build on the design and prototype demonstration of Phase I, we propose to further the development of the compact integrated laser modules. Our approach, with the fabrication of high precision DBR laser of 935nm and 817nm wavelengths; and the package engineering of compact integration, will provide the narrow linewidth and high power laser modules for numerous Lidar applications with the advantages of reduced size, weight and power (SWaP).</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's primary application for the compact integration laser module is the differential absorption lidar (DIAL) instrument development for an autonomous field sensor network mapping atmospheric water vapor. This application is well aligned with the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) instrument development program through the implement of smaller and more affordable DIAL transmitters and is an important step towards water vapor DIAL deployment in air and in space.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The compact integrated laser modules are the turn-key solutions for single frequency laser source at 935nm and 817nm.  The narrow linewidth and high power laser modules find applications in spectroscopy, remote sensing and biometrics. Its spectral stability is desirable in resolving hyperfine structures and in providing long coherent length. Its compactness is suitable for handheld instruments.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) has been mandated by the FAA for all aircraft that fly in Class A airspace in year 2020 and beyond.&nbsp; ADS-B will be the foundation of surveillance, and in this SBIR effort, we exploit the fact thta ADS-B data can also provide evidence of aircraft flying through known sources of aviation turbulence. Phase I R&amp;D showed that moderate or greater levels of turbulence can be identified by analyzing in real-time certain key features observable from ADS-B data.&nbsp; Mountain wave turbulence, clear air turbulence, and convective induced turbulence events can all be identified from the data mining approach that we have developed.&nbsp; Analysis results can be performed in near real time and in an automated fashion, and can trigger safety alerts on AOC dispatcher displays or can be used to build better turbulence forecasts and nowcasts.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		For a decade, NASA has researched how to incorporate weather hazards into Air Traffic Management (ATM) Decision Support Tools (DSTs) and how to establish a shared situational awareness of such hazards with ATM, the Flight Deck (FD), and airline dispatchers.  This SBIR effort will have infusion in NASA ATM research, human in the loop experiments, FD displays, and tactical flight planning systems. With ADS-B as the foundation of surveillance for 2020 and beyond, this technology is a natural fit into the foundational research being performed in shared traffic and situational awareness.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		To complete the commercialization of this SBIR technology, The Innovation Laboratory, Inc and PASSUR Aerospace are partnering on the development and deployment of this SBIR technology into existing PASSUR product lines, including an existing network of ADS-B sensors as well as airline dispatcher workstation displays.

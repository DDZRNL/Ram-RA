		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>A Regenerable Carbon Filter (RCF) is proposed for the removal of carbonaceous particulate matter produced in Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) processes. Successful development of this technology will result in a device that effectively collects ultrafine carbon particles in a high density, high storage capacity volume which is subsequently regenerated in-situ using self-cleaning techniques. Various reactors considered for use in air revitalization in NASA&#39;s exploration life support closed habitat mission concepts result in the generation of solid carbon compounds as byproducts. These include the Carbon Formation Reactor (CFR) within a Bosch-type carbon dioxide reduction system and, what the proposed RCF technology specifically addresses, the methane Plasma Pyrolysis Assembly (PPA) within a Sabatier-type carbon dioxide reduction system. Capture and oxidation of this carbon material in a manner that eliminates crew handling while maximizing equipment operating capacity and lifetime is of paramount importance within manned space habitats that rely upon these processes.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA application will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future manned missions. Regenerable filtration of carbonaceous particulates from gas steams produced within closed habitation ECLS system hardware is needed to maximize equipment operating capacities and extend mission timelines. Ideally the fully developed technology will be acquired as Flight Hardware by NASA, resulting in enhanced capability during crewed deep space exploration.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Gas filtration is an important step in many industrial processes and as such the proposed RCF technology may find application in such instances where low residual carbon is produced as a problematic byproduct requiring removal. In addition, completely analogous to NASA's application, is the employment of an RCF aboard commercial crewed space platforms.

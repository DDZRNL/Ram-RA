		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		<p>The proposed program addresses the fundamental issues of lack of commonality across SmallSat platform power management.&nbsp; The DREPS aims to improve modularity, scalability, and efficiency of small spacecraft and CubeSat power systems (up to 100W) by implementing a novel reconfigurable architecture that integrates high reliability components and novel thermal management techniques to enable operation in extreme radiation and temperature environments.&nbsp; Integration of state-of-the-art technologies such as Gallium Nitride MOSFETs, micro-channel oscillating heat pipes, and digital control systems will enable an unparalleled level of system control while providing a solution focused on extreme environmental conditions required for long duration space missions. The DREPS includes digitally controlled power architecture providing 20+ configurable switched output services that can be commanded by any desired space communication protocol (I2C, SPI, CAN, SpaceWire).</p><p>Compatibility with new electric propulsion technologies can be obtained by the addition of QorTek&rsquo;s recent advances in high voltage piezoceramic-based power converter technology. Integration of cutting edge thermal management technology will enable adaptive retention or rejection of heat as a fully integral portion of the system&rsquo;s packaging through a partnership with ThermAvant Technologies.&nbsp; An array of configurable MPPT Battery Control Regulators will allow compatibility with industry standard solar and energy storage.&nbsp; The goal of Phase II is to achieve a modular SmallSat power system based on matrix interconnectivity of small power converters (cells) that is universally applicable to small satellite platforms and missions. The work plan will exit with fully tested &frac12;U solution that is immediately applicable to all three target markets of ruggedized COTS (LEO), Radiation Tolerant (MEO/GEO) and long duration High Reliability (High-Rel) as vendor projected product availabilities are realized.</p>

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This power system is applicable to a wide range of MicroSat/SmallSat LEO/GEO missions in support of Earth sciences, planetary sciences and Heliosphere studies. Science missions such as Astrobiology (e.g. microorganisms), radiometrics, environmental monitoring (e.g. weather), relay communications, Lunar resources, planetary magnetometry. are increasingly under consideration by NASA to be implemented by SmallSats. As technology advances, these smaller spacecraft will become ever more viable to undertake these, and a wide range of other NASA missions, along with technology qualification missions. The proposed technology offers to be transformative in enabling a low cost but completely custom tailorable EPS solution that both streamlines the development cycle that offers distinct SWaP advantages (in many cases very substantial) and exemplary performance.  NASA engineers will be able to rapidly select the necessary multi-phase converter DREPS modules (cells) corresponding to mission requirements.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Other organizations outside USA such as CSA and ESA are now pursuing many planned SmallSat missions and similarly looking to expand these mission capabilities to new areas science and space operation missions such as re-entry, debris removal, climate change monitoring and many more.  Such organizations are also ready customers for the proposed new DEPS EPS solution. As such, QorTek sees this commercial SmallSat or CubeSat market as the growth industry for its proposed DREPS products. The proposed CubeSat/SmallSat power architecture represents a transformative change in size/weight/applicability/functional capability.  At present, a 4U-6U mission satellite will have the EPS occupying as much as 2U-4U of available space ? leaving little for the science payloads.   This potentially will become the foundation for many non-government and commercial Small Satellite Systems where there can be abrupt changes in electrical power demands and/or must have power re-routing capability in the event of a partial failure.  This will include Multimission Payload Satellites; Communications Satellite Arrays; Ground & Observation & Tracking and more.

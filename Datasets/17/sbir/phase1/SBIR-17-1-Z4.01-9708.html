		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has identified the need for a joining technologies to support the ability to connect spacecraft components autonomously in-space. The joining technology should be modular, reversible, have an open-architecture, and allow "plug-and-play" functionality for maximum flexibility and utilize simple approaches amenable to robotic assembly and disassembly. TUI has been working on structural truss joining (Class 1 joints) and robotic connection approaches through separate efforts and has several ongoing and future efforts that will require in-space joining of modular systems (Class 2 joints).<BR>TUI proposes to develop and demonstrate an open-architecture Class 2 joining solution called the Automated X-Linked for Orbital Networking (AXON) connector. The AXON connector will be a reversible module-to-module connector that minimizes mass and complexity while maximizing assembled stiffness, strength, power transfer, and data communications. The development of the AXON connector will leverage TUI's existing programs and place emphasize automated robotic mating and de-mating.<BR>In the Phase I effort, we will identify a complete set of requirements, develop a concept design, fabricate the concept using TUI's 3D printing and rapid prototyping capabilities, and test the AXON connector using TUI's Baxter robot. In the Phase II effort, TUI will mature the Phase I design and perform reliability testing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The AXON connector will facilitate in-space assembly of satellites, exploration probes, and habitats for robotic and manned missions to the moon, Mars, and deep space destinations. Specific NASA Technology Roadmap topic areas that can benefit from the AXON connector include very large solar array structure (12.2.1.4), reusable modular components (12.2.5.4), deployables, docking, and interfaces (12.3.1), power management and distribution (3.3), structures and antennas for observatories (8.2.2), and systems engineering for robotic and autonomous systems (4.7).
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Beyond spacecraft applications, the advancements the AXON connector enables for in-space structural construction technologies will be directly applicable to constructing large structures in-space and enabling new missions in both the commercial space industry and the DoD. TUI is already developing complementary in-space manufacturing technologies with both the DoD and commercial partners.

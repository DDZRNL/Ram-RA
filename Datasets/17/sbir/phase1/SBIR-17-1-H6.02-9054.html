		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		With more ambitious space exploration programs, which aggressively push the envelope beyond lunar missions, it is therefore projected that a shift in mission planning and system design is necessary for addressing this new breed of resiliency-oriented challenges<BR><BR>An opportunity exists to support the NASA in the development of a framework for the assessment and life-cycle design of more resilient autonomous space habitats. Global Technology Connection, Inc. (GTC), in collaboration with the Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory (ASDL) at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), seeks to develop a state-of-the-art capability focused on providing an a resilience assessment framework, including a set of application-relevant metrics, analysis algorithms, as well as computational tools, which would demonstrate the modeling and simulation-based approach on design space exploration and optimization for a resilient SoS space habitat application. Overview of the analysis framework that will be leveraged and evolved to realize this opportunity has been discussed in detail in the proposal.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed effort has significant range of applications across various NASA multi-disciplinary engineering centers that are in charge of System Design where Resilience is an integral part of the System Design process. Quantifying SHM/FM in terms of standard and recognized metrics has been proven in practice in the Space Launch System (SLS), managed by Marshall Space Flight Center. Now it?s time to go futher and address the bigger picture which is Resilience embedded in the design.  Likewise, other immediate applications of this technology will be the operations and launch facilities at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Other strong users of   include Glenn Research Center, Ames Research Center, and Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The aviation programs at ARC and at Langley Research Center are also likely long-term beneficiaries of this project.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Among other agencies, DoD, US Air Force, US Navy, and commercial aviation (e.g., SpaceX, Bieglow Space) are the most likely potential customers for the resulting technologies. <BR><BR>In addition, smart home applications or intelligent hospital and patient-care systems can be of secondary application space. <BR> This technology would also be useful for disaster planning, e.g. Federal Emergency Management Agency, fire planning, and urban design. Applications such as Air traffic control, missile guidance system, space and range instrument radar systems, etc also will be pursed by GTC commercialization team

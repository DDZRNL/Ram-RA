		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Fibertek proposes to develop and demonstrate a spaceflight prototype of a wideband, high power (up to 50W), polarization maintaining (PM), 1.5-um fiber laser transmitter, supporting high data rate wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) operation for space optical communication links.<BR>The proposed 1.5-um fiber laser transmitter will support up to 8x WDM channels at 4W/channel, with 256-ary pulse-position-modulation (PPM) format, operating at ~10-kW peak power per channel, with >20-nm gain-flat bandwidth, and with 20% power conversion efficiency. The proposed 1.5-um fiber laser transmitter also supports 20x WDM channels at 2.5W/channel, operating at 10 GHz data rate (for 200GHz total) in burst-mode RZ-DPSK modulation. The proposed 10x scaling of the average and peak power performance for such a space-qualifiable WDM 1.5-um transmitter enables >100x data-rate scaling of current space laser communication links. <BR>The successful outcome of Phase I and II will be to develop a prototype, space-qualifiable, high-efficiency, high-power (50W), 1.5-um WDM space lasercom transmitter. This advances the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) from 3 to 5 and supports TRL-6 environmental testing in subsequent phases.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		- Space laser communication transmitter for ISS/LEO/GEO platforms, similar to NASA technology demonstrator missions, such as LLCD and the upcoming NASA ILLUMA and NASA LCRD mission. <BR>- High-data rate, multi-channel laser transmitters, as an adjunct high-volume data link for Earth Science missions, such as for hyper-spectral imaging.<BR>- Support NASA SCaN roadmap to enable large science data volume returns from deep space missions. <BR>- The fiber amplifier/laser design, packaging and technology maturation will support related laser transmitter developments for Earth Science missions, including NASA ASCENDS, CO2 lidar, CH4/H2O, and also for Wind Lidar.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		- High data-rate, low SWaP, laser transmitters for optical communication from LEO/GEO satellites<BR>- High data-rate real-time feed from multiple UAVs via LEO/GEO crosslinks

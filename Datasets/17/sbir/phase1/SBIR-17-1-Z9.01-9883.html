		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		During this Phase I SBIR program Valley Tech Systems, Inc. (VTS) will develop new long duration solid propellant thrust throttling technology for an affordable launch vehicle Reaction Control System (RCS) for small satellite orbital insertion applications. The new affordable RCS propulsion technology provides NASA with accurate launch vehicle upper stage booster Attitude Control, Post Boost satellite Delta-v and accurate orbital insertion thrust using non-toxic and storable solid propulsion. Additionally, the solid propulsion throttling technology features flexible impulse and accurate thrust throttling in a modular constructed architecture for ease of adapting to numerous future NASA launch vehicle applications. The Phase I program will conduct top level system trades, design concept layouts and critical technology testing to yield a smooth and clear transition from the Phase I to a Phase II prototype demonstration program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed affordable launch vehicle RCS propulsion system incorporates new controllable solid propulsion technologies that can benefit NASA objectives for reducing cost and complexity of advanced propulsion systems while maintaining the storability, robustness and performance flexibility of legacy liquid propulsion systems. NASA technology applications include an affordable small satellite missile launch boost and post boost deployment propulsion system where Life Cycle Cost and system affordability drives technology selection.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The long duration throttleable solid propulsion technology has been in continuous SBIR DoD (MDA, USAF) development over the past 10 years for advanced missile defense interceptor propulsion and strategic missile Post Booster Propulsion System (PBPS) product applications. DoD production application includes: Standard Missile 3 (SM3) Interceptor SDACS Propulsion, SM3 Third Stage Rocket Motor ACS propulsion, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (Minuteman) Post Boost Propulsion and future Navy Fleet Ballistic Missile (FMB) Post Boost Propulsion.

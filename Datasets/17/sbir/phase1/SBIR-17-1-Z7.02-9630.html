		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		T.E.A.M., Inc. proposes to develop and demonstrate a manufacturing method for a 3D woven deployable skirt structure with polar fiber orientation and integrally woven rib attachment features and trailing edge radii.  The novelty of our approach comes from the combination of several unique textile manufacturing technologies that to our knowledge have never been successfully combined into a single process.  This includes application of traditional "2D" polar weaving techniques to a variable thickness 3D weave architecture and conical geometry, respectively.  3D woven acreage material will leverage 3D-TPS weave architectures previously developed and arc-jet tested by T.E.A.M., Inc.  Likewise the single radial joint resulting from the polar woven approach will be reinforced using TEAM's previously arc jet tested 3D-TPS stitching technology.  Multiple iterations of the acreage 3D polar weave, radial joint configuration, trailing edge radii and seamless trailing edge close-outs will be demonstrated and quantitatively compared in both flat and formed states.  The developed process will be scalable to >3m base diameter on existing T.E.A.M., Inc. 3D weaving equipment.   The overall goal of the Phase I effort will be to optimize the manufacturing process parameters for scale-up to 1-3m scale in Phase 2.  Heat flux exposure and post heat flux mechanical testing of the developed solution are also planned in Phase 2.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology is directly relevant to NASA's ADEPT program, and partially relevant to NASA's HIAD and HEEET programs.  3D polar woven deployable skirts enabled by the proposed technology have near term potential (5-years) for retrieval of small satellites from around Earth orbit and delivery of small science payloads to Mars and Venus.  Longer term potential exists for larger payloads and human Mars missions.  TEAM would intend to pursue insertion of the developed technology into specific NASA missions by coordinating our efforts with the NASA technical and management personnel on the above referenced programs.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Outside of NASA applications, the technology is applicable to weaving of net-shape hypersonic aeroshell structures for defense applications, and for improvement of fiber orientation and mechanical homogeneity in current (non-polar) 3D woven composite mortar baseplates.  TEAM would intend to pursue insertion of the technology via our existing contacts in the DoD community (both government and prime contractors) with whom we have current working relationships and ongoing programs / contracts in 3D woven hypersonic material development.  The technology may also have application in commercial aerospace applications such as C-C disk brakes.

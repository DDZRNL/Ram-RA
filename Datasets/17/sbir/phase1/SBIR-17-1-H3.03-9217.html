		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Sustainable Innovations has developed a novel solid state technology for gas separation and will be applying it for the first time to meet a critical life support function: to develop an oxygen concentration module that minimize the hardware mass, volume, and power footprint while still performing at the required NASA capabilities. The Sustainable Innovations Oxygen Concentration Module is an extension of our proven H2 concentration, generation and compression technology that we are currently developing for NASA applications, including several configurations specifically designed for operation in Zero Gravity. This cell hardware has been demonstrated in mock zero and negative gravity on the bench-top and is currently being scaled for greater throughput applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Sustainable Innovations Solid State Oxygen Concentrator and Compressor will concentrate the oxygen within the cabin environment and provide the required concentration of oxygen to the crew members. Sustainable Innovations' electrochemical cell technology will separate pure oxygen from dilute, mixed gas streams. In addition, the Solid State Oxygen Concentrator and Compressor system has the potential to replenish the secondary oxygen pack (SOP) used by astronauts during extravehicular activity (EVAs) should the primary and backup systems fail. The SOP only contains 1.2 kilograms of oxygen, enough to sustain an astronaut for approximately thirty minutes. By replenishing the SOP with recycled oxygen, Sustainable Innovations'electrochemical cell design could give astronauts on EVAs additional time to reach the airlock of their orbiter.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Government- Other applications of oxygen capture and compression technology include military uses. The U.S. Department of Energy and Department of Defense may be interested in the development of this technology for military operations as an aircraft on board oxygen generation system, capable of providing breathing oxygen for the crew. <BR><BR>Commercial Aircraft- Sustainable Innovations' Solid State Oxygen Concentrator has the potential to become a cost efficient platform for the onboard generation of oxygen in commercial aircraft. The system will be capable of recycling breathing oxygen from the on board atmosphere and providing supplemental oxygen for passengers during emergency descent. <BR><BR>Medical Oxygen-Current medical oxygen markets are moving to become less reliant on bulky, stationary oxygen concentrator systems. Sustainable Innovations' Solid State Oxygen Concentrator will serve as a low cost, efficient, and portable oxygen generation system for use in medical practices and private homes.

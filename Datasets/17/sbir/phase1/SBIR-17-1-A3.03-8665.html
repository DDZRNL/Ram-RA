		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) is a key NASA initiative to integrate low altitude UAS into the national airspace system, and one of UTM key thrusts is to ensure safe usage of UAS.  Technologies which can be used for real-time risk assessment of UAS flights are being developed by UTM Safety researchers, but there is currently no user interface to connect these technologies with the UTM managers and/or UAS operators. We propose to develop a human autonomy teaming interface system (HATIS) composed of tools, multimodal interfaces, and human-autonomy teaming software, which will permit human operators and UTM/UAS automation to collaborate in real-time risk management and mitigation (RMM).  In Phase I, we will work collaboratively with UTM Safety researchers throughout the project to identify hazard categories; make assumptions about UTM RRM roles, responsibilities, and automation capabilities; develop representative use cases; formulate HATIS requirements for interface, software, and interoperability; design and document HATIS architecture; and demonstrate HATIS proof-of-concept through interactive wireframes of interfaces and presentation of software architecture.  In Phase II, we will implement HATIS interfaces and software components, work with UTM Safety researchers to transition HATIS to NASA, and identify technology transition partners and develop a commercialization plan.

		<BR>
		We envision that HATIS will be broadly used and play a key role in all future NASA R&D projects that involve UTM safety and UAS and human autonomy teaming.  HATIS will help provide NASA's UTM researchers, such as Dr. Belcastro's UTM Safety research, a human system interface to help visualize, test, and mature the technologies for the Real-time System-Wide Safety Assurance effort that develops risk assessment and mitigation methods for different levels of Autonomy and Authority, Hazard Sources and Risk/Safety Impact, and Application Domains (e.g., sUAS to mixed manned/unmanned operations) in a number of contexts, including UTM's Technology Capability Levels 3 and 4.  Other NASA programs that can leverage HATIS capabilities include UAS-in -the-NAS project, which has a component that establishes minimum operational performance standards for risk management, and NASA's ongoing Strategic Thrust 6 (Assured Autonomy for Aviation Transformation), which involves R&D with multi-vehicle collaboration.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We envision that HATIS will be a great asset for a number of organizations.  This first is companies that build UAS and avionics systems which will have a need for HATIS to do risk-evaluations and mitigation.  The second is those (e.g., FAA) that have similar research interests to NASA in investigating the regulatory, liability, and socio-policy-economic implications of operating a large number of UAS.  The third are companies that have developed UAS systems for package delivery or emergency response applications and UAS-based cargo companies.  These companies will have a need to operate their UAS safely within the NAS.  The fourth are military organizations that have made large investments in UAS technologies and deployed them in military missions. Their operational units and research labs are actively researching risks and autonomy issues, and will have need for a tool such as HATIS to conduct simulations for training or evaluations.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To extend the survivability of high temperature extreme environment missions, we propose to design, fabricate and test silicon carbide integrated circuits that are radiation tolerant and high temperature operation capable. Bulk silicon electronics mostly cease to operate properly at temperatures above the 150C to 200C range due to high off-state leakage. The Silicon-On-Insulator version pushes this limit further to 300C; however, the Venus surface exploration systems and gas giant probes require electronics that can operate above this temperature. A solution for high temperature electronics is the use of devices fabricated using wide bandgap semiconductors. Silicon carbide as being the most mature wide bandgap technology and shown to operate at temperature as high as 500-600C offers alternative device and circuit solutions for high temperature electronics. To this end, CoolCAD has the expertise to design, layout and fabricate silicon carbide integrated circuits to address this need, and extend the useful lifetime of vessels and probes in extreme environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Of particular importance is to meet the capability performance goals in the NASA technology roadmaps. The proposed technology helps with achieving these goals in radiation-rich as well as high temperature harsh conditions. Specifically, the proposed technology would help the development of technologies for the robotic exploration of high-temperature environments, such as the Venus surface, Mercury, or the deep atmosphere of Gas Giants. For example the planned Venus lander mission might greatly benefit from the proposed technology. The proposed silicon carbide integrated circuit technologies have the potential to significantly enhance, or reduce technical risk for in situ missions to high-temperature environments with temperatures approaching 500C or higher. In addition to helping missions to high temperature harsh environments, the proposed high temperature electronics would play a significant role in improving the state of intelligent propulsion systems as well as more electric and distributed aircraft and shuttle control electronics.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The benefits of the availability of high temperature silicon carbide electronics go beyond the use of these electronics in Venus, Mercury and Gas Giant probes and vessels.  Such a technology would enable new sensor and electronics systems in geothermal, drilling and gas exploration applications, resulting in higher efficiency and environment friendliness.   Also, this new technology would help enhance sensing and control applications in automobiles, airplanes and shuttles, by enabling use of circuits near engines and heat generating subsystems. Additionally, the high temperature electronics would prove to be useful in defense systems operating in extreme harsh environments either by enabling use of sensors in engines and rockets, or by relieving the cooling needs of electronics used for these sensors and electronics.

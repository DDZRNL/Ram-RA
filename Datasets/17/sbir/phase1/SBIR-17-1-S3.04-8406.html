		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The team of CU Aerospace and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign propose multifunctional solar arrays, which can be used for attitude control of a spacecraft. The solar arrays are actuated using PZT panels which produce strain. The proposed platform is called Strain Actuated Solar Array (SASA). SASA is intended to be a modular package that can be added to any satellite to provide sub-milli-arcsecond pointing and active jitter dampening. Due to the actuating mechanism and modular design, SASA will be able to scale to be used in a variety of satellite bus (regular satellites to smallsats).  This study aims to develop different control algorithms and a high fidelity hardware in the loop platform to test the control algorithms for a scaled SASA prototype. The study would conclude with testing and verifying the control response for the prototype, thereby increasing reliability of the SASA platform promoting it to TRL 4. Subsequent Phases of this project would test the SASA platform in vomit comets and culminate with a test flight on a CubeSat platform to prove flight worthiness (CAPSat).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The full segmented SASA platform will be ideal for several classes of satellites. A scalable and modular system would help in providing precise and accurate ACS for any sensitive platform. These include space astrometry, interferometry based applications. Due to the mechanical simplicity of SASA (fewer failure modes), low power budget and insensitivity to space environment, it can be a favorable solution for deep space satellite missions. Ranging from applications to new frontier missions to small satellites for deep space exploration.  In addition, SASA can enable cheaper precise and jitter free platforms to deploy passive/semi-active probes from mother-ships with a small enough deployment error ellipsoid for future missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The study of SASA platform can be used for the development of soft low power robotics, especially in areas where compliant structures are required (most Human Machine interaction robots). A reengineered concept could use a long SASA panel in the wind to generate electrical energy using wing flutter and other oscillatory forces (places where wind speed is not favorable for wind turbines).<BR>Other applications of SASA include usage of the actuation mechanism to produce fast reaction aerodynamic control surfaces (servo-aero-elasticity) for high speed aircrafts.

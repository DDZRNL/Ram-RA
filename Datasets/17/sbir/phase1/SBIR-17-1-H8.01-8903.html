		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Ultra-low capacitance quadrant InGaAs photoreceivers have been developed as part of the following successful NASA SBIR contracts by Discovery Semiconductors (DSC): (1) Phase I SBIR Contract # NNX09CD48P (01/22/09 to 07/21/09); and (2) Phase II SBIR Contract # NNX10CA59C (02/25/10 to 02/24/12).  The photoreceivers are based on low capacitance per unit area photodiodes, combined with a commercial operational amplifier, and have achieved low cross talk, low capacitance, and low noise.  With the successful completion of the design goals of the Quad Photoreceivers, the LISA community worldwide is eager to have these devices space-flight ready.  Thus, the Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) FF is a perfect vehicle to launch these quad receivers in space, and operate them for 12 to 18 months in harsh conditions.  This view is strongly supported by Dr. Jeff Livas, Chief, Gravitational Astrophysics Laboratory, at NASA GSFC.  <BR><BR>Based on our prior experience with launching LIDAR InGaAs Photoreceivers on a MISSE 7 Flight, it is unrealistic to expect a MISSE FF launch in the 6 months short duration of this Phase I SBIR.  Thus, our Phase I objective will be to perform the five key MIL-STD Tests, on the LISA Gravity Wave InGaAs Quad Photoreceivers.  These tests will serve as a foundation for a potential MISSE FF Space Flight in Phase II SBIR of this program.<BR><BR>MIL-STD reliability tests to be carried out in this Phase I SBIR are : (1) Mechanical Shock; (2) Vibration; (3) Thermal Shock; (4) Temperature Cycling; and (5) Damp Heat (humididty).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Space-based laser interferometry over very long baseline to detect gravity waves.  The noise performance of our quad photoreceiver has been designed for a baseline of up to 5 million kilometers and a Doppler shift of 20 MHz.  It is noteworthy that the capacitance of the 1 mm diameter quad photodiode (2.5 pF per quadrant) allows a 3 dB bandwidth of ~1 GHz.  Therefore, the TIA circuit of the quad photoreceiver can be potentially redesigned for ultra-low noise performance at a Doppler shift of several hundred megahertz.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Infrared sensing including biomedical imaging & spectroscopy. Quad photodiodes with high sensitivity and bandwidth are desirable for human tissue scanning.  The resulting technology will allow safer human tissue scanning.  Detection in this spectral band has specific utility in differentiating between cysts and tumors.  The resulting technology could allow easier scanning and early detection of life-threatening diseases.

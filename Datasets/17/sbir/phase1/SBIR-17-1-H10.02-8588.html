		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The objective of the proposed innovation is to research and study the feasibility of using pontoons (based on Off the Shelf (OTS) equipment) to make an inflatable raft that will support a water-landed space capsule. The advantages of this approach over traditional methods are: 1) Provides stable platform to open hatch for Flight Crew access/egress in less than 1 hour from the time the recovery vessel reaches the capsule, 2) Does not drive an increase in flight weight of capsule, 3) Protects the capsule during handling and loading operations, 4) Can be deployed from different types of vessels, 5) Allows for launch and recovery from support vessels with Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC) or Rigid-hull Inflatable Boat (RHIBs), 6) Minimizes operations in turbulent wake zone of ship, 7) Raft draws very little water, 8)Transports on standard commercial carriers in deflated and stowed condition, 9) Minimal pre-op set-up time on recovery vessel, 10) Based on existing technologies resulting in low technical and operational risks.

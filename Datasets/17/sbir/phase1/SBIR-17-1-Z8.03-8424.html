		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		No vendor has yet to provide a radiation tolerant, high efficiency, small Power Management and Distribution module for the SmallSat and CubeSat market yet. Let alone one with built in batteries. That is where ExoTerra's mission ready Universal Power Storage, Management, And Distribution comes in. Offering nine different voltage rails, each with multiple switched outputs, and an attached thermally moderated 40Whr Lithium Ion battery pack, all packaged in a CubeSat standard PC104 electronics form factor. Its highly modular nature and inherent radiation tolerance will allow it to be used in a multitude of missions right off of the shelf.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A low cost, radiation tolerant, high efficiency combined PMAD and battery module have several NASA applications. With these, NASA can perform low cost interplanetary exploration, coordinated observation, infrastructure, and shotgun exploration applications. NASA mission applications identified by ExoTerra include Interplanetary CubeSats "shotgun" exploration to candidate asteroids, or sending multiple, low cost, CubeSats to a celestial body simultaneously.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		CubeSat's are becoming a more dominant presence in space due to their high capability in relation to their much lower cost of entry to space. There is a growing demand for low cost, well designed, radiation tolerant CubeSat components, as is evidenced by ExoTerra's recent designing of a new 1kW PMAD for Pumpkin, Inc. ExoTerra fills this void with the highly functional UPSMAD.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) is the most CSWaP compatible safety solution for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and will be mandated for use by the FAA in the National Airspace System (NAS) by 2020. The ongoing miniaturization efforts will continue to enable a cooperative approach to the integration of UAS into NAS moving forward.  A critical limitation of ADS-B is the use of GPS-derived position vector in its broadcast, which can be easily spoofed or jammed, or confused by reflections in urban areas.  We present a low-CSWaP solution to secure and verify the GPS integrity using a novel antenna design so that ADS-B can be used as a trusted vehicle to vehicle communications and navigation link for UAS.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Techniques that increase the confidence of ADS-B afford opportunities to equip UAS and other aircraft in the NAS with a reliable tool for air traffic management in the near and mid-term timeframe.  Correcting limitations in ADS-B provides an overarching goal of NASA to safely integrate UAS into the NAS, while increasing automation, tracking and situational awareness for all participants. A low-CSWaP solution that removes false GPS sources (reflections, jamming, spoofing) expands the usefulness of ADS-B for UAS flying in urban areas.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Higher integrity GPS can positively affect a multitude of non-NASA applications.  For the FAA, ADS-B could be a more "trusted" resource, as one can verify the position of the broadcasted source. For users of GPS technologies in urban environments, this elegant solution to removal of reflections would enable a higher fidelity of GPS for use in navigation, cell phones, and future UAS operations.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A small launcher GNC system which maintains GPS fix while rotating, improves drift performance for COTS-based inertial sensors and provides efficient use of actuation system propellant. Provided in a package with components and systems already under development and proven in the space environment. Phase I will result in a flight test ready system
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has a growing interest and need for dedicated small launch vehicles for a variety of small satellite missions.  Kennedy Space Center is placing online a dedicated small launch vehicle pad, Pad 39C.  MAS as well as other users plan to use this for launching both suborbital and orbital small launch vehicles.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology developed under this project will assist these efforts to provide a flight ready small launcher GNC system. This can also provide applications for additional military related projects such as the recently completed MDA project described elsewhere in this document.

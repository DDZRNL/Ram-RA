		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Current designs for NASA fission power systems include relatively heavy shielding to protect the system components and payload from radiation emitted by the reactor.  This shielding typically comprises over 35% of the power system mass.  We propose to develop ultra-radiation-hardened power conversion technology to reduce shielding requirements for the converter and electronics so the large central shadow shield can be reduced or eliminated, in favor of smaller localized shields positioned to protect specific items that are sensitive.  This work has great potential to reduce overall system mass significantly for Kilopower, Nuclear Electric Power (NEP), and Surface Power missions being considered by NASA.  Consequently, these missions will become more practical and affordable to execute.  Although we plan to focus on Brayton converters and electronics, the results will also apply to Stirling converters and their electronics.  Creare is well-suited to succeed because we have a long history developing turbo-Brayton systems and radiation-hardened electronics for spaceflight applications.  During the Phase I project, we will develop converter and electronics designs with radiation-hardened features, we will specify conceptual mission details, and we will optimize shielding mass.  We will then fabricate and test prototype hardware during the Phase II project.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are many NASA uses for the proposed technology.  It can be applied to emerging Kilopower, Nuclear Electric Power, Surface Power, and Radioisotope Power missions.  Although we will focus on Brayton systems, our results will be broadly applicable to Stirling systems as well.  Additionally, there is an ever present need for radiation hardened electronics to support all space missions and payloads.  In particular, extreme radiation tolerance is important for environments with high background radiation, such as those found in the Jovian orbital system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Our radiation hardened technology is also ideal for many non NASA applications.  For example, military and commercial satellites for surveillance and communication all require radiation hardened electronics.  Power systems for nuclear submarines and surface vessels could also benefit from our work.  Creare would also like to strengthen its presence providing equipment for particle accelerators that support high energy physics experiments, which also require radiation hardened features.

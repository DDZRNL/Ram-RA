		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose a new approach for to the design and fabrication of miniaturized Interferometric Fiber Optical Gyroscope (FOG) that enables the production of smaller IRU and IMU with substantially reduced noise (ARW) and better bias performance. The gyro noise is reduced by a factor of at least 4 to 6 by utilizing an innovative approach for the light source noise reduction. In addition the sensor is using a new fiber combined with innovative coil design that results in lower bias drift and up to tenfold reduction of the bias temperature sensitivity compared to the existing FOG products as well as additional x 2 reduction of the ARW. The combination of these attributes supports a smaller, lower cost, high performance and robust IMUs that can serve future NASA mission needs; a 33 cube inch IMU (LN200 size) is expected to deliver Navigational grade performance, with ARW of 0.001 deg/rt-hr and bias residual over temperature of 0.02 deg/hr, while a larger FOG is expected to enable ARW of 0.0002 deg/rt/hr with 0.005 deg/hr bias and IMU volume < 70 cube inch. We also present innovative concept for a miniaturized tactical IMU based on the above technology (< 1 deg/hr bias over temperature and 0.02 deg/rt-hr ARW) with a volume as small as 5 cube inch.

		The proposal will develop the key enabling component of low cost, high precision inertial navigations systems. Low cost, higher precision and low weight/power (SWAP) inertial sensors are necessary components for future NASA applications. Such applications include scientific exploration of Earth, the planets, moons, comets, and asteroids of our solar system using smaller and lower cost spacecrafts to meet multiple mission requirements. Our suggested system offers significant performance improvements over the state of the art in the areas of spacecraft attitude determination and control, spacecraft absolute and relative orbit and attitude navigation and pointing control. Some specific examples include control capabilities for large space telescopes; autonomous onboard flight navigation sensors   and  high accuracy pointing applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Navigational and high-end tactical IMU market is an expanding market with a push for higher performance. This expansion will be driven by cost and size reduction. The technology enables the smallest volume IRU/IMU on the market today for such a performance level.  Our proposed system offers an alternative to existing products like the Northrop Grumman LN200, LN250 or Honeywell MIMU.  The suggested innovations create a disrupting technology advantage that enables a smaller IMU with improved performance and lower cost.  This approach results in a system that is able not only to replace the existing products in the current markets, but also create additional market segments due to the improved performance and cost/size ratio.  It will enable new commercial and DoD applications including airborne PODs, Line of Sight stabilization, weapon designation, Interceptor technology, individual soldier navigation, battlefield management, turret stabilization, missiles, UAV, AHARS and more.

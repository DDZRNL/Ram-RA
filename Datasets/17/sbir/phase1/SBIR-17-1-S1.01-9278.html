		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Lidar is a core technology in NASA's arsenal for science measurements from ground, air-borne and space based platforms. AdvR is proposing a beam steering mechanism for space-based Lidar based on AdvR's electro-optic deflector technology with no moving parts, making it favorable for space-based operation. The system operates on the principle of electro-optically controlled prisms engineered into a ferroelectric substrate, and is designed to have low loss, fast switching speed and settling time, good isolation and operation from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared.  AdvR has previously built and tested electro-optic switches and scanners and the demonstrated performance shows promising potential for use in discrete angle beam steering for Lidar.  This Phase I SBIR will investigate the use of the EO deflector technology for a fast beam steering mechanism to improve the sampling density, coverage and signal to noise ratio of NASA's Space-based Lidar systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A fast electro-optic beam steering mechanism can improve the sampling density and coverage in all four of NASA's primary Lidar instrument types: backscatter, ranging, Doppler and differential absorption. The electro-optic deflector technology is also used in building electro-optic switches and scanners that find applications in quantum information processing and long range optical communications pursued by NASA.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A compact, fast electro-optic beam steering mechanism for Lidar proposed in this Phase I can help advance the state-of-the-art in Lidar beam scanning across the civilian and defense industry. It has applications in self-driving car industry that relies mostly on scanning Lidar for navigation and guidance as well as in geophysical mapping for scientific research and commercial applications.

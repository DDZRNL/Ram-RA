		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In a prior program, Optical Engines was able to achieve 300 W average CW power in a Packaged Deep Space uplink transmitter delivered to JPL. In order to meet the stated JPL goal of 500W of average power with a 20% duty factor in a low data rate configuration, over 3kW of pump power will be required. In order to operate with the nested high data rate option, mj level pulse energies at high average powers will need to be achieved. These performance requirements call for novel and unique designs in order to navigate a potential system around fiber non linearities and thermal modal instabilities. Optical Engines proposes to develop a 1030nm counter pumped composite microstructured fiber based transmitter system. To accomplish this a counter pumped fiber combiner and a specific double mode adapter will be developed and demonstrated, with the 500W average power 2500 W peak power low data rate configuration being developed and demonstrated along with designs for the nested high data rate configuration being completed.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The transmitter envisioned in this proposal will be able to operate with a number of different seed input sources from ps to ns pulse durations. In addition to deep space communications, applications such as LADAR, LIDAR, and other remote sensing applications are accessible with this technology. This very high average power would extend the range and coverage of NASA's current remote sensing technology
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Lasers of this type have numerous applications in industrial markets from micro machining to enhanced material processing.

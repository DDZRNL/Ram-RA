		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		CMC proposes, along with our collaborator, Dr. Mica Endlsey of SA Technologies, to produce a framework from which an Adaptive User Interface (AUI) can be modeled and ultimately developed that utilizes Augmented Reality (AR) to improve Situational Awareness (SA) for spaceflight users in a high-workload scenario. This effort includes a thorough literature review related to the effects of modality and format on workload, as these are key factors informing our framework. Additionally, we will develop a display philosophy to guide how information is presented to the user. The effort includes a survey, assessment and technical summary of currently available and developing hardware and software technologies related to AR. Finally, we will develop a proof-of-concept prototype to demonstrate our AUI model framework and display philosophy targeted at a specifically defined task.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Spaceflight personnel are required to perform a broad range of tasks, interact with myriad situationally relevant information streams, operate under conditions of widely ranging cognitive workload, and potentially make essentially autonomous, yet highly consequential, decisions. The utilization of AR and AUIs in the technological tools available to assist and guide human operators will reduce their cognitive workload and improve their SA. By seeking out the latest technology and tools related to AR, NASA engineers and partnering entities have a unique opportunity to develop the associated user interfaces essentially from the ground up using best practices, as are currently known and being developed, in user-interface design and human-computer interaction. CMC is eager to combine its hardware and design experience with the human-computer interface and SA expertise of its collaborator, Dr. Mica Endlsey, to realize this goal.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Adaptive User Interface (AUI) principles, model and proof-of-concept prototype developed in Phase I of this proposal will have value for any technological application involving human-computer interaction, especially when Augmented Reality (AR) is incorporated, because the work builds upon best practices, as they are currently known and being developed, in user-interface design and human-computer interaction. AUIs enable an application to best meet a user's needs based on workload, mental state and experience; AR coupled with effective AUIs, as developed in the work of this proposal, will improve Situational Awareness (SA), while simultaneously reducing cognitive workload, thus improving user experience and effectiveness. Specific consumer applications include navigation, remote collaboration, training and entertainment.

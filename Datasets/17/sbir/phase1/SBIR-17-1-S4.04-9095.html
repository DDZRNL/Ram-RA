		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will design Silicon Carbide based integrated circuits that will be capable of surviving and functioning at harsh environments. There are numerous design and fabrication challenges that are required to be addressed for a successful Silicon Carbide integrated circuit development. Silicon Carbide devices have already been fabricated and tested. During the Phase I, essential integrated circuit for harsh environment applications will be designed, and the prototypes will be fabricated during the Phase II effort.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed integrated circuit products will provide the essential electronics components to NASA in order to build its instruments and systems for extreme (high temperature and high radiation) environments. Sensing systems, actuation systems, control systems, communication systems, and power electronics in those environments are among NASA's commercial applications.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A number of potential non-NASA applications would be down-holes in Oil/Gas/Geothermal, engines in Aerospace/Automotive, and various Power Electronics. These integrated circuits will enable reliable and long term sensing practical in down-hole applications improving the production efficiency. They will enable engines to run more efficiently saving on fuel and reducing carbon footprints. Power Electronics can become more intelligent with increased power density and efficiency along with reduction in its size and weight.

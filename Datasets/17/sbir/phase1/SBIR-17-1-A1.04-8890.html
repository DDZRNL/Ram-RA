		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In order to enable widespread application of Active Flow Control (AFC) technology on commercial transports, Actasys Inc, in collaboration with The Center for Advanced of Multifunctional Material Systems at University of California, Los Angeles (CAMMS-UCLA) and the Princeton University, intend to develop a model-based environment for the advancement of design and performance validation of AFC using Synthetic Jet actuators (AFCSJ). The core of this approach is establishing a feedback loop between new computational models, lab tests and field experiments in order to mature AFC actuation system design in a time-efficient and cost-effective and ready-implementable manner. This is a significant improvement on the current prevailing approach of iterative build-and-test for AFC development. Phase I will result in computational tools for modeling the performance of Synthetic Jet Actuators (SJA) resulting in optimized performance; Control loops which increase system energy efficiency; and a Data Management Platform (DMP) for test bed result analysis. Phase II will result in full- scale system validation in lab and field tests.  Field demonstration of the system capabilities will use phase I outputs and will be performed using a previously developed full-scale tractor-trailer test bed in order to reduce risk and cost compared to flight-testing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Fuel efficiency improvement of commercial flying vehicles is only one of several potential applications of the developed system within the aerospace industry. <BR><BR>Another application that would benefit NASA is the use of the developed technology to enhance the maneuverability of a wide set of applications, including rockets, missiles, UAVs and landing payloads. By integrating the developed system into such devices it will be possible to achieve a higher degree of maneuverability with very small amount of power. <BR><BR>Furthermore, synthetic jet technology can in principle be used to enhance cooling of computer and power electronics, a critical aspect of several NASA missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The developed technology has the potential to be commercialized in a wide set of markets and for a wide set of purposes.<BR><BR>By leveraging its ability to reduce the drag of vehicles, the developed system can be used to increase the fuel efficiency of a range of ground vehicles, including tractor-trailers, SUV, sports cars, trains, and buses. <BR><BR>Furthermore, similarly to ground vehicles, the developed system can be used to reduce the aerodynamic drag of large marine vessels, increasing their fuel efficiency (both in commercial and military applications). <BR><BR>By leveraging its ability to enhance maneuverability and stability, the new system can be applied to high-speed boats (both for military and commercial applications) and to sports cars. Furthermore, it can be integrated with wind turbine blades to enhance their energy output and reduce their mechanical vibrations, ultimately prolonging their life.<BR><BR>Finally, the developed system can be utilized to enhance cooling and heating in a variety of applications, ranging from computer and power electronics to HVAC systems in buildings.

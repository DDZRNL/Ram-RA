		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to demonstrate and build a 1.572 micron single frequency high pulse energy and high peak power fiber laser by using an innovative Er-doped gain fiber with large core diameter and high gain per unit length. 1.572 micron single frequency high energy and high peak power fiber laser is needed for accurately measuring column CO2 concentrations . In Phase I, we will design and fabricate the large core diameter fiber, demonstrate high gain per unit length at 1.572 micron, and demonstrate high pulse energy and high peak power fiber laser with a short piece of gain fiber. Successful demonstration of such a fiber laser will enable many new NASA and commercial applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA plans to launch ASCENDS in 2023 in according to the US National Research Council?s 2007 Decadal Survey recommendation to accurately measure column CO2 concentrations using the IPDA technique. For ASCENDS mission NASA would need a pulsed singe frequency polarization maintaining (PM) laser system with >3.2mJ pulse energy, 3.2 kW peak power, repetition rate of 7.5kHz, and beam quality (M2) of <1.5. This proposed laser can be used for ASCENDS.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This eye-safe high pulse energy and high peak power single frequency fiber lasers can be used to build commercial lidar for ranging and gas monitoring applications, for optical sensing, fast scanning biomedical imaging, and scientific research.

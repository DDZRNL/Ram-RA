		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		As the world community, has become aware that exoplanets exist in abundance, it has inspired new observatories in search of Earth-like worlds. Technology development studies have highlighted the need for structures with extraordinary dimensional stability.  Advanced materials such as silicon carbide and beryllium are costly and time consuming to manufacture.  Using methods pioneered in carbon fiber composites, sandwich panels from silicon carbide and beryllium are proposed for lightweight, stiff, ultra-stable optical benches for instruments on new observatories such as LUVOIR and WFIRST.  Assembled from flat stock and waterjet machined, the panels are extremely lightweight.  A prototype panel is shown whose stiffness is a close match to the FEA.  Fittings machined from Invar 39 for silicon carbide and AlBeMet for beryllium can be bonded to the panels to provide interfaces to optical mounts and optical components.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA applications include the use of this technology for lightweight and ultra-stable optical benches for spaceflight or balloon borne instruments include those for LUVOIR and WFIRST.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA applications include:<BR>?	Military systems with similar requirements.<BR>?	Commercial robotic systems that require high speed operation (e.g. gantry, assembly, pick-and-place, wafer handling).

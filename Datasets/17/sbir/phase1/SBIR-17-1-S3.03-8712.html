		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this SBIR Program, Structured Materials Industries, Inc. www.structuredmaterials.com (SMI), working with the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS) will develop graphene wire, as a lightweight higher conductivity superior electrical power transmission cable to present copper (or aluminum) wire. Replacing metal wiring with graphene wire will result in significant weight savings for space, military, and commercial craft; translating directly to reduced fuel consumption, extended operational parameters, and increased payload.  The technology developed in this SBIR will ultimately be extended to many other systems with electrical or electronic subcomponents.  In prior wire work, SMI demonstrated the concept of producing lightweight, highly conductive wire based on multiple layers of graphene. Calculations based on that work showed that a greater than 50% weight reduction is possible by replacing copper wires with graphene wires. The weight savings increased with higher amperage wires.  We will build upon the prior work and demonstrate technology for manufacturable  production of graphene wire to NASA performance specifications.  We will also produce and deliver samples of lightweight graphene wire for evaluation by our NASA sponsors.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Graphene wire technology has potential application on all NASA missions where power is transferred electrically, including satellite and space probe power distribution harnesses, manned space missions, aerospace transportation, service/scientific instruments, and instruments in general.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology can potentially be used on a number of power transmission applications. The light weight of the wires will offer advantages from all transportation power distribution harnesses, as well as industrial, consumer, and scientific instruments with power distribution harnesses. It will be particularly useful for aerospace transportation in reducing weight, leading to fuel savings and the reduction of pollution byproducts.

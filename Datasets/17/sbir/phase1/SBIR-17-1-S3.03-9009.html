		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This NASA Phase I SBIR proposal addresses the development of lightweight, high energy density DC-link capacitors that are a key component of inverters used power processing units (PPUs). DC-link capacitors used in IGBT and MOSFET switching circuits are one of the largest and least reliable components in DC-DC and DC-AC inverter circuits. Tantalum capacitors used currently by NASA in such circuits, have significant parametric limitations in the temperature range of -125oC to >200oC.   This development proposes the replacement of electrolytic capacitors with high temperature, solid state, Polymer Multilayer (PML) capacitors that have been recently developed for automotive inverter applications.  PML polymer dielectrics can be used to produce capacitors with voltages in the range of 25V to 1000V.  The high temperature PML polymers are amorphous with very high breakdown strength and can operate in a temperature range of -196oC to >200oC.  PML capacitors are smaller than tantalums, they have 10X lower weight, lower leakage current, lower dissipation factor, lower inductance and lower equivalent series resistance (ESR).  The Phase I development will focus in producing and evaluating PML capacitors designed for PPUs utilized in Hall thrusters and roll-out PV arrays for solar electric propulsion.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Radioisotope power systems (RPS), Advanced Modular Power Systems (AMPS) and Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) are programs that will directly benefit from this development.  <BR>Hall thruster PPUs voltage requirements include a 120V input for a 300V direct drive, a 300V input unit and a discharge module with a wide input voltage range of 300V-600V. Also, roll-out photovoltaic arrays are tailored to 120V and 300V for SEP applications. These are voltage ratings that are ideally suited to PML capacitors.   One PML capacitor can replace multiple tantalum capacitors that are often used in parallel-series configuration.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Capacitors are used in most all electrical and electronic systems ranging from consumer electronics, to industrial electronics, medical instrumentation, transportation, communications and defense.   DC-Link capacitors are needed to absorb ripple currents and transient voltage pulses created by switching devices such as IGBT, IGCT and MOSFETs used to convert lower DC voltage to higher DC and AC voltages.  The proposed PML DC-link capacitors, have applications in inverter circuits used in renewable energy power generation systems, including photovoltaics and wind power generation, hybrid and electric vehicles and modular energy storage systems tied to the smart grid. PML capacitors are smaller, they have lower cost and higher performance, which will improve life and reliability of power converters.  Hybrid and electric automotive drives will particularly benefit from the higher temperature and lower volume and weight of PML capacitors.

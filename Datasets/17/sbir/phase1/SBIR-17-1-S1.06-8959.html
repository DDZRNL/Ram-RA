		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Sensitive magnetometers play a key role in exploring the near-Earth environment, other planets and moons. Measurements using a constellation of spacecraft can provide a rich data set, but this approach requires magnetometers that have stable calibration as well as low size, weight and power. This proposal will develop an all-optical atomic magnetometer whose calibration can be traced to quantum properties of the atoms. It has already demonstrated high sensitivity in the laboratory. The Phase I work will show that it can be flown on a CubeSat by demonstrating that the form factor, weight, and electrical power can be made compatible with requirements for microsatellites. In Phase II we plan to build a version that could fly on balloons or aircraft.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Heliosphere Explorer missions and missions to other planets/moons will benefit from compact and stable magnetometers. Vector magnetometers are also used aboard high altitude balloons as a back-up to differential GPS for pointing telescopes and other scientific payloads. The small size and weight would be a good match for such platforms, and the absence of radio frequency emissions means the magnetometer will not interfere with the science package.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The instrument will be of use to the Navy for anti-submarine applications and the Army for detecting hidden tanks, reinforced bunkers, etc, as the large steel content of these targets generates a magnetic signature on top of the Earth?s field. The civilian market for magnetometers includes applications in oil and mineral exploration, mining, buried object detection, and the recovery of objects lost at sea.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Ultrasonic guided waves are being used as a NDE/SHM technique to detect flaws and damage in fracture critical structures such as aerospace structures. However, due to the complexity associated with the waveguide problem, direct interpretation of large amount of NDE/SHM data is difficult. A rapid and accurate simulation tool is needed to keep up with the demand automated and timely detection and assessment of damages in complex aerospace structures. We propose to develop a "virtual inspection" simulation toolbox (UGW-Sim) specifically for ultrasonic guided waves. This tool will be able to help analyze and interpret ultrasonic guided wave signals obtained from NDE/SHM measurements for damage detection and identification. It will include modeling of critical structural components such as stiffener and bonded joints and various types of damages that are commonly encountered. The tool will also help determine the optimal sensor placement and inspection parameters to maximize the detectability of various damages. Phase I will focus on the feasibility demonstration of the approach on metal structures and simple defects. Phase II will fully develop the software tool and extend to composite material with complex geometries and defect types.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Substantial budget expenditures and schedule delays are often required to develop and demonstrate effective NDE techniques for critical components not designed for inspection. As NASA moves forward in the Journey to Mars Program and Space Launch System to develop the Orion crew module and launch vehicles, it is essential to provide design tools that will enable rapid assessment of the feasibility of NDE methods as part of the design process for critical system components (thermal protection systems, pressure systems, composite structures, etc.) and computational NDE data analysis capabilities to help predict the response from a variety of NDE methods (ultrasonic, radiographic, thermographic, electromagnetic, optical, etc.) in complex aerospace structures.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NDE and structural health monitoring is also important for many military and commercial systems such as aircraft, automobiles,  nuclear reactors, bridge and pipelines etc. A computational NDE tool will help the maintenance staff and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for better design of the structures and inspection practices to ensure the structure integrity. The success of such software toolbox will greatly benefit the NDE community for enhancing the structural safety while reducing the maintenance costs.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Energid Technologies will develop actuator and gripper modules with control and simulation software for building mechanisms to attach to free-flying robots. The technology leverages Energid's existing hardware and software to reduce weight and improve performance. The approach enables novel modes of maneuvering, controlling, and sensing. The module infrastructure includes simulated sensors that enable precise control of mechanisms built with the modules to serve to support a variety of other applications. Multiple articulated mechanisms may be attached to one free-flying robot and cooperatively operated, for example. To control the arms and base, Energid's Actin software toolkit will be extended and applied to enable use of articulated mechanisms in perching and acrobatic modes, with one end-effector fixed in perching mode and momentum conservation integral to the control during acrobatic mode. Included will be powerful simulation software that, by leveraging Energid's commercial Actin software, will be cross platform, fast, and feature rich. The simulation, modeling many aspects of the free-flying robot, will support design validation efforts as well as mission planning and testing. It will seamlessly transition between simulating terrestrial test beds and fielded free-flying robots in a microgravity environment. The simulation will include articulated dynamics, contact dynamics, sensors, and the aerodynamics of any mechanism built with the modules.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Manipulators built using the modules Energid proposes will advance the application of free-flying robots by enabling them to both sense and manipulate the environment. The ability to perch will save power and extend life. The simulation software, which includes both vehicle dynamics and sensors will support NASA and other researchers in exploring algorithms and missions before fielding those plans. The value provided through these applications will lead to additional work for Energid from NASA. Energid will provide support for creating mechanisms from the modules and simulation software's application on upcoming missions both as a prime contractor and as a supporting subcontractor to large NASA prime contractors.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Energid, through its Robai subsidiary, manufactures and sells robots. These robots are bundled with the Actin software underpinning the control and simulation software used for this project. Energid has manufactured and sold many hundreds of robots to customers in many fields and markets. This contract will enable Energid to extend its robots into new markets, particularly for use with terrestrial quadcopters, where the lightweight low-power design will find wide application. In addition, Energid will license the control and simulation software improvements made to its Actin software toolkit. Actin is delivered as libraries and header files that can be compiled into new software.  This form of Energid's technology has found application in software for space, manufacturing, entertainment, agriculture, and oil exploration.  Energid will license the new software and provide services to support it.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Conventional lithium-ion batteries demonstrate great potential for energy storage applications but they face some major challenges such as low energy density and high cost. It is worthwhile to pursue alternative strategies to address the barriers of cost and energy density. In this project, we will develop advanced rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries that have much higher energy density and lower cost. Our Phase I project will use a superionic solid electrolyte and sulfur-immobilized carbon matrix to reduce sulfur loss to the electrolyte and to increase the sulfur utilization. The full lithium-sulfur button and pouch batteries based on these components will be constructed to evaluate their electrochemical performance. Based on our preliminary data, it is anticipated that a 400 Wh/kg energy density of Li-S pouch cells can be demonstrated for a minimum of hundreds of cycles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		If successful, the proposed lithium-sulfur battery can be used as energy storage solution for NASA's surface missions on the moon and Mars, with much higher energy density than conventional Li-ion batteries. More specifically, this battery storage technology can be used for landers, construction equipment, crew rovers, and science platforms and many other NASA applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed lithium-sulfur technology can also be used for electrical vehicles.  It may directly facilitate the commercialization of electrical vehicles as two major barriers of cost and energy density will be addressed. They may also be applicable in the consumer market to portable electronics and communication devices.

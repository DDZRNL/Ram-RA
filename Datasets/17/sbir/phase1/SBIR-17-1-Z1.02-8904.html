		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI) proposes to develop a highly efficient regenerative solid oxide stack design. Novel structural elements allow direct internal reforming of regolith off-gases (e.g., methane and high hydrocarbons) within a solid oxide stack as well as efficient H2O/CO2 electrolysis, overcoming shortcomings of traditional approaches. The resulting enhanced heat transfer design offers the potential for light-weight and simple design with high efficiency and durability. This effort would be valuable to NASA as it would significantly reduce the known spacecraft technical risks and increase mission capability/durability/efficiency while at the same time increasing the TRL of the solid oxide systems for ISRU application. Technology concept of highly-efficient regenerative Solid Oxide Stack will be demonstrated in Phase I with a clear path towards Phase II breadboard demonstration.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Targeted NASA applications include future ISRU concepts for Lunar and Martian bases, rovers, and hydrogen docking stations. With this reversible system NASA can implement H2O/CO2-fed O2 generation for Martian based operations as well as perform hydrogen energy storage & utilization processes. PCI's integrated reformer and reversible fuel cell system also has the benefit of reduced launch mass/cost while simultaneously reducing requirements for supplemental material re-supply.<BR><BR>Our designs make possible higher power densities which can enable larger, more powerful NASA technologies for NASA ISRU missions. This cross-platform tool can provide power for bases as well as the next generation of rover and hydrogen docking station's for missions which can provide a pathway for robotic vehicles to traverse several kilometers while operating on fuel cell power. This comprehensive approach is expected to benefit from multiple thermal synergies resulting in game-changing system applicability to multiple mission applications.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Targeted non-NASA applications include hydrogen energy storage as a solution to the renewable energy intermittency problem and power generation. Continued public focus on energy efficiency and air quality, including global warming concerns, will lead to continued interest in new power generation solutions. Applications also include potential use in hydrogen generation electrolysis systems for vehicle refueling and power to gas applications. Vehicle refueling is a promising application as fuel cell material handling vehicles and fuel cell automobiles are entering initial markets. Power to gas is a new application for our technology in use with energy storage where this can be used to create synthetic natural gas. <BR><BR>Other targeted non-NASA applications include military uses which will benefit from portable fuel & energy production within a single technology. We will also be investigating application of this technology for off-line systems for residential use for energy storage and power generation. For the non-NASA, non-aerospace application we will target SOEC and SOFC stack manufacturers to integrate the PCI stack technology, including through license to achieve faster and broader penetration. The variable fuel capability of this system, including hydrogen, methane, and other hydrocarbons makes this technology commercially attractive to multiple international regions.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Resiliency Evaluation, Assessment and Contingency Tools (REACT)<BR>Achieving resiliency in any system requires capabilities that are beyond the boundaries of currently available engineering tools and processes. Comprehensive analysis using Use Cases, Activity and Sequence diagrams provide significant benefits over text-based requirements and specifications. However, although these specifications include fault identification and recovery identified as part of the review process, they not consider potential systemic problems that may arise post-deployment in response to unforeseen external influences, unanticipated faults or as a result of cumulative operational anomalies. The REACT project proposed in this Phase I effort will develop a suite of software that will:<BR><BR>Integrate research in temporal and hypothetical reasoning with use case and scenario specification. <BR><BR>Perform extraction of scenarios described in SysML/UML Activity Diagrams into external tool.<BR><BR>Perform initial resiliency evaluation based on extracted scenarios.<BR><BR>Perform automated analysis of NASA operational scenarios identifying potential degraded performance or failures.<BR><BR>Automated identification of failure recovery options.<BR><BR>Generate scenarios leading to potential failures and recovery options for engineering review.<BR><BR>Analyze system engineering tool architecture and develop integration plan with COTS SysML/UML modeling tools.<BR><BR>Evaluate options for incorporating deep learning to evaluation and assessment phases.<BR><BR>Investigate adaptable hardware approaches supporting advanced resiliency through reconfiguration.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Autonomous Space Craft - The react toolset provides design analysis assistance to focus on the mission-critical aspects that may arise in different scenarios. Also, the REACT technology will provide an on-board agent improving identification, analysis and response to remedy or work around faults and external events.<BR>Intelligent Agent for Manned Space Flights - On-board monitoring, analysis and management of essential systems providing information to crew regarding possible degradation or failure scenarios based on observed data and projected events, identification of potential preemptive remedies.<BR>Landers and Surface Exploration Vehicles - Surface exploration vehicles will require more on-board health and status monitoring and recovery to achieve mission objectives. The REACT toolset will assist in the initial system design process and transition to on-board support for these vehicles.<BR>Telematics and Robotics - Applications for the monitoring and management of telematics and robotics in response to events or potential system failures that necessitate immediate action due to long delays in communications.<BR>Adaptive, self-configurable communications - Applications for the design and management of communications systems to adapt operational parameters based on environmental conditions, interference, equipment failures and mission objectives.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Internet of Things - The rapid growth of the IoT market has resulted in a myriad of devices, technologies, protocols and standards. Underlying this burgeoning market is the essential need for a more comprehensive model and analysis of the high-distributed and dynamically interconnected elements of the Internet of Things. The REACT toolset can provide valuable insight to the design and deployment of this dynamic area.<BR>Manufacturing and Assembly - Failures in a manufacturing process or assembly line can have catastrophic impacts to a business. REACT can provide more comprehensive monitoring and failure prediction in a manufacturing and assembly process and extended to include supply chain management as a cooperative, semi-independent system.<BR>Power Generation and Distribution - The design and management of large-scale power generation and distribution systems are comprised of a wide range of functional elements. REACT can be applied to model these systems as multiple independent systems with key intersection points where the systems interact to assess potential adverse impacts and recovery options.

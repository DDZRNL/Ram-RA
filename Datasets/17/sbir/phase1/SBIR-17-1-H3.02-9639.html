		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has identified silver ions as the best candidate biocide for use in the potable water system on next-generation spacecraft. Though significant work has been conducted to develop systems for controlled release silver ions in the water systems, there is no sensor for continuous in-line monitoring of the concentration of silver in the water used by the crew, nor a reliable device to analyze silver in space. Intelligent Optical Systems plans to develop a luminescent indicator-based optical sensor probe to monitor silver concentration directly in spacecraft water systems in real time. The proposed sensor will be based on a technology recently demonstrated by IOS for monitoring wastewater in space systems, in which a specific indicator dye is copolymerized with a stable polymer matrix, resulting in highly sensitive and stable sensor elements. The capability of indicator-doped polymer matrixes to detect silver in the ISS has been demonstrated by NASA and its partners, but further development is required to achieve in-line stand-alone monitoring. Our monitor will incorporate robust sensor elements, interrogated via a compact, low-power optoelectronic unit. The proposed sensor elements will be remotely connected to the electronic circuitry by an electromagnetic interference (EMI)-proof optical fiber cable, allowing flexibility in placing the sensor system, where space is highly valuable. In Phase I we will develop novel sensor elements for silver, and will demonstrate sensitivity, measurements range, and stability. In Phase II, in collaboration with UTC, we will produce prototypes for integration into the ISS Potable Water Systems, and conduct extensive testing under simulated environmental conditions, culminating in delivery to NASA of a monitoring system, bringing the monitor to TRL 7.

		Effective use of biocides to assure the quality of potable water is essential for the success and sustainability of manned space missions. The proposed sensor probe responds directly to a NASA need for in-line silver monitoring in spacecraft. Successful development of a compact, low power, fully automated multisensor probe for silver ions will give NASA a powerful tool to maintain water quality in the potable water systems. Real-time knowledge of silver concentration will lead to optimal water disinfection aboard the ISS, and on other manned space missions. Sensors capable of monitoring organic, inorganic, and trace contaminants in water under microgravity could make use of the same sensing technology and optoelectronic unit, expanding the capability of the monitor for silver, and monitoring water quality in all other water streams aboard the ISS.

		<BR>
		The antimicrobial coatings market is expected to grow to $4 billion by 2021, with silver being the leading antimicrobial agent. Key segments include the medical and healthcare industry and the indoor air/HVAC industry. The forecasted growth in the antimicrobial coatings industry will be accompanied by an increased demand for technologies to properly monitor and assess antimicrobials such as silver to ensure their efficacy. Silver-based antimicrobial materials for medical applications are gaining share in that market niche. Fiber optic sensors have significant advantages for biomedical monitoring, and IOS has already transitioned its sensor technology initially developed for space applications to blood and tissue chemical monitoring.

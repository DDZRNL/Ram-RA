		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In response to NASA's need for compact, low-cost deployable magnetometer booms for CubeSats, Roccor proposes to develop a Simple High-performance Roll-Out Composite (SHROC) Magnetometer Boom.  The boom is capable of motor-less self-deployment and lock-out through a unique combination of bi-stable composite laminate design and features that increase torsional rigidity and deployed precision at the end of deployment.  The boom can be built to diameters ranging between 1.6 cm (5/8 in) and 2.5 cm (1 in) and fully deployed lengths ranging from 0.5 m to 10 m while being packaged in less than 1/2-U volume (10 cm x 10 cm x 5 cm).  A launch-retention mechanism is provided to lock the tip-mounted instrument package for launch.  For deployment, this launch retention mechanism is released and the strain energy stored within the high-strain composite boom drives the deployment with predictable and nearly constant motive force.<BR>The overarching Phase I objective is to conduct a preliminary design-analysis-fabrication-test loop for a SHROC Magnetometer Boom capable of meeting requirements for a variety of future NASA Heliophysics science missions.  During Phase II Roccor will address the key engineering development risks, mature the system design to a CDR level of development, and validate performance objectives through a series of ground-based qualification tests on engineering development units.  Overall, the anticipated outcome of the combined Phase I/II program is development and proto-flight validation of a SHROC Boom system for a wide range of future Heliophysics missions.

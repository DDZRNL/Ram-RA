		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In Phase I, Redondo Optics Inc. proposes to develop, demonstrate, and deliver to NASA an innovative, fully integrated, miniature size, light weight, ultra-low power, and wireless communication weaved distributed plastic optical fiber sensor (DIFOS) SHM system suitable for the global monitoring of passive and dynamic - axial and bi-axial - stresses and shape history within the canopy broadcloth fabric of large and entire cross-sections of NASA's disk-gap-band (DGB) parachutes planned for the Mars 2020 mission landings. ROI's DIFOS structural health monitor (SHM) sensor system is based on the innovative integration of proven state-of-the-art technologies: 1) use of minimally invasive (50-&#956;m-fiber) plastic optical fiber (micro-bend, and/or FBGs) strain sensors cross-weaved within the parachute canopy broadcloth fabrics and strands of supersonic parachutes; 2) use of ROI's proprietary PIC microchip optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) for the high spatial resolution (cm's) distributed monitoring of the axial and bi-axial strain/stress state of the weaved optical fibers over the entire canopy broadcloth fabric of the parachute structure. In Phase II, the DIFOS SHM system will be integrated into an airborne ready decelerator system and tested under load environments representative of decelerator decent missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		All of NASA's current and future space vehicle programs will benefit significantly from this project, wherein the key technological challenge is to develop methodologies for high fidelity monitoring and characterization of load, stress, strain, flaws, fatigue, and degradation in complex built-up structures. NASA's Robotic Exploration Program has a critical need for advanced sensors, sensor systems, sensor techniques, and software that enhances and expands NASA's current SHM capabilities to mitigate the risk of catastrophic failure. Specific NASA applications of the propose DIFOS SHM system include un-attended inspections on large and complex composite structures, i.e., decelerator systems - parachutes and ballutes, honeycomb structures, multi-wall pressure vessels, thermal blankets, meteoroid shields, batteries, etc., commonly found in spacecraft, and habitats, and support infrastructures.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The non-destructive test, equipment, and services market generated revenues of $3.77 billion in 2013 with a projection to reach $6.88 billion by 2020, at a CAGR of 8.96% between 2014 and 2020. ROI and its strategic partners expect to capitalize within this market opportunity based on the expected successful development, demonstration, and commercialization of the DIFOS system and to aggressively capture over 5% of the distributed sensing monitoring market for aerospace and avionics applications within five years of operations after completion of the Phase II program. Major industries ROI will pursue include the aerospace and aviation industry, oil & gas and petrochemical industries, wind turbines, utilities, coal - gas - and nuclear power and water treatment plants, automotive, seaports, warehouses, military facilities, airports, civil engineering construction, and healthcare.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this NASA SBIR program, Fibertek, Inc., working with its team partner, proposes to design, develop and demonstrate a SmallSat/CubeSat form-factor, optical communication modem suited for space optical communication links from LEO/MEO orbits. The modem will be suitable for use in both space-to-ground and inter-satellite links. Unlike fiber-optic telecommunication modems, this modem is specifically adapted to the highly dynamic nature of space optical links. Moreover, a software-defined approach leads to an adaptive and cognitive optical modem, that optimizes link BER (bit-error-rate) performance, compared to a fixed-point design  of large-SWaP space optical modems used in recent and planned space optical communication demonstrator missions. Protocols originally developed for RF/wireless fading channels have been be optimized and extended to  terrestrial free-space-optical (FSO) modems, that have high scintillation and fading. The objective of this program is to further optimize and validate such algorithms and protocols for space optical links. Fibertek's focus will be on small-form-factor hardware implementation of such adaptive and cognitive FSO modem, compatible with a space-qualified roadmap, which can be integrated with ongoing CubeSat and SmallSat optical communication payload for demonstrator missions with Fibertek's end customers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA missions include the NASA ILLUMA program, NASA Earth-imaging Hyper-spectral missions needing high-data-rate download, NASA technology demonstrator programs for LEO constellations, and an independent optical data link for ISS.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Fibertek is currently engaged in building and delivering optical terminals for a commercial customer. Fibertek has also received inquiries from several other companies who are actively looking to add optical communications to their commercialization roadmaps. <BR>Our investigation into this market segment has indicated that approximately 75 communications nodes would be needed for a commercial space optical communications network. Several commercial companies are investigating a fully commercial network to increase data transfer speeds for data including satellite imagery, Internet data, and telecommunications data.  A space-based network operating on smallsats and cubesats will need a space-qualified, small form factor modem specifically designed for the space operational environment.

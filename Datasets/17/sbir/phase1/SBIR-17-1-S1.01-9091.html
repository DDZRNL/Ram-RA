		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Modern sensing systems often are required to pick out a very specific wavelength in a sea of other light (such as in daylight), making precise optical filtering a vital part of many sensing systems. Michigan Aerospace Corporation (MAC) plans to design, build and test an agile, frequency-tunable Fabry-Perot interferometer (etalon) for use as an optical filter of background light as part of a Differential Absorption LIDAR (DIAL) system. MAC's extensive history with designing and building rugged etalons for NASA and other customers will be key to this effort. Phase I will involve the design of this specific etalon and the testing of a faster method for precisely tuning it. Phase II will then involve the construction and test of the etalon.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This new, faster-tuning etalon technology will be appropriate not only for NASA DIAL and Integrated Path Differential Absorption (IPDA)-type LIDAR systems, but also for other NASA remote sensing tasks requiring rapidly-tunable wavelength discrimination. The ruggedness of the design will ensure the ability to use such etalons in airborne and space applications, as well as with ground systems.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications will be similar to NASA applications for precise, rapidly-tunable optical filters for sensing systems of all kinds, including those in rugged environments (airborne, shipborne, etc).

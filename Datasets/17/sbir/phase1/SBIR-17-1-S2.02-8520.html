		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed innovations are as follows:<BR>1)    A fully redundant electrical and mechanical motor/cable deployment assembly<BR><BR>2)    A redundant motor/cable deployment assembly that is integrated and deploys a perimeter truss for a starshade<BR><BR>The significance and relevance of the proposed innovations is to meet the technical challenges of deploying a large scale perimeter truss (10-30m diameter) for a starshade.<BR>The STDT's "Exo-S Final Report"  identified an open issue to "Mature perimeter truss technology readiness."  This is part of a defined starshade technology gap S-5 that is titled "Demonstrate inner disk deployment with optical shield."  In the NASA JPL starshade design the petals are placed into their precise position by the deploying truss.  The truss also deploys the spiral wrapped inner disk and at the end tensions the precision spokes.  If the truss was not able to fully deploy or meet the on-orbit load (deployment and deployed) and positioning requirements then the mission would fail.  Obviously the truss deployment mechanism needs to be a robust and reliable system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Technology developed during this SBIR program will be directly applied to any NASA telescope program involved with exoplanet discovery and characterization that needs an external occulter, or Starshade. NASA has identified a potential rendezvous mission with WFIRST/AFTA because it is a large astrophysics telescope capable of supporting direct imaging with a starshade.<BR>Beyond starshades, the technology developed through this SBIR would apply to any cable driven deployment that would benefit from the reliability of a fully redundant electrical and mechanical system.  Cable spoolers are used for deploying articulating booms, trusses, thermal blankets, solar arrays as well as deploying and controlling guys and stays.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Large scale deployable perimeter trusses could also be used for large solar arrays for SEP applications or planetary surface operations that would need a robust architecture that can withstand high accelerations.<BR>In addition, the technology developed through this SBIR would apply to any cable driven deployment that would benefit from the reliability of a fully redundant electrical and mechanical system.  Cable spoolers are used for deploying articulating booms, trusses, thermal blankets, solar arrays as well as deploying and controlling guys and stays.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		It is important to NASA engineers to be able to model radiation effects through very complex vehicle structures.  This requires (1) integration of modeling tools with Computer Aided Design (CAD); (2) easy and uniform setup of materials, particles sources and tallies; (3) ability to analyze and validate the results across multiple radiation codes.<BR><BR>Tech-X will deliver RSim, a across-platform standalone application for radiation modeling.  RSim will have a Graphical User Interface that will allow users to perform setup, run and do post-processing for several radiation modeling tools.  The setup will include Constructive Solid Geometry creation and CAD import, materials annotation, particles sources setup and choosing tallies.  RSim will be able to run several radiation codes to facilitate Validation and Verification. Post-processing in RSim will allow for 3D visualization, 2D plots and histograms.   Phase I will concentrate on CAD import and material annotation for MCNP6 and PHITS codes and develop RSim prototype.  In Phase II we will fully implement RSim and consider integrating with more codes, for example Geant4.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Future NASA missions will benefit from RSim, as it will allow NASA engineers to streamline the design of adequate shielding and ensure human safety and proper functioning of space instruments. An example is the upcoming Europa Mission.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications of RSim include satellite industry, global radiation detection,monitoring and safety industry, radiation-hardened electronics and radiation therapy.

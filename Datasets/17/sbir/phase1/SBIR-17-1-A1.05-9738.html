		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Various attempts to advance high-order mesh generation technology have been made in recent years, however an integrated solution capable of robustly creating optimal curved element meshes in 3D still does not exist. In this SBIR project, CFDRC will develop a software tool for the generation of meshes formed by high-order elements. Our approach consists of (a) linear mesh generation and import, (b) reconstruction of curved boundary using NURBS and B?zier surfaces and optimal high-order nodal distribution; (c) volumetric deformation using elasticity analogy with imposed boundary displacement on curved part of the boundary; and (d) export and display capability of final mesh. Phase I will develop an advanced NURBS fitting procedure and B?zier surface method for retaining boundary geometry and will demonstrate the solution of both linear and nonlinear elasticity analogy to accommodate curved elements and retain high quality for both orthogonal and stretched linear meshes. The resultant improved accuracy will be demonstrated using two high-order CFD codes, including FUN3D with high-order scheme implemented by CFDRC, and a high-order Discontinuous Galerkin code.  Phase II will fully develop the software and bridge the gap between linear mesh generation and high-order CFD predictions for complex configurations.  Parallel algorithms will be implemented to enable execution on NASA HPC  clusters.  Phase II will also increase the TRL by integrating with high-order CFD codes for demonstration on large scale applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The developed software will formalize and streamline the process of high-order curved volume mesh generation, and flow calculation within a single all-encompassing framework, removing the bottleneck between geometric definition and flow solution. The software will enable wide use of CFD solvers with high-order schemes. These schemes are especially efficient for the prediction of noise mechanisms and propagation for engine, fan, duct, propellers, and airframes, and for the analysis of wake/frame interaction induced noise and vibrations. The developed technology will fulfill several goals of NASA Technology Roadmap TA15 by a) enabling design of airframe configurations with high levels of aerodynamic performance and reduced noise, b) reduction of turbofan propulsion noise and emissions, and c) reduction of perceived noise and aircraft fuel burn through integrated airframe-engine concepts.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology provides a viable tool for several commercial applications such as wing-trailing vortex dynamics of large civil aircraft, analysis of noise generated by the landing gear of civil aircraft, and others. The enabling technology of high-order low-dissipation CFD solver is also applicable to a broad range of applications that involve embedded flow features requiring high resolution with limited grid size. Such applications include turbomachinery, cavitation, biomedical, electronic cooling, and many others.

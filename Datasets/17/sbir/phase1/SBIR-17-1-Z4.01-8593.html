		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We will develop a conveniently reconfigurable joining approach to connect highly scalable multifunctional architectures with fiber-reinforced polymer composite links. A reversible solid-state bonding mechanism is enabled intrinsically by novel high-performance polymer resin, for which only physical contact and application of heat is required. The attachment scheme is amenable to automated robotic assembly along with minimized mass usage and power consumption. The ITR bonding is a fully reversible and solid-state process, which eliminates approaches that rely on uncured polymer or a meltable interstitial phase. Also, the ITR ensures physical integrity of joint members of the structure and the reversible adhesive within the range of temperatures experienced during day/night cycles in space. The reversible ITR bonding scheme is the first viable composite welding scheme for fully cured thermoset composites. In Phase I, we will demonstrate technical feasibility of the reversible solid-state ITR bonding approach on fully dense neat ATSP resin parts, carbon fiber reinforced ATSP resin composites (ATSP/C), and ATSP coated aerospace grade metal substrates through a wide spectrum of applications. Also, we will develop thermal-electrical-mechanical finite element analysis models for optimized composite design with tailorable physical properties. Additionally, we will design an electromechanically controlled automated induction heater integrated bonding toolkit device through further automated robotic assembly.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The innovative reversible ITR bonding approach could potentially find an application space in spacecraft technologies of NASA missions. For example, regarding effective operation and maintenance of long-term on-mission space stations (e.g. ISS), damaged structural elements can be easily replaced through convenient bond/debond mechanism of the ITR bonding. Also, construction of on-site habitable architectures requirements of NASA's foreseen deep space missions beyond low-Earth orbit would be facilitated via orbital replacement units transporting ITR joinable high disassembled packing factor building blocks to make reconfigurable structures. Additionally, on-going Solar Electric Propulsion project requirements of readjustable (folding/rolling) solar arrays configurations would be enriched through various other arrangements enabled through ITR bonding and performed through automated robotic assembly.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The solid-state reversible ITR bonding scheme could have a broad impact on other U.S. agencies and particularly aerospace industry is to promote welding-like bonding scheme along with cost, labor and material savings for primary aerospace composite structures. Regarding DARPA/Lockheed Martin X-55 Advanced Composite Cargo Aircraft demonstration, utilizing bonded composite components and fuselage structure, substantial weight savings on an aircraft frame were enabled by simply eliminating rivet and fastener use (more than 85%) along with other improvements in fabrication and assembly stages. Similar improvements can be obtained in polymer composite or metal used structural elements through application of ITR bonding.

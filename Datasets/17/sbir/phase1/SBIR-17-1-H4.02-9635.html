		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Life support systems for future space suits will require advanced instrumentation to enable use of the suit for multiple missions.  We propose to develop an oxygen flow meter for the space suit ventilation loop that will provide highly accurate flow measurements while meeting challenging requirements for low pressure drop, compact size, and durability.  In Phase I, we will prove the feasibility of our approach through analyses and trade-off studies, proof-of-concept demonstrations, and prototype design.  In Phase II, we will design and assemble prototype flow meters and measure their performance under conditions that simulate operation in a portable life support system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The main NASA application will be to measure the flow rate of oxygen in the ventilation loop of future portable life support systems.  Scaled-up versions of the flow meter could be used to instrument spacecraft life support systems, where their compact size, high accuracy, and low pressure drop will benefit overall system performance.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Small pilot-scale and microreactor chemical plants need a high-accuracy flow meter that is simple to integrate with compact flow systems.  The proposed technology will be useful for these systems across a wide range of process applications, including oil and gas, polymers, biofuels, and pharmaceuticals.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		C3 Propulsion's Hybrid Propulsion Technology will be applied to a NASA selected Sample Return Mission. Phase I will demonstrate Proof-of-Principle and Phase II will design, fabricate, and demonstrate a flight-like propulsion system for that application. HPT is non-toxic, safe, and has energy management (throttleable or pulse width modulated) capabilities. It is expected to be able to operate in the cold temperature of Mars and outer planet moons. Its simple design decreases risk, reduces size, and mass, and increases reliability. It has high volume and density specific impulses and is expected to increase performance and lower costs. It has been developed under MDA SBIR programs and is currently at a TRL level of 3.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		C3 Propulsion's Hybrid Propulsion Technology systems are applicable for any NASA propulsion needs other than space launch boosters. It is non-toxic, has the ability to pulse or throttle for complex maneuvering, perform ascent operations from planets, moons, and asteroids, perform ACS and station keeping operations, is applicable to both manned and robotic missions and can operate at cold temperatures. The thrust is scalable from a few to millions of Newtons. It has high density impulse like solid propulsion systems, has the versatility of liquid propulsion systems, and is safer and more environmentally friendly than either.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		C3 Propulsion's Hybrid Propulsion Technology can be used for any missile or satellite station keeping application when more than simple ballistic trajectories are desired. Such applications would be small tactical Army and Marine missiles such as TOW, Javelin, and Hellfire, Air Force and Navy air-to-air and air-to ground missiles such as AIM-9 Sidewinder and AGM-65 Maverick, and third stage booster ACS and Divert and Attitude Control Systems for MDA ballistic missile defense applications. Civilian missile manufacturers would be interested in the ACS for their boosters and even for the smaller boost applications. Satellite manufacturers would be interested in their position and station keeping abilities.

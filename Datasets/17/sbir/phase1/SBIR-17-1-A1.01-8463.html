		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR Phase I program proposes to exploit the tremendous benefits that could be offered by the development of a microstructural refinement and control technology for titanium alloys. A severe plastic deformation (SPD) technology based on hot die isothermal forging technologies will be explored in this work. The goal is to demonstrate a practical, production level manufacturing approach to producing bulk-sized titanium alloy components with refined and controllable microstructure-properties. Higher performance titanium alloys would be particularly advantageous for next generation airframe and engine structures and components seeking improved structural efficiency. The effect of different thermomechanical conditions to achieve the requisite microstructure-properties also needs to be understood in order to identify the optimum process.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA applications are airframe, aircraft engine, and spaceframe structural components that require greater structural efficiency and/or higher performance.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA commercial applications are commercial and military airframe, aircraft engine, and spaceframe structural components that require greater structural efficiency and/or higher performance.  Other potential applications include higher performance industrial pump and valve components, biomedical implants, and sporting goods.

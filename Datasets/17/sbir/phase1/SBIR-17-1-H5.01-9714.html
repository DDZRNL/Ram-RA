		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Proposed is a lightweight PV array module architecture with up to or beyond 2500 m2 surface area autonomously and robustly deployable in a gravitational field from stowage that is eminently streamlined for integration with space transport and surface mission systems.  Supported via simple architectural features are highly prioritized Mars application objectives including modular or single large-unit use, self-cleaning and dust abutment, easy operation including tilt, transportability, robust tolerance for thermal and dimensional perturbations, and <BR>retractability.  <BR><BR>Integration with space transport systems is achieved via toroidal storage that can be designed to encircle any, large or small, core equipment such as a lander or habitat unit or a transportable power module, and seamlessly fits into launch vehicle payload envelopes.  Similar to the recently developed wrapped array concept, rolled in the belt package are support ribs with the surface sectors folded between them; the PV cells are mounted on the latter.  (The ribs concurrently emerge from the package straight and, diverging outward, unfold the sheet sectors.)  When deployed, the PV strips, with gentle cross-slopes, are suspended from the ribs with a sagging/slack cable system that renders the design environmentally robust and permits self-cleaning via the wind effects themselves.  Rib strength is boosted by cable support, analogous to mature crane jib support technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Large PV power supplies or power supply modules for extraterrestrial surface missions such as those on the Moon and Mars, including but not limited to initial manned Mars missions where PV array modules of up to 2500 m2 total area (or a single array of that size) need to be prepositioned, validated, and operated prior to human landings.  <BR><BR>The proposed concept's application is technologically robust and operationally flexible.  Technological robustness arises from simple mechanics and a "slack" design that is inherently insensitive to environmental and dimensional perturbations (including extreme thermal fluctuation) and offers a self-cleaning mechanism in environments where some atmosphere and winds are present and dust accumulation is a risk.  Operational flexibility means applicability both in large units and small, transportable packages.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The concept may mature into spinoff technology for Earth PV array applications with the need for autonomous and rapid deployability, re-deployability, and compact packaging.  Scientific and non-scientific, applications including defense and robotic / mobile / vehicular use may also be served.

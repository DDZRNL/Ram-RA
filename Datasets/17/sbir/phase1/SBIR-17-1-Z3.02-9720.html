		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase I program addresses the challenge of gaining the necessary knowledge needed to support certification of additive manufacturing (AM) hardware and achieving the desired surface finish and mechanical properties on high value components produced by AM. To achieve this goal Faraday Technology Inc., will work with team members at UES Inc., CalRAM Inc., Keystone Synergistic Enterprise Inc., and REM Surface Engineering to develop the necessary empirical knowledge to produce a manufacturing decision tree model (MDTM) that will enable the part designer to reduce the cycle time required produce the desired part with the required surface finish. The MDTM will be designed to select the appropriate build pathway to form the desired component and improve the as-built surface finish on the required areas while also determining the necessary secondary steps to achieve the desired surface finish on all required surfaces. With this teams combined expertise range from AM part building [ARCAM (E-BEAM), SLM (LASER), Wire Fed (E-BEAM)], secondary AM part finishing [electrochemical and isotropic], and post process AM material evaluation (tensile and microstructural characterization) we will be able to diagnose the best manufacturing cycle to reduce time and cost while ensuring the functionality of the produced material is maintained through each processing step. It is envisioned that the outcome of this Phase I/II program would be a working MDTM that has the potential to diagnose the best manufacturing pathway to produce a wide range of high-value components with various shapes and contours.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The anticipated result of the proposed program (Phase I, II and III) is the development of a manufacturing decision tree model (MDTM) that can inform the component designer the most rapid manufacturing pathways to produce a prototype part. The anticipated results of the Phase I and II programs is a software framework that could be imported into existing 3D design software with a TRL of 5 or greater, and a technology transition plan for implementation at a NASA facility or OEM. Commercial applications of the proposed approach include any component that has the potential to be produced via AM processes.<BR><BR>Applications for this technology exist in many turbine and turbomachinery sectors including NASA military rocket applications, DOE ground energy systems, DoD tactical and strategic missiles, enhancing component efficiency, thrust, specific impulse, and maneuvering. We envision this technology application in other areas including: space re-entry vehicles, diver and attitude control systems, gun barrels, hypersonic propulsion, nuclear reactors, gas turbines, or any other technology that suffers from weight restriction and high manufacturing cost due to the large amount of material consumption and extensive machining steps.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to the NASA, the proposed technology will be of interest to other agencies, including Army, Navy, and Air Force. Additional technology maturation, test, and evaluation funding will also be sought from other NASA and DoD program offices for specific AM components. Faraday will established strategic partner relationships with some of the OEM manufacturers of NASA components and is well placed to transition the technology to those OEMs.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address the NASA need for reliable in-process sensing and monitoring technologies for additive manufacturing(AM), Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Penetrating High-Resolution Inspection Tool (PHRUIT). The PHRUIT, intended primarily for layer-by-layer quality control in the power bed fusion (PBF) process, is based on innovative X-ray Compton backscatter microscopy, which enables single-sided, high-resolution (~50 um), subsurface inspection of PBF parts. Due to the penetrating nature of X-rays, the PHRUIT will be able to inspect not only the surface of the last layer, but also the subsurface features, with typical penetration depths of 1-2 mm, and therefore will reveal voids and defects that are not visible with optical imaging. The PHRUIT will enable a user to "focus" on a particular depth within the part and localize any features or voids in x/y/z with accuracy of ~50 um. The PHRUIT will have a capability to cover arbitrarily complex part profiles with two dimensional translation, with a total inspection time of typical parts of around 1-2 min. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the PHRUIT high-resolution imaging approach by fabricating and testing a technology readiness level (TRL)-4 preliminary prototype. In Phase II, POC plans to develop a fully functional and integrated TRL-6 prototype and demonstrate its NDE capabilities to NASA by testing it with relevant PBF AM systems. At the end of Phase II, the PHRUIT system prototype will be delivered to NASA for further characterization.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary NASA application of the proposed PHRUIT system is in-process NDE and quality control of spacecraft parts manufactured by particle bed fusion additive manufacturing. The PHRUIT will extend NASA leadership in AM technologies by providing tools for ensuring the high yield and quality of the produced parts. This will reduce the cost of future AM processes. In safety-critical applications, the benefit of the PHRUIT will be in ensuring the structural integrity and reliability of the produced components, which is crucial for in-space AM activities, where extensive postprocess part testing may not be available. The use of the PHRUIT technology will be beneficial in the AM of critical spacecraft items, such as the repair of components of the propulsion systems.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications of the PHRUIT system will also be based on its use as a fast, high-resolution NDE tool for AM process quality control, as well as single-sided, noncontact inspection of large aerospace structures. For example, the PHRUIT system can be used for the detection of cracks and fatigue in safety-critical components of aircraft and helicopters, composite bondline inspection, and electronic board testing for defects and integrity. The PHRUIT system can be incorporated by the U.S. Navy, Army, and Air Force as a reliable, rapid, robotic, easy-to-use NDE/NDT system in manufacturing and maintenance operations. The commercial applications of the PHRUIT system will also include printed circuit board (PCB) inspection, material development, and biomedical imaging.

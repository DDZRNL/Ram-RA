		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		SDMA proposes to develop a flexible fabric containing Phase Change Materials that is suitable for use on Deployable Decelerators.  This technology will make Deployable Decelerators substantially more efficient.  Previous work at NASA has shown that increasing the thermal capacitance of the structure can make hypersonic vehicles more efficient.  SDMA's work will build on NASA's previous efforts by developing practical methods of containing PCM's in a flexible system that withstands the thermal and mechanical mission requirements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		SDMA will develop a flexible fabric containing Phase Change Materials (PCM's) suitable for use in shifting and attenuating thermal energy loads.  This same fabric could be used in protective clothing, allowing a fire fighter for example to enter a hot environment without incurring injury, or in a fire shelter to help save the life of a wildland fire fighter trapped by fire.  Although the liquid/gas phase change will be considered for deployable decelerators, the solid/liquid phase change could be used in the same type of fabric, and this fabric could be used in medical applications to deliver sustained cold to injuries, or in flexible coolers to keep food and drinks cool for longer periods of time.

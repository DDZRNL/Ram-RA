		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal addresses some of the most challenging materials issues with respect to Hot Structures, very high temperature, up to 4000 degrees F, applications. The very successful, record breaking, NASA led X-43A hypersonic flight proved the ability to use state of the art (SOTA) material/coating system for short duration, single mission, and very high temperature applications. The issues associated with the leading edges are quite different from the Hot Structures issues where transverse properties are very critical and the longer duration time with much wider temperature distribution can be expected.  Also the shear component size makes the application of CVD based coatings impractical. Allcomp proposes an extremely innovative solution to this problem by using functionally graded (FGM)  PIP coatings to alleviate interfacial shear stresses and greatly reduce transverse thermal cracking, which historically have plagued ceramic coatings applied to very low thermal expansion coefficient 2-D  and 2.5 D C-C composite substrates. The success of this Phase I will totally open new avenues in the area of high temperature materials. That, in turn, will enable NASA designers to implement hot structure solution in lieu of parasitic passive insulation system, resulting in significant weight reduction in future NASA Space Exploration vehicles, as well as a plethora of other applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary focus is initially on new TPS solutions like hot structures for NASA Space Exploration vehicles. In addition, this technology would also have applicability in future hypersonic applications.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Several DoD organizations are actively pursuing hypersonic vehicles for both advanced missile systems, as well as sophisticated surveillance vehicles. The novel, low cost technology developed under this program will lead to DoD applications as well.

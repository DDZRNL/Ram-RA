		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is seeking innovative Advanced RF Platform technologies at the physical level, specifically Ka-Band high efficiency high linearity microwave 10 to 20 Watt solid state power amplifiers (SSPAs), to meet the needs of future space missions utilizing complex modulation for communications and sensor applications. Space missions require the smallest size, lowest power, space qualifiable hardware components leading to the choice of monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) technology. In Phase I of this SBIR, Custom MMIC Design Services, Inc. (CMDS) will analyze the GaN MMIC technologies from the available domestic foundries (NGST, Qorvo, HRL) and select best GaN HEMT foundry and process technology to achieve Ka-Band high efficiency high linearity microwave 10 to 20 Watt SSPA. CMDS, utilizing the appropriate CAD tools, will thoroughly design and develop the required MMIC PA. We will also prepare all necessary design rule check (DRC) and layout versus schematic (LVS) documentation during Phase I to assure clean layouts ready for fabrication submission to facilitate the first pass of GaN MMIC fabrication on the first day of a follow-on Phase II contract.  By being completely ready for submission on the first day of phase II, we assure the time necessary for two complete GaAs MMIC LNA iterations during Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The success of this GaN linear PA process and devices selection, and the new 10-20 Watt PA MMIC and circuit topologies developed in this SBIR will allow us to develop other key linear high efficiency PAs for NASA and NASA subcontractors.  We have done this before having been the recipient of derivative 5 W linear PA contracts from NASA Goddard for ?25 to 27 GHz Power Amplifier? and NASA JPL for ?35 GHz Power Amplifier for Radar Applications?. During marketing of our existing PA product line, we have come across other NASA projects (highlighted above). More of this work will take place at different frequencies and different power levels with the success of this project.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Gallium Nitride standard components are in short supply even from the major MMIC suppliers. As a proven entity that can create a significant number of products in a short space of time, Custom MMIC with this contract can establish itself very quickly as a significant contributor of high efficiency linear GaN PAs to the RF block diagrams of both commercial and military systems. The development of Ka-band components in a GaN material system will provide commercial systems with similar components. As stated above the techniques will allow us to create designs for the commercial bands (27-29 GHz) along with military bands. By utilizing the design techniques developed under this and other contracts Custom MMIC will create both linear and saturated high efficiency PAs, along with the respective control components. By using semi-production masks we will be able to limit our up front production transition costs and drive up our volume of wafers such that high volume deliveries can be leveraged.

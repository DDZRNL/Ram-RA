		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The computing capabilities of onboard spacecraft are a major limiting factor for accomplishing many classes of future missions. Although technology development efforts are underway that will provide improvements to spacecraft central processing units (CPUs) they do not address the limitations of current onboard memory systems. In addition to CPU upgrades, effective execution of data-intensive operations such as terrain relative navigation, hazard detection and avoidance, autonomous planning and scheduling, and onboard science data processing and analysis require high-bandwidth, low-latency memory systems to maximize processor usage (i.e. to overcome the "memory wall").  Copious amounts of data being generated on a mission require large amounts of non-volatile memory storage in order to store this data for transmission back to earth when power to do this operation is available.  Furthermore, the memory system must be capable of providing the necessary operational robustness and fault tolerance required for space applications.  In an effort to support the needs for NASA's High Performance Space Computer (HPSC), it is proposed that this research investigates the challenges and opportunities in developing a space-qualified, 3D Flash memory cube utilizing COTS memory devices supplemented with a custom Radiation-Hardened-By-Design (RHBD) controller.  Focus would be on developing a NAND Flash memory module that could be used for SSRs to help increase the memory densities, lower power, lower cost and to achieve higher data throughput.

		<BR>
		The proposed development is to produce a module consisting of a Rad-hard controller integrated with a 3D Flash memory cube design using COTS memory.  Some features of the module would allow for high bandwidth capabilities, increase memory density and dynamic error correction that could ultimately be used for NASA's High Performance Space Computer (HPSC) and high memory density solid state recorders (SRRs).   Interplanetary missions and space telescopes are other possible applications. Further, this technology eventually will allow NASA to access a broader range of capabilities that can be brought to space.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		COTS based 3D Flash memory cubes integrated to a custom RH controller die can be foreseen to enter markets where the ability to dynamically correct for memory errors is important in a harsh environment or where the electronics cannot be readily repaired or replaced.  Military and commercial communication satellites, space-based surveillance and reconnaissance, and downhole electronics are applications where robust electronics are in demand.

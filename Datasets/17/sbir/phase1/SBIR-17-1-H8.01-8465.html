		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Radiation shielding is needed to protect personnel and equipment for extended stays beyond low earth orbit.  Ideally, the shielding material would be of dual use, i.e., shielding and structural.  Recently, a tailorable multifunctional composite with increased structural strength combined with efficient shielding against GCR and secondary neutrons was developed by this team.  For these multifunctional composites to be seriously considered for such applications as crew vehicles and habitats, their durability against the overall space environment such as atomic oxygen, UV radiation, and temperature extremes have to be evaluated. During this effort, we aim to further improve the multifunctional radiation shielding material and use the MISSE-FF facility to test our composite against the combined space environment.  To further improve the shielding and structural properties of the composite,  incorporation of boron nitride as nanophase particles or tubes (BNNT) and enriched boron carbide will be evaluated.  Aside from having large cross-section for neutron attenuation, significant enhancements in strength and stiffness can be expected from incorporating these phases in the composite architecture. In addition to radiation and mechanical testing, these advanced composites will ultimately have to be tested against the combined space environment, which will be conducted during Phase 2 and 3 efforts.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA applications for this technology include structural radiation shielding for the protection of humans and electronics in aerospace transportation vehicles, space transportation vehicles, large space structures, such as space stations, orbiters, landing vehicles, rovers, habitats, and nuclear propulsion.  Potential customers include Boeing, Orbital-ATK, Lockheed, and other NASA contractors.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to NASA markets, this technology can be leveraged across the broader nuclear market.  Both government and commercial entities in the following sectors use radiation shielding.  Commercial applications include shielding for particle accelerators, nuclear reactors, radioactive waste containment, satellite hardware shielding, radiation protection for passengers/crew in high-altitude commercial and military airliners, and medical patient shielding.

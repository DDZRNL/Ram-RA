		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Composites Automation (CA) and partners University of Delaware Center for Composite Materials (UD-CCM) and ILC Dover, propose to evaluate innovative composite material and structure concepts that improve impact performance for space suite hard composite components. A systematic experimental screening methodology in Phase I, followed by detailed design and assessment in Phase II. Material innovations  evaluated in this effort include hybrid laminate constructions, interlayers and thin-ply composite laminates; as well as potential synergistic combinations. A Low-Velocity Impact (LVI) protocol will be used in combination with leak resistance checks to evaluate concepts and guide composite design. A two-stage methodology is proposed with initial screening of concepts under equivalent conditions for comparative assessment, followed by performance limit assessment (maximum impact energy with no leak).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Increasing damage tolerance of lightweight composite structures to impact loads while maintaining leak resistance under pressure is a key performance metric for space suit hard composite components. Aerospace and satellite structures are also driven by damage tolerant design criteria and proposed concepts may enable higher design allowables and lighter weight solutions. Proposed goals will improve performance 3X the current Z2 composite design and enable lighterweight and more robust and leak resistant composite component designs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Damage tolerant composite structures are used in many applications, including aerospace, automotive and marine composites, and military platforms. Post-impact mechanical performance drives composite design in these applications, such as Compression after Impact or Open-hole Tension/Compression. Mechanical fastening and joining is also common in many of these applications and resistance to damage propagation at fastener holes promotes long-term durability. Concepts/strategies that increase durability, and post-impact performance while retaining lightweight characteristics are of wide-ranging interest in the composites industry.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		IFOS proposes to develop a test rig sensor suite to measure pressures/acoustics, static and dynamic strains and tempersures for advanced propulsion systems such as that used for NASA?s Space Launch System (SLS) and SpaceX?s proposed Interplanetary Transport System (ITS). IFOS will leverage off its experience in the turbine engine industry and harsh environment sensors.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed test rig sensor suite will assist rigorous ground testing to mitigate the propulsion system risks that are inherent in spaceflight. This technology also has the potential to provide solutions to NASA?s challenges in developing lighter weight, higher performance structural materials, miniaturized instrumentation, improved measurement capability, and enhanced platform safety over extended operational lifetimes. The technology will readily extend to any NASA vehicle application where Strucural Health Monitoring (SHM) is desired, including extra-planetary exploration, robotic missions, and human space operations
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed work will significantly benefit the commercial space launch industry through the development of advanced fiber optic sensor based ground test systems that enhance chemical and advanced propulsion technology development and certification.  Example application focus will be SpaceX?s proposed ITS.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Tao Systems and University of Minnesota propose to develop a sensor system providing sectional aerodynamic forces and moments with fast response, low volume/size/power requirements for ease of installation, and minimal calibration requirements. Aviation loss of control (LOC) accidents often result from stall and uncertain weather/flow conditions, often at low altitudes e.g., take-off/landing. The sensor system: (1) uses a robust transduction mechanism, (2) has a one-time lifetime calibration requiring minimal maintenance, (3) provides monotonic output with speed and circulation, and is (4) relatively insensitive to environmental parameters such as flight altitude, pressure, temperature, and density. This technology provides real-time output for energy state awareness under both nominal and off-nominal flight conditions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The benefits of a distributed aerodynamic force measurement system has a number of benefits: (1) addresses uncertainties in aerodynamics for safe envelope prediction, (2) increases controller robustness: reduces dependency on aerodynamic and structural uncertainties, (3) increases aerostructural efficiency, (4) enables mission persistence at a lower cost. For example, degradation due to atmospheric effects such as moisture and fatigue caused by constant wing stresses provides significant risk over the life of a HALE-type UAV, e.g., DARPA Vulture. Longevity of components is also a major technological risk. Using extremely high aspect ratios reduces drag. The system can utilize turbulence control for further aerodynamic efficiency.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The ability to cruise efficiently at a range of altitudes, enabled by a substantial increase in cruise lift-to- drag (L/D) ratios over today's high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, is vital, providing sustained presence and long range. Aerodynamic load/moment sensors would enable the efficient, robust active control of adaptive, lightweight wings to optimize lift distribution to maximize L/D. Cost-effectively improving the energy capture and reliability of wind turbines would help national renewable energy initiatives. A standalone aerodynamic load/moment sensor could provide output for control feedback to mitigate the turbine blade lifetime-limiting time varying loads generated by the ambient wind.

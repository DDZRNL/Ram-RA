		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Next generation commercial and DoD communication systems must meet the demand for higher data rates and the growing number of users in an increasingly over-taxed spectrum. Reconfigurable digital phased arrays that implement high speed ADCs promise to help provide a solution; however, creating broadband high speed high ENOB DACs remains a challenging bottleneck of the system. MaXentric's solution will be to create a Universal ADC capable of interfacing with purely electrical systems for moderate speed applications or optically assisted systems for high speed applications requiring precision timing with order of magnitude improvement in timing jitter. With the Universal ADC using optical assistance, it is anticipated that performance can approach 100 Gs/sec with greater than 8 bits ENOB allowing for truly multi-standard high performance "software defined" receivers such as applications of digital phased arrays.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The optically assisted ADC will be an enabling technology allowing for high speed and high resolution signal processing. The applications for high performance ADCs range from imaging to digital phased arrays in high data-rate communication systems.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The anticipated benefit of a Universal ADC proposed by MaXentric is a clear path toward 5G performance. Another, specific, market in which the technology may be advantageous is ground vehicle navigation in which high resolution imaging may be a key component requiring fast, reconfigurable phased arrays. Consumer spending on self-driving cars has received over $3B in research funding from established private-sector organizations.

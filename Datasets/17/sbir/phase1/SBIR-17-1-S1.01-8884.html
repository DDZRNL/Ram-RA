		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Boulder Nonlinear Systems (BNS) will develop a high speed (sub-15 micro-second response time) low size, weight, and power (SWaP) beam scanner for application to space-based Lidar. BNS will employ their current liquid crystal polarization grating (LCPG) technology and ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) switches to meet the discrete scanner speed and resolution requirements called for in the solicitation.  Advantages of applying BNS LCPG and switch component technology specific to the space-based Lidar application will include accuracy, reliability, and improved SWaP as well as high rate (at least 8 kHz ) scanning.  In addition, BNS will develop an environmental test and or mitigation plan for our components tailored to the space-based Lidar application. The Phase I analysis will result in the design of a scanner prototype which will be built in Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to the remote sensing application, a fast, low-SWaP beam scanner could be used in NASAs hazard avoidance applications (Docking, Entry, Descent and Landing). The result of the Phase I effort will be a design for a prototype fast, low SWaP beam scanner.  The Phase II prototype implementation will serve to demonstrate the beam scanning capability, environmental survivability, as well as optimize SWaP. The resultant beam control system will be transitioned to the Lidar systems integrator and eventually a commercial product.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Possible commercial applications include the use of this technology for agricultural and meteorological information gathering as well as search and rescue.

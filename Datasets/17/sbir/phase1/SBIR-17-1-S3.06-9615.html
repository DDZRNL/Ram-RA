		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This NASA SBIR Phase I proposal presents an unprecedented method to do additive manufacturing of integrated heat exchangers for pumped fluid loop with a femtosecond (fs) fiber laser. It is the enabling technology for 3D manufacturing of high thermal conductivity materials. With our successful history in ultrafast laser AM and SM processing, this proposal has a great potential to succeed. A proof of concept demonstration will be carried out at the end of Phase 1. A prototype will be delivered at the end of Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to NASA?s integrated heat exchangers manufacturing, the proposed short pulse high power fiber laser AM and SM process can also be used in other applications, such as space vehicle, aircraft, and satellite manufacturing. PolarOnyx will develop a series of products to meet various requirements for NASA/military deployments.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Successful development of the proposed AM technology will provide a vital tool to solve existing and potential issues. This technology will be directly applied in the 3D printing area with combined market share of $10(s) of billions. 3D printing uses various technologies for building the products for all kinds of applications from foods, toys to battery, rockets and cars. The global market for 3D Printing is projected to reach $2.99 billion by year 2018, driven by the advent of newer technologies, approaches, and applications. Expanding use of the technology in manufacturing final products, declining cost of printers, and increasing use of 3D printing technology in newer areas bodes well for market growth.

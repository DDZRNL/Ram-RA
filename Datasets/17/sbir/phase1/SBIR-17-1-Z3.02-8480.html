		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR Phase I effort examines the feasibility of an innovative surface modification technology incorporating friction stir reaction processing for producing engineered alloy structures, or conventional parts with strategically enhanced locations for wear, environmental, and/or creep-fatigue resistance. Friction stir reaction processing is an emerging microstructural modification technique based on the solid state friction stir welding and friction stir processing. It can be applied to enhance the microstructure-properties of the parent material through the introduction of nano-particles into the "weld" thus improve the damage tolerance capabilities of the reinforced region. This separate step allows high value parts to have tailored microstructure-properties based on component region-specific requirements, as opposed to one set of microstructure-properties fits all as a compromise.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA commercial applications are metal structures and components for space launch vehicles (e.g., thermal protection systems, fuel tanks), spacecraft, airframes, and gas turbines, which require engineered alloys and/or strategic surface modification and/or improved wear, corrosion, and/or durability.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential non-NASA commercial applications are metal structures and components for military and/or commercial space launch vehicles, spacecraft, airframes, air and land-based gas turbines, land vehicles (cars, trucks, trains), sea vehicles (recreation, passenger, cargo), and consumer products (biomedical implants), which require engineered alloys and/or strategic surface modification for improved wear, corrosion, and/or durability.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced cryogenic cooling systems are required to enable high-precision measurements of trace atmospheric gases and isotopes present at very low concentrations in order to evaluate anthropogenic impacts on climate and stratospheric ozone and to assess compliance with international regulations.  This SBIR Phase I project will develop a robust cryogen-free preconcentrator based on a Stirling cryocooler and a novel sample trap design. A high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer will be coupled with gas chromatographic separation for selective and sensitive detection of greenhouse gases and ozone depleting substances. Data acquisition and analysis software will be developed to allow for automated operation of the instrument and data archiving.  Combining these three elements will provide a new system capable of rapid automated analysis for field and laboratory measurements. In addition to these applications, the preconcentrator will be useful for enhancing the sensitivity of optical-based isotopic measurements for greenhouse gases.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is the head US agency for monitoring ozone depleting substances, and plays a leading role in US Global Climate Change Research Program (USGCRP). The system developed in this SBIR project will provide a significant advancement in capability for measuring ozone depleting substances and greenhouse gases. It will be a desirable upgrade to the stations in the NASA-sponsored Advanced Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) and will provide new technology for other NASA-sponsored atmospheric research programs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Atmospheric research and climate change programs sponsored by other federal agencies, such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Energy (DOE), as well as a wide range of international collaborators, will benefit from the technology developed by this project.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Self-Deploying Tent Array (SDTA) is a modular power system that can be scaled to very large power levels for use on the Martian surface.  The tent shape is structurally efficient and packages well with a flexible photovoltaic blanket.  The tent array geometry produces a much more constant power output throughout a day than a non-tracking flat array, and provides significant power at sunrise and sunset.  This results in efficiencies in the power processing and storage system, to which the array would be integrated, that reduce the total system mass significantly.  The tent shape is also inherently resistant to dust buildup due to the slope of the arrays, and is amenable to a number of wind loading mitigations that will be examined in Phase I work.  The module self-deploys and can naturally straddle large boulders.  It can clear 0.5 m obstacles on the ground via two deployment schemes that will be examined.   Phase I work will consist of conceptual design of the module, structural analysis & optimization, performance analysis, module sizing within a large array system, and mechanical design of a module.  This will prepare for detail design, manufacture and deployment testing in Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The SDTA is applicable to any Lunar or Martian NASA surface mission that requires large amounts of power.  A first mission for the SDTA might be with an in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) robotic mission, where the array could be deployed on Mars and tested while supplying power for ISRU.  A large number of modules could be built up on Mars in preparation for a human landing.  The design is also very applicable to the moon, and could be simplified due to the lack of wind loading and the lower gravity.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The SDTA design will be able to deploy in a 1 g environment, and so could be applied to terrestrial applications where a deployable collapsible array is needed.  This self-deploying tent array concept can potentially have military and civilian applications. Providing power for remote camps or isolated equipment operation would be one possible application. Due to its ability to be stowed and deployed easily and its modular/scalable output power capability, it could be viable as an emergency or disaster relief power supply. In such a situation, it could power items such as communications towers or water filtration systems.

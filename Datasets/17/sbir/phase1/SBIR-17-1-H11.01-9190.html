		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Advances in radiation shielding systems technologies are needed to protect humans and electronic components from all threats of space radiation.  This is especially important as NASA continues to develop plans for long duration missions, where exposure to harmful radiation is greater than ever before. Brimrose Technology Corporation, in collaboration with Penn State University, proposes to develop a novel integrated radiation shielding material based on aluminum and UHMWPE and Field Assisted Sintering Technology (FAST) will be used to fabricate the prototypes of these materials. Beside radiation shielding capabilities, such materials would also have desirable thermal and mechanical properties suitable for forming protective structures that are strong, durable, thermally manageable, and hermetic.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Lightweight innovative radiation shielding materials are needed to safeguard humans in next generation exploration. Furthermore, the energetic particles encountered in space can destroy or cause malfunctions in spacecraft electronics.  The targeted application for the proposed materials that will be developed during this SBIR work is radiation shielding to shield humans in aerospace transport vehicles, large space structures such as space stations, orbiters, landers, rovers, habitats, and spacesuits. The material is expected to be multi-functional by also providing structural support while still maintaining weight requirements. The materials will also provide radiation shielding to the electronic components on board the space vehicle.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed materials have potential military applications as well as commercial applications such as in the medical industry and for the nuclear energy industry. Along with NASA, potential customers include DoD and DOE as well as first responders, nuclear energy providers and medical personnel.

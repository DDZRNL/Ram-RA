		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Discovery Semiconductors and Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories have teamed together to design a Universal LIDAR system that will work for NASA's diverse range of applications.  We propose a fiber-based, self-heterodyne LIDAR, at 2050 nm wavelength, whose transmitted optical signal is modulated by a 10 Gbps programmable pseudo-random (PRN) sequence.  The LIDAR's resolution and sensitivity will be tuned by choosing the appropriate PRN sequence.  A PRN length of 1 will provide the finest resolution of 1.5 cm with 1 uW sensitivity.  Increasing the PRN length to 100,000 will improve the sensitivity to 10 pW for 1.5 km resolution.<BR><BR>Several NASA applications will be covered by the new innovation including:<BR> <BR>1)  Thermometry and spectroscopy of rocket plumes and jet engine flames with cm scale resolution,  <BR>2)  Laser Doppler Velocimetry in Hypersonic wind tunnels up to Mach 20,<BR>3)  Navigational LIDARs for planetary landing mission that need velocity and altitude measurements with sub-meter accuracy,  <BR>4)  Clear air turbulence measurements having 10 m or higher resolution, and<BR>5)  Space based wind LIDAR for environmental sensing having 1 km resolution.<BR><BR>Our Phase I work will result in detailed LIDAR design, which will be corroborated by experimental demonstration of resolution-sensitivity trade.

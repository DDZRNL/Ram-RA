		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Current and emerging spaceflight processors are leveraging heterogeneous multicore/co-processor architectures to satisfy the ever increasing onboard processing demands required by planned NASA missions. These architectures can provide increased processing bandwidth, power efficiency, and fault tolerance for onboard processing applications. However, these advantages come at the cost of increased hardware and software complexity. As software development is a major cost driver for missions, this increased complexity has the potential to significantly increase cost for future missions. To address this risk, Troxel Aerospace Industries, Inc. proposes to develop a robust middleware management technology for spacecraft-focused multicore/co-processor architectures. The proposed middleware technology will enable a fault tolerant computing environment that is agnostic to the underlying hardware and is largely transparent to mission applications executing upon the middleware to provide a standardized, intelligent resource, fault, and power management interface.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Troxel Aerospace is committed to continuously pushing the state of the art in spacecraft onboard processing to meet the current and future needs of NASA, the DoD, and commercial customers. The significant improvement in multicore radiation tolerance and co-processor support derived from the successful development of this SBIR effort is of significant interest for all space customers. The Phase I, Phase II, and commercialization plan outlined in this proposal is achievable, has a low risk profile, significantly improves onboard processing capability currently required by multiple NASA missions, and has a clear path to commercialization and acceptance into missions through direct use by programs and infusion via processor vendors who supply to NASA programs. A smooth commercialization path is guaranteed by collaborating with future government and industry customers (i.e. primes and processor vendors) early in Phase I and throughout Phase II to ensure the technology's relevance to their products. The processor-agnostic design of the proposed middleware increases its commercialization potential by being applicable to all processor vendor's present and future technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-government commercial space customers in all markets will be able to directly benefit from the technology including telecommunications, commercial imagery, launch vehicles, ISS re-service vehicles and exo-planetary commercial ventures (e.g. asteroid mining). Also, non-space markets that require robust fault tolerance from high-performance heterogeneous multicore/co-processor architectures will also be served by the middleware including: radiation test facilities, medical radiation therapy facilities, and other critical performance markets where people's lives or expensive equipment is at risk such as aircraft, automobile, public transportation, and advanced manufacturing where the same processors targeted by the proposed effort are already deployed. Troxel Aerospace plans to capture all these markets by following the a commercialization strategy through partnerships with vendors and primes who already supply processors to these missions and customers.

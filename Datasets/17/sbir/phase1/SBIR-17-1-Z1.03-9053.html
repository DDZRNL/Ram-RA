		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Under this Phase I effort, MiTi proposes to establish the design of a high performance recuperator for integration with a Close Brayton Cycle turboalternator for space application, primarily for fission-based power generation technologies for surface missions on the moon and Mars.  The proposed recuperator design will emphasize high effectiveness approaching or exceeding 90% in addition to being sized to minimize both volume and weight.  Based on requirements for a 10 kWe He-Xe CBC power generating system the key recuperator design parameters such as inlet and exit pressures, temperatures and mass flow rates will be determined and the novel Quasi-Helical flow recuperator concept sized.  Design iterations will be conducted to establish wall thickness to accommodate internal differential pressures as well as minimize system weight.  This Mohawk Innovative Technology, Inc. (MiTi) proposal for development of a recuperator capable of satisfying the stringent requirements for a CBC system addresses NASA's stated need for space power systems technology. The preliminary design study will encompass all key aspects of recuperator design, including: 1) parametric Brayton cycle thermodynamic analyses to establish CBC turboalternator requirements and identify optimal operating condition; 2) recuperator sizing and layout to ensure high effectiveness and low pressure drop, 3) stress analysis and fabrication method down-selection to ensure hermetic (leak-proof) construction, 4) solid model of the integrated recuperator-turboalternator system showing the overall system configuration layout. Fabrication of a prototype unit would occur during a Phase II of the program.

		<BR>
		The proposed technology will satisfy NASA's stated need for technology for power conversion from fission to support space exploration applications and specifically surface missions on the moon and Mars. The initial technology development will be suitable for space based stationary and transportation power generation systems This effort will lay the groundwork for subsequent scaling to higher power platforms (order of 100 kWe), capable of powering spacecraft on-board power, communication, navigation controls and electronics, life support systems, planetary rovers and machinery, and even planetary human settlements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Besides space systems a large number of potential military and commercial customers would benefit from use of the proposed technology for microgrid and waste heat applications.  Among these are distributed cogeneration from high-grade waste heat recovery (heating exhaust for residential use of the order of 1 kWe) to industrial (process waste heat in the order for generation of 100 kWe and higher) applications. Additionally, the U.S. military could benefit from direct application of the technology to both land based and mobile turboalternators including those used in forward operating base microgrids as efforts to reduce fuel consumption continue for the military as well as for power sources for UAVs, drones and even in advanced commercial air plane auxiliary power units.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		State of the Art In-Space Telescopic imagery suffers from deleterious effects of image quality due to radiation, in the form of stray visible light.  While treatments to reduce the impact of stray light exist, the effectiveness of these treatments have limitations thereby limiting the range and reliability of astrophysical telescopic imagery.  NASA is seeking a scalable, highly effective solution to reduce and/or eliminate the impact of stray light.<BR>Applied Sciences, Inc. (ASI) proposes Applied Sciences proposes a unique solution for stray light suppression in space flight instruments. The innovation utilizes non-reflective/ nano-structured polymer coatings combined with a proven and scalable process that yields a light trapping nano-textured surface.  Stacked-cup carbon nanotubes will provide additional absorptive properties to a currently-used aerospace qualified resin system (legacy material). A non-reflecting surface will be fabricated by plasma etching and replication into pyramidal nanostructures for broadband absorption with efficiency at or better than 99.9%. This new approach comes at a much lower cost, is readily scalable and safer than the competing technology. ASI has previous success formulating spray-able room temperature cured coatings with tailored reflectivity and is working with U.S. Air Force to scale-up the nanomaterial enhanced coatings manufacturing capability.  That separate effort, and the use of a (modified/enhanced-) legacy material, will benefit the proposed effort as it will enable rapid verification, qualification, and transition of the technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology is aimed for stray light suppression in spaceflight instruments. The non-reflective nano-pyramid shaped carbon nanotube coating is designed for application on components such as baffles, entrance aperture, tubes and stops.  Black-body masks and terrestrial telescopes could also benefit from the proposed technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed innovation comes at a much lower cost than the current state of the art, and is readily scalable. Commercial applications include optical apertures, binoculars, night vison goggles, analytical instrumentation and other devices that benefit from stray light suppression.

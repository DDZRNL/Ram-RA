		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Future robotic and human space exploration vehicles will be producing large quantities of data that needs transmitted between vehicles and to the ground stations.  However, these vehicles will be tightly constrained in size, weight, and power sources.  Traditional methods of using single function elements will not be able to meet these requirements. Therefore, advanced technologies that utilize state-of-the-art materials, packaging, and devices and components are urgently needed to minimize the size, weight, and power usage of the RF communication systems. <BR>nGimat proposes to develop high performance Ka-band electrically steered antenna with phased array architectures using nGimat's proprietary BST based tunable dielectric materials.  BST's unique voltage tunable characteristics make them promising candidates for critical microwave components in phased array communications and radar systems such as varactors, tunable filters, and phase shifters.  The ability to efficiently change the RF complex impedance with low electrical loss could significantly impact future communication systems for both government and civilian applications.  Successful maturation of tunable materials together with associated microwave and component circuit design techniques resulting from this effort could reduce the cost while simultaneously improving the performance of future RF communication systems.  The resultant antenna will be capable of simultaneous full-duplex multiple beam operations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology could find direct use in NASA's RF communication system for future robotic and human exploration vehicles and space platforms. The developed antenna will bring down the size, weight, and power consumption (SWAP) while retaining the capabilities including beam agility, high power handling capability, and high data transfer rate.  The antennas will be reconfigurable in frequency and radiation pattern that will reduce the number of antennas needed to meet the desired communication requirements of NASA's missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The high performance small, low weight, and low power consumption electronically steered antenna developed in this project will also find wide commercial and military applications including cell phones and commercial communication systems, etc. It has been realized that unlike government applications, the commercial applications epitomize a high volume, low margin opportunity. Therefore, lowering the film and processing costs is one of the key objectives to be addressed in this project, but secondary to meeting NASA's needs.

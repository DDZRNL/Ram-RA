		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A lander on the surface of Venus is heated by the 460 &#61616;C surface temperature, which, even with the best current designs using passive insulation, cause its electronics to fail in much less than a day. Active cooling concepts are not only exceedingly heavy but also exceedingly inefficient. TDA proposes a new insulation for the exterior of the lander that incorporates heat rejection mechanisms that apparently have not been previously considered for the Venus surface. Our insulation will make use of a flexible material that has been recently developed at TDA, and we will compare it to other potential but brittle insulations. Order-of-magnitude calculations suggest that the lifetime of the lander can be extended from hours to days.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The insulation is being designed for a Venus lander. In some sense, it is an enabling technology for a Venus lander, since surely the life expectancy of a mission must be substantially enhanced over the historical Pioneer and Venera probes in order for the mission to be funded. Even so, the materials and techniques developed during this project are potentially useful for a wide range of thermal protection systems (TPS), and could potentially be redesigned for use in applications such as (re-)entry heatshields, both deployable and static.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Thermal protection is also of substantial interest for a host of military applications, primarily including re-entry heatshields, rocket nozzles and internal insulation for solid rocket motor cases.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Innovation Laboratory, Inc., proposes to develop a Decision Support Tool (DST) for strategic guidance to pilots for mitigating encounters with en route turbulence hazards.  Implemented on either Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Electronic Flight Bags (EFBs) or Personal Electronic Devices (PEDs), and standard turbulence data formats, the system is designed to increase the likelihood of Air Traffic Control (ATC) approval of a pilots trajectory change request by strategically presenting viable, pro-active trajectory change options to the pilot based on timely traffic and weather information.  Distribution of our turbulence information to Airline Operations Centers (AOCs) allows airline dispatchers the ability to provide an additional safety net, adjusting flight plans to strategically avoid turbulence related hazards.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Our proposed SBIR product helps NASA researchers study technologies and concepts that enhance aviation safety.  An example of this would be the identification and mitigation of moderate or severe mountain wave turbulence (MWT) or Convective Induced Turbulence (CIT) detected by our system, distributed to other aircraft via EFBs and PEDs, voice communication warnings, or other mechanisms to tactically adjust the flight levels of nearby aircraft prior to entering into an area of turbulence. NASA can investigate Route Availability (RA) and Route Blockage (RB) accordingly.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Turbulence data is needed in the Flight Deck (FD) and at Airline Operations Centers (AOCs) for use by dispatchers and ATC coordinators, for instance, for flight plan adjustments and safety warnings; this may occur even if the TASAR or TASAR-R system is not in use on the FD.  Key potential customers include all the major commercial airlines, other smaller General Aviation (GA) and corporate flight departments; and service providers who market flight management services to corporate flight departments.

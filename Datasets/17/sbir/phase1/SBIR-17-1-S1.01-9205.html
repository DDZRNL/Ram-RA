		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to demonstrate a compact integrated laser module that addresses the requirements of the laser source in a water vapor differential absorption lidar (DIAL) system at the 935nm absorption wavelength. Our approach, with the development of the high performance DBR laser diode and the engineering of compact integration technology, will provide narrow linewidth and high power laser modules for numerous Lidar applications with the advantages of reduced size, weight and power (SWaP). <BR><BR>Under this Phase I SBIR we propose to design and fabrication the EPI material and the DBR lasers with a high gain compressive-strained single quantum well (QW) structure, based on Photodigm's proprietary single growth epi, precision gain ridges, and monolithic grating process. We would develop an integrated module that is optically isolated and fiber coupled by investigating the custom build optical isolators of the operating wavelength and designing a compact, hermetic package to achieve high reliability and manufacturability. <BR>   <BR>Continuing device engineering such as extended mode hop mounting, micro lens beam shaping and package space qualification are expected to be incorporated with this device family under Phase II of this SBIR program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		With the development of high precision 935nm DBR laser diode and matching isolator, NASA's primary application for the proposed compact integration laser module would be the deployment in the air-borne DIAL sensor networks to map atmospheric water vapor with high spatial and temporal resolution. This application is well aligned with the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) instrument development program objective through the implement of smaller and more affordable DIAL transmitters. The compact integration technology applies to the full spectrum of the GaAs material based DBR lasers that Photodigm offers, leading to potential applications in sensing of ozone and other trace gasses.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed integrated laser module would be the most compact and high power DBR laser with embedded optics available in the market. The optical integration concept complements the Photodigm family of DBR laser packages in the 850 to 1000nm range with isolated fiber coupled solution. It is also a high power package alternative to the broader 760 to 1100nm wavelength range devices. In addition to NASA's use in a number of LIDAR systems, a narrow linewidth and high power laser module finds applications in various areas of spectroscopy, atomic physics, non-linear optics, and fiber amplifiers. The high spectral stability is desirable in applications resolving hyperfine structures and applications demanding long coherent length. The size and weight reduction and fiber connection is suitable for handheld instrumentations. Photodigm recognizes the fastest commercial growth lies in gas sensing, aerospace metrology and medical tomography.

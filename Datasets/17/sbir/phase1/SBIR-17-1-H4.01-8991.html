		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The project goal is to increase impact resistance compared to the baseline laminate used in Z-2 test article from 100 J to 300 J.  After impact, the laminate has to have an operational loads.  It is also desirable to make improvements in the efficiency and quality of the manufacture of suit components.<BR>Two high-level approaches are being proposed to inhibit post-impact air leakage:  (1) make the laminate more impact resistant, and (2) prevent cracks from traversing thickness of laminate.  The first approach, making the laminate more impact resistant, also aims to improve post-impact mechanical properties of the laminate. <BR>Maher & Associates LLC proposes to design and develop three new concepts for improving the damage tolerance of the current composite structure concept of the Z-2 spacesuit.  In developing these concepts, Maher & Associates LLC will partner with University of Delaware.  Our personnel with work with university personnel at their Applications and Technology Transfer Laboratory (ATTL) to fabricate coupons and conduct testing.  In addition to characterizing the structural and impact resistance of the concepts, panels will be fabricated that include Z-2 design features to assess the manufacturability of the concept.  <BR>In reviewing the literature, we noticed that there are subtle differences in the clamping approach in the impact testing that was done as art of the original Z-2 development work and the ASTM D-7136 test called out in the topic. In order to assure that a proper baseline is established, we will also fabricate and test fabricate acceptable leak rate and retain sufficient mechanical properties to sustain <BR>a test article representative of the original design.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The results of this SBIR are directly related to the development of the Z-2 space suit.  As a generic technology, the developments can be easily applied to other applications within NASA where damage tolerant composites are sought.  This includes pressure vessels, habitation structures and aircraft skins.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technology will be applicable to any application that is seeking damage tolerant composites. This includes automotive structural components, pressure vessels, aircraft nacelles, fuselage and wing skins, transport flooring, etc.

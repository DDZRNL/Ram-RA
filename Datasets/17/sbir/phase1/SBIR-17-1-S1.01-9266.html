		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		TIPD proposed to build a stable, robust, rugged, compact, fiber coupled gas reference cell (GRC) with tens of meters of interaction length that is required in atmospheric constituent and trace gas analysis sensors as well as LIDAR instruments in the near and shortwave infrared supporting NASA's future planetary science missions. Specifically, this proposal addresses the need for a water vapor reference cell that is required for differential absorption LIDAR (DIAL) systems for water sensing in 820nm and 940nm bands.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The TIPD's all fiber gas reference cell is directly applicable to future NASA goals in Earth and planetary science as well as missions requiring remote spectroscopic sensing of key atmospheric species at near and shortwave infrared wavelengths where robust, compact, and long interaction length reference gas cells are required. Specifically, our GRC could be used in water vapor, CO2, and CH4 DIAL systems.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		One of the most promising markets for commercializing the GRC technology proposed by TIPD beyond direct NASA applications is in the area of molecular spectroscopy including biological sensing, quality control in manufacturing processes, and environmental sensing and monitoring.

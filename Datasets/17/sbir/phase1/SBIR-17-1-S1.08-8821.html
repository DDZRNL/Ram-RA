		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Space-based global measurements of atmospheric CO2 must be complemented with ocean water analysis. Monitoring ocean acidification, which results from the accumulation of CO2, is of critical interest, since progressive acidification is already affecting oceans and coastal estuaries and waterways. To that end, NASA and NOAA are seeking in-situ monitoring devices for oceanic and coastal water monitoring, including a pH sensor for seawater, to support space-based monitoring programs. Monitoring ocean pH accurately over large areas has proved to be extremely difficult, and classic sensor technology, based on potentiometric measurements (pH electrodes), have shown significant limitations: current instruments are expensive, do not monitor pH directly, and therefore need complex signal compensation to yield accurate measurements, and require frequent calibration. Intelligent Optical Systems proposes to develop a novel luminescent sensor for pH, taking advantage of novel materials developed to monitor pH and other parameters of interest in high salinity and elevated pressure environments; it will exhibit high selectivity (direct pH measurements) and stability. A novel antifouling technology with no mechanical parts will prevent sensor degradation in seawater. To contain the cost of the electronics while maintaining high performance in detecting the luminescent signal, we will use Circuit Seed circuits, which process analog signals on 100% digital components. This enables them to reduce size and parts count, simplifying quality control and power requirements, and will enable us to produce high-performance, low-cost optoelectronic units.

		A low-cost, high-performance sensor for seawater pH, and multiparameter devices for monitoring dissolved CO2 and dissolved oxygen in-situ, are essential to current and future NASA space missions such as Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS), Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), and Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Robust sensors for monitoring pH in seawater will enter the oceanography market for NASA programs and beyond. Combined sensing of pH and dissolved oxygen will find application not only in ocean studies but in the growing aquaculture market. According to a study by Grand View Research, Inc., the global aquaculture market is expected to exceed $200 billion by 2020; 40% of that aquaculture takes place in marine and brackish water, where water quality plays a critical role in production. A low-cost, robust water quality monitor will be an important enabling technology, helping this industry collect massive amounts of data to accelerate the development of underutilized marine resources in a responsible manner. Finally, sensors developed for seawater will also find application in the water quality monitoring market, which is projected to reach $3.6 billion by 2020.

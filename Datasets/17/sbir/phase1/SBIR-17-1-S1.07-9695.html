		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Mesa Photonics proposes an optical gas analyzers suitable for planetary and lunar missions that will be smaller, more rugged, and more reliable than existing technology.  These are point sensors for measurements within planetary atmospheres or for analysis of gases collected during lunar activities.  Target gases include CH4, CO2, CO, NH3, O2, C2H2, C2H4, H2S, and H2O. The innovation uses optical absorption spectroscopy at near-infrared wavelengths.  Sensitivities will range from 2 ppm for H2S (in a 101 kPa mixture) to less than 1 ppb for HF.  Instruments will weigh less than 3kg, be under 1 liter in volume, and draw less than 10W.  Power consumption could be as low as 3W depending on platform temperature stabilization.  The Phase I project will test the new technique by (1)assembling and testing instrumentation electronics, (2)measuring detection sensitivity, precision, drift, linearity and dynamic range using CH4 as a representative gas, (3)develop a numerical model of the technique, and (4)determine the expected physical and performance specifications for instruments that could used on planetary missions and lunar deployment.  Based on the most recent decadal survey, possible planetary  missions include a dropsonde for studying the atmosphere of Venus, analysis of trace gases in the Martian atmosphere, characterization of atmospheric composition of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and a dropsonde into the atmosphere of Uranus.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications include gas analysis for planetary missions including studies of the atmospheres of Venus, Mars, the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and Uranus.  The technology can also be deployed for lunar measurements of emitted gases and regolith composition, and for on-line monitoring of regolith processing.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Hydrogen sulfide monitoring is the largest addressable commercial market with most customers in the oil and gas industry.  The proposed technology has significant advantages over existing H2S detection methods (electrochemical cells, lead-acetate tape, ultraviolet spectroscopy, resistive gold films, and non-dispersive mid-infrared detectors).  Portable, hand-held implementations are possible that would be particularly useful for monitoring upstream oil and gas installations. Mesa Photonics anticipates operating as an OEM supplier to a larger company that is well established (making the technology acceptable to potential customers) who can also provide worldwide sales and service.

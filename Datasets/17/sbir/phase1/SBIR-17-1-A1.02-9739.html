		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Thorough understanding of airframe and propulsion aerodynamic noise sources and the subsequent acoustic propagation to the farfield is necessary to the design and development of efficient, environmentally acceptable aircraft.  In this SBIR study, we propose to develop a high fidelity tool using high-order low-dissipation methods in the NASA flagship unstructured CFD code FUN3D. The developed prediction tool can accurately represent the nonlinear flow processes with minimum dissipation, including turbulence, coherent vortices and shock waves critical to the noise generation. Compared to the state-of-the-art unstructured production codes, an increase of one order-of-magnitude in resolvable scales is expected at the expense of just 10% overhead. In Phase I, the effort will include improvement of the 3rd-order scheme for high-aspect ratio unstructured grids, and consistent temporal and spatial accuracies.  High-order limiters will be developed to improve the shock capturing capability for sonic boom. The performance improvements will be assessed for the unsteady subsonic and supersonic flows.  The Phase II effort will further mature and advance the technology utilizing FUN3D?s massively parallel infrastructure to enable its applications for the prediction of airframe noise sources and the noise sources due to the aerodynamic and acoustic interaction of airframe and engines.

		The work proposed in this effort will advance the state-of-the-art of unstructured CFD technology not only for aeroacoustics problems in airframe but also in other areas such as high-lift surfaces and propulsion design. The developed tool can also be directly applied to several of NASA?s multidisciplinary noise and vibration programs such as the prediction of noise mechanisms and propagation for engine, fan, duct, propellers, and airframes, and for the analysis of wake/frame interaction induced noise and vibrations. The developed technology will support multiple NASA programs, projects and initiatives including Advanced Air Transport Technology (AATT) Project, Commercial Supersonic Technology (CST) project, Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology (RVLT) project, the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) vehicle, and many others. It can be used for the design of revolutionary aircraft with innovative configurations and technologies for minimum noise signature, and for the improvement of current aircraft noise performance.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The FAA spends millions of dollars each year buying homes, or making acoustic improvements to homes to comply with FAA regulations. There is an enormous market for efficient aeroacoustic analysis tools, which is driven by new aircraft, missile, and reusable launch vehicle design and by the need for multiple aeroacoustic analyses over time as a consequence of aircraft modifications and expanded/changing missions. These are important areas for defense contractors. The proposed technology provides a viable tool for several commercial applications such as wing-trailing vortex dynamics of large civil aircraft, analysis of noise generated by the landing gear of civil aircraft, and others. The present high-order low-dissipation CFD technology is also applicable to a broad range of applications that involve embedded flow features requiring high resolution with limited grid size. Such applications include turbomachinery, cavitation, biomedical, electronic cooling, and many others.

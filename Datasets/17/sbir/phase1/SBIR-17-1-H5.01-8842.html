		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		For Mars mission program managers, who need a robust, structurally efficient solar array system to autonomously deploy on the Martian surface, the Modular Extendable Terrestrial Array (META) is an extremely high performance and cost-effective deployable solar array system that will enable manned missions.  LoadPath's approach adapts a demonstrated, high packaging-efficiency array folding architecture for a Martian surface application delivering robust autonomous deployments over uneven terrain, retractability, modularity, portability, minimal CONOPS, and integrated dust mitigation.  LoadPath recently invented and demonstrated the feasibility of an advanced, lightweight solar array system to deliver high power generation capability for small satellite systems with extreme stowed volume constraints.  Establishing a functional solar array farm on the Martian surface to support manned missions shares many of the technical challenges and requirements of the small spacecraft, large deployable array problem.  LoadPath leveraged the findings of this previous effort with its extensive experience in devising and delivering numerous innovative deployable structural systems in the development of the leading concept for an META autonomous deploying terrestrial array.  In this Phase I effort, the conceptual design will be developed through a thorough engineering trade study of the required support components, culminating with a functional deployment demonstration with a fabricated prototype structure.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In 2010, the NASA Authorization Act and the U.S. National Space Policy drafted goals to send humans to Mars in the 2030s.  This direction resulted in renewed studies, specifically by the multidisciplinary Collaborative Modeling for Parametric Assessment of Space Systems (COMPASS) at NASA Glenn Research Center, to determine the required systems to support various potential manned mission scenarios.  To support manned operations, a large power generation capability, on the order of 40kW, is required with the ability to be modular, autonomous, and reconfigurable to respond to any mission design. The design trade study between solar versus fission power generation technology showed that, depending on the mission, the solar array option could be the more cost effective and mass efficient solution. <BR>The proposed META is an innovative deployable solar array technology that clearly responds to the subtopic, NASA missions, and NASA programmatic needs. As concluded in the numerous Mars mission design studies, there is a need to mature the notional concepts to determine if the requirements can be satisfied. Preliminary design efforts indicate that the META approach addresses all stated requirements with a feasible path towards meeting those goals.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to Mars terrestrial solar arrays, META has Earth terrestrial applications including austere military operations, remote industrial operations such as mining, disaster relief, and temporary or seasonal dwellings such as yurts.  During this SBIR effort we will focus on aerospace and military applications by engaging with Lockheed Martin. LoadPath has an existing working relationship with Lockheed Martin and will continually interact with them during the Phase I and Phase II efforts to assure a clear technology transition path. A Mars surface solar array alone is not a significant market; however, META's extended Earth terrestrial applications including military operations, mining, disaster relief, and portable consumer power products create a sufficient market to warrant the development investment.

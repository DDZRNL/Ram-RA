		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Our past success in developing what has proven to be a revolution in contamination control ? that of residue free, strippable polymer coatings for surface protection and cleaning has, so far, been limited use on substrates such as glass, fused silica and aluminum.  These are the types of surfaces found on flagship projects such as the LIGO Gravitational Wave Observatory, the 10 meter class WM Keck and the GTC Gran Canarias Telescopes and the optical and mirror surfaces of the National Rocket and Missile test program exemplified by programs at Vandenberg Air Force Base where extensive data has proven our technology.  However, significant hurdles exist in applying our stripcoat technology to other technologically important surfaces that are also important to NASA Programs.  Anomalous adhesion of our polymer films is seen on iron, steel, copper and nickel surfaces as well as numerous other materials.  Since the Starshade edges may be made of sharpened amorphous alloy or anodized black surfaces, the First Contact Polymer coatings that worked so well on JWST gold mirror surfaces and the projects above cannot be applied.<BR>Further, application and removal procedures and proof of principle metrology must be developed, verified and tested before use in the critical launch path of the Starshade.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We will develop a fast and easy method to make surfaces contamination free and ready for space across a platform of space mission, instruments and vehicles.<BR>At the end of Phase I, we will have demonstrated a polymer blend/solvent formulation with reduced adhesion on Nickel Iron Amorphous Alloy sheets and have a draft SOP for application and removal of the polymer formulations for the razor sharp Starshade edges.  Such results will set the stage for Phase II optimization and minimization of the adhesion on the amorphous alloy as well as on a variety of surfaces technologically important to NASA including stainless steel.  In phase II, effort will put into investigating the feasibility of strip coating removal upon deployment in space.  Further, we will begin investigations of application of the polymer system to 1) Developing optimized CNT Based ESD free and conductive films; 2) Use of the strip coatings we developed for maintaining and creating sterile and biological contamination free surfaces and 3) Proof of concept to procedural steps involved in cleaning up, sequestering and disposing of radioactive surface contamination.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercialization efforts in Phase III would revolve around the successful technological demonstration of either maintaining surface sterility or radiation cleanup or both.  Clear use and impacts in the medical, food and scientific and biotechnological communities are evident with creating and maintaining sterility.  Similarly, radiation cleanup will have applications with NASA, DOE, DOD and commercial operators in the nuclear industry.Successful demonstration of the utility of our application optimized polym

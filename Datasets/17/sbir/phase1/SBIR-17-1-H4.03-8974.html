		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The team has identified and is proposing a single sensor technology that targets the above requirements including readout capability. Our novel technology will utilize a proprietary 3D optical fabrication process and fabric combination for small form factors to achieve the required results. The sensor fabric will be developed so that it is mechanically equivalent with human skin to eliminate interfacial decoupling and allow accurate pressure readings. Multiple sensors will be integrated into a prototype and the flexible packaging will be where multiple sensors are integrated such that that they are compatible with attachment to human skin or the spacesuit comfort garments.<BR>By using a nanocomposite sensor approach, the team will maximize spatial resolution and accuracy at the same time minimize weight. A replaceable fabric approach will also be developed to address failure rates with component spares.

		The target size and budget of the technology is estimated to be more than $5 million per year. AMI expects to gain licensing opportunities for this product as well as license to manufacture agreements.  <BR><BR>- NASA Space Suit Sensors comprised in this proposal<BR>- Aerospace Boeing has supplied a letter of interest for this work. <BR>- Commercial All sensors are part of the rapidly growing Internet of Things (IOT). Haptic sensors are finding their way into many product applications, medical applications for surgery, and artificial limbs, touch pads in cell phones, sports equipment user diagnostics and human  robot interfaces.

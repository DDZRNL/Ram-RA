		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The innovation proposed is a method for the fabrication of a very low cost, very light weight large aperture Al10SiMg aluminum alloy mirror by the combination of three manufacturing processes.  1.  Additively manufactured mirror substrates as demonstrated in previous Phase 1 NASA SBIR S2.03-9125 with 0.2 mm contour accuracy.  2.  Precision robotic welding of hexagonal on-axis and hexagonal off-axis segments to produce a larger mirror. 3.  Large capacity diamond turning can produce any desired mirror aspheric contour to visible tolerances on the monolithic large mirror.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Extremely light weight medium aperture off-axis three mirror anastigmat (TMA) mirror optical components, collimator and telescope optical instruments. Extremely lightweight large off-axis mirrors for unobscured optical collimators and telescopes. On-axis hexagonal segments and off-axis hexagonal  aspheric optical mirrors can be assembled to enable very large telescopes.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Defense applications requiring mirror optical components for satellites and aerospace vehicles. Non-military applications such as weather satellite optical mirrors and commercial telescope optics. Commercial applications requiring light weight stiff optical components such as semiconductor<BR>manufacturing equipment.

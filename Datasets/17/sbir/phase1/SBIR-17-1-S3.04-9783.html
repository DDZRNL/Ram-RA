		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Recent efforts led by the PI of this proposal have studied the benefits of a satellite navigation technique known as Linked Autonomous Interplanetary Satellite Orbit Navigation (LiAISON). LiAISON makes it possible to achieve absolute, inertial navigation of two or more satellites using only relative satellite-to-satellite tracking data. LiAISON removes the need for ground tracking and permits a constellation to achieve autonomy with on-board navigation software. A good example of LiAISON involves one satellite traversing a libration orbit about the Earth-Moon L2 point (perhaps providing communication services to the lunar far-side) and another satellite traversing a low lunar orbit. The time-series of range data between the two satellites is unique in that it cannot be reproduced by any other two orbits. The uniqueness of these two orbits based on their relative position and/or velocity permits the estimation of the absolute positions of both spacecraft. Another example configuration places one satellite in a distant retrograde orbit about the Moon (a desirable orbit for many mission concepts including Orion, the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM), and various Mars sample return concepts) and a second satellite anywhere else in cislunar space. Numerous recent academic studies have shown that processing satellite-to-satellite tracking data for these vehicles yields absolute navigation states for both vehicles. Extensive academic studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this algorithm over the past 10 years. Advanced Space proposes to develop this innovative technology into a robust, expandable in-space navigation system, simulated through a representative real-time environment, positioning it for infusion into spaceflight missions. The resulting system lays the foundation for the proposed Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System (CAPS), which infuses the strength of LiAISON into an operational network.

		<BR>
		Advanced Space anticipates the LiAISON algorithm, used to create CAPS, will enable a rich operational environment for NASA missions within cislunar space as well as other environments where similar field geometries can be exploited to create a local positioning system. There will always be a connection between Earth ground stations and exploratory missions. However, in environments equipped with a LiAISON-based network, that connection is no longer required for navigational purposes. In cislunar space, the specialized CAPS system would help to create a vibrant ecosystem of spacecraft whose navigation would be conducted entirely on-board and autonomously, operating on and around the Moon using a LiAISON-enabled GPS-like beacon. By improving the navigational capabilities of spacecraft in highly dynamic environments, LiAISON will have applications in robotic servicing, formation flying, constellation management, astrometric alignment, and other areas. In particular, Advanced Space expects the LiAISON approach to significantly support the goals of the Science Mission Directorate in moving toward smaller, more challenging missions in the highly dynamic environments. Particular missions and efforts may include (but are not limited to) New Worlds Observer, Lunar ground operations and sample return, and the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM). LiAISON may permit missions that were previously impossible or not realistic without a regional positioning system to reference.

		<BR>
		Companies and agencies interested in constructing spacecraft systems to operate in dynamic environments will have immense interest in LiAISON and LiAISON-based networks. NASA, along with other government agencies and private entities such as ESA, JAXA, ULA, and Google Lunar X-Prize teams, already demand technologies that enable enhanced science measurement capabilities using smaller and lower-cost spacecraft to meet multiple mission requirements.

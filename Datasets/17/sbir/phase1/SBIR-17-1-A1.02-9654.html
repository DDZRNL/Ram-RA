		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Interdisciplinary Consulting Corporation (IC2) proposes the development of high channel count, high density, reduced cost per channel, directional microphone arrays for noise source measurement using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based piezoelectric microphones with backside contacts and advanced packaging technology.  The goal of this research is to develop an advanced phased-array technology to revolutionize array measurement capabilities through increases in array density and channel count while easing installation into wind-tunnels and significantly reducing cost per channel.  Specifically, this array technology will be developed to address NASA?s needs for acoustic and relevant flow field measurement methods for subsonic, transonic and supersonic vehicles targeted specifically at airframe noise sources and the noise sources due to the aerodynamic and acoustic interaction of airframe and engines, as per Subtopic A1.02 Quiet Performance - Airframe Noise Reduction of the NASA FY 2017 SBIR/STTR Solicitation.  This work is aimed at meeting the aerospace industrys need for economically viable array technology that meets required metrics.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed instrumentation technology has the potential to be transportable across multiple NASA facility classes as well as implemented across government-owned, industry and academic institution test facilities.  The target application for entry into NASA ATP is as wind tunnel instrumentation for phased-array beamforming to enable noise source localization.  In addition to wind-tunnel testing, the proposed microphone technology is also applicable for dynamic pressure measurements, in-flight acoustic measurements, and static engine testing. The proposed innovation is applicable to NASA LaRCs 14x22 Subsonic Wind Tunnel for advanced phased array measurements of fixed- and rotary-wing civil and military aircraft over a wide range of takeoff, landing, cruise and high angle-of-attack conditions. The Structural Acoustics Branch at LaRC would also benefit from support to the Acoustics Research Laboratorys 20x24x30 anechoic quiet-flow facility and aircraft sidewall noise transmission measurement facility.  The measurement capabilities would also help support LaRCs Aeroacoustics Branch by supplying validation of simulation of the Rotorcraft, the Subsonic Fixed Wing, and the Supersonic Projects.<BR><BR>Additionally, wind tunnel test facilities at GRC and Ames will benefit from this microphone/array technology (as microphones and/or dynamic pressure sensors arrays).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed instrumentation technology has the potential to be implemented across government-owned, industry and academic institution test facilities. The target market is instrumentation and measurement microphones and arrays for the aerospace industry. The target application is as wind tunnel instrumentation for phased-array beamforming to enable noise source localization. In addition to wind-tunnel testing, the proposed microphone technology is also applicable to the types of technological solutions sought for pressure measurements and focusing acoustic measurements that can be used in a flight-test tunnel environment and ground test instrumentation for static engine<BR>testing. The primary characteristic of this market is the need for high performance measurements with relatively low volume requirements. Ultimately, the cost per unit and size constraints of existing technologies limit the array size and density below customer desired levels. IC2 seeks to change that dynamic via microphones with reduced size and complexity, at drastically lower cost (roughly an order of magnitude), enabling vastly larger, affordable arrays of higher density. Furthermore, we achieve those goals while meeting individual microphone performance requirements,leading to potentially game-changing improvements in array performance.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		For future advanced terrestrial balloon missions, NASA requires energy dense and power dense energy storage solutions significantly exceeding the performance of state of art Li ion batteries. The requirements for a typical 100 day mission are for a 28V system capable of providing wide power demand of 100 W minimum to 2 kW peak. Lynntech proposes to design a battery system with energy density in excess of 400 Wh/kg and power density in excess of 1,000 W/kg for the terrestrial balloon application, based on its advanced Li ion or Li-S battery technologies. The Phase I project will involve further improvements of Lynntech's battery technologies for improving the energy density and power density numbers followed by selection and optimization of the most promising option among these two technologies. A 2 kWh scale battery prototype design will be developed at the end of the Phase I project that can provide the target energy and power density as well as cycling stability for the terrestrial balloon application. The Phase II project will work on fabrication and demonstration of the battery technology at relevant scale.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed lithium ion batteries with high energy density and high power density will find use in multiple NASA applications such as satellites or orbiters (LEO, GEO, HEO and planetary), astronaut equipments,  EVA suites, crew exploration vehicles, landers, planetary probes, rovers etc.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Apart from the desired space applications, the proposed Li ion batteries will also find military applications such as soldier power, communication systems, weapons systems, remote sensors, detection devices, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Specific benefits for DOD include extended duration missions and improved capabilities. Private sector applications include electric and plug in hybrid electric vehicles, auxiliary power units, and consumer electronic devices.

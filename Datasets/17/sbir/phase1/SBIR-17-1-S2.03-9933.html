		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Using technology spun out from Sandia National Laboratories, Goodman Technologies LLC with our Small Business and Minority Institution partners (Team GTL) has demonstrated the feasibility of 3D printed metals and ceramics for low areal cost, ultra-lightweight mirrors and structures.  Our technology development roadmap shows production of the first meter-class mirror segments in time for the 2020 Decadal Survey. Our 1.5-meter hexagonal silicon carbide segments will meet or exceed all NASA requirements for the primary mirror of a FIR Surveyor such as the Origins Space Telescope (OST), and may also provide a solution for the LUVOIR Surveyor.  Our analysis and internal research and development show that we will achieve an areal density of 7.75 kg/m2, a cost to print of $60K/segment, and an optical surface that has nanometer-scale tolerances.  Our encapsulated lattice construction provides a uniform CTE throughout the part for dimensional stability, incredible specific stiffness, and the added benefit of cryo-damping. Our process will also allow for direct embedding of electronics for active structures and segments, and the potential for actively cooling with helium for unprecedented low emissivity and thermal control. Finally, the particulate paste extrusion process may be very suitable for printing mirrors in the zero gravity of space.

		The ultimate goal of the proposed Phase I and Phase II SBIR projects is to demonstrate manufacturing processes for 3D printing low areal cost, ultra-lightweight mirrors and structures, and then sell these products to the Government and Systems Integrators in Phase III. <BR><BR>The NASA Astrophysics Division Roadmap Enduring Quests - Daring Visions builds on the 2010 Decadal Survey and includes near-term, formative (10-20 years - notional Surveyor missions) and visionary (20+ years - notional Mapper missions). Assuming a 20-m aperture Far-Infrared Surveyor (Origins Space Telescope), a 16-m aperture LUVOIR Surveyor, and 500 m2 collection area for the ExoEarth Mapper, then at least 1015 m2 of mirrors are required by NASA in the next 30 years. At the NASA target price of $100K/m2 this represents a marketplace totaling over $101M.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Low cost, lightweight, dimensionally stable mirrors have use in complex telescopes for Astronomy, Imaging and Remote Sensing applications, including optical instruments/telescopes which enable imaging, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions for police and paramilitary units, fire fighters, power and pipeline monitoring, search and rescue, atmospheric and ocean monitoring, imagery and mapping for resource management, and disaster relief and communications. The dual-use nature of complex telescopes will bring affordability to national defense missions such as airborne, shipborne and land-based lasers as well.

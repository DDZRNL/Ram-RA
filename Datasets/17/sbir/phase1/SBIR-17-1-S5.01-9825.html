		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The goal of this project is to refactor NASA's FUN3D computation fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation code to enable it to take full advantage of accelerator hardware available on modern hybrid computing environments. We will rearchitect FUN3D to take advantage of HPC tools we are currently building for NASA Goddard, using a dynamically-scheduled, task-based approach, with the goals of improving scalability, performance on the CPU, and the amenability to accelerators current and future. In Phase I, the focus will be on proving the validity and applicability of our approach for a given subset of FUN3D code. To meet this goal, we have identified two primary objectives for Phase I: rearchitect FUN3D and develop a prototype demonstrating feasibility. This will decouple the science being performed from the intricacies of implementations on a variety of platforms. In Phase II, we will build off this work to create a full accelerated solver for ongoing use. Once complete, the full solver will be efficient on today's hardware and easily adaptable to future systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		FUN3D is mission-critical software, and is used to analyze many types of air vehicles. The code developed in this project will be integrated back into the core FUN3D codebase, benefiting FUN3D users directly. Our intention is that the work in this project will result in sufficient commercial opportunities for continued development after completion of the SBIR program.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		We have identified two main channels for commercialization of this technology, through direct consulting and by working with partner companies. Consulting will be performed by continuing to tailor our solution to a client's needs. We have specifically identified users of this software at commercial and other government organizations who have expressed interest in our approach. We will engage them during the project to ensure a successful commercial transition.

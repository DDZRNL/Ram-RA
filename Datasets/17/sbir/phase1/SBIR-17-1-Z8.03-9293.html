		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In response to NASA's need for compact, lightweight and efficient, low-cost deployable radiators for CubeSats, Roccor proposes to develop a high-strain laminate composite deployable radiator capable of dissipating over 50-watts of thermal energy. The proposed design leverages Roccor's experience in high-strain composite deployable structures and thermal management products for CubeSat and SmallSat applications. While solar arrays and instrument capabilities in CubeSat applications keep growing, the limited radiator surface results in a thermal bottleneck that limits the actual use of science or communication instruments. State-of-the-art deployable radiators use multiple rigid panels connected by a flexible hinge, replicating designs used in large space structures. However, the miniaturization of such designs have proven incapable of meeting the tight mass and volume constraints of CubeSat applications. Roccor proposes to utilize a novel packaging of large surface areas, made of highly conductive materials, and with enough strain energy to deploy passively in a radial arrangement.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Roccor will maintain constant engagement with NASA centers in order to identify missions with thermal bottle necks, which could benefit from having additional power dissipation capabilities through extended surfaces. The primary target application is future NASA CubeSat and SmallSat spacecraft in which the surface area available for thermal dissipation has become the design bottleneck.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Over the past year Roccor has been collaborating with Morehead State University on opportunities for integrating Roccor's thermal management products into MSU's 6U common bus for scientific missions. In addition, Roccor has been in contact with commercial CubeSat or SmallSat developers who are reaching the thermal design limits for the significant processing or power dissipation of the designs.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We have designed an UAS and aircraft extended communication network to cover the critical low altitude national tracking gap from the ground to 3000ft in the FAA?s NextGen. Our no-Gap ADS-B network design is nationally scalable and offers interoperability with the deployed national network. Our design does not need expensive infrastructure, it is modular for on-location demand yet is nationally scalable, so will cost far less than existing solutions. <BR><BR>Our FAA approved secure weather data network design will be extended to provide secure UAS & aircraft traffic data.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA?s Aero Aviation Programs operate many UASs, LaRC has a Cirrus SR-22 research aircraft to simulate autonomous UAS flight, other research UASs, e.g., AFRC?s Ikhana collects atmospheric data. Most NASA UAS program can use our technology to set up their custom UAS site with ADS-B transition capability. The network platform design will allow interfaces to NASA?s SSA software for their and ground control stations, simulator and its other NextGen R&D labs.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The FAA requires ADS-B for all US aircraft & drones flying in controlled airspace by 2020.<BR>The Total Available Market is over 10,000 small airports and UAS launch sites: agricultural, pipeline patrol, natural resources etc. <BR>We have strong interest from a weather sensors company and have discussed network development for commercialization with Google and Amazon.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Augmented Reality systems come with many benefits derived by co-locating information with a user's environment through the use of one or more output modalities such as visual, auditory and tactile. In the case of future human spaceflight programs involving deep space missions, the ground operations infrastructure currently utilized for support of LEO missions will be less accessible or unavailable. This will place far higher emphasis on the importance of automated and intelligent tools for tasking, advising, and monitoring autonomous crew activity.  Augmented Reality systems will play a key role in achieving crew autonomy. With this fusion of real and virtual perception, however, comes challenges to ensure that the information is presented in a way that the user can effective consume it meet the goals of the situation.<BR>The proposed innovation is a configurable and extensible Augmented Reality Adaptable Information Manager (AR-AIM) that provides an infrastructure for integration of disparate sensor inputs, task definitions, consideration factors, prioritization algorithms, and output modalities to achieve adaptive augmented reality.  Specifically, it will include a diverse combination of capabilities needed to make user interfaces that dynamically change to increase user precision and reduce stress on the user caused by the system. By being implemented as a reusable library, the AR-AIM controller suite can be leveraged across many systems, use cases, and domains.  Features will include:<BR><BR>-	FOV Management<BR>-	Occlusion Engine <BR>-	Optimal Text Placement <BR>-	Complexity Scaling <BR>-	Multiple Modality Support <BR>-	Data Interfaces <BR>-	User Contextual Adaptations<BR>-	Stress predictor <BR>-	Multi-user Integration

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		METECS sees opportunity to infuse this technology into existing and new projects within NASA.  <BR><BR>Model-based Simulations - The simulation and graphics branch of SRSD at Johnson Space Center develops a variety of analytical and human-in-the-loop model-based simulations for training, analysis and mission development purposes. Additionally, METECS sees benefit in applying the techniques used in our commercial simulation projects to NASA simulation projects and the development of the adaptive AR capability described in this SBIR would support that.<BR><BR>Avionics Integration Facilities and mREST - METECS is involved in orchestration of several avionics integration facilities.  One of our main contributions in that area is the orchestration infrastructure mREST.  This software collects data from disparate test equipment and model-based simulations to enable data fusion and incorporation of data from multiple sources for integrated control and display. Because the underlying technology of the software is web-services based, this information is typically (but not always) displayed in a web-browser on fixed desktop computers or laptops.<BR><BR>Logistics Management - METECS is a member of the RFID-Enabled Autonomous Logistics Management (REALM) team.  We believe there are both short and long term opportunities for METECS to infuse this technology into our work in those areas.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		An immediate application of this technology will be to support our ongoing VR and AR based initiatives in the construction and agricultural industries.  We have already been incorporating augmented reality technologies into our commercial projects, however, we desire a better infrastructure for addressing the issues described in this proposal. Our aim will be to infuse this technology into our commercial efforts as soon as possible which we believe will result in a positive impact on our revenue growth.We believe that an infrastructure such as the one we propose will contribute to future development of new capabilities by:<BR><BR>o	Improving the quality of the AR experience through incorporation of adaptive AR capabilities<BR>o	Reduce development time by decreasing time spent adjusting AR modalities and displays in ad-hoc ways to accommodate sometimes conflicting requirements<BR>o	Promote reuse of common infrastructure code base across a wider variety of AR applications.<BR><BR>Specific projects that will be early candidates for this technology will include:<BR><BR>-	Our Human-in-the-loop simulators for operation of agricultural and construction equipment<BR><BR>-	Augmented technology within virtual environment simulators<BR><BR>-       OEM development of AR applications for field operation of underground construction equipment

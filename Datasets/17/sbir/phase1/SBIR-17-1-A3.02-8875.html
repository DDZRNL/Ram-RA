		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		ASC has tested the LIDAR in diverse weather conditions (rain and fog) and has created landing maps, but has not done the two simultaneously.  A number of algorithms for landing site evaluation have been developed, but none of those algorithms have been evaluated for adverse weather conditions.  This effort will allow for the acquisition of data and the evaluation of algorithms, so that the architecture for a Phase II prototype can be developed for use in diverse weather conditions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This sensor will increase the success of NASA operations such as:<BR>Rover Mobility and Navigation <BR>Topographical Mapping <BR>Mars Landed Exploration <BR>Exploration of Moons (ALHAT, Jupiter Icy Moons) <BR>Asteroid and Comet Rendezvous and Sample Return <BR>ISS Rendezvous and Docking (*Figure 19) <BR>Space Situational Awareness <BR>Rock Abundance and Distribution Maps
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications include collision avoidance to save pedestrians and prevent vehicle damage, Mid-Air Refueling, Surveillance, Terrain Mapping, Autonomous Navigation for unmanned ground, air and surface vehicles.  The 3D maps created by the system will be useful to avoid automobile accidents and guide robots for Hazard Material Detection and Handling.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A small deployable antenna is proposed with an offset-fed paraboloidal reflector for use between 8 and 100 GHz in CubeSat, NanoSat, and SmallSat applications. Apertures vary from 0.5 to 2 meters. For a 0.5 m aperture, the approximate dimensions of the stowed reflector are 6 cm in diameter and 8.86 cm in length, with an approximate mass of 0.25 kg. For a 1.2 m aperture, the approximate dimensions of the stowed reflector are 14.4 cm in diameter and 21.26 cm in length, with an approximate mass of 0.6 kg. For a 2 m aperture, the approximate dimensions of the stowed reflector are 24 cm in diameter and 35.4 cm in length, with an approximate mass of 1 kg. This antenna design builds off the proven mission success of similar designs while remaining competitive in performance with smaller deployable antennas. The stowed volume of this antenna is comparable to the volume of the KaDPA antenna developed by JPL, while providing a potential increase in the antenna efficiency due to the advantages of an offset-fed design compared to its center-fed counterpart. During Phase I, a preliminary design of this antenna system will be developed, as well as its deployment and testing procedures will proposed.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA spaceborne instruments will benefit from the development of this new antenna technology. The demonstration of the prototype built during the Phase II of the project will prove the deployable antenna concept and open new possibilities in design for space remote sensors, either active or passive. The technological trend is moving towards the smaller and less expensive satellites and this project is one of many significant steps towards making such systems economical and competitive.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Private markets are investing in Earth observations and many smaller nations are looking to develop their EO small satellite constellations with remote sensors. The primary market for these deployable antennas is weather forecasting systems.<BR>Over the next decade, 419 Earth observing satellites are expected to be launched generating $35.5 billion in manufacturing revenues. Significant growth in the number of commercial satellites launched in constellation is expected. <BR>The successful demonstration of the antenna prototype operation and its characterization in laboratory conditions, will open the door to rapidly developing markets of small satellites for active or passive microwave remote sensing.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In recent years, Type-II superlattices have experienced significant development. However, the full potential of Type-II superlattice has not been fully explored and alternate superlattice architectures hold great promise. Despite demonstration of SWIR photodetectors based on this material system, there has been no report about Type-II superlattice-based photodetectors that have been sensitive to visible light. We propose to develop Type-II superlattice-based photodetectors and focal plane arrays for NASA's imaging and spectroscopy applications in the spectral band from visible to extended short-wavelength infrared (0.4 - 2.5 um) with a very low dark current density. In mid- and long-wavelength infrared spectral bands, Type-II superlattice-based photodetectors already offers performance comparable to the state-of-the-art mercury cadmium telluride but at a fraction of the cost due to the leveraging of commercial growth and process equipment. Our goal is to extend that benefit into the short-wavelength infrared. Using the best material currently available and a novel bandgap-engineering design and process, we will fabricate photodetectors and, ultimately, focal plane arrays. <BR><BR>In Phase I, we are going to demonstrate photodetector designs based on Type-II superlattices, which can cover spectral range between 0.4 to 2.5 um with a very low dark current density (<10^-11 A/cm2) at temperatures below 100 K.. In Phase II, we are going to continue reduction of the dark current density to <10^-13 A/cm^2 -level at temperatures below 100K. Then, we will use the optimized device design to develop and deliver 1Kx1K imagers to NASA for planetary sciences.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Visible-SWIR photodetectors are of special interest to NASA for planetary observation missions. The Visible-SWIR imagers can be used to study the world's ecosystems and provide critical information on natural disasters such as volcanoes, wildfires and drought. Visible-SWIR imaging will be able to identify the type of vegetation that is present and whether the vegetation is healthy. It can provide a benchmark on the state of the worlds ecosystems against which future changes can be assessed. Moreover this imaging method can assess the pre-eruptive behavior of volcanoes and the likelihood of future eruptions as well as the carbon and other gases released from wildfires. The data from Visible-SWIR imagers can be used for a wide variety of studies primarily in the Carbon Cycle and Ecosystem and Earth Surface and Interior focus areas. <BR><BR>The large-format Visible-SWIR cameras, with ultra-low dark current, we will be developing and delivering in Phase II of this program will be able to provide high resolution mapping of planetary bodies.

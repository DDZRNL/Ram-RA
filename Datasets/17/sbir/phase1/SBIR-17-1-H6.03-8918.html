		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this proposal, Cybernet proposes to leverage our distributed Procedure Execution and Projection (PEP) system that focuses on supporting automation of complex spacecraft, subsystem, maintenance, and consumables management procedures while ensuring crew situational awareness and anticipating future problems. The PEP system will provide the capability to:<BR>?	Work in a dynamic collaborative manner with crew to execute procedures,<BR>?	Dynamically offload and re-assume tasking from automation,<BR>?	Autonomously offload tasking from crew based on the system?s initiative when perceiving that the crew member is overloaded or otherwise requires assistance,<BR>?	Project forward in the task execution to look for potential problems and develop contingencies,<BR>?	Ensure crew situational awareness even during complete automation handoff,<BR>?	Work on multiple procedures at the same time while detecting procedure conflicts (such as for limited resources)
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed cognitive architecture can support crews without communication with or support from ground based personnel. Therefore, it will be directly applicable to long duration missions or missions with poor or slow communications (such as dark side of moon, Mars, etc.).
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Similar autonomous management technology could be implemented on Navy vessels, which also seek to reduce manpower while expanding capabilities. Also will support procedure execution of manned/unmanned teaming in autonomous robotics. This will directly support commercial applications of autonomous material handling systems working in coordination with human personnel.

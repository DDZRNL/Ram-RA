		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		CRG proposes to advance smallsat and cubesat deployable components enabling CRG's electrically activated shape memory polymer (EASMP) to transition a rigid component with characteristics representing a thermoset into lower modulus state as an elastomer for flexibility. This switch will be capable with a single momentary electrical activation. This bi-stable solution will allow for a lightweight, compact, and controlled solution of deployment for multiple smallsat components such as latches, hinges, reflectors, booms, etc. This technology will not be limited by mission size or application, it is capable of scalability for a large range of applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Supporting NASA's materials and structures capabilities, this project's technologies directly address requirements for smallsat and cubesat components.  The proposed technologies offer deployable components at a fraction of the weight and complexity. Through this project, tailoring EASMP for space applications opens a new frontier for novel material applications for various space systems such as, but not limited to; deployable solar arrays, deployable antennas, micro-actuators, variable vibration dampening structures, and tunable signal cancellation panels. Other NASA applications may benefit from the material's ability to stay flexible and soft below -100 deg.C, such as seals, couplings, or dampers.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This project's technologies, developed for NASA systems, would directly apply to systems operated by other government and commercial enterprises. Government systems that would derive the same benefits would include deployable composites for satellites operated by the Department of Defense, Department of Interior's EROS, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Federal Aviation Administration. This technology's attributes for tunable composite modulus should yield a high potential for private sector commercialization for various space materials and systems for companies such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Sierra Nevada, SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, and many more.

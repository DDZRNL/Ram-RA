		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The main objective of the proposed work is to develop a robust and effective sample acquisition system for the Europa lander called the Europa Drum Sampler (EDuS).  The proposed drum sampling system is based on a terrestrial roadheader design and includes a Thwacker that generates percussive vibrations during rotary excavation.  <BR><BR>All components will be designed to withstand Dry Heat Microbial Reduction as well as Planetary Protection requirements.  The EDuS' structural components include a support boom, a buffer plate, and a cutter head.  The support boom is hollow and its position and length can be adjusted depending on the required excavation depth and volume on the lander.  For launch, the boom will be compressed and then spring-extended upon landing.  A spring loaded boom has an added advantage of mitigating Thwacker vibrations to the Robotic Arm.  The buffer plate is also a structural member whose main purpose is to prevent chips from falling out.  <BR><BR>The cuter head is the central part of the system.  The cutter head has been designed in the shape of a typical cylindrical pressure vessel.  The teeth are placed on all rotating surfaces, including the convex sides. This shape can deal with a range of surface topographies from flat to very jagged.  The teeth are very sharp to reduce cutting forces and are made of carbide to increase longevity.  The cutter head also includes a ring of teeth which make up the Thwacker Ratchet.  Thwacking will reduce cutting forces and aid in sample delivery.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The near term application includes NASA's Flagship-class Europa Clipper mission and in particular its lander that requires a sampling system. This SBIR funded technology would transition very well into the actual mission. Europa lander will launch in approximately 2024. This Phase 1 work would end in December of 2017, while the Phase 2 work (TRL6) would end in Dec of 2019. Thus, at the end of 2019 with at least 5 years before the actual launch, the TRL6 sampling system or critical subsystems of the sampling system deemed important by the Europa team could be infused into the actual mission.<BR>Other NASA missions that could include this sampling system (or certain subsystems of this sampling system) include: 1. Discovery-class missions to icy-bodies, including Mars; 2. New Frontiers class missions such as Comet Nucleus Surface Sample Return, Lunar South Pole Aitken Basin Sample Return, Venus In Situ Explorer; 3. In the Flagship class category, in addition to the Clipper mission, another mission that could use the sampling system includes the second mission in the Mars Sample Return Program - Mars Ascent Vehicle. It is prudent to have a backup sampling system adjacent to the MAV.<BR>In the HEOMD directorate, In Situ Resource Utilization missions to Mars, asteroids, or the Moon, such as Asteroid Redirect Robotic or Crew Mission (ARRM, ARCM) or Resource Prospector Mission could use this technology.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The sampling technology system could be used by several commercial companies that are interested in mining and in-situ resource utilization for financial gain. These include Planetary Resources, Inc. and Deep Space Industries, Inc., targeting asteroids and Shackleton Energy Corp, targeting the Moon. <BR><BR>The ultimate goal of SpaceX is to establish human presence on Mars. As such, SpaceX would also benefit from mature sampling and mining technologies.<BR>Other non-NASA applications include robotic acquisition of volatiles as well as soil and liquid samples from hazardous environments - chemical spills, nuclear waste, oil spills. Examples include samples from nuclear waste sites as well as disaster sites (Fukushima nuclear reactor).

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Phase I STTR project will develop an ignition system for a high density hybrid rocket motor using non-toxic, storable, ionic liquid oxidizers and high density polymer fuels.   The program will also research fuel additives to boost ISP and fuel regression rate of the high density, high regression ate fuel..   This high density propulsion system resolves one of the chief drawbacks of hybrid rockets, the poor volumetric efficiency, by matching the volumetric performance of solid propellants.  This STTR program will develop a non pyrotechnic electrocatalytic ignition system for the ionic liquid oxidizers that may also enable multistart operation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This program is designed for insertion into the nanolaunch1200 luancher program, consistent with program plans for small business and university technology infusion.  Hybrid rocket motors with non-toxic, storable oxidizers offer the potential for dramatic cost reduction for launch and upper stage propulsion compared to solid rocket motor and cryogenic or other bipropellant systems.   For upper stage precision systems, the throttling capability enables a standard system to be deployed for greatly reduced cost.  BThe green propellant system is storable and handleable without bunny suits or special precautions, such that upper stages can be preloaded and shipped using commercial transport, eliminating a significant amount of the propellant handling costs and precautions.   The reduced size of the high density hybrid allows hybrid motors to be efficiently packaged, and reduce parasitic mass and cost, increasing propellant mass fraction.    This program specifically uses the black brandt X nanosat launcher PSRM-30 and PSRM-120 stages as reference stages.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Successful development of a compact, green hybrid motor can reduce costs and logistics challenges for commercial space access, as well as for insensitive/inherently safe propulsion systems for national defense missile systems.   A hybrid with the volumetric performance of a solid propellant, and the control and throttleability of a liquid system resolves numerous cost and performance issues in rocket propulsion systems.

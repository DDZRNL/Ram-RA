		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		QuesTek Innovations, a pioneer in Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) and a Tibbetts Award recipient, is teaming with University of Pittsburgh, proposing to expand their Materials by Design technology and develop the essential ICME technologies that help optimize the additive manufacturing (AM) process of Inconel Alloy718. One of the biggest hurdles to the adoption of AM of metals is the qualification of additively manufactured parts while currently available systems are based largely on hand-tuned parameters determined by trial-and-error for a limited set of materials with significant uncertainty. A comprehensive ICME approach is needed to address this issue by modeling the process-structure-property chain to predict performance of AM parts. We propose to improve state-of-the-art modeling for AM by coupling FEM codes with materials phase transformation and precipitation simulation software. The Phase I focus on determining the ICME framework architecture and identifying the necessary models as building blocks, as well as key data and experiments for calibration and validation. The resulted ICME tools will enable engineers to develop efficient machines and to optimize and certify AM process and materials, with greatly reduced time, cost, uncertainty, and risk and improved reliability, confidence, and quality assurance.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The software developed in this program would apply to a wide range of NASA applications, specifically for platforms that utilize components made of alloy 718 and the associated manufacturing supply chain that would aim to integrate additive manufacturing technologies. These include high temperature applications where strength, creep resistance, and cracking resistance in welds is of benefit. Specific components where additive manufacturing of 718 can bring value to the supply chain are rocket engine and turbine components such as disks, combustion chambers, bolts, casings, shafts, housings and fasteners. The significance of a software tool that can model the additive process and bring reliability to AM 718 parts is seen in the high level of structural integrity and performance required by flight- and mission-critical components.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Additive manufacturing processes are being integrated into the manufacturing pathways of a wide range of industries. Industries with high temperature applications where alloy 718 is used, and in which companies are either producing components with additive manufacturing or integrating additive processes, include the commercial space, aerospace, industrial and automotive industries. The commercial space industry applications would be identical to the NASA applications outlined in the previous section. For the aerospace industry, key applications focus on jet engine components including supporting structures, airfoils, blades, sheets, discs, rotating parts and other components that are either being built with additive processes or would be considered for additive with the knowledge gained from the proposed software technology under this program. Industrial applications include gas turbine components similar to those aforementioned.

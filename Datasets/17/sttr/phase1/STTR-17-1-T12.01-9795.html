		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Structural degradation and failure can cause malfunctions and long-term problems aboard spacecraft,  jeopardizing the crew, especially in deep space missions. On Off-world habitats, this can lead to extensive maintenance procedures and dangerous EVAs to fix malfunctions. Micrometeorite impact and shielding breaches can have lasting impacts that pose a significant hazard to the longevity of missions. Made In Space, Inc. (MIS) has been developing novel additive manufacturing (AM) technologies for the production and application of embedded sensors and actuators. MIS's Structural-Health Aware Failure-Tolerant Engineered to Respond (SAFER) Additively Manufactured System is a suite of integrated technologies and composite materials that are compatible with AM processing techniques ranging from Free-Form-Fabrication, Direct-Write, and injection molding. Using the advanced AM technologies developed for microgravity manufacturing at MIS and piezoelectric thermoplastics provided by the Ohio State University (OSU), a major suite of structural monitoring and sensing technologies will be made available to designers for a variety of applications. The SAFER Additive Manufactured System will include a suite of AM solutions for the following applications: embedded strain-sensors for health monitoring and diagnosis; piezoelectric actuators and sensors for system prognosis; and embedded heaters and actuators for system self-healing and increased rigidity. SAFER embedded systems empower designers to cut weight of structural monitoring and increase structural safety with the freedom of AM. With the development of a novel piezoelectric AM material, SAFER will be a key component to safe long-duration manned space flight such as NASA's Journey to Mars and beyond. SAFER gives NASA peace of mind by coupling health-monitoring and self-repairing materials.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are a number of NASA applications for SAFER, including:<BR>- Active support structures for imaging telescopes - Piezoelectric solenoids enable active optical systems. As part of Phase I, 3D printable piezoelectrics are developed, thereby enabling optimized construction of active optical backplanes.<BR>- Resilient backbone structures for long duration human spaceflight missions.<BR>- Active monitoring and reinforcement of spacecraft deployed for long durations in extraterrestrial locations<BR>- Active monitoring and repair/reinforcement of space launch vehicle structure, enabling portions of the structure to be reinforced if weakened, thereby increasing mission resilience.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are a number of applications by other government agencies, including:<BR>- Vehicles having integrated structural health monitoring and repair/reinforcement, including planes, boats, small submarines such as the SEAL Delivery Vehicle. <BR>- Actively monitored and reinforced pressure vessels and containment vessels.<BR>There are a number of potential commercial applications of SAF3R, including:<BR>- 3D printable piezoelectric material enables piezoelectric microphones, speakers, inkjet printer pumps, motors sensors, fuses, strain gauges, and the like.<BR>- SAFER cars - SAFER can be integrated into future vehicles to provide an even greater level of systems monitoring than currently exists in motor vehicles. The addition of SAFER?s repair/reinforcement abilities is functionality that currently does not exist in the market.

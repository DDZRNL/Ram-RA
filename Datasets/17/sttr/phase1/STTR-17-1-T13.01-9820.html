		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is looking for advanced sensor technologies, especially wireless embedded sensor systems, to support rocket propulsion development. The enabling technology should provide a highly flexible instrumentation solution capable of monitoring remote or inaccessible measurement locations. This sensor system should substantially reduce operational costs and evolutionary improvements in ground, launch and flight system operational robustness. It should provide an advanced diagnostics capability to monitor test facility parameters including temperature, pressure, strain and near-field acoustics. To address this critical need, X-wave Innovations, Inc. (XII) and Prof. Fang Li from New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) propose an innovative passive, wireless, high temperature embedded sensor system that is capable of providing high-bandwidth measurements of temperature, pressure and strain on both rotating and non-rotating propulsion engine components. For the Phase I program, XII will prototype a embedded sensor system and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technique for passive, wireless, multi-parameter measurements. For the Phase II program, XII will focus on refining the prototype system design and development with improved hardware and software. For the Phase III program, XII will focus on optimizing the prototype performance and collaborating with our commercial partners to package the sensor technology into a commercially-available system.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has great interest in embedded sensor system with wireless data communication capabilities for a variety of applications, from ground testing, to flight testing, to in-service monitoring, etc. The proposed passive, wireless, high-temperature embedded sensor system provide a highly flexible instrumentation solution to monitor remote or inaccessible measurement locations for NASA's rocket propulsion test facilities.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed wireless sensor system has many market applications in different industries such as exploration, defense, aviation, and civil and environmental engineering sectors. Other government agencies, including DOD, DOE, DOT will benefit from this technology. Passive, wireless, embedded sensor technologies for SHM and other applications are constantly being sought in many markets, especially those that require continuous monitoring of large infrastructures.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This project evaluates automated tape placement (ATP) processing of thin ply composites, including process and design modeling, test panel fabrication and mechanical performance evaluation. Key to successful transition of standard ply to thin ply ATP processing is the ability to fabricate uniform high fiber volume and fiber distribution composite parts with below 1% void content. Our ATP robotic system will be adapted to handle thin ply materials, including accurate placement and consolidation to minimize potential defects (adjacent tape gaps creating voids, non-uniform compaction of plies, etc.). Existing modeling of the placement process at our academic partner will support hardware optimization. Coupon fabrication and testing will provide validation of the process to produce high quality parts and initiate the development of a property database (microstructure, mechanical performance, etc.).
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has interest in applying thin ply technology in various programs including the Composite Cryotank Technologies and Demonstration (CCTD) project. The Boeing Company was contracted to design, analyze, and manufacture the large composite cryotanks for testing at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. An automated placement system was utilized to place thick and thin prepreg plies with final consolidation using out-of-autoclave processing (OOA). The approach has the potential to reduce cost by 25% and weight by 30 percent compared to existing aluminum-lithium propellant tanks.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The general approach and specific technologies developed in this STTR can also be applied to other military platforms and commercial applications (aerospace, automotive, wind etc). These applications may require additional material testing and R&D to meet certifications and particular application requirements.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		TSRCo and CU are developing a framework to quantify and predict crew performance in various spacecraft designs in the context of the design process. The framework utilizes an elemental resource breakdown approach to relate the crew, the spacecraft design, and operations.  The elements identified in the breakdown correspond to existing measures currently used in the physiological, cognitive, and psychological fields. This novel integration of currently existing metrics allows for the quantification of specific crew resource elements over the mission timeline and an in-depth analysis of the impacts caused by various spacecraft design choices.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		As one of the first comprehensive crew performance models, this technology has far reaching applications in areas where complex system design need to be analyzed for human factor impacts. The merits of this particular framework and model is that it ties together existing data that scientist already understand and use for their research. As the model evolves and becomes more sophisticated, additional layers of analysis can be done to extract user behavior. The data can be fed back to the model design and identify areas for improvement and add efficiencies. This is relevant to NASA, its subcontractors for spacecraft development (Lockheed, Boeing, SpaceX, Orbital), but also relevant to those companies developing their own human-rated space vehicles (Blue Origin, Bigelow, SNC, XCorp etc.)
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This application is intended for other government agencies that have complex systems with human users and have a need for tracking the quality of human performance. This ranges from military combat situations, to polar expeditions, to operators of complex systems (nuclear power plant, submarines, emergency services etc.). <BR><BR>Other potential applications are industries that have an increase of robotic or machine equipment designed to interact with human operators. For example, production line facilities for manufacturing and assembly of consumer goods often have mechanized robotics which interface with an operator. The model developed here can help guide designers of the production line in finding optimized layouts and architecture for ensuring work flow efficiency and safety of their workers.

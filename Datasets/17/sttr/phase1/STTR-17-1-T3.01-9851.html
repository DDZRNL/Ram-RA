		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA has identified the need to increase availability of Power as a Top Technical Challenge. This STTR proposal suggests novel approaches for the wireless energy transmission for use by satellite, spacecraft in orbit, or by space habitats. NASA?s planned earth orbiting spacecraft, planetary spacecraft, Cube Sats, Small Sats, balloons, aircraft, surface assets, and marine craft and UAVs as observation platforms can benefit from such successful wireless energy transmission technology. The advanced power transmission technology and receiving concepts proposed are based on the principles and system design for Aperiodic HF EM waves based power transfer, which are not absorbed by dense matter, including organic matter and water. The success in this STTR would enable and enhance the capabilities of NASA mission hardware and offer operational flexibilities with significant savings in the overall costs along with the weight savings due to reduction in needed harness weight.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA Applications: Many NASA science missions, avionics and terrestrial systems, including satellites, aircrafts, balloons and unmanned areal vehicles, could benefit from the developed Aperiodic HF energy transmitting systems. Success in this proposed energy transmitting concept with low mass may open up power availability needs of many NASA missions due to the appeal of a lightweight device technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		DOD Applications: Many DOD space and avionics systems, including communications and navigation satellites, could benefit from increased availability of power in wireless manner. The unique low mass Aperiodic HF Transmitting system design that can provide reliable power for the mission needs has appeal of weight savings.<BR>Commercial Applications: Space, avionics, and terrestrial commercial systems, including satellites, aircrafts, unmanned air vehicles, and surface - marine unmanned vehicles can benefit from the developed energy transmitting systems. Success in this proposed energy transmitting concept with low mass may open various market sectors due to the appeal of the device technology.

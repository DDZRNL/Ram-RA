		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Polymer matrix composites are increasingly replacing traditional metallic materials in NASA launch vehicles.   However, the repair and subsequent inspection methods for these materials are considerably more complicated.  Typically, a composite laminate patch must be manually fabricated and bonded or co-cured to the damaged structure.  To ensure high quality patches with sufficient compaction and low void content, significant time, preparation and equipment is required.  Current surface preparations require time consuming labor and can be a risk for further damage.  The ideal repair methodology would allow for a rapid structural repair to be performed on-site in locations with minimal access and without the need for extensive tooling, surface prep, cure times and complicated inspection techniques. Engineers at Luna have developed a number of technologies that have the potential to enable high performance composite repair and inspection during pre-launch ground processing. Luna's comprehensive system will realize improvements via facile surface preparation, reduction of specialized fabrication equipment, rapid-on-demand curing resins and utilization of Luna's unique fiber optic measurement capability for monitoring repair state. This Phase I program will focus on developing these methods for composite damage that can be performed during ground processing of the launch vehicle without the need for full replacement

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Luna's composite repair system will be directly applicable to launch pad damage mitigation activities for current and future launch vehicles. Ground processing operators will be able to identify the damage that will require patching and Luna's technology will enable rapid surface preparation, patch bonding, vacuum debulking and consolidation without the need for complicated tooling or equipment. This should dramatically reduce time and energy costs while maintaining high probabilities of mission success.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Luna's technology is applicable to a wide range of composite material systems, manufacturing methods, and applications. The barrier and curative approaches can be adapted to prepreg systems that would have prolonged room temperature storage capability with the ability to be quickly cured, out of autoclave and on-demand. The impact of these systems on the broad composite commercial market could be enormous.  A good example where the technology would be directly applicable and would make a dramatic impact is the military and commercial aerospace industry, where optimal performance is required of structural components for the absolute maximum weight savings.

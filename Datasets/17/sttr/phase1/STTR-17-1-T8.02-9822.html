		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The team comprising OEwaves Inc. and UC Davis offers to develop and demonstrate a SiN-platform integrated photonic circuit suitable for a spectrally pure chip-scale tunable opto-electronic RF oscillator (OEO) that can operate as a flywheel in high precision optical clock modules, as well as radio astronomy, spectroscopy, and local oscillator in radar and communications systems. The effort comprises integration of an ultra-high quality (Q) crystalline whispering gallery mode (WGM) microresonator with multiple lithographically defined photonic and electronic components and devices (including a laser, a detector and waveguides) on a single platform with nanometer-scale feature sizes. The proposed oscillator will be packaged in a volume of approximately 1cc, with net power consumption of less than 500 mW.  The oscillator will produce a minimum of 10 mW of output RF power in Ka frequency band, and its single sideband (SSB) phase noise will be as low as -60 dBc/Hz at 10 Hz, and -160 dBc at 1 MHz and higher Fourier frequencies.

		The proposed technology is suitable for designing chip-scale tunable OEO and high precision optical clock modules particularly critical for small spacecraft platforms.

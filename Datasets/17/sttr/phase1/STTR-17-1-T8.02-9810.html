		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this work, Freedom Photonics will team with University of California, Santa Barbara to develop a hybrid integration platform that integrates yielded, best-of-breed active optical components with low-cost, high functionality Silicon Photonics components in a manner that is compatible with foundry fabrication. This will be performed in a highly manufacturable manner, using passively aligned pick-and-place technology to place the semiconductor components on the interposer substrate to form a system in package-type of integration platform for space photonic applications. The approach is based on a novel 3D hybrid integration approach developed at UCSB that is scalable, low cost, reliable, and that demonstrates superior thermal performance.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Chip-scale integrated miniaturized, yet high performance photonic systems can significantly impact a wide range of applications including and in addition to NASA space communication and control needs. These applications include other terrestrial communications applications, including both free-space and fiber optic links, a range of sensing applications and potential optical waveform generating sources. Freedom Photonics will work with NASA and communications equipment manufacturers in the development and commercialization of these chip-scale photonic integration technologies to a variety of NASA applications and markets.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		1.	Optical fiber sensor systems which with significantly lower cost has the potential to become pervasive in structural monitoring of buildings, vehicles  and other structures.<BR>2.	Optical links such as free-space optical or hybrid fiber-wireless systems where implementation to date have been limited due to the performance and cost of components compared to conventional transmission links and digital technologies.<BR>3.	Medical markets, a potentially very large volume market where a range of non-invasive optical sensing and imaging technologies are emerging including optical coherence tomography.<BR>4.	Chipscale integrated systems and subsystems for large data centers and supercomputer data transfer interconnects. Low-cost, ruggedized integrated photonics is a requirement for meeting these demands through efficient advanced photonic integrated circuit technology, in particular with regard to the large volume of components needed in a large datacenter or supercomputer.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		PCKA is partnering with researchers at CWRU to develop an Autonomous Power Controller (APC) for mission-critical microgrids to supply electric power in a highly autonomous and secure manner to accomplish mission objectives. The APC consists of a centralized controller connected to an array of local component controllers. The centralized controller will be capable of optimal generation and load scheduling, abnormal conditions and/or failure detection, and system restoration, while the local controllers monitor system components and pass sensor data to the centralized controller. The core of the APC is a database architecture that facilitates data movement to enable the various control functions. The design of this database was carried out by the PI, Dr. Hong, in a 2016 collaboration with NASA GRC, and it will be leveraged in this STTR effort to support the expansion of the APC. The effort will also utilize a spacecraft system simulator tool developed by PCKA. Therefore, the team is well-placed to successfully develop the APC. Potential applications of the APC will be in deep space explorations, aeronautic flights, and special human habitats, where human supervision of the electric power systems is limited and availability of electric power is critical to mission success.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The most immediate NASA applications for this technology is NASA's Exploration Augmentation Module (EAM) system. PCKA's existing Simulink model of this system will form the testbed used to demonstrate the capabilities of the APC. The International Space Station power system is similar in nature, a dc system based on solar arrays and battery energy storage, so it is also a potential application for the technology. The APC will also have potential applications in aircraft electrical propulsions systems, wherein the electrical system is mission-critical. NASA's CAS and NEAT programs are examples of such systems. PCKA also has existing models of these systems to facilitate future application of the APC.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		While the proposed effort is focused on spacecraft power systems, other types of power systems could take advantage of the control technology. The underlying control architecture can be applied to essentially any type of microgrid power system. Terrestrial microgrids do not suffer the same communication latency as deep-space systems; however, autonomous control of these systems would greatly improve performance through optimal operating point identification and automated reconfiguration in response to faults or disturbances. It should be noted that these systems can be either ac or dc in nature; however, the APC formulation can remain largely the same. Furthermore, the team's approach to development of the control using a simulation-based testbed allows efficient development, testing, and validation of the approach to a wide array of systems.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Among a suite of synthetic biology methods, Afingen's APFL technology offers a robust path to produce high-value biochemicals from inedible biomass-derived substrates with minimal cis-genetic manipulation and improved genetic stability compared to conventional bio-engineering. By amplifying and/or reducing target compounds with unprecedented specificity and improved tolerance, engineered food-, feed-, and biofuel crops (e.g. switchgrass, wheat, canola, corn, soybeans, alfalfa, tomato, potato) may offer higher yields of biomass and enhance degradation in the inedible biomass to facilitate nutrient recycling. This STTR Phase I application by Afingen, Inc. and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is aimed at generating significantly improved rotation crops, wheat and canola,with a combination of three beneficial traits: [1] accelerated rooting growth, [2] increased grain yield and vegetative biomass, and [3] enhanced degradability of inedible biomass.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The engineered crops will be able to provide food and be converted to advanced degradable feedstocks that provide nutrient recycling as next generation organic fertilizers. The proposed biotech platform would also allow variety of different crops to [1] grow better even at limited spaces and resources, [2] accelerate rooting systems compatible to microgravity, and [3] increase their photosynthetic organs (green vegetative tissues: leaves and stems) to convert carbon dioxide to oxygen for more sustainable and efficient cultivation systems on Mars.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Enabled the combination of three beneficial traits: accelerated rooting growth, increased biomass, and enhanced (bio)-degradability of inedible biomass will contribute to U.S. agricultural production, self-sustainability, economy, food security, and bioenergy.

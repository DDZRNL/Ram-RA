		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		GTL has developed an innovative composite repair methodology known as the Composite Repair System (CRS).  In this phase I effort, CRS is being developed for the repair of damaged induced in thin-laminate composite cryotanks.  In applying CRS to damaged composite structures, the required level of structural capacity is recovered to within a predetermined percentage of its original performance after being damaged.  GTL?s CRS offers a repair method that reduces complexity and time required to perform repairs.  Designed to repair damage in locations with minimal access, the CRS repairs can be made at any point after laminate fabrication.  The CRS can be used to perform launch vehicle repairs in assembled states while on the launch platform.  In the phase I effort, GTL will perform initial feasibility studies and tests to validate the anticipated performance capacities of the CRS repairs. At the close of this effort, the design will be refined.  At this time, initial studies will be performed to incorporate ?smart? sensing technology into the repairs. In the phase II effort, GTL will extend this analysis and apply this ?smart? technology to refined repair patches.  These patches will be tested one of GTL?s pre-existing cryotanks in the phase II effort.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Composite Repair System will be a tool that can be used to quickly repair damaged cryotanks in assembled states while on the launch pad. Its application to the repair of thin-laminate cryotanks can easily be extended to the repair of other pre-existing cryotanks of varying thickness.  Future development will expand the applications of the CRS to in-vitro repairs for more general laminates.  In this vein, the CRS could be applied to the repair of a multitude of aerospace structures in addition to cryotanks.  This repair technique would also be useful in repairing space habitat structures as minor space related damages are incurred into the composite structure.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		CRS can be developed as a general composite repair technology, with possible application to laminates ranging from highly specialized (e.g. GTL?s BHL cryotank) to more general.  In terms of general composite structures, CRS can be used to repair composite military structures including fixed and rotary wing aircraft, tanks, and missiles.   The CRS technology is just as applicable to existing composite structure within the commercial market. It could also be used to repair both military and civilian space vehicles and tankage.

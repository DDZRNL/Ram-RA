		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The innovation proposed here is a fidelity-adaptive combustion model (FAM) implemented into the Loci-STREAM CFD code for use at NASA for simulation of rocket combustion. This work will result in a high-fidelity, high-performance multiphysics simulation capability to enhance NASA's current simulation capability of unsteady turbulent reacting flows involving cryogenic propellants.  This  novel FAM model utilizes a combustion submodel assignment, combining flamelet-based combustion models (such as inert-mixing models, equilibrium chemistry, diffusion-flame Flamelet/Progress Variable (FPV) or premixed-flame models) for the computationally efficient characterization of quasi one-dimensional, steady, and equilibrated combustion regimes, with combustion models of higher physical fidelity (such as thickened flame models, reduced/lumped chemistry models) for accurate representation of topologically complex combustion regions (associated with flame-anchoring, autoignition, flame-liftoff, thermoacoustic coupling, and non-equilibrium combustion processes) that are not adequately represented by the current flamelet model in Loci-STREAM. In FAM, the selection of a combustion submodel from a set of models available to a CFD-combustion solver is based on user-specific information about quantities of interest and a local error control. With this information, FAM performs an identification procedure for an optimal combustion submodel assignment from the available combustion models that. This simulation capability will have direct impact on NASA's ability to assess combustion instability of rocket engines.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The outcome of this work will be a powerful CFD-based design and analysis tool for propulsion engines of relevance to NASA.  This tool is envisioned to be useful for full rocket engine simulations, injector design, etc.  Specific applications at NASA of this capability include: (a) High-fidelity simulations of upper stage propulsion systems, (b) The multi-element injector problem coupled with fuel and oxidizer feedlines and manifolds, (c) Design improvements for J-2X and RS-68 injectors to be used in the SLS, (d) Design improvements for the LOX/LH2, LOX/LCH4 and LOX/RP-1 engines, and (e) full rocket engine simulations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The computational tool resulting from this project will have wide-ranging commercial applications.  The Hybrid RANS-LES methodology can be used for a wide variety of engineering applications involving unsteady turbulent flows.  The reacting flow capability can be used for simulating combusting flows in various industrial applications, such as gas turbine engines, diesel engines, etc.  The real-fluids methodology can be used in a large number of industrial flow situations involving both chemically inert and reacting flows.  With additions of multi-phase spray combustion modeling capability, the applicability of this tool can be further broadened.

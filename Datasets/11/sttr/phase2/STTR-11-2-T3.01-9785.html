		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Deployable Space Systems, Inc. (DSS), in collaboration with the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), Department of Mechanical Engineering, will focus the proposed NASA STTR Phase 2 program on the materials optimization, structures optimization, creep / relaxation phenomena characterization and analytical modeling, and manufacturing process optimization/development for the Mega-ROSA/ROSA solar array. The ROSA technology (termed for: Roll-Out Solar Array) is a new/innovative mission-enabling solar array system that offers maximum performance in all key metrics and unparalleled affordability for NASA's Space Science & Exploration missions. ROSA will enable NASA's emerging Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) Space Science & Exploration missions through its ultra-affordability, ultra-lightweight, ultra-compact stowage volume, high strength/stiffness, and its high voltage and high/low temperature operation capability within many environments. Multiple identified end-users provide strong commercial infusion paths for the ROSA solar array upon the successful execution of the proposed Phase 2 program technology advancements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA space applications are comprised of practically all Exploration, Space Science, Earth Science, Planetary Surface, and other missions that require high-efficiency photovoltaic power production through deployment of an ultra-lightweight and highly-modular structural system.  The technology is particularly suited for NASA's SEP missions and other missions that require game-changing performance in terms of affordability, ultra-lightweight, compact stowage volume, and superior structural performance.  The technology is also well suited for applications requiring scalability/modularity, high deployed strength/stiffness, operability within high radiation environments, high voltage operation, and operation in LILT and HIHT environments.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA space applications are comprised of practically all missions that require high-efficiency photovoltaic power production through deployment of an ultra-lightweight and highly-modular structural system.  The technology is particularly suited for SEP missions that require game-changing performance in terms of affordability, ultra-lightweight, compact stowage volume, and superior structural performance.  Applicable non-NASA space missions include: LEO surveillance, reconnaissance, communications and other critical payload/equipment satellites, LEO commercial mapping and critical payload/equipment satellites, MEO satellites & space-tugs, GEO commercial communications and critical payload/equipment satellites, and GEO communications and payload/equipment satellites.  The proposed technology also has tremendous dual-use non-space commercial private-sector applicability including fixed-ground and deployable/retractable mobile-ground based systems.

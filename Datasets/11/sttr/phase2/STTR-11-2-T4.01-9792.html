		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase 2 program builds on a successful Phase 1 effort that demonstrated practical engineering methods as well as continuing development paths to build smaller high performance gyro systems suitable for small satellite applications.  This program will execute a logical follow-on endeavor by (a) using existing components that satisfy the specifications matrix, and (b) developing new components that are required to complete the task of fabricating small optical gyro heads.  We have clearly defined tasks and realistic milestones with risk management embedded.  Designed to fit within a 1U satellite chassis to adapt to the growing cube sat application space, a clear plan has been laid out to generate an IRU system that addresses deployment issues such as mass, harness routing, and 3-axis cluster versus split head configurations.  The gyro design is a keen compromise between leveraging shorter wavelength subcomponents to improve performance naturally, smaller mechanical size to minimize thermal effects, and optoelectronics placement options for form factor flexibility.  We recognize power management as the critical parameter for devices within small satellites, therefore an effort has been allocated to develop a solution concept for miniaturized and power-efficient control electronics to address the goal of <2W consumption, although its implementation is beyond the scope of this Phase 2 program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Although the target application is a gyro system for small satellites, any NASA sounding rocket, research balloon, or space platform that needs a gyro system with improved SWaP-C will benefit from this technology development.  Its small form factor lends itself to alternative applications such as planetary exploration bots and extravehicular platforms.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The commercial aviation sector and commercial companies involved in advanced aerospace projects are obvious candidates for this technology.  The oil and gas industry needs to displace magnetometers to improve their measurement-while-drilling capabilities, which will lower the cost of energy resource exploration; thus a rugged, advanced miniature gyro system would offer a significant advantage.  DOD programs involving advanced interceptors and space platforms can also benefit from a small, low cost gyro system that is radiation tolerant, immune to EMI, and capable of surviving harsh environments.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The objective of this Phase I STTR program is to adapt NanoSonic's HybridSil&#153; nanocomposite technology for the creation of next generation highly flexible, fire resistant foams capable of extended operational lifetimes within demanding aerospace platforms.  Phase I optimized nanocomposite foams would have immediate utility within a broad spectrum NASA applications as non-halogenated fire proofing, insulative, de-icing, and energy absorptive materials with tailorable breathabilities.  To that end, NanoSonic and Dr. James McGrath's research group of Virginia Tech will work to design, optimize, and scale-up a family of highly flexible polyimide-polyorganosiloxane HybridSil&#153;   foams with statistically optimized cell content, mechanical durability, thermooxidative resilience, gas permeability, flexibility, and flame retardancy.  This program will build from established non-halogenated, high temperature HybridSil&#153; technology that has passed the ISO 9705 room corner burn test to obtain qualification as "fire restricting" per the International Maritime Organization, demonstrated a  flame spread rating of zero (ASTM E-84), yielded thermal conductivities below commercially available polyurethane foams (< 50 mW/mK), and elastomeric resilience (recovery from 1000 % deformation) from ballistic / blast impact threats .  Rapid Phase III transition to commercial integration will be facilitated through an established HybridSil&#153; pilot scale manufacturing infrastructure capable of producing > 8,000 lbs. resin / day.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NanoSonic's Phase I optimized HybridSil&#153;   insulative coatings will serve as a replacement for currently employed polyurethane and polyimide foams yet provide enhanced fire retardancy, elastomeric flexibility, insulation, impact dissipation, acoustic attenuation, and ice mitigation for a broad range of NASA vehicle, ground, and umbilical support platforms.  Additional NASA specific applications include protective clothing and electronic insulation applications.  The proposed polyimide HybridSilTM nanocomposite foams will be an extension of NanoSonic's tailorable, high performance HybridSilTM polymer nanocomposite technology which has recently received the R&D 100 Award.  Of particular importance to fire resistance and flexibility, the base copolymer technology has independently validated fire and blast protective properties and is currently transitioning to pilot scale manufacturing through a U.S. Navy Commercialization Pilot Program. Thus, the manufacturing infrastructure necessary for pilot scalability will be in place during the onset of the Phase I program and provide a driver for near term Phase III NASA integration pathways.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to meeting the solicitation specified  cryogenic insulation, fireproofing, energy absorption,  ice mitigation,  and acoustic attenuation applications for NASA vehicle, ground, and umbilical systems, the proposed polyimide HybridSil&#153;  nanocomposite foams will have broad utility within additional defense and commercial applications.  Most immediately, NanoSonic's  non-halogenated fire resistant foams may be used to provide next generation thermal insulation and energy efficiency within commercial and residential buildings.  Specifically, the proposed nanocomposite foam technology will serve as a replacement for currently employed polyurethane foams yet provide orders of magnitude greater thermal insulation,  environmentally friendly VOC-free spray deposition processes, validated non-halogenated flame protection, negligible smoke toxicity,  and superior mechanical durability.  Additionally, insulation systems around high temperature automotive and aerospace structures would provide increased lifetimes for a range of subcomponent systems.  A secondary market interest with insulative clothing, protective equipment padding, and tent ensembles may be realized as well.

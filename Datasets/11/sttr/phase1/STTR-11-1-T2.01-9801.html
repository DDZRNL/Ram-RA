		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Prime Research LC (PPLC) and Virginia Tech (VT) propose to develop an energy harvesting wireless strain node technology that utilizes single-crystal piezoelectric fiber-based energy harvesting, highly sensitive and low power piezoresistive strain gages, and ultra wide-band (UWB) ultra low power radio communication.  Single crystal piezoelectric fibers promise to improve piezoelectric harvesting power density by a factor of 4 &#150; 5 &#61620; while the ultra wide-band radio (UWB) and piezoresistive strain gages promise to lower power requirements by almost 100x.  The proposed Phase I work will demonstrate the technologies critical to successful commercialization of a low cost, mass producible, postage stamp sized wireless strain node. A key result of the Phase I effort will be demonstration of the proposed harvesting and sensing technologies.  Demonstration of these two items will remove the most significant hurdles to a successful commercial product.  Phase I will provide the data necessary to perform an integrated system design in the Phase I Option and during Phase II, PPLC and VT will fabricate the integrated device for use in field trials.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The initial NASA commercial application of market the Energy Harvesting Wireless Strain Sensor (EHWSS) technology would be in support of advanced flight testing of low subsonic and high supersonic aircraft.  The EHWSS system would facilitate monitoring of strain levels in key components of aircraft, particularly in areas that might prove problematic for traditional, wired sensing technologies.<BR>Refinement of power budgets and operation environments would allow for extension of EHWSS systems into NASA manned or unmanned space missions for spacecraft structural monitoring, including strain monitoring and/or damage event detection.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		PPLC will market the Energy Harvesting Wireless Strain Sensor (EHWSS) technology for use in support of US military mobile platforms (e.g. ships, aircraft), as well as commercial ships and other private sector industrial and structural monitoring applications such as infrastructure health monitoring (e.g. buildings and bridges) industrial equipment monitoring (e.g. mills and HVAC systems) and power generation equipment (e.g. wind turbines, steam turbines).

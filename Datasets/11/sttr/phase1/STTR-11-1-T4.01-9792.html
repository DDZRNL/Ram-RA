		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Small satellites require much lighter weight, smaller, and long life Attitude control components that can withstand stressing launch conditions and space vibration environments without compromising their performance. In particular, rate sensors that can provide high-resolution Line of Sight (LOS) stabilization, accurate inertial pointing and higher bandwidths are needed to support attitude and position determination from highly compact and very lightweight packages.  IFOS, with a team having many years of pioneering experience in innovative Fiber-Optic Gyroscopes (FOGs), proposes to develop an advanced miniaturizable FOG based on an approach that would allow utilizing drastically reduced  size components packageable into high performance attitude control sensor affording high degree of robustness against the shock and vibration that would maintain long term alignment in requisite space environment. IFOS will exploit novel techniques including new fiber components and coil production methods suitable for shorter wavelength operation, and vibration damping concepts that would  be compatible with weight of less than 2 lb and volume under 150 cm3 for an Inertial reference Unit (IRU). Phase I will focus on feasibility study of the concept for 1-axis gyro, demonstration of critical components and simulation of vibration damping techniques needed to protect the sensor during launch and long term operation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Advancement of rate sensor components is essential to support navigation and attitude control systems for advanced NASA  satellite missions. The proposed IFOS FOGs will have significantly reduced size and weight with ruggedized components designed to meet stringent dynamic and thermal specifications. A robust, high performance cost-effective gyroscope suitable for space-based operations will also have significant impact on demanding LOS stabilization for NASA applications that require spacecraft stabilized instrumentation platforms for long term space applications. As well as providing weight reduction, the miniaturization enabled by our optical fiber technology is key to diverse spin-off applications such as for sensor matrices in NASA's extra-vehicular and planetary exploration robots for unmanned missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed work will significantly benefit the commercial aviation industry as well as sensor arrays for medical applications and homeland security robotic disarming of bombs. Reducing the SWaP and cost of these sensors and improving robustness against harsh environmental risk factors &#150; all without loss of performance - is also critical for many advanced interceptor and satellite platforms that are of interest to DOD and advanced aerospace applications

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Lynntech proposes a novel flow control methodology for airfoils undergoing dynamic stall. Dynamic stall refers to an aerodynamic phenomenon that is experienced by airfoils that undergo rapid changes in the flow angle of attack such as rotorcraft based airfoils, flapping wing technologies as well as fixed wing aircrafts undergoing sudden angle of attack changes. Dynamic stall is inherently an unsteady, non linear and complicated effect that can affect such flight parameters as lift, drag and airfoil stability. <BR>Lynntech, along with its STTR partner in Dr. Noel Clemens and Dr. Jayant Sirohi, at the University of Texas at Austin proposes to use novel pulsed plasma discharge based actuators for flow control on dynamically stalled airfoils. Lynntech has more than 20 years of experience with applied plasma physics and 10 years of experience with turbulent CFD modeling. Dr. Noel Clemens at the University of Texas Flow Imaging Research Laboratory in the Department of Aerospace Engineering, who has implemented and tested various types of plasma actuators for flow control. <BR>The proposed technology consists of pulsed plasma actuators which will induce high velocity airflow within the airfoil boundary layer, thus reattaching the flow. The proposed plasma actuator can achieve high Reynolds number (>5e6) flow control compared to contemporary dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators without relying  on corona discharge / hot plasma technology. Advantages of the system include low power consumption, ease of installation, increased flight stability, reduced drag and higher stall angles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		One of NASA's functions is developing and demonstrating new flight technologies for both military and civilian use.  The technology proposed here, if implemented, can reduce fuel consumption or increase payload.  Either will make aircraft operation more profitable.  Reducing fuel consumption will also reduce emissions, including aircraft produced CO2.  Increasing boundary layer attachment will also make the aircraft more responsive to its controls, an added advantage.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Developing and dispersing this flow control technology will be of greatest benefit outside of NASA, with improved safety and profitability for commercial aircraft operators at all levels, from private pilots to commercial airlines.  <BR>Beyond these direct flow control applications, development of the pulsed plasma jet systems have several other potential applications in the energy and emissions control industries. The significant energy associated with the ions, neutrals, metastables, and electrons in a dielectric barrier discharge can be utilized for heavy hydrocarbon cracking in oil refineries, producing alternative fuels from various feedstocks such as JP-8, renewable feedstocks such as biomass, and for producing energy from waste such as waste cooking oil, municipal solid waste etc. The pulsed plasma can also be used for regenerating NOx and CO2 emission control catalysts, by generating an oxygen discharge that can burn off the soot generated on the catalyst surface.

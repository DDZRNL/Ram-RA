		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		For supporting NASA's Robotics, Tele-Robotics and Autonomous Systems Roadmap, we are proposing the "Evolutionary Autonomous Health Monitoring System" (EAHMS) for planetary exploration, which will provide an integral flexible diagnostics and prognostics framework by advanced and novel methods for determining the operational condition in on-board sensors (odometry), actuators, and power systems. In EAHMS, high performance diagnostic techniques provide a foundation for tailoring robust and accurate failure detection and identification (FDI) in key components of a robotic vehicle's locomotion system (e.g. motors, encoders, etc.). This foundation is comprised of innovative and advanced features including: (a) an enhanced collaborative learning engine (eCLE); (b) sensor health diagnostics with slippage awareness based on an Extended Kalman filter sensor fusion process; and (c) an integral system design for optimized reliability. In particular, the eCLE provides a mechanism for facilitating autonomous operation, since it includes self-learning capability. The eCLE is developed within the context of health monitoring, but will also have the capability to be applied to different domains. Another innovation is the support for electronic circuits and boards considering radiation effects.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Evolutionary Autonomous Health Monitoring System will directly support NASA's future planetary exploration missions according to the RTA Roadmap. In particular, the pervasive use of intelligent robotics with self-monitoring diagnostic/prognostic capabilities will enhance exploration by increasing reliability and mission success potential. NASA robotic exploration missions involving Mars, small planetary bodies such as asteroids, and the moons of the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn would all greatly benefit from the integration of an on-board health management system. An immediate application would be the NASA Ames Research Center's Intelligent Robotics Group (IRG) which sets out to explore extreme environments, remote locations, and uncharted worlds based on new and novel technologies. Current NASA rovers such as the "K10" series operated by IRG would be prime candidates for integration of the software.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		One of the main objectives of this STTR is the commercialization of the project's research and the introduction of a commercialized product to the market place. The EAHMS will provide an integral solution for conducting diagnostics and prognostics in unmanned robotic vehicles. For example, US Army organizations within CECOM LCMC and Army Team C4ISR would benefit from the technologies. Specific application areas that would benefit from the technology include: (1) Robotic platforms and UGVs (e.g. TALON) for facility surveillance, disarming improvised explosive devices, etc; (2) Military vehicles for infantry combat (such as tanks), reconnaissance, command & control (e.g. LAV-C2), engineering (e.g. Buffalo MPRC), and armored fighting such as the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV); and (3) Non-ground vehicles such as maritime vessels, unmanned aerial vehicles, etc. (using aspects of the EAHMS).

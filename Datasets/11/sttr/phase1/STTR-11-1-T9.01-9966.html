		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		An accurate predictive capability of coupled fluid-structure interaction in propulsion system is crucial in the development of NASA's new Space Launch System (SLS). This STTR effort will develop a multi-disciplinary tool to improve CFD prediction capability in modeling coupled fluid structure interaction (FSI) phenomena for many SLS propulsion applications such as flexible inhibitors for SRMs. During Phase I, an Application Programming Interface (API) framework with conservative interface treatment will be developed to couple a NASA production CFD solver with a DoD open source nonlinear large deformation Finite Element solver developed by the proposing firm. The multi-disciplinary tool will be rigorously validated against coupled as well as decoupled problems (fluid and structure individually). Phase I will demonstrate the improved pressure oscillation modeling fidelity and provide great insight into the physics of nonlinear FSI leading to thrust oscillations in SRMs. The Phase II effort will conduct more validations and investigations of several SLS FSI phenomena including the physics of flexible inhibitors in triggering unsteady pressure oscillations and flow induced vibration of turbine and inducer blades in liquid rocket engines.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The developed FSI analysis tool will provide accurate high-fidelity aeroelastic/hydroelastic analyses for dynamic loads analysis of turbomachinery, inducer, delivery pipe, and valves. Aerospace engineers will be able to utilize the proposed technology to analyze early designs of turbomachinery, thereby reducing the dependence on expensive wind tunnel/water tunnel and flight tests. Benefits will also be achieved in the final performance, and enhanced structural integrity, prolonged structural life, and improved safety of aerospace vehicles. <BR><BR>Direct applications of the technology are in the analysis of dynamic loads problems of aerospace vehicles, such as buffet, flutter, buzz, and control reversal. Direct applications of the technology are also in noise, vibrations, and buffet suppression of rotorcraft and commercial air vehicles. General applications of the technology include fluid-structure interaction problems such as vortex-blade interaction of rotorcraft, trailing vortex dynamics of commercial aircraft, heat exchanger vibration, strumming of cables and offshore pipelines, galloping of towers and masts, and fatigue of panels.

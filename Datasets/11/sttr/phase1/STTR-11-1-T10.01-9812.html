		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		American GNC Corporation (AGNC) and Louisiana Tech University (LaTECH) are proposing a breakthrough technology consisting of an innovative system for facilitating the monitoring and management of NASA test facilities (such as rocket engine test stands) and widely distributed support systems (WDSS). This technology, termed the Intelligent Distributed and Ubiquitous Health Management System (IDU-HMS) consists of: (a) a fault aware wireless sensor network (WSN) for monitoring valves, vacuum lines, and pressurized subsystems; (b) local wireless data collection and diagnostic units; (c) a main Web service based health and data unit; and (d) portable Web clients. New and powerful algorithms based on the artificial intelligence paradigm are leveraged for conducting automated anomaly detection and diagnostics. Another key innovation is the ubiquitous information capability enabled by mobile communication technologies as well as secure Internet and wireless local area network (WLAN) connections. The architecture is based on a standardized framework for maximum modularity such that it can be integrated into current support, CBM+ type, and control systems at NASA Stennis Space Center (SSC).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Intelligent Distributed and Ubiquitous Health Management System will directly support health monitoring and management of NASA test facilities and widely distributed support systems. The integration of the system into NASA SSC rocket engine test stands will immediately benefit the Integrated System Health Management (ISHM) program by providing powerful FDI and wireless networking capabilities. This includes the monitoring of valves in propellant delivery systems, cooling water lines, etc. Another example is the remote monitoring of vacuum lines as part of the low pressure and low cryogenic temperature A3 test stand at NASA SSC. Possible applications outside of SSC involve the health monitoring of test facility support systems at Glen Research Center, for example, vacuum line monitoring at the zero gravity research facility, as well as usage in wind tunnel test facilities such as those at Ames Research Center and Langley Research Center.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		One of the main objectives of this STTR is the commercialization of the project's research results and introduction of a commercialized product into the marketplace (both civilian and military). The IDU-HMS will provide an integral solution for health monitoring and CBM applications in a variety of systems. Specific uses include: (1) heating and cooling systems in expansive commercial facilities; (2) support systems in nuclear power plants (cooling lines, gas pressurization lines, and so on) as well as other power plant types (fossil fuels, geothermal power, hydroelectric, etc.); (3) general manufacturing environments in need of FDI and CBM capabilities; (4) industrial environments that require the proper operation of fluid flow systems (e.g. refrigerant for cooling, hydraulic power systems, etc.); and (5) natural gas pipelines and other gas delivery systems.

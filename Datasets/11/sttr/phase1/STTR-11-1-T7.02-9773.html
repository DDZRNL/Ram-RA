		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to develop a capability to provide integrated acceleration, vibration, and shock testing using a state-of-the-art centrifuge, allowing for the test of synergistic effects of these combined environments. By installing a shaker table on the centrifuge, the test setup can provide both sustained and dynamic-g loads as well as simultaneous vibration loads, in two independent axes. This method will provide more realistic launch environments for testing launch payloads. By providing a more realistic test environment, combined environment testing has the potential to reduce cost, save time, reducing risk and increase performance. <BR><BR>Launch vibration data for a Terrior-Orion two-stage suborbital sounding rocket was used as a basis for analysis.  The data presents a typical launch load environment in that two main loads exist: 1) sustained-g load from acceleration of the rocket, and 2) random vibration and shock loads. The current fixed-table vibration test devices are incapable of simulating both of these loads at the same time. Accordingly, the current test methodologies typically overstress the payload to ensure that the system survives the launch loads. By enabling the proposed capability to test payloads by simultaneously applying sustained-g and vibration loads, we can more closely simulate the actual launch conditions, resulting in risk, schedule and cost reduction.

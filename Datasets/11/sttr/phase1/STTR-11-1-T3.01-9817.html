		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to develop a high-efficiency, triple-junction, epitaxial lift-off (ELO) solar cell by incorporating quantum dots (QDs) within the current-limiting subcell.  We intend to leverage existing QD epitaxy processes developed by the Rochester Institute of Technology and combine this with MicroLink's expertise in multi-junction cell growth and ELO technology.  We will employ QDs to enhance the middle cell absorption in a InGaP/GaAs/InGaAs metamorphic IMM cell.  Detailed balance calculations indicate that the triple junction efficiency can be increased to ~42% by reducing the bandgap of the middle cell to ~1.2 eV.  The combination of the QD technology with multi-junction ELO technology will be exploited in two ways: i) ELO GaAs cells with QD can be grown into full triple-junction cells and ii) back-surface reflectors on the ELO cells will be used to improve absorption by routing IR light for a second pass through the QD subcell.  The relevance of this work to NASA is that it will result in lightweight, high-efficiency, triple-junction solar cells that will have a specific power > 500 W/kg.  In addition, the use of QDs has been shown to improve radiation tolerance of the photovoltaic device.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		When fully developed, the quantum dot solar cells will be suitable for use in the following NASA applications: replacement for conventional triple junction cells on spacecraft, solar panels for next generation solar electric propulsion (SEP) spacecraft, and solar-powered high altitude, long endurance (HALE) aircraft.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The lightweight, high efficiency solar cells to be developed in this program can be used in the following non-NASA applications: replacement for conventional triple junction cells on spacecraft, solar-powered high altitude, long endurance (HALE) aircraft, solar blankets for terrestrial power generation, and terrestrial solar concentrators.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Thermal Stir Welding (TSW) provides advancement over the more conventional Friction Stir Welding (C-FSW) process because it separates the primary processes variables thereby allowing independent control of metal stirring and forging from the stir zone temperature.  However, the feedback for precise control of the stir zone temperature, and hence the process parameters to sustain that temperature within a narrow range, does not currently exist on the TSW machine at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC).  At present, the current state of the art for the selection of process parameters for both TSWing and C-FSWing parameters is highly empirical and by nature is based on phenomenological knowledge.  In response to this need, Keystone is proposing this Phase I SBIR project to demonstrate the feasibility of closed-loop control of the TSW process and to enable the establishment of a theoretically derived processing map to accelerate process understanding and selection of parameters for a given material and pin tool design.  The close-loop control system will enable sustainment of a steady-state temperature at the stir rod as a function of spindle RPM and the travel velocity for a given z-axis loading and stir rod design.  Use of this theoretically derived processing map will provide guidance in the optimization of the process parameter domain for solid-state welding of a given material.  This capability will in turn enable rapid process qualification of the TSW process and components produced by the process.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed technology will enable the creation of processing maps to characterize the solid-state joining of metals by thermal stir welding. The closed-loop temperature control system (applicable to other types of stir welding) will allow higher fidelity, stir welding of alloys of interest to NASA for manufacturing space craft and heavy lift vehicles.  The analytical simulation of the stir welding process will enable more rapid and less costly formation of processing maps of a given material. The control system and analytical simulation combined will enable formation of a processing map for Haynes 230 (the alloy of choice by NASA for the J2X nozzsle extension) and establishment of a rapid process qualification methodology for thermal stir welded components.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The advancement of stir welding technologies has application well beyond NASA applications.  It is envisioned this technology  will become important to the Navy for ship building applications, as well as to the larger commercail ship building industry for construction of ship hulls and superstructure.  The process will also be useful to fabrication of large tankage and piping for the chemical processing and transporation industry.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Intelligent Fiber Optic Systems Corporation (IFOS) proposes to prove the feasibility of innovations in acousto-optic sensor development for measurement of launch acoustics on space vehicle and ground structures. The proposed sensor platform provides an ultra-light-weight, ultra-high-speed, multi-channel, optical fiber sensor array system for acoustics measurements. The project goals are to design an ultra-high-speed/high resolution, small footprint fiber Bragg grating (FBG) acousto-optic sensor array plus the interrogator, construct a system model, test platform and develop signal processing algorithms to identify and measure acoustic signals in the presence of a quasi-static background strain field. The system model will demonstrate proof-of-principle and the test results will provide proof-of-functionality of the proposed sensor system for measurement of vehicle and ground effects of launch acoustics including using the advanced signal processing algorithms. IFOS and its collaborators in this project will develop a Phase 2 strategy plan that includes development and integration strategy, potential demonstration opportunities, program schedule, and estimated costs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary market for the application of this technology will be a verification and validation tool for the NASA's ground support equipments (GSE) and launch pad structures designs to withstand the launch-induced environments produced by the first-stage rocket exhaust plume.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Many non-NASA commercial markets exist that can realize significant benefits from this new technology for highly integrated/synergistic structures in the aerospace, automobile, and infrastructure industries. Commercial aviation, the oil and gas industry and land and marine vehicles will benefit significantly from this technology.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT) has identified a "carbon-carbon nozzle (domestic source)" as a "Top Technical Challenge" in the 2011-2016 timeframe in the "Launch Propulsion Systems Roadmap" document.  This program, by utilizing a demonstrably capable team with a deep history in the manufacture, testing, and analysis of C/C materials, will address this need by developing a Lyocell C/C composite system aimed at the need for a composite J2X nozzle extension.  The proposed Lyocell based system will have the advantages of being thermally compatible with, specifically, the TEG manifold of the J2X and will have a domestic supply chain.  This technology has the capability to save hundreds of pounds of weight over the current (and less capable) metal based nozzle extension.  Therefore, the overall objective of this program is to develop a viable, domestically produced Lyocell based C/C that passes margin of safety requirements for use as a J2X nozzle extension material.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA applications for this technology include the J2X nozzle extension, for which the application of C/C will provide hundreds of pounds of weight savings from both the material itself and the removal of a thermal expansion interface region that would have to be added with other composite systems.  Other systems that would benefit are the RL-10 system family as well as the potential for use in both upper stages of heavy lift and in-space propulsion systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The potential for domestic large C/C manufacture will provide an opportunity for the currently supported commercial launch industry to utilize this technology.  Though the business area is still developing, this technology has the capability to be utilized in several future commercial spacecraft.  The potential also exists for DoD/MDA applications.  Currently Lyocell development work is underway with MDA and US Navy support that will benefit from the research proposed in this document.

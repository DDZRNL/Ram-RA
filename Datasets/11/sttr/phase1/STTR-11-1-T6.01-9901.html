		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Current approaches planned for space suit atmosphere revitalization (AR) are neither compatible with each other nor regenerable in space, and have a high life cycle operating cost associated with them. The proposed PCI innovation in collaboration with University of Hartford involves synthesizing improved sorbents on high surface area supports tailored for CO2, water and trace contaminant removal. Phase I effort will demonstrate proof of concept &#150; developing appropriate methods for coating high capacity sorbents on high surface area supports, scalability of the approach with high bed utilization, maximizing sorption capacity resulting in ultra-compact sorption adsorber, rapid regeneration to vacuum and an operating demonstration on a bench scale; representing significant advances over current state-of-the art AR methods.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A common modular approach to air revitalization for all levels of activity &#150; from EMU suits, ground-based crew cabins, ground vehicles, on up to spacecrafts.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications of this technology will be in the manufacture of light weight, compact and scalable Adsorber modules for use in air purification systems, including those found in crew cabins or enclosed spaces such commercial airplanes, submarines, operating rooms, ships, and industrial process control rooms.  Regenerative personnel protective devices against toxic gas, airborne toxins or biological agents would be an application for small scale versions of the adsorber system. Industrial applications such as semiconductor manufacture where solvents or emissions are a concern would be potential larger scale application areas.  Following successful development of a scalable system on Microlith&#174;, some major spin off applications would be investigated by PCI in the area of selective adsorption and desorption/oxidation cycles during automotive engine cold starts. In the manufacture of chemicals, targeted constituent capture through cyclic adsorption/desorption and integrated catalytic reactor elements may permit active, "selective" catalytic reactors to enhance product yields.

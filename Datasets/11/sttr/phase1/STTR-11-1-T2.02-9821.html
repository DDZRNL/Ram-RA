		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		As the aerospace industry continues to push for greater vehicle efficiency, performance, and longevity, properties of wing aeroelasticity and flight dynamics have become increasingly important.  Both the study and the active control of wing dynamics require advanced sensing technology to inform the design process on the ground and provide feedback for aeroservoelastic systems in the sky.  Existing aeroelastic monitoring systems rely on large networks of individual strain sensors, which must be precisely mapped to the wing's surface, and from which dynamic wing shape can only be inferred from the synthesis of their strain measurements.  To date, no technology has been demonstrated which can make a true measurement of distributed wing shape using a single embedded sensor.<BR><BR>Luna Innovations, Inc. proposes to leverage its ongoing fiber optic shape sensing development effort to create a unique technology capable of measuring wing geometry and vibration in response to gusts, static or dynamic loading, and aeroservoelastic control.  In partnership with Dr. Rakesh Kapania, Professor of Aerospace Engineering at Virginia Tech, Luna will design a model-based sensor layout, embed their miniature fiber optic shape sensing technology in an idealized flexible wing model, and demonstrate the feasibility of the technology in a wind tunnel environment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Successful development of the proposed embedded fiber optic wing shape sensing technology will support the mission directives of several of NASA's Fundamental Aeronautics Program (FAP) by adding key sensing capabilities for advanced on-the-ground and in-flight research as well as feedback information for aeroservoelastic systems.  By enhancing static and dynamic wing performance, the use of distributed shape sensing systems in will enhance the performance and efficiency of next-generation commercial aircraft, such as those based on Boeing's Truss-Braced Wing technology

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Luna Innovations has proven track record of commercializing technology developed under the SBIR / STTR program, and has developed strong relationships with many of the DOD's prime contractors including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Boeing.  Cutting-edge unmanned aerial vehicles, such as Boeing's Phantom Eye High-Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) AUV, represent a rapidly increasing market for in-flight aeroelastic measurement and feedback technologies.  Because of their large, lightweight wings and unpredictable high altitude operating environment, HALE AUVs have a pressing need for accurate, reliable wing shape measurement and control.  Luna's embedded shape measurement system could provide vital information during design and testing, and in-flight operation to ensure optimal vehicle performance and help prevent excessive wing warp or vibration.

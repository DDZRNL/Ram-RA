		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Fault Management (FM) is a key requirement for safety, efficient onboard and ground operations, maintenance, and repair. QSI's TEAMS Software suite is a leading facilitator diagnostic and FM modeling, and performing various FM-related functions. Through this effort, QSI proposes to introduce capabilities to TEAMS that would significantly Reduce diagnostic model development cost and time, Enhance analytic capabilities for aiding model evaluation, and,  Improve FMECA Process. These issues are of critical importance in developing and maintaining diagnostic models in a cost and time efficient manner and utilizing those for analyses related to diagnostic designs, models and overall scheme evaluation. The capabilities and features targeted in this effort are of high importance to develop and mature diagnostic schemes for systems in design phase as well as fielded systems. High-value assets such as NASA's space vehicles; Department of Defense's vehicles (Military aircraft, ships, and ground vehicles) whose underlying systems are designed with the philosophy to serve multiple types of mission involving different phases (or regimes) of operation. From that perspective, the outcome capabilities of this effort could also aid in developing diagnostic models and schemes for large and complex industrial installations.

		NASA's current vision to implement the Fault Management technologies in a cost and time efficient manner. Introduction of the target technology and capabilities to TEAMS toolset will add to its utility in diagnostic modeling, diagnostic and FM capability evaluation, maturation of diagnostic and FM schemes. Thus the technologies are rather critical for NASA's next generation systems and vehicles, e.g., Space Launch System, Systems on future Mars Rover, and Space Habitat Systems, Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN)mission systems, and systems for InSight lander mission that are currently in design and development phase.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Among the other agencies, DoD and Air-force and Navy are the most potential customer for the resulting technologies. Large scale military systems (systems of systems) such as NORAD, Space Command ground segments, the Joint Strike Fighter fleet, the Navy shipboard platforms, Submarine Commands and ballistic missile defense (BMD) systems can be potential areas to field the proposed technology. In addition, UAVs, UMGs and other unmanned submersible vehicle markets could also be potential target for the proposed technology. The product is also expected to be of commercial value to the manufacturers of DoD and military's remotely guided weapons and reconnaissance systems.

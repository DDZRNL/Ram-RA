		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In Subtopic X11.01, NASA has identified the need to develop advanced radiation-shielding materials and systems to protect humans from the hazards of space radiation during NASA missions.  The radiation components of interest include protons, alpha particles and heavy ions from galactic cosmic rays, protons and other ions from solar particle events, high energy electrons and neutrons, and high-energy electromagnetic radiation.  International Scientific Technologies, Inc., in conjunction with the College of William and Mary, proposes to raise the technology readiness level of selected polymeric radiation-shielding materials through participation in the Materials on the International Space Station Experiment program, named MISSE-X.  The Phase I SBIR program demonstrated the feasibility of developing a flight-qualified Technology Demonstration Experiment to be carried on board the ISS as part of a MISSE-X payload to facility Technology Infusion.  Phase II Technical Objectives will include specification and fabrication of polymeric materials to shield astronauts and sensitive electronic equipment, acquisition and test of detectors/dosimeters suitable for measurement of total ionizing dose, design, construction, test and optimization of an experimental package compatible with the guidelines and specifications of the MISSE-X program, and field testing and integration in conjunction with NASA personnel and NASA contractors.  The anticipated result of the Phase II program is the delivery of an experiment package for MISSE-X.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed approach to validation of passive radiation-shielding materials has NASA applications including evaluating the effects of the space environment on multifunctional nanocomposite materials capable of serving both as radiation shields and structural elements.  These materials are being developed by International Scientific Technologies, Inc.  Several NASA programs will be directly affected as a result of the Phase I and Phase II programs. The Human Research Program (HRP) is tasked with ensuring crew safety on long-duration space missions. Validation of radiation shielding on-board the International Space Station will support that task.  HRP will also deliver a design tool to assess advanced radiation shielding on space vehicles. The Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) Program will develop and demonstrate prototype systems for life support, habitation, and extravehicular activity (EVA).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Lightweight multifunctional radiation shielding will find application in the commercial sector in reducing collateral damage from heavy charged particles emerging as a therapeutic approach in nuclear medicine.  The shielding will lead to decreased fatigue among medical personnel required to wear heavy protective garments during radiological procedures.  Workers in industrial facilities using radiation for materials processing and in nuclear power facilities will also benefit from more-comfortable garments having reduced weight and thermal stress.  The Departments of Defense and of Homeland Security will find applications that include protection of soldiers, first responders and emergency medical personnel against high energy gamma radiation and neutrons resulting from so-called dirty bombs as well as from hazards brought about through accidental release of radiological materials.  The uses of continuous monitoring of arrays of in-situ radiation sensors include evaluation of degradation of personal protective garments for biomedical, defense and homeland security applications.

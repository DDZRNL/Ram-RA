		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		A Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) flight experiment will demonstrate Next Generation Navigation Techniques and Advance SDR/STRS Communications Technology to TRL-7.  Scintillation-hardening techniques will be applied to an open-source waveform ported to the SCaN platform.  This will result in improved GPS navigation during geomagnetic storms.<BR><BR>The ported waveform will be STRS-compliant and open source.  It will provide a validation of the STRS architecture and software defined radio technology for space applications.  While operational, the waveform will autonomously detect scintillation and automatically switch into a data collection mode for relaying the GPS samples to the SCaN avionics subsystem for later transmission to White Sands.<BR><BR>The open-source, STRS-compliant waveform software and GB of GPS scintillation data will be enduring products of the flight demonstration.  The STRS infrastructure will be expanded with the STRS tool kit produced during this project.  The STRS tool kit will be similar to the OSSIE tool kit for the SCA, providing automatic code generation of STRS wrappers and interfaces.  An eclipse-based framework will provide drag-and-drop of components for developing STRS-compliant software.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The SBIR is producing product valuable to NASA across a breadth of missions  such as ISS, TIROS, Stardust, Mini-Sat, and CubeSats.  The scintillation-hardening improves the reliability of GPS for lower-orbit missions and the STRS-compliance permits mission redundancy.  A software-defined radio implementation allows a single hardware element to function as either a conventional radio, or GPS, providing backup and redundancy for platforms such as the ISS and high-value remote sensing platforms.  <BR><BR>Packages such as the Stardust mission's return capsule can benefit from the flexibility of a software defined radio implementation that can provide GPS and communications from a single hardware system, saving cost, weight, and power.  Scintillation hardening improves mission reliability and flexibility.  <BR><BR>Lower cost, low-orbit missions benefit directly from the STRS-compliant software package that enables low-cost, single-radio hardware systems that can function as a communications system or GPS system.  Because scintillation effects increase at the lower altitudes, mission reliability will be improved with the scintillation hardening.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		CubeSats have primarily been a university curiosity.  The August 2012 launch of the Atlas V from Vandenberg AFB ferried 11 CubeSats as auxiliary payloads.  Of the eleven, three are government or Department of Defense, and three are commercial satellites.   Although we anticipate university interest to continue, the presence of the Department of Defense and commercial satellites in this launch indicates this market is about to open up with significant funding and resources.  We believe there is great potential for STRS products and our GPS waveform in CubeSats.<BR><BR>The most likely commercial product though, is software services.  Similar to the dilemma confronted by Red Hat software in 1993, there is an established tier or monopoly of space product contractors and suppliers.  To penetrate the market, we must provide a disruptive product that will compel system integrators to investigate our product.  'Free' is a powerful economic force, and one that has been successful in switching many markets from traditional suppliers to smaller and more agile software developers.<BR><BR>Our business model is to develop the STRS Eclipse-based software tools and distribute them open source.  We will also publish a scintillation-hardened GPS software as open source.  Because schedule is equivalent to cost for many programs, we will provide subscriptions and consulting for those programs desiring direct assistance.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Need:  NASA faces challenges in imaging and characterizing faint astrophysical objects within the glare of brighter stellar sources. Achieving a very low background requires control of both scattered and diffracted light. <BR>Significance of the Innovation: Aligned arrays of carbon nanotubes have recently been recognized as having world-leading optical absorption, far above competing state of the art materials.   The nanotube array's diffuse reflectance (10-7) was demonstrated at two orders of magnitude lower than commercially available low reflectance carbons (10-5).  The integrated total reflectance 0.045%, bested the field of competing materials, which are typically >1% at optical wavelengths. However, these arrays were produced on silicon, so they have limited utility for aerospace applications. NanoLab identified the potential to grow these arrays on flexible substrates, and proposed a Phase I effort to explore their properties.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The need for stray light control is pervasive, throughout multiple NASA missions. Among the applications we have considered for the aligned arrays, some are 'Aerospace only." These include: IR detector cold shields, coronagraph baffles, space-borne optical systems, spectro-radiometers, cryogenic radiometers, occulters, sharp edged diaphragms & blades, and passive thermal control coatings w/ tailored absorptance/emittance.  We expect that these coatings, once advanced to a sufficient TRL, will be able to provide significant enhancements to a number of missions.   The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and New Worlds Technology Development Program (NWTP) are two target programs where we recognize the coating could have a dramatic impact on the performance of the optical train.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Non-NASA, optical applications we have identified for the coating includes: black layer for contrast enhancement in displays and LED modules, solar energy absorbers,thermal radiation detectors (bolometers), laser energy sensors, black body sources and calibrators, and optical packaging for cameras, telescopes, & microscopes.<BR>Non-optical applications are also possible using a variant of this technology.<BR>These include: High performance supercapacitors, battery electrodes, chemical sensors /detectors,<BR>field emission cathodes (xray sources, electric propulsion, microscopy), thermal interface materials<BR>thermoacoustic loudspeakers, nanotube yarns, super-hydrophobic coatings, and gecko foot adhesives.

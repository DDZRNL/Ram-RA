		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		HJ Science & Technology, Inc. proposes to develop a novel high pressure "pump-on-a-chip" (HPPOC) technology capable of generating high pressure and flow rate on the microchip level.  When combined with a "valve-on-a-chip" (VOC) platform, HPPOC is naturally suited for NASA planetary science applications including on-chip HPLC sample manipulation and analysis.  In Phase I, we have established the technical feasibility of the technology by fabricating a set of HPPOC chips and successfully demonstrating the required maximum pressures and flow rates.  In addition, we have also established a novel HPPOC actuated VOC platform.  In Phase II, we will construct, test, and deliver a high performance and low power consumption microfluidic sample manipulation manifold prototype.  In particular, we will build an integrated on-chip HPLC buffer and sample injection pump and valve manifold specifically engineered to support the chip-based LC-MS research effort at GSFC.  In addition, the Phase II work will also be performed in parallel with efforts to develop such manifolds for the commercial analytical markets.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed high pressure "pump-on-a-chip" (HPPOC) microfluidics technology can be readily adapted to enhance NASA's miniature scientific instrumentations for in-situ exploration of bodies in the solar system.  In particular, it can be employed to support the current chip-based HPLC instrumentation being developed to analyze organic molecules and biomarker on Mars surface to find signature of life. Other planetary environments for the in-situ explorations of the chemical and biological composition of soils and ice include Europa and Titan.  In addition to planetary science applications, the proposed HPPOC technology has other broad NASA applications including on-chip biosensors, electrochemical sensors as well as high pressure micropumps for fluid positioning, mixing, metering, storage, and filtering systems.  Finally, the HPPOC technology can also be leveraged for astronauts' clinical diagnostics, spacecraft and biosphere environmental monitoring, and toxicology studies.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The high pressure "pump-on-a-chip" (HPPOC) microfluidics technology described in this proposal possesses significant commercial potential for a wide range of technologies and applications in markets ranging from specialty medical and aerospace industries to consumer electronics. Commercial devices based on such microfluidics technology envisioned include on-chip HPLC for protein, drug, and chemical separation and analysis, drug delivery systems, portable environmental and health monitoring systems, and miniature high pressure actuators.

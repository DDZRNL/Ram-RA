		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Space Micro-Arizona State University (ASU) team will develop an all-digitally controlled, wide temperature range point-of-load switch-mode DC-DC regulator core with built-in self-test (BIST) functionality which meets space radiation requirements. In Phase II we will complete a design and fabricate into silicon at Tower-Jazz foundry and demonstrate the electrical, thermal, and radiation performance to meet NASA mission needs.  This R&D translates into substantial benefits to NASA in extreme temperature (and radiation) environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Cross cutting NASA space applications including LEO, GEO, lunar and deep space missions. A unique application is for the extreme temperature and radiation environments of Mars, moon, and other remote planets. Virtually all NASA space programs have a demand for this product. NASA applications range from space shuttle, space station, earth sensing missions e.g. (EOS), and deep space missions. NASA programs/missions that will benefit include new lunar and Martian landers and orbiters.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This novel technology and evolving Space Micro products may benefit many commercial space platforms, both LEO and GEO telecommunication satellites, such as Intelsat, Direct TV, XM radio, Orbcomm and Iridium Next telecom constellation replenishment, plus standard industry busses including Lockheed's A2100, and Boeing's HS-702. Civil earth sensing applications such as weather/metrology applications e.g. (NOAA GOES and Landsat) can also benefit. The large DoD space industry, including USAF, MDA, NRO, and new Army nanosat programs at SMDC will directly benefit. Among these programs are AEHF upgrades, GPS follow-ons, MDA's STSS and PTSS, USAF TacSat family, Operationally Responsive Space (ORS), and Army SMDC nanosat family. The entire Cubesat initiative including NRO's Colony program and USAF SENSE program would benefit. This technology and products will also address emerging MDA radiation threats. These programs include AKV, THAAD, AEGIS, SM3 Block IIB, and GMD for Blocks 2016 and beyond. With the new challenge of atmospheric neutrons to High Altitude Airship (HAA) programs and NASA or Air Force UAV programs, this R&D and product will be a timely solution. Other military applications may include strategic missiles (Trident and Air Force upgrades), as well as many DoD tactical weapon programs with nuclear survival levels.

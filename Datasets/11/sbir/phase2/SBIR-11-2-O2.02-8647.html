		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NOFBX propulsion technology is being developed actively for a number of applications including a flight experiment on the International Space Station NOFBX propellant has unique electrical properties that allow the potential for development of an extremely low energy ignition mechanism when coupled with the design of an NOFBX combustion chamber. This has the potential for dramatically reducing the volume, mass, voltage, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) emissions. The development we are proposing is a very low energy ignition system that utilizes the unique attributes of the NOFBXTM propellant that minimizes the volume, mass, and voltage of a block redundant system to be used in NOFBX propulsion systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed igniter development is specific to NOFBX&#153; propellant-based systems.  Unlike other liquid propellant options, NOFBX&#153; propellant has a low energy ignition threshold.  Existing igniters are designed with much higher energy spark requirements to address the challenge of reliable ignition of other spark-ignited liquid propulsion technologies.  Therefore, there are no igniters currently on the market that are well suited to NOFBX&#153; engines, which is the motivation for this proposal.  Because this igniter would be manufactured and sold as part of NOFBX&#153; propulsion systems, the market for this technology is closely tied to adoption and use of NOFBX&#153; propulsion technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NOFBX technology is currently being developed under a NASA BAA for flight on the International Space Station as a commercial flight experiment. The proposed activity would upgrade the ignition element of this flight system reducing mass, volume, and power of the device as well as conductive and radiative emission characteristics. Given the commercial interest in the NOFBX propulsion technology, we anticipate this block upgrade ignition module to be readily integrated into the NOFBX product line being developed by Innovation Space Propulsion Systems, the licensee of NOFBX technology.

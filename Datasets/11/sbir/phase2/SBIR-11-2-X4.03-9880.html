		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR project is to develop a novel Hemispherical and Dynamic Camera(HDC) with ultra-wide field of view and low geometric distortion. The novel technology we proposed would lead to ultra-compact, low-power, light weight, and high resolution hemispherical camera for EVAs.   We successfully completed the Phase 1 project with a novel optical design, functional prototypes, extensive experimental results and commercialization potential. All Phase 1 objectives are met and exceeded.<BR>Phase 2 program will afford us to design and build a fully functional miniature EVA camera systems, and perform extensive tests for NASA's EMU and EVA applications. Capitalizing upon the breakthrough we have made thus far, we propose the following Phase 2 technical objectives:     <BR>Objective 1:   Design and build a fully functional prototype of the EMU camera system; <BR>Objective 2:   Carry out extensive validation experiments and improve the EMU camera prototype;<BR>Objective 3:   Design and build a prototype of EVA Smart PTZ camera; <BR>Objective 4:   Carry out extensive validation experiments and improve EVA Smart PTZ prototype;<BR>Objective 5:   Work closely with COTR to facilitate NASA applications and broad adoption of the Neo360 optics and Smart PTZ technologies developed under this SBIR;<BR>Objective 6:   Pursue commercialization of the developed Neo360 and Smart PTZ technology.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Future EVAs need to support high resolution imagery with ultra compact, low-power, high definition (HD) cameras and low loss compressed digital data output for radio frequency (RF) transmissions or IP networks. Hemispherical and dynamic cameras are desired for EVAs, where the hemispherical cameras take 360-degrees video of a crewmember, distorting (wrapping) the views through optics and then undistorting (unwrapping) those views via software on the ground to pan /zoom for total situational awareness.  <BR>The proposed novel optical design would lead to ultra-compact, low-power, light weight, and high resolution hemispherical dynamic camera (HDC) for EVAs. The novel optics can also be used in the design of high performance cameras with different field of views (such as panoramic or wide FOV) for other NASA applications, such as robotic vehicles, docking, and rescue missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to applications to NASA space missions, break-through in novel optical design technology could have wide-spread commercial applications in various commercial products for diversified markets/segments, such as: <BR>* Cell phone cameras: compact, light weight and low-power optical unwrapping cameras.<BR>* Video surveillance:  wide-FOV video camera for target detection and tracking. <BR>* Automobile: novel designs of the rear view cameras or rear view mirrors.<BR>* Medical device: endoscopes and laparoscopes for minimally invasive surgeries. <BR>* Robotics: optical design techniques could lead to novel compact imaging sensors for robots.

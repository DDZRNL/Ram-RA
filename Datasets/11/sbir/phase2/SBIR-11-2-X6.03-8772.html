		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Long-duration robotic and manned space missions have a number of unique requirements for mission success. These include ultra-high reliability, safety, sustainability and affordability of launch vehicles and spacecraft. These requirements, in turn, are allocated among critical subsystems, such as engines, propellants, structures, software systems, thermal protection, power, avionics, life support, guidance, communication and navigation. In this vein, novel integrated system health management (ISHM) technologies that evolve with the system life-cycle, viz., concept-> design-> development-> production-> operations and training, are essential for meeting the requirements of safe and ultra-reliable, sustainable and affordable launch vehicles and spacecraft. To improve the ISHM process, QSI proposes to emphasize advancement in the two following areas: 1) generation/selection of an optimal sensor suite for the system based on user selected performance requirements and system level constraints, and 2) enhancement of a drill-down diagnosis/next best test capability in terms of algorithms that can be implemented for low power, low memory CPU/hardware that are available for embedded diagnosis using TEAMS-RT. Outcome technologies of the proposed focus are expected to allow an improved ISHM process to systemically trade-off prevention, detection, diagnosis, decision, and response strategies to mitigate the failure effects, as well as enhance FM development process by improved/new capabilities of TEAMS&#174; tool set.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's current vision to enhance the level of autonomy for vehicle health management and mission planning and recovery makes the proposed effort worthy of funding from several branches within it. Clearly, establishing the technology and the software so that it readily operates as part of NASA's next generation missions especially those that require long-term operability and automation (e.g., missions similar to the Curiosity Rover) allows NASA to utilize the continuous health assessment and mission satisfiability information from QSI's tool for improved mission execution and reconfiguration while improving safety, mission success probability and reducing flight controller and crew workload.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Among the other agencies, DoD and Air-force and Navy are the most potential customer for the resulting technologies. Large scale military systems (systems of systems) such as NORAD, Space Command ground segments, the Joint Strike Fighter fleet, the Navy shipboard platforms, Submarine Commands and ballistic missile defense (BMD) systems can be potential areas to field the proposed technology. In addition, UAVs, UMGs and other unmanned submersible vehicle markets could also be potential target for the proposed technology. The product is also expected to be of commercial value to the manufacturers of DoD and military's remotely guided weapons and reconnaissance systems. <BR><BR>Commercial air transport, space-based systems, underwater, and maritime (both civil and military) sectors can be the potential end user of the technologies developed from this effort. All these systems require the presence of mission critical systems whose operations are mostly automated and conducted in demanding circumstances. The techniques, algorithms and information workflow developed in this effort will enhance operational efficacy and contribute significantly to mission success through condition monitoring and aiding in the reconfiguration of critical systems and facilitating effective choices of mission plans.

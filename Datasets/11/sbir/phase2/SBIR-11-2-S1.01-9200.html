		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this proposal, we propose to demonstrate and build a widely tunable, narrow linewidth, single frequency fiber laser near 2.05 micron by developing an innovative Ho-doped single mode fiber. Such near 2.05 micron fiber laser is needed for coherent lidar and interferometric fiber sensing. Based on our successful demonstration in Phase I, our newly developed Ho-doped fibers have the capability of single frequency fiber laser operation in a wide spectral range from 2040nm up to 2100nm. In Phase II, we will further optimize our innovative H0-doped single mode fiber, develop a new laser cavity design for fast and broad tuning, build a deliverable prototype laser unit with wide mode-hop-free fast tuning to NASA.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) encompasses research in the areas of Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics, and Planetary Science. A major objective of SMD instrument development programs is to implement science measurement capabilities with smaller or more affordable spacecraft so development programs can meet multiple mission needs and therefore make the best use of limited resources. This proposed near 2 micron tunable narrow linewidth single frequency fiber laser can be used as innovative lidar component for measurements of the atmosphere and surface topography of the Earth, Mars, the Moon, and other planetary bodies. Because it is fiber based, this single frequency laser is compact, efficient, and extremely reliable.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Near 2 micron tunable single frequency fiber lasers have a number of potential non-NASA commercial applications. This eye-safe laser source can be used to build commercial lidar for ranging and surface topography applications, be used as the light source for fiber optical sensing, fast scanning biomedical imaging, and scientific research.

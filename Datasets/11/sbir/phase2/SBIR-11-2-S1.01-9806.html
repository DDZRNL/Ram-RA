		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This Phase II program will build and deliver a tunable single-frequency laser operating in the 1.645 micron region on optimum CH4 absorption line features.  Under this program an all-solid-state parametric-converted laser will be delivered to NASA LaRC which will be suitable for acquiring range-resolved and column CH4 measurements, and compatible with integration into an airborne methane DIAL system under future programs.  Due to its relative insensitivity to aerosol and cloud interferences, a DIAL system based on this pulsed laser source will be ideal for NASA investigating high-latitude CH4 releases over polar ice sheets, permafrost regions, wetlands and over open ocean during night and day. In addition the methane lidar system has commercial applications in detection of fossil fuel leaks.  This development advances the laser system TRL from 3 to 5. The proposed laser is designed to be compatible with manned or UAV platforms and traceable to space=based instruments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA markets include planned airborne metane DIAL systems and eventually space-based sensors. These applications are all for low-volume high value systems, which makes DIAL instruments a viable product for small business.  Methane is cited as an important atmospheric variable by several panel reports in the Decadal Survey for Earth Science Applications from Space. NASA's plan for climate-centric investigations recognizes the importance of CH4 and discusses the potential for capability on the follow-on to OCO-2.  A U.S. Carbon Cycle Science Plan currently under development recognizes the importance of CH4 and emphasizes the importance of an integrated system to collect and maintain the essential data that drive scientific understanding. The laser source proposed under this SBIR directly addresses these needs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Methane lidar systems are being deployed for commercial gas leak detection, mainly in Europe, and as airborne pollution sensors and for wide area characterization of methane atmospheric content in support of global warming research. The major contributors in this area are in Germany and France.   Currently there is little analogous work in the US.  The sensor developed under this SBIR program is designed primarily for airborne deployment.  WIth increased exploitation of natural gas reserves detection of leaks from wells and pipe lines is becoming increasingly more important.  We anticipate that successful demonstration of airborne methane DAIL by NASA will introduce this technique to the commercial sector.  Energy companies, state and national government are potential customers for airborne DIAL systems.  National governments of energy producing nations also represent a rich market for this technology.

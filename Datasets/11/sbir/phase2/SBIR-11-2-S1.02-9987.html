		<b>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</b> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<br>
		A few NASA decadal missions such as the Aerosol Clouds Ecosystems 
(ACE) mission require space-based millimeter-wave radar apertures to 
complete the science objectives. We propose to create dual-polarized 
microfabricated copper-based antenna apertures with integrated MMICs 
that go beyond the capabilities funded to date at the upper frequencies 
of interest by enabling electronic scanning at W-band frequencies, while
 not precluding the co-location of Ka-band capability in the same 
aperture. This Phase II effort will constitute element-, feed-, MMIC-, 
and array-level analyses of the trade space for the proposed aperture. 
In addition we will provide a hardware demonstration of a W-band 
transmit/receive array tile showing MMIC integration on the necessary 
scale for W-band phased arrays and high-efficiency dual polarized 
antenna elements.

		<b>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<br>
		There are several applications for active mm-wave antenna arrays 
outside of NASA. NOAA and other government organizations use W-band for 
instruments with similar frequency capability as what would be required 
for the NASA Aerosol, Cloud Ecosystem (ACE) mission. Raytheon uses this 
frequency range for Active Denial, and a more efficient front end could 
be useful for this type of system. In addition, the Air Force is very 
interested in satellite communication capability at V-Band, and the 
proposed effort would have application at these lower frequencies. The 
DARPA system technology office recently released a broad agency 
announcement for W-band silicon-based phased arrays. Improved antenna 
and amplifier efficiency for the front end of these sensors would be 
achieved using the proposed technology. The dual-polarized 
microfabricated copper-based antenna apertures with integrated MMICs 
present enabling capabilities for each of these applications and others 
using this frequency range.

		<b>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<br>
		There are several applications for active mm-wave antennas of interest
 to NASA. Active millimeter-wave imaging is very promising for a wide 
range of remote sensing NASA missions including the measurement of 
precipitation and characterization of cloud properties as for the 
Aerosol, Cloud and Ecosystems (ACE) mission The Curiosity rove as part 
of the Mars Science Laboratory, landed on Mars in August of 2012 using a
 lower-frequency radar sensor for through-dust imaging.  Interest exists
 to move the technology up in frequency to decrease the size and weight 
of the landing radar. In addition, satellite communication is moving to 
V-Band, and the proposed effort would have application at these lower 
frequencies. The dual-polarized microfabricated copper-based antenna 
apertures with integrated MMICs present enabling capabilities for each 
of these applications and others using this frequency range.

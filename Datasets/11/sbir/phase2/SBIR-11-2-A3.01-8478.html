		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Phase I verified ADS-B-ER feasibility-based on compatibility with the ADS-B operational standards and design specs, bandwidth and the iPAD EFB capability for performing the trajectory computations for avoiding hazardous weather, terrain, traffic and restricted airspace. We then assured that the &#150;ER software can interface these waypoints to large variety of existing GA analog and digital auto pilots (approximately 100,000 GA airplanes are equipped with autopilots). The Phase I work demonstrated feasibility by carefully evaluating candidate hardware options. The overall target is a decisive enabler for GA NextGen ops as well as for improved levels of GA safety.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Our ADS-B-ER system software specifically its optimum trajectory modules will serve both NASA's and the FAA's NextGen R&D mission in the areas of safe mixed geographically diverse traffic handling development and in GA safety. NASA Langley's ATOL facility can employ our system for its NextGen simulations, by running our ER scenarios, they can evaluate the effects this has on their traffic management metrics. NASA can also employ our ADS-B-ER system hardware AND SOFTWARE IN ITS Cirrus Design SR-22 or other Flight research airplanes.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Since US aircraft must be ADS-B equipped by 2020, an FAA mandate, our system has an assured market demand. MUNRO will commercialize the ADS-B-ER system with our MISATS avionics industry cost share partners who have the expertise to assure FAA Certification of the end product.  There is no such lifesaving potential enhanced safety ADS-B product for General Aviation operations in NextGen. We estimate a startup 2,000/year domestic & 500/year global market growing to 10,000/year in 5 years.

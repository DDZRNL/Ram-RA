		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		DSS proposes to systematically mature, mitigate risk for; and perform hardware-based ground validations / demonstrations of a low-cost, high technology payoff, ISS-based flight experiment that will allow key relevant space-flight environmental validation of our innovative Roll-Out Solar Array (ROSA) technology.  The ROSA flex-blanket solar array technology provides game-changing affordability and performance, and delivers a performance paradigm shift in terms of: significantly lower cost, greater specific power, more compact stowage volume, higher structural performance, less complexity, and  more modularity / scalability than state-of-the-art solar arrays.  A critical aspect of readying the enabling ROSA technology for infusion into potential end-user applications is to increase the TRL to 7+ via test / analytical validation of hardware in a relevant spaceflight environment for: Deployment, Deployed Dynamics and Photovoltaic Power Production. The ISS provides a ready and cost-effective relevant space environment (zero-G, vacuum and solar illumination/thermal) test-bed for the validation of these key technology areas via the straightforward flight experiment proposed. The Phase 2 effort is intended to lead to the definition of a comprehensive and test-validated ISS-based ROSA experiment design and operations plan that will facilitate / accelerate an ISS experiment manifest / review / approval process to significantly shorten the time to flight. The program includes: comprehensive risk mitigation for the flight experiment that includes hardware-based testing / ground simulation of experiment operations (including ISS structure and robotic arm interfaces) with functional and flight-like experiment hardware and generation of documentation to facilitate ISS flight experiment board requirements, integration, operations and safety reviews.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential NASA space flight applications are comprised of practically all NASA missions that require power production through deployment of photovoltaic devices.  The technology is very well suited for high-power, high voltage Exploration missions, SEP missions, deep space LILT missions, high strength and high stiffness CEV, COTS/CRS, rovers, and other NASA mission applications requiring significant design flexibility, scalability, modularity and low cost.  The proposed (ISS-flight validated) ROSA technology will undoubtedly provide discriminating performance and will be mission-enabling for many NASA missions when compared to current state-of-the-art systems; and its ultra-high performance, affordability, configuration flexibility and low-parts, and elegantly-simple deployment reliability is game-changing for NASA.  The proposed Phase 2 flight experiment hardware development / risk mitigation; and eventual successful ISS space flight TRL 7+ validation of the ROSA technology will provide a reliable replacement for expensive and inferior-performing solar arrays, and will enable many future NASA missions requiring: high specific power, high stiffness / strength, scalability  / modularity, high stowed packaging efficiency, autonomous retraction and re-deployment capability, large-area / high power capability, high voltage operation, LILT operation, and high radiation survivability.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A strong and solid commercial technology infusion path has been identified for the ROSA technology and proposed program, with exceptional commercial end-user interest in the technology and its continued development and near-term ISS flight-validation. ROSA is ideal as a direct replacement solar array for the large number of projected future commercial communications satellites that require ever-increasing power levels, and DoD surveillance / communication applications requiring the highest performing solar arrays. The proposed (ISS-flight validated) ROSA technology will undoubtedly provide discriminating performance and will be mission-enabling for many space missions when compared to current state-of-the-art systems; and its ultra-high performance, affordability, configuration flexibility and low-parts, and elegantly-simple deployment reliability is game-changing for the commercial space industry.  The anticipated Phase 2 program will completely justify, increase the feasibility of and provide key detailed ISS implementation design / planning for, and significantly reduce experiment risks for a cost-effective flight ROSA experiment that will rapidly mature and advance the TRL, and produce the much desired space-flight validation of the revolutionary ROSA solar array architecture required by commercial end-users. An ISS flight experiment is critical to providing a reliable, and high-fidelity ROSA solar array system that potentially would enable DoD and commercial space missio

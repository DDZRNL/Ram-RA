		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The protocols needed to coordinate the activities of distributed components, such as consensus algorithms, are notoriously difficult to design, implement, and verify.  Abstraction is the only way to gain intellectual control over this complex problem; so ATC-NY and Cornell University have developed Event Logic, a high-level model for describing and reasoning about distributed systems, and EventML, a high-level functional language for implementing distributed protocols by "programming with events."   Properties of EventML protocols can be formally verified by interactive theorem proving in the Nuprl environment.  To integrate these conceptual tools with standard processes of system development, and to make the labor intensive task of verifying protocol properties more efficient, ATC-NY is developing Emile.  Emile is a software tool that provides: a semantic interface to EventML that translates assertions about properties of EventML programs into logical forms to which powerful fully automated analysis tools can be applied, along with a "logical manager" that can direct analyses involving the interaction of these tools.  We will demonstrate Emile by using it to verify the key properties of EventML source code for standard consensus algorithms, such as Paxos.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Emile supports the development of critical protocols that underlie highly reliable distributed systems (whether systems are "naturally" distributed, or replicated for fault tolerance)&#151;for example, air traffic control.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Examples of non-NASA Commercial Applications requiring the support Emile provides for highly reliable distributed systems include the New York Stock Exchange, the AEGIS combat system, Google's Chubby service (on which Google File System and Google Analytics rely).

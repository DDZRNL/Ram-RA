		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Deployable Space Systems, Inc. (DSS), and Space Systems Loral as a key subcontractor and potential commercial infusion partner, will focus the proposed SBIR Phase 2 program on the TRL 5/6 technology maturation / development of an affordable, lightweight, high power, maximum performance solar array specifically configured to next-generation high power geostationary-earth-orbit commercial mission requirements, and in support of future NASA missions.  DSS's recently completed NASA SBIR Phase 1 program has established a TRL 3/4 classification for an innovative affordable maximum performance solar array as applied to a multitude of NASA and commercial missions.  Significant concept feasibility, design/analysis, trade study/evaluation, and proof-of-concept hardware build/test efforts executed during the Phase 1 program have validated the proposed technology as a potentially revolutionary photovoltaic flexible blanket solar array system that provides enabling performance in terms of:  High specific power / lightweight (up to 200 W/kg BOL at the array level with ZTJ PV), compact stowage volume (>60-80 kW/m3 BOL), high deployed strength and stiffness, mechanical and electrical simplicity, high reliability, high modularity, rapid production capability, high platform flexibility and applicability to many missions, and ultra-affordability (>24% recurring cost savings at a minimum).  Building off the success of the recently completed Phase 1 program, the proposed Phase 2 follow-on program will significantly increase technology readiness to TRL 5/6, ready it for an end-user qualification program, and drastically accelerate commercial infusion.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA space applications are comprised of practically all Space Science, Earth Science, Exploration, Planetary and Lunar Surface, and other missions that require affordable and high performance photovoltaic power production through solar arrays.  The technology is particularly suited for missions that require game-changing performance in terms of affordability, ultra-lightweight, and compact stowage volume.  The proposed technology will enable ultra-high power solar arrays for future Exploration missions through lightweight, compact stowage, and significant affordability.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA space applications are comprised of practically all missions that require high-efficiency photovoltaic power production through deployment of an ultra-lightweight and highly-modular solar array system.  The technology is particularly suited for missions that require game-changing performance in terms of affordability, ultra-lightweight, and compact stowage volume.  The proposed technology will enable ultra-high power solar arrays for future missions through lightweight, compact stowage, and significant affordability.  Applicable non-NASA space missions include: LEO surveillance, reconnaissance, communications and other critical payload/equipment satellites, LEO commercial mapping and critical payload/equipment satellites, MEO satellites & space-tugs, GEO commercial communications and critical payload/equipment satellites, and GEO communications and payload/equipment satellites.  The proposed technology also has tremendous dual-use non-space commercial private-sector applicability including fixed-ground and deployable/retractable mobile-ground based systems.

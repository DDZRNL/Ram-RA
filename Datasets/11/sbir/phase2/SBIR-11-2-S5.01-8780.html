		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Advanced Scientific Concepts, Inc. (ASC) is a small business that has developed 3D Flash LIDAR systems for space and terrestrial applications.  3D Flash LIDAR is ideal for determining real-time spacecraft trajectory, speed and orientation to the planet's surface, as well as evaluating potential landing sites.  Flash LIDAR sensors utilize a 3DFPA and rely on the illumination of a 10nsec pulse from a diode pumped solid state (DPSSL) q-switched Nd:YAG laser.  Improvements in pulse shape and stability are crucial to improve range resolution for higher resolution landing maps.  ASC is proposing an innovative approach to the laser and thermal management to meet NASAs requirement for a compact, robust planetary landing sensor.  An innovative approach for an optically triggered "semi-active" q-switch will allow for increased power stability in a very compact laser design.  The semi-active fused q-switch will eliminate the need for a mechanical or electro optical q-switch by actively bleaching the passive q-switch with a laser diode.  The advantage of the Cr4:YAG crystal over active q-switches is that it can be fused directly onto the YAG laser rod creating a monolithic laser cavity reducing the number of coated surfaces and the overall size.

		This sensor will increase the success of NASA operations such as:<BR>?	Mars Landed Exploration <BR>?	Exploration of Moons (ALHAT, Jupiter Icy Moons) <BR>?	Asteroid and Comet Rendezvous and Sample Return <BR>?	ISS Rendezvous and Docking (manned & unmanned)<BR>?	Space Situational Awareness<BR>?	Extravehicular Robotic Camera<BR>?	Rock Abundance and Distribution Maps <BR>?	Topographical Mapping <BR>?	Rover Mobility and Navigation <BR>NASA Langley Research Center has purchased two of ASC's existing FLVC systems for performing laboratory, field, and airborne test and evaluation of this technology for use on the ALHAT program.  A FLC been deployed for EDL helicopter and high altitude fixed wing experiments, and has shown excellent results.   ASC is continuing to develop and improve its line of 3D Flash LIDAR systems, one of which successfully flew on the Endeavor (STS-127) for AR&D testing.

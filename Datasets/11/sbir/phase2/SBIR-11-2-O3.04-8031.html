		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In Sub-topic O3.04, NASA has identified a need for control of material degradation to extend the life and reduce the life-cycle costs of piping systems subject to microbial influenced corrosion in the presence of untreated or brackish water.  The corrosion mechanisms of greatest interest are salt and acid attack due to exposure to brackish and untreated waters.  International Scientific Technologies, Inc., in conjunction with Ferrum College, proposes the development of a protective barrier conversion coating to prevent corrosion cell formation in steel substrates.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed polyoxometalate conversion coating will find application in reducing life-cycle costs of piping systems subject to microbial-influenced corrosion in the presence of untreated or brackish water.  The environmentally friendly chrome-free conversion coating is expected to perform not only as a corrosion inhibitor to microbially induced corrosion, but also function as a smart coating that will passivate metal exposed in organic-coating topcoats and at defects in the conversion coating.  The removal of toxic materials and reduction in operation and maintenance costs would be welcomed for control of material degradation in the nation's spaceport and propulsion test-facility infrastructure and ground and flight assets.  Other areas supported by NASA, such as the Air Transportation & Safety, Structures and Waste Storage/Treatment, could also make use of the conversion-coating technology.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) 2001 report on corrosion costs in the United States it is estimated that Corrosion costs U.S. industry and government agencies an estimated $276 billion/year.  Chrome-free environmentally friendly conversion coatings will find application in a variety of industrial sectors in reducing worker exposure to toxic materials and reduction of waste-treatment costs.  The corrosion inhibition of ferrous metals will lead to decreased failures due to microbial corrosion in pipelines and in manufacturing and construction materials in highly corrosive salt and acid environments.  It is expected that the coatings can be used in field applications for large structures at ambient temperatures rather than higher temperature alternatives that need to be applied in controlled environments.

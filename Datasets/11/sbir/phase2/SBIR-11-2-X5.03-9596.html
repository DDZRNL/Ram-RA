		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Based on the successful feasibility demonstration in Phase I, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to continue the development of a novel Structural Integrity Inspection and Visualization System (SIRIUS), which addresses NASA's need for compact nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of the structural integrity of spacecraft components and structures. SIRIUS is based on one-sided three-dimensional (3D) structure imaging via collecting the information on density profiles in multiple object cross sections through hard X-ray Compton-scattered imaging. The SIRIUS Phase I prototype system demonstrated excellent potential for 3D localization of defects in various aerospace materials and structures, such as thermal protection system (TPS) ceramic foam tiles, micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) shielding, spacecraft pressure walls, inflatable habitat structures, composite overwrapped pressure vehicles (COPV), aluminum-rubber composites, and metal honeycomb materials. In Phase II, POC will develop a compact, standalone version of the SIRIUS system with improved performance (in terms of resolution and data acquisition speed), as well as an advanced graphical user interface (GUI) for straightforward data acquisition and visualization. At the end of Phase II, POC will perform a TRL-6 demonstration of SIRIUS at the NASA facilities. SIRIUS will provide NASA with an effective NDE tool for both in-space and on-ground applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary NASA application of the proposed SIRIUS system is a compact NDE system that can be used for evaluating the structural integrity of spacecraft components during spaceflight, with the capability of providing reliable, high-resolution assessments of the locations and extent of damage within thermal protection, MMOD shields, inflatable habitats, EVA suits and vehicles, electronic systems, conductive structures, pressure vessels, and other lightweight materials, with the capability of functioning in hard-to-access areas within both pressurized habitable compartments and external space environments. Additional NASA applications include in situ NDE of large-area non-uniform multilayer aluminum/titanium/composite structures with complicated geometry used in the development of advanced aircraft and spacecraft, providing accurate identification, localization, and measurements of all types of internal and surface defects.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Military applications of SIRIUS will include in situ NDE of U.S. Navy, Army, and Air Force military aircraft with large-area non-uniform multilayer aluminum/titanium/composite structures that have complicated geometry (and also combined textile polymeric, ceramic, and metal matrix composite structures). SIRIUS will also be used for the NDE of airplane, helicopter, and missile parts containing electronics, mechanics, propellants, explosives, etc., to detect their defects and integrity. SIRIUS can be incorporated by the U.S. Navy, Army, and Air Force as a reliable, rapid, robotic, easy-to-use NDE system. Potential DHS applications include the detection of vehicle-borne contraband, drugs, and explosives. The commercial availability of SIRIUS includes its use for in situ NDE of large-area non-uniform components in aging and modern commercial aircraft, spacecraft, light marine vessels, and any application requiring defect detection for multilayer ceramic, composite, metallic, and plastic non-uniform structures.

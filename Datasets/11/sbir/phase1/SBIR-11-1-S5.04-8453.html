		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To-date, the realization of small-scale, high-performance propulsion systems for challenging in-space maneuvers requiring high delta-V and acceleration over a short period of time (i.e. sample return), has largely been limited by the lack of regeneratively-cooled thrust chamber assemblies and turbopumps in the 100-1,000lbf thrust class.  Ventions proposes to overcome this limitation by developing a 500lbf, LOX-cooled, pump-fed engine for in-space propulsion applications.  The Phase I effort will focus on: 1. Overall design of a 500lbf engine; 2. Detailed design and fabrication of a sub-scale, LOX-cooled main combustion chamber; and 3. Experimental hot-fire testing of a LOX / IPA combustion chamber assembly to evaluate cooling channel performance and LOX quality at the injector inlet.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The propulsion system proposed herein represents a low-cost technology that can be integrated into a number of spacecraft designs with the ultimate goal of providing high-performance liquid bipropellant rocket engines for challenging in-space missions. The use of LOX for regenerative cooling of the main combustion chamber enables propellant combinations, engine cycles and / or operating points not currently available for in-space missions.  The availability of on-board pressurization for higher chamber pressure operation (without the excessive weight penalty of propellant storage tanks), can further result in a significant increase in the capability for missions requiring large Delta-V over a short period (such as sample return, powered landings and ascent, orbit insertion and change, etc.), thereby easing implementation of space borne operations through a combination of reduced size, weight, improved reliability and lower cost.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA commercial applications include: 1. Upper stage propulsion. 2. Apogee kick motors for small- and medium-scale<BR>spacecraft. 3. Standalone non-aerospace applications of the pump technology in industrial and desalination settings for water and cryogenics, and as an alternative to other high-pressure liquid pumps.

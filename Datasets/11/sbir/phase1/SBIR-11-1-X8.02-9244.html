		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Future space exploration energy-storage needs span a wide range of requirements. NASA's Exploration missions will require safe, human-rated, high specific energy, high energy density and high efficiency-storage systems that can be used in space and on the moon and Mars. These energy storage devices need to be used in applications such as Landers, Rovers, and extravehicular activities (EVAs). NOHMs Technologies, Inc. proposes to develop a novel battery based on Lithium-Sulfur chemistry that has a demonstrated specific energy of 1875 Wh/kg with a theoretical specific energy of 2600 Wh/kg, while yielding a dramatic 3-4x reduction in weight, size, and cost.  The proposed technology is based on innovative sulfur-infused carbon composite cathode materials developed at Cornell University. These materials overcome the poor cycle life problems that have plagued Lithium-Sulfur batteries by encapsulating sulfur in nanometer-sized mesoporous carbon capsules. In addition, the proposed Phase I research will focus on the development of stable, non-flammable, non-volatile, nano-hybrid electrolytes and separators that overcomes lithium dendrite formation in all lithium based battery configurations, significantly enhancing their safety. Phase I will demonstrate the potential of our proposed system to meet the performance parameters specified by NASA.

		NOHMs nanostructured battery technology will enhance capability extended duration of future NASA space missions.  Missions will continue to become more complex and increase in duration using manned and unmanned space vehicles, landers, rovers, satellites, and EVA. Next-generation space platforms will continue to demand more power to sustain longer-range communication, increasingly complex sensing capability, and longer range for manned and unmanned vehicles. Advances in vehicle transport and exploration systems will continue to increase power and energy demand beyond the capabilities of commercially available battery systems. Additionally, as NASA continues to plan for missions to the Moon and Mars, there is increasing logistical burden to transport vehicle and portable power systems to the remotest of destinations. <BR>Battery-powered robotic systems for space and military use, including UAVs, Unmanned Ground Vehicles are a growing market worldwide. Because of this increased interest around the world, the global market for robotics will grow from $5.8 billion in 2010 to more than $8 billion in 2016, with the United States as the largest by far with over 50% of the value share held by American firms. Effectively integrating new, longer lasting, higher energy density batteries into space mission would give vendors a significant value proposition with which to expand their share in a multibillion dollar industry in which virtually every space system requires batteries.

		<BR>
		While lithium ion batteries have garnered a lot of attention, secondary lithium-sulfur batteries employing sulfur as the cathode and metallic lithium as the anode offers the highest energy storage potential of any two solid elements. They offer more than twice the energy capacity of currently deployed lithium ion battery technology with half the weight.  If the potential of these batteries can be harnessed, they are expected to disrupt current lithium ion cell technology because of their higher energy density and the low cost and wide-spread availability of sulfur. <BR>NOHMs is positioned well initially as a material manufacturer (cathode and electrolyte) that will approach major battery manufacturers (e.g. Panasonic, A123 Systems, LG Chem, NEC, Johnson Controls) as (1) customers or (2) potential licensees. NOHMs materials are suitable for three energy storage sectors.<BR>?	Mobile Consumer Devices: Most competitive market with greatest sales potential.<BR>?	Electric Vehicles: Fastest growing market with strong incentives.<BR>?	Stationary Energy Storage: Least competitive market with high potential for federal and state subsidies.

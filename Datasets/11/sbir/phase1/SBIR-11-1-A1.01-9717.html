		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Fibertek proposes a multi-function, high energy, eye-safe 1550 nm band pulsed fiber-laser lidar system for airborne sensing of various kinetic aviation hazards. The lidar system includes the laser transmitter, the receiver, a telescope, and a scanner. The lidar functionality will include ground and air speed measurement, wind and wake sensing, altitude measurement and terrain mapping, reduced visibility sensing, and ice sensing. The proposed system is based on Fibertek&#8223;s proprietary laser architecture that utilize state-of-the-art fiber optical, electro-optic and RF analog and digital electronic component technologies. The expected TRL range at end of SBIR Phase I is TRL 2, and at the end of SBIR Phase II is TRL 4-5. We expect to deliver a packaged prototype lidar system at the end of Phase II for NASA laboratory and field testing.

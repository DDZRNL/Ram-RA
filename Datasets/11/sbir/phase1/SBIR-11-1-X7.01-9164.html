		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR will study the application of a brain machine interface (BMI) to enable crew to remotely operate and monitor robots from inside a flight vehicle, habitat and/or during an extra-vehicular activity (EVA).   The goal is to improve robot operator productivity, situational awareness, and effectiveness.  With the application of a BMI technology an astronaut in an extravehicular suit could great improve their capability of working with rover, arm and free flying robots.  The use of BMI is being studied extensively worldwide for its application in aiding people who are paralyzed or for persons missing limbs to control prosthetics.  This project will study ways to apply this research to robotic control in space applications.  System architectures will be defined for both the EVA and IVA crew member.  The goal for phase II will be to demonstrate BMI in a space robotic control application.   This research also has the benefit of supporting technology of use by those who are paralyzed or who have prosthetic limbs.

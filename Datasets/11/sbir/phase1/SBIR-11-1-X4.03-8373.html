		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Nanohmics proposes the integration of two major paradigms to optimize and improve current EVA communication systems. To address the implementation of tunable front-end transceivers, nanoimprint methodologies will be used to create nanoscale dimensions sub-systems designed to fit flexible printed circuits requirements. The second paradigm will bring software-defined radio (SDR) mesh networks methodologies as part of an embedded platform based on rad-hard reconfigurable devices (e.g. FPGA) with encryption capabilities.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		SDR radios based on NEMS technology will enable NASA to be a relevant player in the communications arena since weight, mass and power reduction are direct results of the proposed system. <BR><BR>A list of possible applications where the proposed system can be applied is shown as follows<BR><BR>1. Frequency agile radio<BR>2. Cognitive radio systems (networks)<BR>3. Remote Space Instrumentation<BR>4. Communication links for Extra Vehicular activities <BR>5. Compatibility with a wide range of equipment (including outdated radio systems)<BR>6. Ad-Hoc Networks for remote sensing and peer-to-peer communication<BR>7. Network integration and dynamic spectrum allocation<BR>8. Innovative circuit design for nanoscale technologies<BR>9. Reduction of overall energy budget <BR>10.Dynamic systems for telemetry

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		As part of the spacesuit pressure garment, the EVA glove incorporates a silicone pad on the palm for protection of the bladder from cuts and punctures. Repeated gripping and rotational motion cause delamination of the silicone pad from the underlying Vectran&#174; fabric. In addition, frequent scuffing causes damage to the palm pad and loss of material and material functions. Improving adhesion of the silicone layer with the underlying fabric, and enhancing the overall mechanical properties of the glove surface, will beneficially impact extravehicular activities by the astronauts. In Phase I, we propose to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a silicone nanocomposite palm pad material with enhanced adhesive and mechanical properties, and the ability to self-heal scratches and microcracks. The novel silicone nanocomposite combines a nanoscale additive and a self-healing agent into a unique structure in ways never done before. The program is a collaborative effort with a NASA spacesuit contractor. Test coupons with a silicone nanocomposite coating on Vectran&#174; fabric will be used to demonstrate proof of concept. The Phase II program will build upon the Phase I demonstration effort by implementing the technology in a prototype glove assembly.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to the EVA glove, the proposed silicone nanocomposite technology will help to reduce the coating weight on airbags used for MER applications while maintaining or increasing the seam strength.  This generic technology may also be utilized in a broad range of space applications, including inflatable space structures, parachutes and space suits.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		An immediate commercial application of the silicone nanocomposite technology is heat resistant silicone gloves/pot holders/oven mitts, which represent a specialty rubber glove sector of the global rubber gloves market. The proposed silicone nanocomposite technology also has immense potential in industrial textile coatings that are used in various sectors, including manufacturing and processing, transportation, construction, sports and leisure, and personal and property protection.

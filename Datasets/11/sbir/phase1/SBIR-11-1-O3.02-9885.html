		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Genova Engineering proposes to develop and demonstrate a toolset of discrete devices and extraction kits which will leverage existing on-orbit facilities and will permit an expansion of molecular biology capabilities onboard ISS. This toolset, Nucleic Acid And Protein Isolation (NAAPI), is a near-term deployable technology which gives the ISS researcher the ability to isolate DNA, RNA and proteins from precious biological samples. By isolating these target molecules, sample volumes can be reduced by orders of magnitude resulting in reduced downmass. This technology also proposes to adapt a state of the art stabilization technique to enable long-term ambient storage of nucleic acids. This system offers the unique ability to isolate total protein for storage and/or analysis.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology will introduce the ability to carry out sample preparation for molecular biology tests from a variety of sample matrices (cell culture, plant tissue, blood, swab, etc). These NASA applications includes processing astronaut blood, urine, and other body fluids to isolate and identify infectious agents or for gene expression studies. Additional application can be found in monitoring water supplies or life support systems for microbial contamination. The technology is extensible and comprised of discrete components which can be adapted for multiple tasks related to fluid manipulation and sample processing.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Multiple levels of containment needed for ISS use can be incorporated into potential commercial applications that require DNA, RNA and protein isolation from highly infectious human samples. Segregation of samples from multiple applications of wash buffer during processing cycles, will reduce the number of disposables used and lab efficiency can be improved.

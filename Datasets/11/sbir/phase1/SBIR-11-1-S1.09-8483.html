		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Makel Engineering and the Ohio State University propose to develop a harsh environment tolerant gas sensor array for atmospheric<BR>analysis in future Venus missions. The proposed instrument will be very compact, require low power, and ruggedly packaged to be<BR>compatible with balloon a payload for atmospheric composition analysis. The goal is to provide information on local SOx (or total<BR>sulfur compounds if a reactive filter is used), CO, O2, NOx, H2 and/or water vapor concentrations in order to complement other<BR>measurement systems that were targeted in the 2009 Venus Flagship Mission Study such as a GC-MS, nephelometer, or<BR>camera/optical detector

		<BR>
		This proposal targets complementary technology development to enhancement measurement systems that were targeted in the 2009<BR>Venus Flagship Mission Study such as a GC-MS, nephelometers, or cameras/optical detectors. Significant development of the<BR>baseline instrumentation (GC/mass spectrometers) will be needed to meet the specifications for the 2021 mission. The proposed<BR>array of miniaturized, robust, high temperature (600-800 C) solid electrolyte chemical sensors can significantly augment decent<BR>phase data and provide useful instrumentation options during mission development. Similar sensors can be developed for other<BR>planetary studies with potentially harsh atmospheres.<BR>This class of sensors has been developed by MEI and OSU in cooperation with NASA and directed primarily towards engine exhaust<BR>measurements for enhanced flight measurement capabilities for future use in engine control and IVHM

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This technology has military and commercial applications as well, which fits well with NASA's mission for the promotion of advanced<BR>technology for civil aviation. This technology will also apply to in-situ measurement capabilities for coal power plants, industrial<BR>burners, boilers, gas turbines, and other engines.

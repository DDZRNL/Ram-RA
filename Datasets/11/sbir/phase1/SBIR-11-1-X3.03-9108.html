		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		ORBITEC, in collaboration with Lucigen, proposes a rapid genetic detector for spaceflight water systems to enable real-time detection of E. coli with minimal consumables and crew time. The Rapid Coliform Detector (RCD) amplifies the genetic material in a liquid sample to allow near real-time identification of specific genetic sequences, in this case, that of E. coli. This easy-to-use device incorporates a patented polymerase enzyme that enables rapid RNA amplification by reagents with superior long-term shelf life and thermal stability. A color change indicator will show the presence or absence of coliform bacteria in the water within 30 minutes. The results of the Phase 1 will be test data from prototype test kits and chemical reagents for rapid coliform detection which brings the RCD to TRL 4. The anticipated results of the Phase 2 are a flight-like prototype of the complete test kit and reaction chamber, performance test results at 1g, and reduced gravity operational test results, which bring the technology to TRL 6.

		The RCD provides indication of the presence of E. coli within 30 minutes of sampling, with minimal consumable hardware. The RCD reduces crew time by eliminating the need to unstow, check, and restow a test kit after 2 days, and again after 5 days. Unlike the Water Microbiology Kit (WMK), there is no need for a syringe of growth media, and the RCD microbial capture device is smaller and lighter than that of the WMK. Another advantage of the rapid test is that if an E. coli infection is suspected in space, potential sources can be tested, and results determined quickly, so additional infections can be avoided. This technology can be used on the ISS and on future long-duration spaceflight missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The combined goals of this proposal will have a significant impact on terrestrial water quality management and on current diagnostic capability for detection of waterborne disease outbreaks, especially in areas that are currently not well served. Enhanced access to in-the-field diagnosis of locally relevant diseases will improve sanitation among populations in resource-limited settings. The technology will also promote better understanding of the epidemiology of emerging zoonotic and pandemic pathogens in real-time, will significantly reduce the response time to serious outbreaks, and could help combat any potential future biological threats.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This innovative and practical measurement and monitoring system optimally defines dynamic pressure fields, including sound fields.  It is based on passive acoustic tomography technologies.  In contrast to most monitors it is unique in measuring absolute sound intensity magnitude at each location in the sound field.  Most importantly, the measured noise source absolute intensity is specific to the generating mechanism/source.  Intensity is independent of the monitored space;  Source intensity of a generator is the same value in both free space and in hard, reverberant enclosure environments.  Measured absolute intensities are transferable to other physical locations.  In other words, experimental data is transportable and is directly applicable to any other real-world system or structures. The mesh or cell size used by the monitor/scanner is fixed by the physics of the noise generation mechanism, not by computer power considerations.  The software can be run in a standard workstation, and with careful implementation of standard electronics can provide real time acoustic noise field monitoring.  The AeroNoiseScanner [ANS] scanner is a natural extension and enhancement of an analytical and experimental program involving many decades of research and development programs and financial investments.

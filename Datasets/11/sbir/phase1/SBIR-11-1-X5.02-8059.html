		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This program will focus on developing and validating computational models for near-net shape processing of aluminum alloys.  Computational models will be developed for deformation modeling and for texture generation.  Characterization of two aluminum alloys including flow stress, forgeability, and recrystallization characteristics will provide input for the models.  The models will be validate through laboratory scale testing of the ring rolling process.  The two aluminum alloys are 2139, which has time strength and fracture toughness and ATI451a variant of 2139 that has excellent T6 temper properties.  The models will be used to simulate full scale deformation and predict the nonisentropic material properties of the deformed product.  Successful completion of this effort will enhance NASA's ability to implement near-net shape manufacturing processes, evaluate new materials and reduce the cost and weight of space exploration vehicles.

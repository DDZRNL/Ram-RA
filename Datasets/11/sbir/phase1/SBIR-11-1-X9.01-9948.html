		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Fiber Materials, Inc. (FMI) will develop an aerospace-grade carbon felt preform by employing application specific materials with effective processes and fabrication technologies.  Innovative combinations of materials and processes will result in thermal protection system (TPS) preforms that will enable a range of end applications. Future mission flight environments and designs, such as those anticipated for Mars EDL missions, will require a variety of TPS options to accommodate entry system designs.  The capability of the developed carbon felt preform solutions will address various vehicle shapes, integration methods and the ability to deploy a flexible TPS. Testing for mechanical and thermal robustness will be conducted in a two phase program approach. The Phase I program will assess materials, designs and processing options to be developed, and cost effective manufacturing and assembling methodologies.  The material approaches, design options, fabrication/assembly methods, Phase II work plan, Phase II proposal and final report are delivered at the conclusion of the Phase I program.  During the Phase II program, a mission-applicable preform utilizing the developed material system will be demonstrated.  The proposed materials, designs and methods are currently TRL < 3. It is anticipated that TRL ?? 5 will be achieved at the conclusion of a successful Phase I and Phase II program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Stardust Sample Return Capsule completed its objective with earth reentry in January 2006.  Mars Science Laboratory Aeroshell heat shield has been completed and delivery of the Curiosity rover to Mars is scheduled for 2012.  FMI will leverage successful development and fabrication of these programs to develop aerospace-grade carbon felt perform for TPS heat shields in support NASA flight mission(s). During this two phase program, developed materials will demonstrate the capability and basis for mission implementation. FMI is prepared to continue supporting NASA mission thermal protection by delivering additional enabling material options for a variety of thermal exposures. The program proposed will assist FMI in long term support of future NASA missions that include several TPS materials under development for Mars EDL application.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Enhanced carbon fiber felt solutions developed under this program would support commercial space operations including Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) and other exacting commercial applications.   Aerospace-grade carbon felt can be enabling technology for commercial space return or planetary missions requiring TPS.  Improvements realized from fiber felting and heat treatment are expected to enhance material offerings to the industrial sector.

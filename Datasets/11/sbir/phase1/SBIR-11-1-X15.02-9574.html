		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		InnoSense LLC (ISL) proposes to develop a nanoparticle encapsulation systems for water- and fat-soluble vitamins (VitaCap&#153;) to increase shelf life up to five years for long duration space missions. This encapsulation technology would preserve/enhance the nutrient content of space foods by increasing the amount of bio-active vitamins delivered into the body. Ensuring adequate nutrition that is adapted to these physiological conditions in space, adds a new dimension to the challenges of planned long duration human spaceflight missions beyond low earth orbit (LEO). Phase I feasibility studies are expected to demonstrate that encapsulated vitamins do not degrade and the proposed encapsulation materials do not allow diffusion of the vitamin under processing and storage conditions. It would also be established that bioactive vitamins are released under digestion conditions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		VitaCap will have applications as vitamin additives in NASA food packages for long duration space missions. It will offer advantages such as increased bioavailabililiy and superior vitamin delivery, increased shelf life with optimum physical and chemical stability, and greater flavor compatibility and ingredient options.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The market is driven by factors such as increased shelf life, enhanced bioavailability, and consumers' increasing demand for fresh flavorsome food products. The U.S. presently holds the largest market share. Emerging markets such as China and India are expected to show higher growth in the coming years. The global food encapsulation market is estimated to be $35.4 billion by 2014, growing at a rate of 6.9 % per year. Some of the larger competitors in this market and potential buyers of VitaCap are Nestl?, Unilever and Cargill. Other customers include smaller encapsulant manufacturers and nanotech companies.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Ionu Biosystems will develop a fluorescent smart phone blood analyzer that can measure important physiological concentrations from a drop of blood.  The approach will be to develop fluorescent optode sensors to detect the concentration of the components of basic metabolic and blood gas panels.  Using wireless optode sensors, which can reduced in size to the nanoscale, and fluorescence signal detection removes the need for wired connection of the sensors, sample preprocessing and microfluidics for sample handling.  These advantages will reduce the size, weight and cost of the sample cartridge.  Fluorescence emission from the sensors will be directly measured by the built-in phone camera and data processing can occur on the phone itself.  The results from Phase I will include the construction of a prototype phone case to provide the necessary optical components to convert a smart phone into fluorescence sensor and response of sensors for the components of a chem8 to different target concentrations measured with the phone prototype.  Phase I of this project will satisfy the solicitation requirements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The fluorescent smart phone blood panel diagnostic will provide a method for NASA to self monitor key physiological parameters during long flight missions.  This will allow flight staff to control their own health and provide information for physicians at home to assess health and advice on courses of action.  Converting the technology developed in this proposal to any camera based system will be simple and allow for integration into future hardware.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There are numerous non-NASA applications of a fluorescence based smart phone blood diagnostic.  Rapid, mobile, small volume blood diagnostics will provide medical information to healthcare providers that in certain settings have no other means of access.  In home health monitoring this technology will allow patients to self monitor key physiological levels and easily communicate with their physicians.  Using a smart phone as the base of the system will provide healthcare providers in resource poor settings, such as third world countries, remote regions, or at forward points on the battlefield, with valuable information on the patients they are treating.  This proposed system will significantly alter access to important health parameters to enhance healthcare and reduce healthcare costs.

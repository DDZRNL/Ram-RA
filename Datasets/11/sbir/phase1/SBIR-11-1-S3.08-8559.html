		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) are becoming more prevalent for Suborbital Scientific Earth Exploration, which often involves high altitude, long endurance flight missions.  Extreme environmental conditions, especially involving sub-freezing temperatures (e.g. polar missions in support of the U.S. Global Change Research Program), can lead to the accretion of ice on control surfaces and jeopardize both the vehicle health and mission success.  MesoScribe proposes the development of a structurally integrated ice detection and minimization system for implementation onto UAV platforms.  The system, encompassing multifunctional detection and de-icing modules as well as power distribution arrays, will be designed and fabricated using Direct Write technology.  Specifications will be identified based on the chosen system architecture for integrated switching networks, which will be required to toggle between detection and de-icing modes for power management.  Prototype modules will be feasibility tested during Phase I to demonstrate concept efficacy and provide direction for development of the distributed system architecture.  The proposed technology offers a variety of benefits for integration onto UAVs, including multifunctional icing detection/minimization capabilities, low-profile non-intrusive conductor networks, minimal power consumption, and ruggedized implementation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA has communicated a need to develop icing detection and minimization systems for unmanned platforms specifically pertaining to Suborbital Scientific Earth Exploration Missions, which involve various payloads, a range of altitudes and mission durations, and generally extreme operating environments.  One particular initiative that would benefit directly from a structurally integrated icing detection and minimization system is the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which employs NASA aircraft to conduct high-accuracy climate research in regions extending to the Polar Regions.  Multiple NASA centers are also actively engaged in UAV development and fielding.  Direct Write technology and the proposed innovations for aircraft ice mitigation have applicability over a wide range of unmanned platforms for vehicle health management and sustainment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Deployable systems for multifunctional icing detection and minimization, particularly on control surfaces, are in high demand for commercial and military aviation platforms.  The innovations proposed in the subject NASA Phase I proposal encompass multifunctional Direct Write sensors and heaters as well as distributed conductor networks for implementation onto control surfaces.  MesoScribe has engaged multiple aerospace transition partners to provide guidance on potential vehicle platforms.  In particular, both commercial and military aircraft have a need for upgraded de-icing systems, specifically employing active de-icing based on detection capabilities rather than preventative anti-icing approaches.  Unmanned vehicle platforms involving high altitude, long endurance (HALE) flight, which is akin to the requirements specified for NASA UAV missions, also have a need for ice detection and minimization technologies.  MesoScribe will work with OEM partners to identify transition opportunities and platform specific requirements to facilitate rapid technology fielding within the aerospace sector.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		There is a continual drive to move electronics out of the "warm box" to their point of use on space platforms.  This requires electronics that can operate reliably over a wide range of temperatures and in the presence of radiation. The range of functions needed at various points across a given platform require use of digital, analog and high-voltage circuits, partitioned either independently or in combinations on the same chips.  Currently, there is no "common denominator" integrated circuit process that can effectively support all applications; extreme-environment systems must include the best-in-class technologies.  Circuit design techniques which can produce hardened circuits across a number of technology nodes are essential to producing IP that can be ported and applied to the best technology for the task at hand.   Delay-insensitive (DI) asynchronous digital logic, such as NULL Convention Logic (NCL) is one such technique that can be applied to produce radiation-hardened wide-temperature electronics across many process nodes.  DI logic can produce circuits with wide-temperature, threshold-independent operation and has shown tremendous potential for radiation-hardness through use of its dual-rail encoding scheme.   DI logic has been successfully demonstrated in digital and mixed-signal applications down to 130nm in bulk silicon and SiGe processes over a wide range of temperature.  An opportunity thus exists to apply the asynchronous DI approach to other space-applicable technologies where reliable digital processing needed, including SOI for high-voltage processes for power processing and conditioning.  Proposed is the design of a wide-temperature wide-voltage range RS-485 interface suitable for power and actuator control applications built using DI-NCL gates and wide-temperature design techniques in a high-power radiation-hard process.

		<BR>
		A proven and characterized DI cell library in high-power wide-temperature SOI technology completes a bridge for a reliable digital design technique between silicon, SiGe mixed-signal circuits and high-power applications. Further, as state-of-the-art RS-485 chips have limited voltage and temperature ranges for space applications (min. -55o C), producing a wide-temperature (cryogenic rated) radiation-hardened RS-485 interface has immediate usefulness to NASA and clearly advances the state of the art with the opportunities for integration it provides.  Wide-temperature radiation hardened RS-485 interfaces that can be integrated with digital, analog and power IP blocks would provide boundless applications and point the way forward for distributed space electronics.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		DI logic in wide-temperature, high-power SOI technology offers a potential solution to digital circuitry for harsh radiation environments such as aerospace.  The aerospace electronics market alone is predicted to be a $138 billion market in 2011.   The success and qualification of rad-hard DI logic will allow for the creation of commercial integrated solutions in this market.  Additional potential markets in the commercial sector are numerous.  The designed DI-NCL asynchronous digital standard cell library can be applied to the creation of custom and general-purpose processing technology for integrated power electronics, such as DC-DC converters commonly needed in solar, wind and other alternative energy architectures.  The design techniques and circuit topologies proven in the course of the research can be applied to alternative IC processes enabling new capability including wide-temperature sensing and control electronics.

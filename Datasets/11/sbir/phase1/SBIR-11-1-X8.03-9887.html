		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Infinia Technology Corporation's (ITC) proposed Modular Stirling Power System (MSPS) is a free-piston Stirling system that addresses NASA needs in 12-kW increments. The MSPS utilizes a support structure that couples 1 heater head with 4 power modules and provides a high efficiency of 25% between very conservative acceptor and rejecter temperatures of 823 K and 475 K (30% @ 900/450 K). Proven ITC technology provides high intrinsic reliability and maintenance-free operation for >15 years. It directly leverages 3-kW power modules developed for Infinia's solar-Stirling PowerDish&#153; that have been deployed in over 400 engines to enable full-scale demonstration under a Phase II SBIR. The MSPS will employ innovative fabrication and/or laser welding processes for reliable liquid metal pumped loop compatibility with a next-generation heater head designed for nuclear system integration. Phase I will culminate in a concept definition and design as a foundation for analysis, detailed design, fabrication, and testing in Phase II.<BR><BR>Development of the MSPS concept opens many avenues of application for commercial and government markets. Within NASA, the system will provide mission support for future space transportation and surface power with a very reliable, high-efficiency Stirling converter for the conversion of reactor heat into electricity.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Modular Stirling Power System (MSPS) is ideally suited for use with Space Nuclear Power Systems (SNPS) and/or Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) systems. The proposed system will in no way be constrained by the availability of special isotopes, as is the case for small space power systems and can be easily interfaced with liquid metal cooling loops like those under development for future space transportation and surface power applications. Modular in nature, the MSPS enables varying power levels (12kW multiples with existing pre-commercial convertors or higher with redesigned systems) depending on mission power requirements with each module made up of a power conversion system, heat rejection system, and associated controls that can be interfaced with a reactor to meet specific mission applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		ITC expects the MSPS interface to adapt core 3 kW Stirling engine technology for numerous additional synergistic commercial products and markets where the attributes of low noise, high efficiency, low emissions, and maintenance-free operation are valued. Higher power levels offered by the MSPS through the joining of multiple pre-commercial convertor technology into a single heater head exchanger coupled with the lower temperature deltas from source to sink, open many markets. Future complementary applications will include but are not limited to:<BR><BR>*Waste Heat Conversion<BR>*Solar Trough systems<BR>*Emergency power generators<BR>*Remote power systems<BR>*micro-Combined Heat and Power (mCHP)<BR>*Over-the-road truck auxiliary power units to comply with the new anti-idling regulations<BR>*Recreational vehicle and yacht generators<BR>*Construction site power

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The use of composites in aircraft manufacturing is growing dramatically. To ensure the integrity of composite structures and bonded joints, a variety of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technologies have been developed over the past three decades. Among them, the ultrasonic and acoustic based technologies (e.g., ultrasonic C-scan, resonance, mechanical impedance analysis, and tap test) have proven to be successful in many field applications, especially for delamination and disbond inspections. However, most conventional ultrasonic NDE methods are based on point-by-point inspection scheme, which is either subjective in manual operation or time-consuming when a large area needs to be inspected. In this proposal,X-wave Innovations, Inc. (XII) and North Carolina State University (NCSU) propose an innovative linear-array ultrasonic technique for rapid inspection of large-area composite and bonded structures.  The success of the proposed effort will result in the development of a novel technique that will provide rapid, reliable, and accurate inspection and evaluation for composite structures and bonded assemblies, as well as an ultrasonic NDE system that is inexpensive, portable, and easy to use.  This system will be suitable for field testing of defects (including disband and delamination) in various composite materials and bonded structures

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Quick inspection of large composite structures posts significant challenge and interest to NASA.  The low cost, light weight, handheld device that can provide quick inspection and imaging of various defects (such as delamination and disbond) and damages (e.g., fiber breakage and impact damages) for various composite structures and bonded assemblies should also be extremely valuable to advanced mechanical components and systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed LAUT system has many market applications in different industries such as the air and space, defense and energy sectors.  Customers should include the US government agency, including DOD, DOE, DOT, and commercial companies such as Boeing, GE, etc. The total market will increase in the future because of the rapidly expanded use of composite materials in many mechanical components and system to improve the system's efficiency and overall performance.

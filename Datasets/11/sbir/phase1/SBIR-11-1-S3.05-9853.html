		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This SBIR phase I program is directed toward the development of novel, nanoporous silica anodes for low-earth-orbiting (LEO) spacecraft power applications. Silica has attracted a lot of attention as a next-generation anode material because of its very high theoretical capacity compared to state-of-the-art graphitic carbon anodes. However, its use in Li-ion battery applications is limited by its poor cycle stability caused by large volume changes experienced during Li insertion and extraction. The unique pore structure of materials developed in this program will overcome this limitation and realize rechargeable Li-ion cells with high-specific energy and extremely stable cycle life for LEO spacecraft power applications.

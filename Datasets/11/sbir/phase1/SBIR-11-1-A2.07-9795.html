		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		ZONA Technology, Inc. proposes an R&D effort to develop a Gust Load Alleviation (GLA) control system using a novel Leading Edge Stagnation Point (LESP) sensor that has the nearly instantaneous predictive capability. The real-time gust information from the sensor will enhance the performance of the proposed GLA control system. The GLA control method we will adopt is the Generalized Predictive Control (GPC), which consists of identification of the flexible system perturbed by gusts and minimization of the prediction response error by optimal control design. The GPC scheme has a "feedback and feedforward" topology and solves Multi-Input Multi-Output control problems. The measurements of gusts via the LESP sensor, which reduces the inherent delay associated with conventional sensing of the structural responses, can be incorporated into the controller in the feedforward path, hence the GLA performance is improved. ZONA will further assess the effectiveness of the control system on a high fidelity model of a Body Freedom Flutter vehicle, which is a flexible flying wing configuration vehicle designed and flight tested by Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Comprehensive generalized predictive controller for alleviating gust load can be used as part of a new generation Flight Control System, within the effort of Fundamental Aeronautics Research program. The enhanced aviation safety can further contribute to various research projects conducted in NASA.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The potential non-NASA customers for this tool include the R&D arms of USAF, Navy, Army, and major aircraft manufactures. It can be readily adapted by a wide class of aerospace vehicles ranging from current to next-generation designs such as: (a) USAF's F-22 and F-35 aircrafts at Edwards AFB, (b) UASF's Hilda and/or SensorCraft aircrafts, (c) USAF's next generation stealth and morphing UAV/UCAV, (d) DARPA's new Switchblade Flying Wing Program, and for (e) Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) with enhanced control/maneuver capability. ZONA Technology's reputation and track record in supporting the aerospace industry and government with ZONA codes can assure the success of the commercialization plan.

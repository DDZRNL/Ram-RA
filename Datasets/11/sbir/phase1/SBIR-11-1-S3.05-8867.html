		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposal represents a radical revolution in Power Management & Distribution (PMAD) that addresses many of the challenges for NASA missions that will operate in harsher space environments.  One of the several advances it introduces is to eliminate the number one problem of electronics failure in space environment &#150; "latch-up".  The new technology would entirely eliminate all sources of 'latch-up" events, thereby drastically reducing space electronics risk.  The new technology of 'solid-state ceramic' voltage level shifters further integrates wideband gap power switches as part of a radical new design approach that improves electronics performance over a wide operational (thermal, loads) with drastically improved radiation tolerance over what is presently available.  The emphasis will be on a whole new form of space electronics PMAD that enable very (extremely) high levels temperature/radiation tolerance for a wide range of missions including Heliophysic Solar Terrestrial Probe (STP), Europa, Venus missions and future Small Explorer (SMEX) missions  that are previously unobtainable.  Its unique capabilities of voiding need for digital processors combined with its immense immunity from EMI/RFI make this technology an ideal space power electronics solution for Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) Missions.  Because of its unique nature of complete elimination of any form of control, filtering and measurement subsystems the new technology substantially reduce system risk and increase autonomy. Its unique design, materials and operation eliminate need of any processors, core magnetics and software; thereby eliminating almost all the causes of system failure in high radiation exposure environments.  Because it is based on ceramics and has no processor or core magnetic components, the new technology can be designed to safely operate from cryogenic to very high temperature ambient conditions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There is obvious application needs in several key Heliophysic and deep space missions that will encounter high thermal/radiation conditions.  In addition to mission spacecraft the new technology will be directly applicable in a number of science applications payloads &#150; both deployed and released.  The power electronic subsystems are critical to both spacecraft and payload operations n these environments.  Scaled down, these devices can be applied to SmallSat requirements and on space platform equipment such as particle measurement, solar observation, etc. Our commercial strategy is to initially develop for NASA needs in Heliosphere exploration and deep space missions and use this as a baseline to address a range of other mission needs. NASA specific needs include future science payload development initiatives for which this technology could be applied include and improve chances of selection include: Io Observer New Frontiers Mission; Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO) flagship mission; Venus surface missions; and exploration of the dark lunar polar craters.  QorTek, in addition to working with Boeing Huntington Beach to transition of the new ceramic-based space power electronics technology, is also in discussions in regard to this technology for NASA specific mission transition with:1) Boeing Satellite Development Center,  2) Lockheed Martin Commercial Space Systems.

		<BR>
		Military Systems: The US Army and major SDR vendors are also evaluating the new "all solid state converter" technology as the possible next generation of micro DC-DC converter technology for dismounted soldier and vehicle communication support.  QorTek/PKI is presently working closely with both major JTRS contractors in technology evaluation/transition: 1) AMF JTRS Radio Systems Requirements - Lockheed Martin LMTS POC - Anthony Debevec, Lockheed Martin MS2, Senior Manager Integrated Systems, 2)Tactical Radio JTRS Systems Requirements &#150; Harris RF Communications, (Harris Corp. POC - Richard Buckley, Harris Fellow, RF Communications)<BR>Commercial Electronics: End applications for the new technology include markets such as computing and communications, consumer appliances, lighting and automotive applications. DC-DC and AC-DC converters, lighting, Class D audio, and motor drives.  QorTek is primarily focusing on development of laptop and cell phone AC/DC adaptors that use the ability of the technology to be realized in a miniaturized package with very few components.  Integration of cost competitive GaN power switches into the design and product will further reduce size and improve performance.

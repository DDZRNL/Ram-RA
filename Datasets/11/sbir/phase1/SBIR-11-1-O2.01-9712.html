		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Ventions proposes the development of a pump-fed, 2-stage nano launch vehicle for low-cost on-demand placement of cube and nano-satellites into LEO.  <BR><BR>The proposed vehicle uses high T/W and high Isp pump-fed engines that operate at high chamber pressures without the weight penalty of high pressure tanks, thereby realizing payload fractions in the 1-2% range.  <BR><BR>Ventions has already completed several component-level demonstrations in the area, and is proposing additional development of the stage separation mechanisms, payload fairing and main engine gimbal as part of the Phase I effort.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed nano launch vehicle is aimed at providing low-cost and on-demand insertion of NASA cube- and nano-satellites into LEO as primary payloads.  This will change the current model of launching such satellites as secondary payloads (which are often constrained by requirements of the primary payload), thereby extending this capability to a wider range of NASA experimental missions requiring on-demand and low-cost insertion into specific orbits.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications for the same will include DoD and military missions requiring rapid on-demand access to space from anywhere in the world (based on ground or air-launch), as well as university and research satellites.<BR><BR>Additionally, the small-scale thrust chamber assemblies and turbomachinery technology components developed for the launch vehicle are also expected to have widespread applications in other in-space propulsion systems, upper stages, and orbital insertion / maneuvering thrusters, etc.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address NASA's need for compact nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of the structural integrity of spacecraft components and structures, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Structural Integrity Inspection and Visualization System (SIRIUS), based on acquiring two-dimensional images of Compton-scattered hard X-ray radiation produced by multiple slices of the object, with subsequent three-dimensional reconstruction of the inspected structure for high-resolution (~0.5 mm) detection and localization of defects. This approach incorporates the POC-developed innovative X-ray Compton Imaging Tomography technique (patent pending) and patented X-ray imaging optics with high spatial resolution and a wide field of view, enabling it to meet NASA's requirements for operation on a wide range of lightweight spacecraft materials, noncontact operation, portability, and ease of use. SIRIUS will provide detection and three-dimensional localization of defects and damage in space transportation vehicles, pressure vessels, ISS modules, inflatable structures, EVA suits, MMOD shields, and thermal protection structures, with spatial resolution of ~0.5 mm and penetration depth up to 25 cm (depending on the material). In Phase I POC will demonstrate the feasibility of using SIRIUS for NDE of spacecraft components by fabricating and testing a TRL-4 prototype, with the goal of achieving TRL-6 by the end of Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary NASA application of the proposed SIRIUS system is a compact NDE system that can be used for evaluating structural integrity of spacecraft components during spaceflight, with the capability to provide reliable, high-resolution assessments of the locations and extent of damage within thermal protection, micro-meteoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) shields, inflatable habitats, EVA suits and vehicles, electronic systems, conductive structures, pressure vessels, and other lightweight materials, with the ability to function in hard-to-access areas within both pressurized habitable compartments and external space environments. Additional NASA applications include in situ NDE of large-area non-uniform multilayer aluminum/titanium/composite structures with complicated geometry used in the development of advanced aircraft and spacecraft, providing accurate identification, localization, and measurements of all types of internal and surface defects.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Military applications of the SIRIUS system will include in situ NDE of U.S. Navy, Army, and Air Force military aircraft with large-area non-uniform multilayer aluminum/titanium/composite structures that have complicated geometry (and also combined textile polymeric, ceramic, and metal matrix composite structures). The SIRIUS system will also be used for the NDE of airplane, helicopter, and missile parts containing electronics, mechanics, propellants, explosives, etc., to detect their defects and integrities. The SIRIUS system can be incorporated by the U.S. Navy, Army, and Air Force as a reliable, rapid, robotic, easy-to-use NDE system. Potential DHS applications include the detection of vehicle-borne contraband, drugs, and explosives. The commercial availability of the SIRIUS system includes its use for in situ NDE of large-area non-uniform components in aging and modern commercial aircraft, spacecraft, light marine vessels, and any application requiring defect detection for multilayer ceramic, composite, metallic, and plastic non-uniform structures.

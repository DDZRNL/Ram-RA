		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this effort, ZONA Technology, Inc. aims at developing an innovative multi-fidelity and multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO) sub-framework that can (i) effectively reduce the number of design variables without screening-out any of the variables, (ii) accelerate the convergence through a novel design space evolution technique, and (iii) enable rapid determination of design sensitivities (gradients) for all the levels of fidelity during aerodynamic analyses. The innovative application of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for design variable reduction, when coupled with the fitness-driven Design Space Evolution scheme is an ideal optimization technique for the conceptual and preliminary design stages, wherein, a large number of configurations are rapidly sampled. To facilitate process automation and to achieve time-saving, the finite element mesh morphing will be incorporated through the use of ZMORPH, ZONA's Boundary Element Method based mesh-morphing code. For an effective system-level data-flow between various disciplines, the proposed optimization sub-framework will be integrated using Phoenix Integration Inc.'s ModelCenter software. In collaboration with Phoenix Integration Inc., ZONA team will develop the functional plug-ins for the ZONA codes involved in the sub-framework. Once developed, such a framework will be demonstrated for its robustness on a non-conventional Supersonic Tailless Air Vehicle (STAV) platform. The current NASA MDO framework, as well as other industry-standard MDO frameworks will benefit significantly from the inclusion of ZONA's modular MDO sub-framework for conceptual design optimization.

		<BR>
		NASA's current research efforts in aircraft design focus on noise/boom reduction and improvements in fuel efficiency of the next generation sub/supersonic commercial aircraft. These design drivers call for investigation of unconventional and revolutionary design concepts for which the empirical structural and aerodynamic equations based on historical database are not valid. ZONA's innovative modular MDO sub-framework, once incorporated in the NASA MDAO systems, can provide variable-fidelity and physics-based structural, aerodynamic, and aeroelastic solutions, along with the solutions for other disciplines computed by the existing analysis codes available in the NASA MDAO systems, for solving a complete configuration design and optimization problem.  With acceleration of convergence achieved through the POD-based order reduction and design space evolution technique, accurate shape sensitivity information provided by incorporation of ZEUS-DO and ZAERO-DO, automated rapid mesh-morphing by ZMORPH, and  system-level integration using ModelCenter, Phase I+II effort of this project will largely expand NASA's MDAO capability and enable the design of unconventional and revolutionary air vehicles in a computationally efficient and cost effective manner.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Because of the automated mesh generation +morphing capability, unified shape design variable definition for both structural and aerodynamic models, accelerated convergence through order reduction and design space evolution technique, and the streamlined ModelCenter-integrated process for the variable-fidelity structural, aerodynamic and aeroelastic solution generations, ZONA has discovered that the proposed MDAO suite has a unique commercial competitive edge in the air vehicle MDAO software market. Once Zona's highly modular MDAO suite is integrated into an existing MDAO system, it can be adopted by the conceptual design and configuration development departments of airplane manufacturers nationwide and worldwide to develop a wide class of air vehicles such as UAVs/UCAVs, supersonic business jets and transports, advanced transonic transports, fighter aircraft, hypersonic missiles, and winged projectiles.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NanoSonic offers an innovative manufacturing process to yield ultra-lightweight radiation shielding nanocomposites by exploiting the concept of the Thoraeus filter on the nanoscale.  Our elegant, layer-by-layer deposition process allows for unique layering with molecular level precision to covalently bind advanced polymers with alternating layers of high and low z nanoparticles.  While radiation shielding cannot be achieved without some combination of mass density and appropriate choice of materials, NanoSonic's Thoraeus Rubber&#153; are nanostructured layers engineered in a manner to maximize shielding with minimum bulk within a hydrogenous network to address neutron emissions in addition to RF, gamma, X-ray and high energy particles.  Radiation shielding shall be evaluated at Colorado State University and the Brookhaven Radiation Effects Facility to verify protection for humans and exploration vehicles envisioned for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and long-duration missions beyond LEO.  Thermal, mechanical, and RF characterization would be carried out at NanoSonic.  Micrometeoroids and Orbital Debris (MMOD) resistance and outgassing would be carried out by our space prime partner.  Candidate materials shall be delivered in support of demonstration experiments for Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE).  TRL 8-9 would be achieved upon demonstration of human and electronics protection from long-duration galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and solar energetic particles (SEP).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Structural, yet compliant, high temperature, radiation resistant Shape Memory-Metal Rubber&#153; composite materials having unique morphology and multiple controlled electromagnetic properties are possible via NanoSonic's automated spray-on ESA manufacturing approach.  SM-MR adaptive materials represent a new class of robust, stowable &#150; deployable structures and shielding materials for spacecraft based on covalently bound shape memory polymers and nanostructured conductive particles.  For this program, SM-MR shall be integrated as protective charge dissipative coatings for space electronics, and shielding coatings for exploration vehicles and satellites in LEO and beyond.  NanoSonic's SMPs may be combined with our family of nanostructure materials produced in house (noble metals, magnetics, ceramics and quantum dots) for limitless combinations of multifunctional morphing materials for civil and space applications.  SM-MR free standing nanostructured skins offer dual-use commercialization for NASA and civil markets in the electronics, aerospace, automobile and microelectronics markets for the production of conductive, high temperature, rad hard coatings.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Additional applications for SM-MR include ultra-lightweight sensors/actuators for shape changing inflatables, rigidizable/deployable aerospace structures, and as protective coatings against electrostatic charging, radiation, and abrasion.  Low cost, highly EMI/ESD protective skins for aerospace, biomedical and microelectronic components are offered via Shape Memory Metal Rubber&#153; with metal-like EMI SE up to -88dB under repeated and severe reconfigurations.  Such EMI shielding skins can be envisioned for use on aircraft, morphing unmanned aerial vehicles, antennas and space structures.  Structural, high temperature, composite materials having unique dielectric and multiple controlled electromagnetic properties are possible via NanoSonic's layer-by-layer approach.  Spray ESA is envisioned as a cost-effective, environmentally friendly technology to displace sputtering and traditional dense filled composites.  Metal Rubber&#153; Fabrics and films can also function as conducting electrodes for high strain mechanical actuator and sensor devices, and as low-weight, electrically conductive and mechanically flexible coatings for systems requiring physically-robust electromagnetic shielding, ground planes or electrical interconnection.

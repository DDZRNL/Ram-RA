		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Research is proposed to investigate the feasibility of using advanced manufacturing techniques to enable the affordable application of multi-functional high temperature coatings having enhanced resistance to high temperature engine environments. For example, thermal / environmental barrier coatings (T/EBCs) are envisioned to protect the surface of Si-based ceramics against moisture-assisted, oxidation-induced ceramic recession. Current T/EBC systems have been demonstrated in long time exposures at ~2400?F. However, their use at elevated temperatures is limited by the low temperature stability and high diffusion activity of current T/EBC materials. One approach to enhance the temperature capability of these systems is the incorporation of multi-layered T/EBC designs to provide multi-functional protection.  In this Phase I effort, novel processing techniques will be developed to enable the affordable, high performance  manufacture of such systems using a physical vapor deposition based processing approach which enables enhanced coating adhesion and advanced coating architectural, compositional and microstructural control. Processing developments will then be used to created novel multi-layered coatings. These coating layers will then be incorporated into advanced high temperature capable T/EBC systems in Phase. This work will lead to the incorporation of Si-based ceramic components into enhanced efficiency gas turbine engines to reduce weight and increase operating temperatures. A TRL 4 will be achieved at the end of Phase I and TRL 6 at the end of Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This research is anticipated to result in environmental barrier coating systems that provides higher temperature capability, improved durability and better CMAS resistance than current EBCs. These advancements will help enable the use of Si-based ceramics in a range of high temperature applications such a gas turbine engines, combustion liners, exhaust components and heat exchangers. These advances will potentially benefit all gas turbine engines requiring greater performance and efficiency.  In addition, this research specifically supports the goals of NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) which seeks to expand the boundaries of aeronautical knowledge for the benefit of the Nation and the broad aeronautics community and in particular NASA ARMD's Subsonic Fixed Wing Project which has a goal of conducting long term research in technologies which promote, among other things, higher performance and higher efficiency gas turbine engines.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The development of high temperature T/EBC systems using DVTI's advanced coatings processing techniques will enable not only new T/EBC systems for use in future military and commercial aircraft platforms, but also new deposition processes to enable affordable coating application onto engines components.  DVD coaters are envisioned to be small with low capital costs and tailorable volumes so that small volumes of parts can be deposited at low cost. The soft vacuum required and the high deposition rates also have the potential to facilitate assembly line like part coating for some geometries. The non line-of-sight capabilities of this approach enable coatings to be applied onto complex components thus expanding their use. The compositional and morphological flexibility of this approach would also enable other advanced functional coating systems to be applied such as thermal barrier coatings, wear and corrosion resistant coatings, thin film batteries and damping coatings.

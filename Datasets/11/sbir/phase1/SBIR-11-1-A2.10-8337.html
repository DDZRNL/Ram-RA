		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The one CFD modeling area that has remained the most challenging, yet most critical to the success of integrated propulsion system simulations, is turbulence modeling. There is a need to develop mid-level CFD models for the interaction of turbulence and chemical reactions that give superior results to the simple models (e.g., Magnussen's Eddy Dissipation Concept), but which do not require the large computational expense of the very complex models (e.g., PDF evolution methods or the Linear Eddy Method).  This SBIR program proposes to develop this capability by extending the Eddy Dissipation Concept of Magnussen (EDC) to allow for improved modeling of reacting flows&#151;especially diffusion flames where the flow contains significant regions of mixing prior to combustion.  In Phase I, the proposed approach will be demonstrated using a Magnussen model with a global one-step reaction mechanism.  The effect of the modified model on the predicted combustion relative to the original Magnussen EDC will be demonstrated on a test case.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed tool can be implemented into production CFD codes such as Wind-US, Fluent, OpenFOAM, Vulcan, etc., which are used widely by a large population for various applications.  Today, these CFD software are heavily relied upon for the design and analysis of systems such as combustion engines, jet engines, augmenters, gas turbines, scramjets, reactors, power plants and many others.  The proposed capability (extended EDC model) will be applicable to majority of cases where the classic EDC model is presently used in modeling combustion systems.  The advantage of achieving higher computational efficiency with detailed chemistry capabilities will enhance the use of such CFD codes for combustion related problems. <BR>The proposed extended-EDC model will improve the turbulence-chemistry modeling capabilities of CFD software that NASA is using for the design, analysis, and optimization of advanced propulsion-airframe integrated systems for future subsonic, supersonic and hypersonic applications.  Propulsion system integration challenges are encountered across all of the speed regimes from subsonic "N+3" vehicle concepts to supersonic "N+2" vehicle concepts.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed extended-EDC model can be used for gas turbine, process furnace, and IC engine applications. The model can be used to improve and optimize the design of gas turbine combustors with reduced emissions.  It can be used to improve the capabilities of CFD software in predicting NOx formation in gas, oil and coal flames.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Volume reduction is a critical element of Solid Waste Management for manned spacecraft and planetary habitations.  To this end, the proposed fecal waste incinerator may be utilized to completely mineralize feces to harmless inorganic substances such as CO2 and water.  These products may then be rerouted to the ECLSS processes for hydrogen CO2 reduction to form water and water electrolysis to yield oxygen and hydrogen.  Fecal oxidation takes place in two coupled reactors utilizing advanced heat exchanger technology, one to incinerate the feces and the second to oxidize incineration products.  Little energy input is required due to the use of fecal matter heat of combustion in combination with efficient heat exchange.  Feces are incinerated immediately after collection, eliminating the need for waste stabilization that would otherwise be required to eliminate offensive odors and control microbial growth.  All evolved gases including incompletely oxidized volatile organics are passed through a catalytic reactor, ensuring complete combustion to avoid loading the Trace Contaminant Control System.  This innovative system is light, compact, simple, energy efficient, contains few moving parts, is virtually maintenance free, and requires little astronaut time.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA application of this technology will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future long duration manned missions. The primary application will be for eliminating fecal waste produced during manned space operations, although this technology may also be applied toward incineration of other solid wastes such as non-edible, plant mass produced by agricultural cultivation in space habitats.  In addition, concentrated organic vapors produced by other solid waste treatment processes may be efficiently oxidized by utilizing this novel approach.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA applications of this technology include the efficient incineration of medical wastes to insure sterilization and prevent the spread of pathogenic microorganisms.  Another attractive application of this technology will be the incineration of toilet wastes at remote locations, on board ships, or in third world countries where in particular pathogens are commonly transmitted via fecal waste.

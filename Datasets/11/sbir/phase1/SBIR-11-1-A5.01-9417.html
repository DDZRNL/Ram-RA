		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed solution is to create a high fidelity simulation environment that merges a UAS ground control station (GCS) simulator with an air traffic control (ATC) simulator. The UAS GCS station will have the capability of introducing a single UAS or multiple UASs simulator operated by a single and/or multiple UAS pilots into the ATC. This simulation will have the ability to simulate manned aircraft, among others in the airspace. It will allow the UAS GCS to communicate with ATC as well as other manned aircraft through the use of a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) based intercom system. In addition to voice communications, a text-based chat system may also be utilized for communication among the different operators. Information regarding position and altitude for all aircraft will be available to the UAS GCS, ATC, as well as manned aircraft. The ATC simulator will be able to relay information regarding the position of other aircraft within 5nm horizontal and 1200 feet vertical separation to the UAS GCS through formatted messages.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary application of UAS-ATC Test-Bed will allow researchers to test and evaluate a wide variety of issues surrounding the integration of UAS into the National Airspace System. This test-bed will provide a rich environment for researchers to evaluate many important research questions such as:<BR>1. Testing of UAS in the NAS and NextGen concepts of operation<BR>2. Testing of system resilience given off-nominal events<BR>3. Evaluation of technological innovations<BR>4. Training evaluations

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There is forecast to be an explosive growth of UAS operations in the United States. This will range from military, law enforcement, agriculture, border patrol, etc just to name a few applications.  The commercial potential of our technology will consist of future versions of our UAS STE that can be integrated into other simulations systems to evaluate, in a scientific valid manner, the effectiveness of UAS:<BR>1. Training Regimes<BR>2. User Interfaces<BR>3. Procedures<BR>4. Integration into the NAS<BR>5. Regulations<BR>6. Recurrence Training<BR>7. Operator Mission Essential Competencies (MEC)<BR>8. Adaptive Operator Training<BR>9. Payload Operator Training

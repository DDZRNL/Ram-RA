		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Advanced Microgravity Compatible, Integrated Laundry (AMCIL) is a microgravity compatible liquid / liquid vapor, two-phase laundry system with water jet agitation and vacuum assisted drying.  Umpqua Research Company previously developed a complete microgravity compatible Single Phase Laundry System (SPLS).  Single-phase operation during the wash cycle facilitated microgravity compatible fluidics and eliminated problems associated with foams.  Pulsed water jets were utilized to agitate the clothing.  Drying was achieved with microwave assisted vacuum drying followed by a tumble cycle that greatly enhanced softness in the previously vacuum pressed clothing.  Tumbling was achieved by an array of three air jets, two to generate a cyclonic effect and a third to induce tumbling by blowing perpendicular to the plane of rotation.  This concept was successfully demonstrated during a KC-135 microgravity simulation flight.  The proposed AMCIL concept will build on the SPLS technology and incorporate key design improvements to reduced water requirements and lower power consumption.  Specific advancements include a redesigned wash cycle that consumes less water and reduces power demand.  The Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of the microgravity compatible liquid / liquid vapor, two-phase washing concept in a laboratory scale system.  A complete, automated prototype unit that incorporates the system parameters established during the Phase I tests will be designed, fabricated, and tested during the Phase II program.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA application for the AMCIL system will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of long duration human missions beyond low Earth orbit where reductions in replacement clothing will lower the ESM for crew accommodations.  The AMCIL system is suitable for use in any long term space mission where resupply logistics preclude routine delivery of fresh crew clothing and removal of disposable clothing articles.  While the proposed laundry system is microgravity compatible, the system will be completely functional in reduced gravity environments.  Specifically, the proposed laundry technology will be suited to deployment on the Lunar and Mars surfaces, at Lagrange points, and onboard long range transit vehicles.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		AMCIL has potential utility in any application where long term habitation is coupled with limited access.  Some obvious examples include isolated military outposts, research stations, naval vessels, research vessels, and commercial ships.  Each of these installations feature similar restrictions on available clean water, energy, and waste storage.  The ability to wash and reuse clothing with equipment that consumes small amounts of these valuable resources will reduce resupply requirements and improve quality of life.

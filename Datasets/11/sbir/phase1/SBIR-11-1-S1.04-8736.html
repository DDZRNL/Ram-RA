		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Loveraging on Agiltron's experience in optical fiber components, Agiltron proposed a coherent single-mode fiber (SMF) spatial filter array (SFA) with a gradient index fiber (GIF) lens array pair to meet NASA's application of planet exploration. There are several advantages over the current approach in: small aberration, low insertion loss, high uniformity, low cost, easy assembly and high stability.  <BR>In Phase I, Agiltron will build a GIF-based SFA prototype to prove the feasibility of the proposed low cost program for NASA applications. At the same time, a theoretical study will be made to build a simulation model for the proposed SFA. This simulation and actual physical testing will provide the necessary baseline for us to build and demonstrate a prototype including the mechanical enclosures in Phase II. We expect to provide fully functional and environmentally tested production units for NASA in Phase II.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		A planet finding visible nulling interferometer coronagraph architecture was applied to detect extra-solar planets near its star in the visible or near infrared spectrum. In order to reducing wavefront mismatches between the beam's combination in the interferometer and preserving the spatial information of the incident beam, a spatial filter array (SFA) will be crucial for such a interferometer. The SFA, which has to be uniform of intensity and phase to meet the request of telescope imaging for the planet, can reduce the starlight to request level to observe the image of the planet. The high performance and fill factor as well as light weight GI lens array can be used in the beam steering systems for NASA's laser space measurements and communication.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The GI lens array has great advantages over present micro-lens arrays in high accuracy and uniformity, high resolution and low cost for commercial applications as FPA imager, remote sensing, wide angle, fast beam steering applications, scientific and engineering instruments. For example, a GI lens array used with a CCD array can constitute the core of a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor. If the wavefront is distorted, the light imaged on the CCD sensor consists of displaced spots and missing spots. This information can be used to calculate the shape of the wavefront that was incident on the microlens array. Another application is in 3D imaging and displays. The use of a GI lens array can define the viewing directions for a pair of interlaced images and hence enable the observer to see a 3D stereoscopic image. And the GI lens array can be used to DWDM module, WSS in fiber optical communications.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The principal technical innovation is SLIM (Systems LIfecycle Management), a software environment for integrated model-based systems engineering, combining SysML (OMG Systems Modeling Language) and PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) toolsets. The SysML model provides fine-grained federation of information across an integrated set of design, analysis, simulation, requirements management and costing tools. PLM manages the same tools at a file-based level for configuration management, access control, and product data management.<BR> <BR>The objective of creating a low-cost, agile MBSE methodology is to provide a flexible engineering framework using standards-based modeling tools, existing detailed design and analysis tools (where acquisition and training costs have been amortized), and efficient work processes across domain boundaries, which we call "patterns of integration".<BR><BR>The technical objective of the Phase 1 project is to demonstrate a prototype methodology from conceptual to detailed design, using a representative tool set and a combination of existing and to-be-developed interfaces. In the first step, a SysML model of a mission will be created in MagicDraw, but model configuration control will be handled by Teamcenter PLM. In the second step, abstract CAD models of mission systems are created and registered by the PLM system and requirements are transferred from SysML to the abstract CAD models. In the third step, finalized CAD models are checked into Teamcenter and critical design data transferred to the SysML model for system requirements verification. Equivalent processes are carried out on the analysis and simulation side. In the Work Plan, specific features to be developed are identified.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)

		This innovation directly addresses NASA's current effort to adapt MBSE to established NASA systems engineering practices, occurring both at individual centers and across the agency. Key issues are low cost standards-based solutions, leveraging existing tools and expertise, scalability to large-scale multi-year missions, and compatibility with existing NASA system engineering multi-phase review and documentation needs.<BR><BR>InterCAX has trained over 200 NASA personnel(combined)from JPL, Goddard, Glenn, Langley, and Kennedy in SysML and Model-Based Systems Engineering (training at JSC Houston scheduled for Sept 2011) and InterCAX personnel have consulted with several of these centers. The technical advances proposed here would easily integrate into these efforts and address key needs identified by NASA management in model-based projects: requirements traceability, design object continuity, cost, and optimization. Capabilities developed for the SLIM systems development environment are directly applicable to the design of spacecrafts, aircrafts and satellites.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		InterCAX develops and sells commercial plugins for SysML model execution to customers in aerospace, government, defense, energy and heavy industry. Key features of complex "systems of systems" are:<BR><BR>* Simulation from the conceptual, systems design stage to the end of product lifecycle<BR><BR>* Collaborative modeling, design, analysis and simulation environments<BR><BR>* Incorporation of multiple design data sources, multiple solvers and analysis modules<BR><BR>The  market opportunity is for companies that develop and manufacture complex products, generally with extended supply chains, and are leaders in the practice of systems engineering and product/platform architecture. The global market for engineering software in these areas is approximately $26.3 billion per year (2008), with integration software, e.g. PLM, document management, etc., approx. $8.2 billion annually [CIMData, 2009].<BR><BR>Advanced modeling and simulation capabilities also have major market opportunities in other fields, including civil and environmental engineering (e.g., the 2008 INCOSE International Symposium was focused on the environment), business process analysis, and computational finance. Recent InterCAX consulting projects have included modeling wind and tidal energy systems, supply chains, watershed management, and network computer system architectures.

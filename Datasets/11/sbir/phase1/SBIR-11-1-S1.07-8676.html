		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Future NASA missions will require cryocoolers providing cooling capacities upwards of 0.3W at 35K with heat rejection capability to temperature sinks as low as 150K and input powers limited to 10W. Presently there are no cooling systems operating at this heat rejection temperature. This proposal describes a cryocooler that employs a cold compressor. The proposed cryocooler will be light-weight, efficient, reliable, have low vibration, and easy to integrate.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA applications of the low heat rejection cryocoolers is missions to remote locations and orbits which have a low level of solar input. This has a major effect on the available power to the satellite or instrument, making power more precious. At the same time, because of the lower level of heat input from sun and earth the rejection temperatures are reduced. The combination of these two effects greatly favors reduced rejection temperature cryocooler systems because the power requirement is reduced and lower rejection temperatures are more easily achieved. These systems can be employed both on Mars instruments and on scientific instruments positioned at special L2 and L3 orbits.

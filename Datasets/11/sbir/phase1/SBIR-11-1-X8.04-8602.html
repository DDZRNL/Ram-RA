		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Mega-ROSA-EX is an enhanced, higher stiffness, higher sun-pointing accuracy, higher strength, higher specific power and even larger overall power / deployed size / stowed packaging capability configuration of the  innovative Mega-ROSA technology.  Mega-ROSA, named for Mega Roll-Out Solar Array, is a highly-modularized and extremely-scalable ROSA-based solar array architecture that provides immense power level range capability from 100kW to multiple Megawatts in size, for NASA Exploration Initiative and Planetary missions such as SEP space-tug and large-scale SEP-powered Planetary applications. <BR><BR>The further-advanced/optimized versions of Mega-ROSA proposed(Mega-ROSA EX),promise to increase its deployed stiffness, strength and deployed size/packaging capability performance well beyond the excellent values already shown to be obtainable with the baseline "standard" high-packaging efficiency Mega-ROSA design.  The significant and revolutionary end-user benefits of the Mega-ROSA EX technology advances are: <BR><BR>Increased deployed stiffness / sun-pointing accuracy - The Mega-ROSA-EX configurations proposed to be developed during the Phase 1 program will allow significantly higher deployed stiffness (3-5 times higher than the standard baseline Mega-ROSA configurations), and the resulting lower PV blanket-plane displacements / higher wing sun-pointing accuracy achieved under expected on-orbit accelerations will enable the use of currently-available and cost-lowering flex-blanket PV concentration systems. The use of these concentrating methods to reduce the amount of expensive high-performance photovoltaics is a necessity to make cost-viable many of the planned NASA high-power SEP and Planetary missions.<BR><BR>Certain SEP-powered Tug and Planetary spacecraft applications have mission scenarios with burn events/maneuvers that impose high accelerations. The Mega-ROSA EX configurations proposed are capable of achieving these accels. up to 0.25 G's and higher.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed Mega-ROSA-EX technology promises to provide NASA a near-term and low-risk solar array system that provides revolutionary performance in terms of ultra-high power (100's of kW to 10's of MW), high specific power (>200-500 W/kg BOL at the wing level depending on PV), affordability (up to >50% projected cost savings at the array level with concentrators), light weight, high deployed stiffness, high deployed strength, ability to react maneuvering accelerations, compact stowage volume (>50 kW/m3 BOL), reliability, high radiation tolerance, high voltage operation capability, scale-ability, and LILT & HIHT operation capability.  The proposed highly-experienced team and unique capabilities will catalyze commercial infusion and rapidly increase Mega-ROSA-EX technology readiness.  The predicted performance metrics for the Mega-ROSA-EX technology are incredible improvements over current state-of-the-art, and in many cases are mission-enabling for future NASA Exploration missions and other NASA applications, and particularly for NASA's deep space solar electric propulsion (SEP) high-voltage and high-radiation missions, space-tug missions, and large area Planetary / Lunar surface missions.<BR><BR>Space applications are comprised of NASA missions that require large-power production through deployment of photovoltaic devices.  Ultra-high power applications include high power spacecraft, Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP), space-tug, etc.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA space commercial applications are comprised of practically all DoD, and commercial missions that require large-power production through deployment of photovoltaic devices.  Ultra-high power applications include high power spacecraft, Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP),and high-power telecommunications  DoD customers may take advantage of the high-stiffness / strength capability for reacting maneuvering loads associated with rapid-response surveillance missions.

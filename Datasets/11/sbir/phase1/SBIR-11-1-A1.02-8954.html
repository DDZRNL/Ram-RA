		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The purpose of this Phase I SBIR program is to adapt NanoSonic's HybridSil&#153; nanocomposites that combine high levels of erosion resistance and anti-icing functionality to enable in-flight icing measurement and mitigation for next generation aircraft.  Icing on engine components, rotors, and wings creates substantial problems during in-flight operation.  To address the issues of both in-flight icing measurement and mitigation, NanoSonic will build on its demonstrated HybridSil&#153; Erosion protective, anti-icing appliqu?s/tapes designed for rotorblades to realize a lightweight nanocomposite with appropriate functionality to enable multifunctional icing measurement and mitigation on next generation aircraft.  NanoSonic's current HybridSil&#153; Erosion has been measured to provide high levels of particle and rain erosion protection; samples have been tested up to 7 hrs rain erosion and 100 g/cm2 mass loading angular sand, both tested at 500 mph, with sample survival following exposure.  Additionally, the nanocomposite materials have been demonstrated to prevent dynamic ice accretion at temperatures as low as 19?F (-7?C) in their current tape format.  Application has been demonstrated thus far with excellent adhesion and performance on 6Al4V Ti, 2024 T0 Al, and glass fiber/epoxy composites. A prime that provides de-icing systems to a broad range of commercial and defense platforms is currently working with NanoSonic for baseline performance evaluation of its HybridSil&#153; Erosion/Icephobic materials, and has discussed with NanoSonic methodologies to integrate multifunctionality, such as developing icing measurement concepts, for a broad range of existing and future aircraft.  This prime has expressed significant interest and support of NanoSonic's materials development, and will work with NanoSonic through a subcontract on this effort to integrate design suggestions and perform rigorous measurements required for transition to NASA platforms.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		As the proposed technology is matured and qualified throughout the proposed effort, multiple manufacturers and customers will integrate this technology within their designs to help enable all-weather operation of existing and next generation aircraft.  The proposed materials are technology enablers for next generation airframe structures and engine components where lightweight, durable materials and low power requirements mandate innovative approaches to not only mitigate ice formation, but to enable measurement of icing conditions that promote unwanted ice formation and to concurrently provide erosion protection. In addition to aircraft, the proposed nanocomposites will be useful for a broad range of commercial rotorcraft and jet engine applications.  NanoSonic will work with its Phase I prime partner to identify multiple potential commercial and defense outlets for the technology developed within this effort.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed multifunctional nanocomposites integrate high durability and hydrophobic functionality, which is marketable to an extremely broad range of applications outside of aircraft. Water repellency provides anti-icing functionality useful in nearly any vehicle or structure for missions where icing or the risk of ice formation inhibits progress. Water repellency also suggests minimized water ingress, which is a significant problem in nearly all applications where composites are used for metal replacement. For metallic materials, the proposed materials will reduce corrosion, reducing maintenance and concerns of potential structural integrity damage resulting from corrosion. Similar hydrophobic nanocomposites can also significantly reduce frictional drag, enhancing performance. Commercial applications are nearly limitless for higher performance, cost and energy saving commercial aircraft and automobiles. Because of the dynamic applicability of NanoSonic's nanocomposites, the potential market spans from military to civilian, opening the door to endless possibilities in multiple industries.

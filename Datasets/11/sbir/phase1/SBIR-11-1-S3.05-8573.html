		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The overall objective of this research project is to investigate an autonomous and online control structure for finite-inertia power systems (dc and ac) with a real-time system simulation embedded within the control. The dual use aspect of this research will be demonstrated by focusing simultaneously on model development for both spacecraft power systems and terrestrial micro-grids. Both of these applications require advanced controls to react to unpredictable circumstances when human intervention is not possible or practical. The Phase I effort will focus on model development, model verification and validation, and applying model reduction and/or averaging and advanced simulation techniques to achieve a real-time system simulation. This will set the stage for the development of advanced power management and distribution controls. In particular, the possibility of embedding a real-time simulation into a control infrastructure, providing contingency analysis and look-ahead prediction of the results of control actions, could be investigated.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Model-based design of power management and distribution controls is specifically targeted at deep space autonomous systems (such as Radioisotope Power Systems) in this proposal. System controls developed with this approach could provide fault tolerance, autonomous reconfiguration, stability, power management, and optimal resource allocation. It is anticipated that the software and model library developed in the effort will coalesce into a software product that can be applied to other NASA programs as well. In addition, PCKA will be well-positioned to provide services including development of additional models and implementation of real-time system simulations.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed approach is sufficiently general and scalable that potential target applications include (in addition to spacecraft power systems) electrical power systems on a wide range of military platforms (aircraft, ground vehicles, shipboard) and also commercial terrestrial power grid and micro-grid applications. Of particular interest are micro-grids in government facilities that, under Executive Order 13423 of 2007, are required to achieve a 30% reduction in energy intensity in the FY2006&#150;2015 timeframe. Government facilities offer a unique setting to incorporate and investigate new ideas in the control of terrestrial micro-grids in a more controlled and isolated environment than is feasible in the commercial electric power grid.

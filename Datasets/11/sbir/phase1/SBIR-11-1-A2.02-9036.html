		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal address innovations to the Laser-Induced Incandescence method aimed at (1) improving the lower detection limit of soot volume fraction by as much as two orders of magnitude and increasing overall measurement range by two orders of magnitude to meet new regulation that are in place or anticipated and (2) provide PM mean volumetric particle size and number density measurement capabilities.  The proposed advances in the LII technique will substantially increase the capabilities for real-time particulate matter measurements over any engine transient operation. It will also have several orders of magnitude greater sensitivity than the gravimetric techniques or any other available method. The wide dynamic range and lower detection limit of LII will make this technique the preferred standard instrument for particulate matter measurements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA currently has the AAFEX program for evaluating fuels and combustion emissions. We have already participated in these tests and the availability of instruments with much higher sensitivity will serve to improve the measurement results from these studies. As regulations are imposed, means are required to determine compliance with these regulations. Our compact easy to use LII instruments will be very competitive in this market.  Artium believes that this instrument could be used for enforcing EPA regulations on particulate emissions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary application for the integrated system is for characterizing the black carbon particulate emissions from gas turbine (jet) engines, vehicles (diesel and gasoline) and other combustion sources. Artium Technologies has already developed the LII instrument for black carbon measurements from gas turbine and other combustion sources. The enhanced capabilities that will be derived from this program will be extended to measuring much lower concentrations of BC particulate matter. In addition, extending the method to measure the mean volume diameter of the soot aggregates and their concentration will place us in a very competitive position. These capabilities are needed by engine manufacturers who are faced with ever more stringent emissions regulations.

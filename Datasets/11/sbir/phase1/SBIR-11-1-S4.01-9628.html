		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed innovation is to use the comm-based measurements available from many advanced satellite cluster wireless networks to improve the flexibility and robustness of relative and absolute navigation systems without the additional expense, weight and power that a traditional navigation backup systems (like an extra GPS receiver) would require.  This will be accomplished by comparing the range, range-rate or angle measurements predicted by GPS-based navigation solutions to the actual measurements obtained from the communication system. By monitoring these parity equations and the innovations of the GPS filters, FDIR can be significantly improved. These parity relations between redundant range measurements create a more sensitive residual than filter-based residuals because most filters naturally mask the faults. Recovery to GPS failure can be accomplished by relying on the comm measurements themselves to maintain relative state observability. Attempted recovery of GPS or other strategies can then be implemented without requiring the cluster to disperse. By building off of Carrier-phase Differential GPS (CDGPS) navigation filters and cluster flight simulations currently being built by Emergent under its DARPA System F6 contract, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of this FDIR technique in simulation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		As GPS/CDGPS is the state of the art in absolute and relative navigation, it is anticipated that many missions involving cooperative rendezvous or docking will implement it. The proposed FDIR system has the potential to significantly improve the robustness and survivability of these spacecraft in the face of GPS failure or interruption.  Thus the proposed FDIR method would benefit missions as basic as commercial manned spacecraft docking with ISS or commercial space stations or as advanced as missions where small spacecraft work collaboratively to create sparse arrays, synthetic apertures, or other distributed sensors networks.  Other applications include spacecraft that are used to assemble large space structures, such as a manned mission where the Orion MPCV docks with another Orion MPCV or other spacecraft like the Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle or Deep Space Habitat. Finally, the technology stands to benefit cooperative satellite servicing missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The technologies developed in this project will be integrated into our work for DARPA's System F6 project.  This work is focused on the guidance, navigation and control software necessary to support cluster flight.  Many of the wireless communication systems being proposed for F6 produce range and range-rate measurements, and the navigation system will likely be GPS based, making it an ideal platform the proposed FDIR system.  It can also be used to support other DoD or commercial multi-satellite missions that involve cluster flight, orbital rendezvous or even docking. It is anticipated that in a few years commercial manned spacecraft will dock with the ISS or other commercial space stations.  Commercial systems are especially sensitive to size, weight, power, and cost and will benefit from the proposed FDIR enhancements when building rendezvous capable vehicles at any scale.

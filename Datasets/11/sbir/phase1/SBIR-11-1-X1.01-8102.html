		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this Phase I SBIR, Reactive Innovations, LLC (RIL) proposes to develop a compact and lightweight electrochemical to capture carbon dioxide in the martian atmosphere from nitrogen and argon. Our approach builds on two separately developed technologies in our laboratory involving: 1) carbon dioxide capture and 2) advanced electrode designs.  Our approach initially aims to make a compact reactive/separator that can operate continuously with minimum energy requirements for both ISRU process streams in particular the martian atmosphere. The success of this approach demonstrated in a compact and lightweight unit for NASA will allow us to deploy it in the near term for a number of terrestrial-based applications including CO2 sequestration and mitigation.

		<BR>
		The proposed technology has application in ISRU processing. In particular, the Martian atmosphere is about 95% CO2, which can potentially be separated and processed to produce oxygen or methane gas. Another important application for CO2 separation technologies involve air revitalization where excess carbon dioxide must be removed from the cabin of spacecraft and spacesuits.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to NASA, this technology will have significant terrestrial-based applications and thereby a significant customer base. The market for separating carbon dioxide from other gases is expected to grow with continued interest and emphasis on reducing CO2 emissions. Sequestering CO2 or reducing CO2 to oxygen on earth may find interest by organizations that need to reduce their CO2 emissions. Successful cost effective technologies that can sequester CO2 clearly have a world-wide market appeal. A compact  reactor that efficiently separates and concentrates CO2 can be used in sequestration scenario, alternative fuels production, as well at mitigating CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants.

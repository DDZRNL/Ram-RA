		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		For effective disaster response, software technology needs to provide several key features: enable real-time reporting of events, aggregate and analyze event reports in real-time, display event reports on maps (2D) and geobrowsers (3D). We propose to leverage several leading-edge software technologies and trends, as well as relevant existing open-source / accessible software platforms and mapping clients. The technologies are: cloud-computing, crowdsourcing, semantic analysis, social media, mobile computing, and geospatial visualization. Our primary innovation is an architectural approach for combining these technologies into one coherent platform and a mobile app software tool for disaster response.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed mobile app software tool directly addresses NASA's stated need for disaster response. It leverages and enhances broadly used technologies and platforms such as Ushahidi, Google App Engine, Twitter, Facebook and Google Maps. It enables the layering of real-time social media responses onto geobrowsers such as COAST and Google Earth. This technology can also be used in other NASA applications such as Air Traffic Control and Space Missions.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Platforms like Ushahidi are currently utilized in crowdsourced disaster response web sites and mobile apps. This technology will enhance these sites and applications by enabling semantic parsing of social media and implementation through cloud computing. Homeland security, Department of Defense, and Law Enforcement are some potential users. Hospitals and other healthcare service providers can use this technology for epidemics and pandemics.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		An important aspect of the ISS air revitalization system for life support is the removal of carbon dioxide from cabin air and retrieves oxygen from CO2. The current state of art technology for CO2 reduction is Sabatier reaction, which is energy intensive and results in excess CO2. Cambrian Innovation has developed an electromethanogenesis bio-electrochemical system (BES) that is focused on reducing costs associated with CO2 reduction. The two-chambered BES system is designed to operate by producing a reliable stream of O2 while simultaneously bio-electrochemically reducing CO2 to CH4 and H2O. Phase I experiments and analysis will be used to determine whether it will be feasible to develop a cell which can replace the existing Sabatier reactor. Through Phase II and Phase III R&D we hope to develop and test a BES CO2 removal system for potential utilization aboard the ISS or related crewed systems.

		<BR>
		The proposed electromethanogenesis BES could potentially replace the existing Sabatier reactor in Air Revitalization System with the benefit of higher CO2 removal efficiency and lower power draw.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed system might also find use in other CO2 sequestration applications. For example, combining photo-voltaic (PV) technology, the proposed BES could be applied to converting CO2 directly to natural gas in coal fired power plants which supply readily available CO2.

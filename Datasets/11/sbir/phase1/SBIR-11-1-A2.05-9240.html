		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Active flow control using dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuators is an attractive option for both reduction of complexity of aircraft systems required for off-cruise operation and increasing reliability of future hypersonic vehicles. However, development of DBD plasma actuators has been rather slow due to the complexity and lack of understanding of physical processes associated with DBD operation and its interaction with the external flow. In order to widen the capabilities of the DBD plasma actuators and make them applicable to a number of NASA missions, including Supersonic and Subsonic Projects, it is necessary to develop a predictive methodology to optimize DBD systems based on complex understanding of plasma-flow interaction. We propose to develop full plasma/CFD experimentally validated modeling capability for DBD plasma actuators for the problem of Shock Wave Boundary Layer Interaction (SWBLI) control. During Phase I of the project we will develop a prototype simulation tool for SWBLI control system using DBD plasma actuators, demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed control approach both using numerical simulation and wind tunnel experiments at Princeton University and validate developed prototype against experimental and available numerical data.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The primary NASA application of the proposed SWBLI control simulation tool is active flow control for inlet of scramjet engine to ensure efficient combustion and increase reliability of the hypersonic vehicles. In addition, NASA scientists will get predictable plasma-based active flow separation control simulation tool for a number of NASA projects, such as Subsonic Fixed Wing Project, Subsonic Rotary Wing Project. Finally, the proposed simulation tool, coupled with existing NASA high-fidelity CFD tools, will ensure solution of multi-physics problems, such as full simulations of plasma-assisted combustion for in-flight conditions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Active flow control using DBD plasma actuators is of interest to a number of government agencies, private industry and universities. Proposed concept and associated simulation tool will be beneficial for hypersonic and subsonic programs, involving plasma-based control concepts. These programs include, but are not limited to, development of hypersonic aircrafts, such as DARPA FALCON program and Boeing X-51, active flow separation control at UAVs and commercial airplanes during take-off, landing or maneuvering, improvement of engine performance. Besides the primary application for a SWBLI control, proposed tool can be used for a wide range of plasma aerodynamics applications, such as plasma-assisted combustion, de-icing of aircraft wings and efficient operation of windmills at high angles of attack.

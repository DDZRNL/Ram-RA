		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		ORBITEC proposes to develop and demonstrate a novel cooling concept called Lattice Regenerative Cooling Methods (LRCM) for future high thrust in-space propulsion systems.  Incorporation of ORBITEC's innovative lattice structures in the fabrication of thrust chambers for expander cycle engine systems will maximize the heat transfer into the coolant fluid, expand design options, enable substantial cost savings, and reduce lead times for component fabrication.  Using rapid prototyping technology, the LRCM hybrid fabrication approach allows for the rapid casting of near-net shape metallic thrust chamber components.  The lattice passages allow for turbulent flows through the cooling jacket which induces mixing in the coolant.  During Phase I, monolithic chamber wall sections incorporating the LRCM lattice structure will be fabricated and tested in a hot-fire test conditions in ORBITEC's propulsion testing facilities.

		<BR>
		The primary focus of this activity is to develop innovative cooling approaches for rocket combustion devices that will expand the performance envelope and reduce the manufacturing cost of future high thrust in-space propulsion systems for NASA.   LRCM components and subassemblies will be developed for implementation in an operational engine system during the Phase III program.  The same high performance cooling approaches could be used in a wide range of propulsion applications including large-scale booster engines, RCS thrusters, and other in-space propulsion systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The LRCM high performance cooling approaches could be used in a wide range of Air Force, DoD, or commercial applications including large-scale booster engines, RCS thrusters, and other in-space propulsion systems.  Beyond the needs of NASA, it is expected that the LRCM manufacturing technology will be integrated into ORBITEC thrust chambers for other customers such as the U.S. Air Force's USLV (7-30K lbf) propulsion systems and future commercial launch applications.  ORBITEC will market this technology to other rocket engine manufacturers.  We are currently under contract with Boeing to provide propulsion system design and analysis for an upcoming DoD procurement where the LRCM technology would be of tremendous benefit.  In addition, we have been approached by Lockheed Martin for information on our propulsion technologies and other technologies for future programs.  Other commercial applications for this cooling technology may include industrial burners and large-scale, power-generating gas turbines.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA's latest effort in developing a common platform for space communication and navigation systems is the Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) standard. It defines architecture enabling interoperability of Software Defined Radio (SDR) components. Future proof, power conscious architectures of STRS compliant re-configurable SDR transceivers are needed for implementation of envisioned space communication systems.<BR>Pacific Microchip Corp. proposes to develop a highly integrated, low-power, multifunctional 56GS/s Direct Digital Modulation/Demodulation (DDM) SDR transceiver using 45nm SOI CMOS technology. The resulting STRS compliant integrated solution will be radiation tolerant by technology and design. The direct conversion based transceiver utilizes novel 56GS/s D/A and A/D converters and features arbitrary waveform generation (AWG) mode. The availability of AWG and DDM modes removes limitations on the synthesized waveform shapes up to 28GHz. Pacific Microchip Corp. proposes all-digital implementation of frequency up- and down-conversion, I/Q modulation and demodulation. Since digital power is mostly dynamic, digital processing will enable power consumption scaling linearly with the operating frequency.<BR>Phase I work will provide a complete definition and in-silico validation of the proposed device. The Phase II program will produce a fieldable product. In order to facilitate the commercialization efforts in Phase III, a commercial radiation-tolerant CMOS SOI technology will be used.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The low power re-configurable SDR transmitters and receivers featuring power optimization capability depending on the required BER, high modulation frequencies have great potential in current and future NASA missions.  Besides targeted application for CONNECT experiment installed on ISS, proposed all-digital SDR transceiver is directly applicable to a systems seeking autonomous operation such as deep space communication radios. NASA missions using Ku band, such as OIB (airborne program for precise sea and ice elevation monitoring) will also benefit from proposed SDR architecture which will increase their accuracy.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		In addition to its primary application in space communication systems, the proposed wideband SDR transceiver and its building blocks will be targeting other commercial and military related markets which require high speed capture, digitization, and synthesis of wideband signals. Commercial applications include wireless (WiMAX, 3G, 4G) and fiber optic communication (40G and 100G Ethernet). The projected ramp-up of 100G Ethernet technologies will raise industry demand for capable test equipment. The direct conversion architecture of the proposed transceiver provides the flexibility needed for testing equipment. Therefore, it has great commercialization potential in this market segment. Possible military applications include high speed, secure communication and data transmission systems and millimeter-resolution radars.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		HJ Science & Technology, Inc. proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of an integrated "lab-on-a-chip" technology capable of in-situ, high throughput, and real time identification and characterization of a variety of toxic metals, organics, and bacteria biomarkers in spacecraft water supplies onboard the International Space Station.  The novel technology combines automated programmable on-chip sample processing technology, microchip capillary electrophoresis, and laser induced fluorescence detection in a miniaturized format.  In terms of spacecraft environmental monitoring, the in situ measurement capability of our portable platform offers important advantages including reduction in time and cost, real-time data for better and more timely decision making, and reduction in sample consumption.  In addition to the unprecedented sensitivity, efficiency, selectivity, and throughput compared with the current state-of-the-art technologies, the proposed miniature instrument also meets the stringent space-flight requirements including small consumption of sample and reagent , low-mass, low&#150;power consumption, rapid analysis time, and microgravity compatibility.  In Phase I, we will establish the technical feasibility of the technology by analyzing fluorescently labeled ketones and aldehydes as a proof of principle demonstration.  In Phase II, the main focus will direct towards the development of a miniaturized prototype to be delivered to NASA by incorporating the most promising design based on the results of Phase I as well including additional detection modules in order to extend the measurement and analysis capability to other contaminants relevant to spacecraft environmental monitoring.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)

		Our novel integrated microfluidics technology has great potential to enhance NASA's current efforts to monitor spacecraft environment.  In particular, the microanalytical instrument is capable of performing rapid simultaneous measurements of a variety of toxic contaminants in spacecraft drinking water supply aboard the International Space Station.  In addition, the microfluidic technology is naturally suited to such important NASA programs as planetary and small body surface chemistry studies.  It also has broad applications including on-chip biosensors, electrochemical sensors, wet-chemistry systems, as well as high pressure micropumps for fluid positioning, mixing, metering, storage, and filtering systems, clinical diagnostics, spacecraft and biosphere environmental monitoring, and toxicology studies.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The toxic contaminants potentially present in the water supply aboard the International Space Station are also a serious concern to human health on earth because they are common environmental pollutants present in air, food, drinking water, and soil.  The proposed technology therefore can be a powerful analytical tool with significant commercial potential for a wide range of in situ environmental monitoring applications.  In addition to environmental monitoring, other commercial devices based on the microfluidics technology envisioned include components for DNA, protein and drug separation and analysis, chemical analysis systems, drug delivery systems, and embedded health monitoring systems.  The relative simplicity and unmatched capability of these micro-devices will enable numerous, large-scale commercial markets to be infused with the technology.

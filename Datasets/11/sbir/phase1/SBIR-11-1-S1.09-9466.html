		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to develop a coke-can-size, 250 g, 400 mW instrument for mounting on small lander or rover arms: the ultra-Compact Optical Spectrometer for Organic Mapping (&#61549;COSOM) instrument. Two core technologies enable the proposed instrument: a narrow linewidth, 235 nm, deep UV (DUV) semiconductor laser triode (LT), currently being developed by Photon System under DARPA funding; and a new uncooled, linear DUV CCD array detector with high quantum efficiency in the DUV with fast read rates and low read noise.  <BR>	The need for in situ micro-scale mapping for trace concentrations of organics on planetary surfaces is exemplified by requirements put forth the (July 09) Mid Range Rover &#150; Science Analysis Group (MRR-SAG) and again in a 2010 Astrobiology paper by Pratt et al. ?COSOM fulfills similar organic needs on future in-situ missions with MER class rover/arm sizes or small landers to planetary bodies such as Mars, icy worlds (Titan, Europa, Enceladus), and small primitive bodies.<BR>	&#61549;COSOM provides a broad organic and inorganic compound measurement capability without the need for sample handling or reagents.  It will excite sub-ppb levels of organic compounds on rocks, soil, or other surfaces at 235 nm and simultaneously measure Raman scattering in the 240 nm to 260 nm region (1000 to 4000 cm-1) and native fluorescence in the 260 nm to 700 nm region at a working distance of several cm, with long depth of focus, and with the ability to map areas up to 1 by 1 cm in size with 100 &#61549;m spatial resolution.  The pulsed source enables solar blind gated Raman and fluorescence spectral measurements but also fluorescence and phosphorescence decay measurements to provide orthogonal information about target composition.  The instrument can also provide spectral reflectance of targets from 240 nm to 700 nm together with Raman and fluorescence data, using solar illumination, and enable solar and stellar irradiance and sky background measurements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The uCOSOM instrument has a broad range of potential applications for NASA as well as commercially.  For NASA, uCOSOM provides a very miniature instrument for terrestrial field applications including examination of targets both on the surface and underwater.  Because of its size, weight, and power consumption uCOSOM can be deployed on very miniature robots or be hand-held.  Because of the broad measurement capability, it can not only measure the chemical and biological nature of materials but also provide information on the environment and situation of the target measurement.  Simple additions to the instrument can provide GPS location as well as azimuth and elevation information to each extensive Raman and fluorescence data set. <BR>Typical commercial applications of uCOSOM would include chemical and biological surface contamination for the pharmaceutical industry, hospitals, microelectronics and other industries, product testing in the chemical and food industries, and environmental monitoring of water, air, soil, and a myriad of other applications where small spot sizes or photon-energy-specific excitation is needed or enabling.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial application benefit also from the miniature size and ability to detect and characterize trace chemical contaminants.  As a tool for first responders, this instrument surpasses other Raman based instruments because of the limits of detection and ability to characterize a very broad range of materials without fluorescence obscuration of Raman bands and the added information provide by fluorescence as an independent, orthogonal, measurement variable.  Additional commercial applications of uCOSOM would include chemical and biological surface contamination for the pharmaceutical industry, hospitals, microelectronics and other industries, product testing in the chemical and food industries, and environmental monitoring of water, air, soil, and a myriad of other applications where small spot sizes or photon-energy-specific excitation is needed or enabling.

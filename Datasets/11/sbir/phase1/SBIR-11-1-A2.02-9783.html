		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Scramjet engines promise to become a next-generation revolutionary technology for aerospace applications. Some of the significant challenges in rapid development of scramjets include complex flow physics; combustion; flow-combustion interactions; propulsion air-frame integration; coupled with difficulty in producing realistic experimental conditions.  The role of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), therefore, is crucial in design and development of the scramjet engines.  The overall innovation includes development of a comprehensive Eulerian transported PDF methods framework coupled with an efficient RANS/LES flow solvers for simulating high-speed turbulent reacting flows and an innovative chemistry acceleration module achieving up to two orders of magnitude reduction in computing times for the Eulerian TPDF framework.  In Phase I feasibility of the proposed Eulerian transported PDF approaches for accurately capturing turbulence-chemistry interactions will be demonstrated and analyzed. In Phase II, we will perform additional developments in the chemistry acceleration module and the Eulerian TPDF framework, such that a comprehensive, turbulent-combustion modeling framework, for low and high-Mach number reacting flows will be available at the end of Phase II.

		The tools developed in this SBIR project will be directly useful to NASA's Hypersonics Program.  The methods developed under this project will have wide ranging applications at NASA in addition to high-speed combustion devices such as ramjets and scramjets, including design of propulsion devices such as solid rocket motors, liquid rocket engines and gas turbine combustors &#150; important in the design of the Space Launch System, In-space propulsion systems, numerous planetary spacecraft missions, etc. The Eulerian transported PDF methods are an area of active research and have excellent promise to provide accurate and computationally tractable models for complex turbulence-chemistry interactions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The software tool developed in this project will significantly improve the accuracy and reduce turn-around times for design and analysis cycles for scramjet applications to the Department of Defense programs. It will also be useful for simulating low-speed combustion devices such as gas turbine combustors and augmenters. The technology will facilitate significant advancement in use of CFD analysis in applications including propulsion devices, gas-turbine combustors and other combustion devices.  The software will be beneficial to OEMs such as GE, Pratt & Whitney, Williams International, and Rolls Royce in designing various propulsion devices and gas turbine combustor components.  It will be a valuable tool for all industries that require CFD simulation of reacting flows in a hardware design process.  Modules developed in this project will also be of interest to commercial CFD OEMs such as ANSYS for integrating with their own simulation software.

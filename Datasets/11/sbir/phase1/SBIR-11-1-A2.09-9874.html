		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		International Electronic Machines (IEM), a leader in the development of innovative sensor solutions for transportation systems, will develop the Adaptive Rotorcraft Condition and Usage Tracking System (ARCUTS), building upon and integrating wireless instrumentation systems developed for the U.S. Navy, CBM systems developed for the U.S. Army, and condition and diagnostic sensing systems developed for other Federal, state, and commercial purposes. ARCUTS will combine wireless technologies with specific sensing capabilities which may be targeted towards any aspect of the drive or engine systems. <BR><BR>For Phase I, IEM will focus on a unique and innovative wireless torque monitoring approach for drive shafts which combines capabilities of two of IEM?s patented and patent-pending inventions into a single powerful system for measuring and tracking torque at high sample rates (to detect even short transient strains) and high accuracy (to less than 1%) to permit accurate and reliable CBM of shafts and immediately dependent components. Torque measurement is proposed because accurate, high-speed torque measurement has strong implications  not only for CBM applications but also for proper control and power usage applications on rotorcraft and in other settings as well. IEM will also show how ARCUTS provides its adaptability by demonstrating that the same core technology can be used to track the condition of other components of the drive train and engine. IEM will be supported in this work by the Boeing Corporation, premier designers and manufacturers of military and civilian rotorcraft as well as fixed-wing aircraft and one of NASA?s partners in the development of the LCTR-2.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The initial target application for ARCUTS will be for use in NASA development and testing of rotorcraft, including the Large Civil Tiltrotor-2. The LCTR-2, like other tiltrotors such as the V-22, relies on torque transfer through shafts that are not only immediately attached to an individual engine but also stretch across the entire aircraft. It is vital that this capability remain intact in the event of a single engine failure, since such a connection provides the only means for the aircraft to continue flying with one functioning engine. <BR><BR>The core smart adaptable wireless sensor (SAWS) technology will be applicable to many other NASA test and monitoring requirements besides torque monitoring.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		ARCUTS specific technology applies to any rotorcraft with primary or secondary shafts with section lengths over one foot or so. As such, multiple applications will be found in military rotorcraft (V-22, CH-47, CH-53 series, and others) and in civilian rotorcraft as well.<BR><BR>The core wireless sensor technology can be applied to many other sensors and sensor packages, such as temperature, pressure, and strain sensors which are very applicable to PHM/CBM maintenance for fixed wing aircraft, rotorcraft, and even other transportation systems. IEM has multiple contacts and business connections in the fixed-wing aircraft, rotorcraft, railroad, and commercial vehicle industries and would leverage these to bring the technology developed under ARCUTS to market.

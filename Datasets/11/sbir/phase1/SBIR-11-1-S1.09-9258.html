		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		During this Phase I, Michigan Aerospace Corporation will adapt the design of an optical MEMS seismometer for lunar and other planetary science instrumentation. The optical MEMS based seismometer takes advantage of the high Q of morphological dependent resonances and can be sensitive to a few nano-g with a proof mass under 80 grams. The three-axis seismometer, originally designed for field applications, will be rugged, compact and low power (<160 mW per channel). During the Phase I effort, MAC will develop the design for the instrumentation, with specific attention to the environmental conditions encountered on the lunar surface, in particular the large temperature excursions and galactic cosmic radiation. During Phase II, an engineering model will be fabricated, tested and demonstrated.

		<BR>
		This effort will produce a design for a compact, low-power optical MEMS-based seismometer that will be rugged enough for use on the Moon; such a device will find use for seismic sensing on other solar system bodies as NASA missions explore asteroids, Mars and elsewhere. The sensitivity of the device is such that it can be used for sensitive studies of acceleration in spacecraft, for example to study atmospheric drag on satellites. Extremely rugged sensors normally used for space applications will also find terrestrial work in seismic studies near active volcanoes and other extreme Earth-bound environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The base technology will result in low-cost accelerometers, no matter the application. The components are inexpensive, and the fabrication and packaging do not require highly-specialized environments, unlike micro-fabricated devices. We anticipate such instrument to penetrate the market because its reliability and affordability. Applications for such an accelerometer encompass a broad range of activities. They include:<BR>--Geological research: mining and oil prospecting<BR>--Earth sciences<BR>--Space exploration: satellite drag measurements, docking, navigation<BR>--Homeland security: footstep detection, tampering, entry and illicit activities<BR>--Building safety<BR>--Academic research<BR>--Vehicle safety research

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose to investigate a virtual teamwork training suite incorporating serious games that target specific team-oriented skills and behaviors. We will define metrics for evaluation of team performance, devise games that engage crew and controller participants in relevant team tasks, and perform a review on the applicability of virtual environment and serious game mechanics to training objectives.

		<BR>
		A training suite composed of serious games will be targeted towards teams composed of mission controllers and crew. During Phase I we will identify the behavioral constructs and indicators that drive requirements on game mechanics. Given a mission description, combination of games within the suite can be retrieved for use.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		As workplaces become more and more interdependent, while at the same time becoming more distributed, we expect that teaching readiness skills will be valued for increasing the productivity of teams. These skills are vital in high stakes domains such as military or law enforcement since peoples' lives are at stake. This includes training for emergency rooms, firefighters, law enforcement, emergency first responders, and so forth.

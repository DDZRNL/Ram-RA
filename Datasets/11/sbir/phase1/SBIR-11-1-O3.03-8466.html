		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Effort proposed is for detailed planning, configuration and hardware definition of a low-cost, but high technology payoff, ISS-based flight experiment that will allow key relevant space-flight environmental validation of our innovative Roll-Out Solar Array (ROSA) technology/ hardware.  The ROSA flex-blanket solar array technology provides game-changing affordability and performance, and delivers a performance paradigm shift in terms of: significantly lower cost, greater specific power, more compact stowage volume, higher structural performance, deployment reliability, less complexity, and higher modularity & scalability than state-of-the-art solar arrays; for NASA deep space planetary exploration/science, high-power solar electric propulsion (SEP) Tugs and Exploration vehicles, commercial orbital transportation and resupply (COTS, CRS)missions. <BR><BR>The critical and necessary aspect of readying the enabling ROSA technology for infusion into these applications is to increase the TRL to 7+ via test-validation of hardware in a relevant spaceflight environment provided by ISS (and supporting scalable predictive model validations) for three key ROSA technology advance areas critical to solar array implementation by end-users: Deployment Kinematics, Deployed Dynamics Behavior and Photovoltaic Power Production / Survivability.<BR><BR>The ISS provides a ready and cost-effective relevant space environment (zero-G, vacuum and solar illumination/thermal) test-bed for the validation of these key ROSA technology areas via the straightforward flight experiment proposed.<BR><BR>The proposed ROSA ISS flight experiment will leverage off of existing ground-based hardware test / analysis efforts to continue the systematic ROSA technology maturation, risk mitigation and TRL advancement to level 7+, through space-environment validations of a ROSA prototype-experiment flight wing's function and performance. It will also allow generation of flight validated, scalable, TRL 7+ predictive models.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The impacts of a successful Phase 1 and Phase 2 flight experiment development; and successful ISS space flight TRL 7+ validation of the ROSA technology will provide a reliable replacement for expensive and inferior-performing solar arrays, will enable many future NASA missions requiring: high specific power, high stiffness / strength, scalability  / modularity, high stowed packaging efficiency, autonomous retraction and re-deployment capability, large-area / high power capability, high voltage operation, LILT operation, and high radiation survivability; including many of NASA's Exploration and Planetary Science missions, and will provide a next generation technology for ultra-reliable, elegantly simple and low-cost high-performance flex blanket solar array applications.<BR><BR>The ROSA technology is very well suited for high-power, high voltage Exploration missions, SEP missions, deep space LILT missions, high strength and high stiffness CEV, COTS/CRS, rovers, and other NASA mission applications requiring significant design flexibility, scalability, modularity and low cost.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		ROSA is also ideal as a direct replacement solar array for the large number of projected future commercial communications satellites that require ever-increasing power levels, and DoD surveillance / communication applications requiring the highest performing solar arrays.   <BR><BR>The proposed (ISS-flight validated) technology will undoubtedly provide discriminating performance and will be mission-enabling for many commercial and DoD space missions / applications when compared to current state-of-the-art systems.  The ROSA technology's ultra-high performance, affordability (less expensive than rigid arrays), configuration flexibility and low-parts, and elegantly-simple deployment reliability is game-changing for the commercial space solar array industry.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Space Micro's technology features the use of a FPMA or field programmabe microwave array that is Multi-band and multi-waveform capable. The FPMA can be integrated into a Multi-Chip Module (MCM)to enable SWaP (size weight and power) improvements.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This novel agile cognitive space radio technology has broad potential commercial application as well as NASA applications which include space - vehicle, spacecraft mounted to support satellite or ground/ship stations.<BR><BR>Generic NASA Applications:<BR><BR>Virtually all NASA space programs have a demand for this proposed technology and product. NASA applications range from space shuttle, space station, earth sensing missions e.g. (EOS), and deep space missions. NASA programs/missions that will benefit include new lunar landers and orbiters e.g. (LADEE), Mars missions, solar system exploration e.g. (Titan, Juno, Europa, comet nucleus return, New Discovery, and Living with a Star (LWS).  NASA programs which may continue to be funded by Congress include the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and Commercial Orbiter Transportation Service (COTS) would benefit.   Products evolving from this SBIR will be enabling for future programs such as Dawn, Aquarius, Kepler, Ocean Vector Winds, and space interferometry (SIR).

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This novel agile cognitive space radio technology has broad potential commercial application. Applications include space - vehicle, spacecraft mounted to support satellite or ground/ship stations; Military, vehicle or man pack mounted; Civilian, vehicle or man pack mounted to support planes, cars or mobile applications.<BR><BR>Non-NASA Applications:<BR><BR>This technology and evolving Space Micro products may benefit many commercial space platforms, both LEO and GEO telecommunication satellites, such as Intelsat, Direct TV, XM radio, Orbcomm and Iridium Next telecom constellation replenishment, plus standard industry busses including Lockheed's A2100, and Boeing's HS-702.<BR><BR>Civil earth sensing applications such as weather/metrology applications e.g. (NOAA GOES and Landsat) can also benefit. <BR><BR>The large DoD space industry, including USAF, MDA, NRO, and new Army nanosat programs at SMDC will directly benefit. Among these programs are AEHF upgrades, GPS follow-ons, MDA's STSS and PTSS, USAF TacSat family, Operationally Responsive Space (ORS), and Army SMDC nanosat family. The entire Cubesat initiative including NRO's Colony program and USAF SENSE program would benefit.<BR><BR>This technology and products will also address emerging MDA radiation threats. These programs include AKV, THAAD, AEGIS, SM3 Block IIB, and GMD for Blocks 2016 and beyond. With the new challenge of atmospheric neutrons to High Altitude Airship (HAA) programs and NASA or Air Force UAV programs.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		NASA is installing the Communications, Navigation, and Networking reConfigurable Testbed  (CoNNeCT) onto the truss of the International Space Station to demonstrate software-defined radio (SDR) technology, and is now accepting proposals for new and useful SDR experiments to fly on CoNNeCT that are compliant with the Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) SDR standard.  Emergent Space Technologies proposes to develop an STRS-compliant software-defined GPS receiver that can be flown on CoNNeCT that is based on a proven terrestrial commercial technology which shares heritage with the JPL Blackjack receiver.  The proposed system is called the Radio Navigation Waveform Experiment (RANE) and utilizes a codeless signal processing technique, called Spectral Compression Positioning (SCP), to estimate position, navigation, and timing (PNT) solutions.  RANE will have a small electronic footprint, be multi-frequency capable, and require less power than traditional code-correlator GPS receivers.  On CoNNeCT, RANE will demonstrate the portability and use of SCP for PNT solutions for NASA.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		RANE will be a highly portable GPS SDR that can be used in various orbits ranging from near-Earth to geosynchronous orbit.  The versatility of RANE to detect and track signals in a weak signal environment or highly accelerating one has been shown in simulation and testing.  This is particularly useful for a geosynchronous vehicle like GOES-R.  This technology has significant promise for nearly any spaceborne GPS application.  Due to its low electronic footprint and power, RANE could be used on cubesats and can also coexist on a shared hardware platform, such as communications.  RANE can track multiple frequencies simultaneously and thus has significant potential for space weather.  And in an STRS compliant form factor, it will be portable to various platforms.  RANE can track the encrypted L1 P(Y) chipping code phase.  Pairing this capability with real-time GPS differential corrections can potentially enable geodetic quality PNT solutions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The current terrestrial implementation of RANE requires little power and has a small electronic footprint.  It can be added to another set of hardware to increase capabilities without adding weight.  RANE can also be flown on cubesats where SWaP is limited for use as a PNT sensor or space weather sensor.  The Air Force has shown interest in the codeless technology and its versatility for Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) missions.  Since RANE can be configured to detect any broadband signal with the appropriate RF front end, it could navigate in GPS-denied environments.  This would be especially useful in various military applications.  It can function in various orbit types without little-to-no changes to the waveform.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		To address NASA's need for alternative methods for ambient preservation of human biological samples collected during extended spaceflight and planetary operations, Chromologic (CL) proposes to develop a novel Biological Sample Ambient Preservation (BioSAP) device. BioSAP device is based on an improved dried biological specimens storage approach and specialized matrix to (1) collect a known amount of biological samples, (2) rapidly capture and stabilize them, (3) protect them from biodegradation, (4) decrease drying time, and (5) increase recovery. The unique technology and expertise of CL scientists will result in an innovative, reliable, compact and low-cost method of collecting and preserving dried biological specimens at room temperature. The unique portable design of the BioSAP does not require any power source and it is utilizable during flight and mission. In Phase I, CL will demonstrate the feasibility of the BioSAP device by fabricating a prototype device capable of capturing and stabilizing a subset of target analytes through a rapid drying process. In Phase II, CL plans to validate, refine and optimize the design of the BioSAP to allow for future integration with post-mission analysis methodologies.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA will have a versatile, compact, lightweight blood and urine preservation device does not require refrigeration that can be used for long-term studies into the effects of the microgravity environment on the physiology of astronauts.  The small sized inexpensive material based system is designed to weigh as little as possible and be able to be tightly packed; it does not require any additional processing equipment nor consume any power. The versatility of the BioSAP device will allow its range of use to be expanded to encompass storage of other biological fluids with very little modification. No commercial system offers the capability of BioSAP in room temperature biological preservation during space missions.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The BioSAP device will lead to a new generation of biological specimen preservation devices for use in remote, challenging conditions where scientific equipment and infrastructure are not readily available. The BioSAP device can also be incorporated, for example, into the standardized tool or method that are currently used for quick diagnostic at limited resource settings. Development of this device will have immediate applications in medicine in third world countries, forensic data collection and environmental monitoring. In addition, BioSAP system can be commercialized into the following market: self blood collection at home and send it for remote testing, for new-born screening, drug monitoring, and small animal research.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The concept in the proposed project is to create a melting, alloying and casting furnace for the processing titanium based SMA using cold crucible techniques. The cold crucible furnace configuration will allow the material to remain pure without ceramic contamination. By using a combination of arc melting and induction processes it will also allow the material to be fully alloyed from elemental feed stock. The complete alloying and casting process will be contained in one vacuum/atmospheric chamber reducing the introduction of oxygen in the process. The deliverable at the end of the project will be to deliver a fully developed melting, alloying and casting furnace for processing 500g melts to The Advanced Metallics Branch of NASA Glenn Research Center.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The NASA application of the proposed furnace is to enable the full theoretical properties to be explored of titanium based shape memory alloys (SMA). It is not limited to research of SMA it can be used for a wide range of reactive and refractory metal alloy development including intermetallic compounds.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed furnace configuration is a saleable product for Arcast Inc. and we intend to market it once it is fully developed.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The Exercise Load Measurement Insole (ELMI) is a system that is designed to measure normal and shear foot forces during exercise.  The ELMI system is lightweight, portable, unobtrusive, and its versatility allows it to be used for many purposes outside of exercise load measurement and study.  At the heart of ELMI is an innovative sensor design that when configured in an array can measure full foot normal and shear loads simultaneously. The sensor design allows for normal forces to be measured in compression, while both lateral and longitudinal forces can be measured in shear. The normal and shear sensitivity can be customized for different specifications, and even stacked for graded sensitivity, if desired. The result can be placed in an array and integrated into a shoe without affecting user operation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed Exercise Load Measurement Insole (ELMI) system is composed of individual sensing elements that are capable of measuring both normal and shear forces simultaneously. The flexible and thin characteristics of this sensor allow for it to be used for many other purposes in the space environment. The individual sensors could be placed on remotely teleoperated devices to measure contact forces.  In a similar fashion, these sensors could be used as input devices for an interface.  Also, since the sensor is flexible, it could also be placed on hand related exercise equipment bars (bench press, bicep curl) to measure upper body exertion. Outside of exercise use, these insoles could be used to monitor general ground reaction forces during routine daily activities.

		<BR>
		The proposed Exercise Load Measurement Insole (ELMI) system is composed of individual sensing elements that are capable of measuring both normal and shear forces simultaneously. The flexible and thin characteristics of this sensor allow for it to be used for many non NASA purposes. The individual sensors could be used by roboticists as tactile sensors for various manipulation tasks. These sensors could also be arranged in an array to ergonomically measure seat forces, as an indication of posture. In the insole form factor, this system technology could have many uses in athletic training, rehabilitation, and gait analysis.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Deployable Space Systems, Inc. (DSS) will focus the proposed NASA Phase 1 program on the development and validation of ROSA-Max, a significantly structurally/electrically optimized version of the basic ROSA solar array technology with advanced ultra-lightweight structures and IMM photovoltaics.  The combined embodiment with advanced ultra-lightweight structures and IMM photovoltaics offers maximum performance in all key metrics and unparalleled affordability for NASA Space Science missions.  ROSA-Max will enable emerging Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) Space Science missions through its ultra-lightweight, ultra-compact stowage volume, ultra-affordability, high strength/stiffness, and its high voltage and high/low temperature & illumination operation capability within many environments.  The ROSA-Max technology will provide NASA/industry a near-term and low-risk solar array system that provides revolutionary performance in terms of high specific power (>300-500 W/kg BOL at the wing level, PV-blanket dependent), affordability (>50% projected cost savings at the array level, PV-blanket dependent), ultra-lightweight, high deployed stiffness (10X better than current rigid panel arrays), high deployed strength (10X better than current rigid panel arrays), compact stowage volume (>60-80 kW/m3 BOL, 10X times better than current rigid panel arrays), high deployment reliability and operation reliability, high radiation tolerance, high voltage operation capability (>200 VDC), scalability (500W to 100's of kW), and LILT & HIHT operation capability (LILT &#150; Low Intensity Low Temperature, HIHT &#150; High Intensity High Temperature).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		NASA space applications are comprised of practically all Exploration, Space Science, Earth Science, Planetary Surface, and other missions that require high-efficiency photovoltaic power production through deployment of an ultra-lightweight and highly-modular structural system.  The technology is particularly suited for NASA's SEP missions and other missions that require game-changing performance in terms of affordability, ultra-lightweight, and compact stowage volume.  The technology is also well suited for applications requiring scalability/modularity, operability within high radiation environments, high voltage operation, and operation in LILT and HIHT environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Non-NASA space applications are comprised of practically all missions that require high-efficiency photovoltaic power production through deployment of an ultra-lightweight and highly-modular structural system.  The technology is particularly suited for SEP missions that require game-changing performance in terms of affordability, ultra-lightweight, and compact stowage volume.  Applicable non-NASA space missions include: LEO surveillance, reconnaissance, communications and other critical payload/equipment satellites, LEO commercial mapping and critical payload/equipment satellites, MEO satellites & space-tugs, GEO commercial communications and critical payload/equipment satellites, and GEO communications and payload/equipment satellites.  The proposed technology also has tremendous dual-use non-space commercial private-sector applicability including fixed-ground and deployable/retractable mobile-ground based systems.

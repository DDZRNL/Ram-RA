		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		This proposal puts forth an innovative star tracker hardware sensor that allows for autonomous calculation of a spacecraft's orbit by employing Doppler Spectroscopy and Astrometric techniques.  The proposed advanced star tracker provides onboard deep space orbit self determination capabilities through the use of specialized reference stars that have exoplanet companions.  The motion of exoplanets around a reference star's barycenter provides a stable, highly predictable natural signal pattern.  An advanced exoplanet star tracker enhances mission capabilities for future manned and unmanned space vehicles as well as reducing Deep Space Network (DSN) tracking requirements and resources.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed Exoplanet Star Tracker hardware would improve future navigation systems for NASA manned or unmanned space platforms.  Primary autonomous navigation could be incorporated into spacecraft designed for geostationary, elliptical or deep space orbits including missions to the Moon, comets, asteroids, Libration points and Mars.  Resource demands on DSN would be decreased.  Secondary navigation in low and medium Earth orbits would be available when primary GPS navigation is lost.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed Exoplanet Star Tracker hardware would improve future navigation systems for non-NASA users such as the military, non-profit research institutions, universities and commercial satellite builders.  Independent navigation in low and medium Earth orbits would be available when primary GPS navigation is unavailable.  In 2010, satellite manufacturing revenues were $10.8 billion dollars.

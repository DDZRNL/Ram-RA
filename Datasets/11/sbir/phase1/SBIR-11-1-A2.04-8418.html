		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Complex aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic phenomena can be modeled on complete aircraft configurations, generating models with millions of degrees of freedom. Reduced order models are used for systems and control analysis. The ability to do so on freely supported vehicles has been demonstrated including estimates of the rigid body dynamics. Improvements to this process are proposed to more closely match known frequency responses in the rigid body range, and to generate the reduced order models in a form that can be used for linear parameter varying control design methods. A set of modest order aircraft models will be collected and created using flexible structures and doublet lattice aerodynamics. These models will be used develop and demonstrated the improved model order reduction methodology, and then a plan will be developed to generalize this process for very high fidelity models. The improvements will increase the technical readiness of new model order reduction methods used to create aeroelastic models that include rigid body dynamics. The ability to create these models in the form used by linear parameter varying control methods will make it possible to develop flight control systems with provable robustness across the entire flight envelope.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The Reduced Order Aeroservoelastic Models with Rigid Body Modes technology supports the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Program and the Aeroelasticity Topic. More specifically the proposed work addresses development of efficient methods to generate mathematical models of flight vehicles for performing vibration, aeroelastic, and aeroservoelastic research. This includes design methodologies that encompass CFD steady and unsteady aerodynamics, flexible structures, and active control systems

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This capability will be of use to DOD aeronautical research and flight test centers and in the commercial and military aircraft industries where it will meet a market demand for increased safety, reduced risk, improved performance, and reduced cost. The greatest market potential will be to support the development of new aircraft and enhancements to existing designs (e.g., new store configurations, flight control system upgrades, etc.) including support for flight testing.

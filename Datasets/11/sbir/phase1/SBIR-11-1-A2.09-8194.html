		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed program will focus on the development of a new generation of advanced technology for rotorcraft transmission systems.  This program will evaluate the viability of integrating gears with composite shafts. The aim of this work is to reduce overall weight and improve vibration characteristics.  Two concepts have been identified and will be further researched.  The first design includes co-molding a bearing race to a carbon fiber reinforced composite shaft.  The second design integrates the composite shaft and metallic gear in a way that allows shaft misalignment in the power transmission system.  These attachments will simplify gear attachment and have the potential to reduce weight by integrating parts without the need for secondary fasteners.  This development work will allow for widespread application in both military and civil rotorcraft systems.

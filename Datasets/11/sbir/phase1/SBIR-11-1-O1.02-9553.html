		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Ridgetop Group will develop a 3X improvement in sampling resolution over current state-of-the art analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technology to support reconfigurable/reprogrammable communication systems. The significance of this innovation lies in the time-interleaved pipeline ADC, based on the most advanced silicon-germanium (SiGe) BiCMOS technology available, with over 2 bits higher effective number of bits (ENOB = 11.0 bits) than the best commercially available radiation-tolerant 2 GS/s ADCs (ENOB = 8.9 bits). In addition, the ADC consumes 65% less power than commercial ADCs, conserving valuable spacecraft power.<BR>For maximum flexibility and minimal power consumption, the ADC provides two configurable pipeline channels and four programmable operation modes. The ADC will also provide 3 GHz input analog bandwidth for direct sampling of RF signals in the S-band.<BR>The ADC will tolerate 5 Mrads of total ionizing dose (TID) radiation due to the inherent radiation tolerance of the SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBT), 130 nm thin-oxide CMOS transistors, and standard radiation-hardening-by-design (RHBD) techniques. The ADC will be also sufficiently hardened against single-event effects (SEE). <BR>Ridgetop will fabricate and test the ADC in the IBM 130 nm BiCMOS SiGe process in Phase 2 of this SBIR program.

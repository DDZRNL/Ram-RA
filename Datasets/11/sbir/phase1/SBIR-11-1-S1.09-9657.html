		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		HJ Science & Technology, Inc. proposes to develop a novel high pressure "pump-on-a-chip" and "valve-on-a-chip" microfluidic technology for NASA planetary science applications including on-chip sample manipulation and analysis.  In particular, we will design, build and demonstrate a miniature high pressure micropump to precisely control fluid flow in microfluidic devices with no moving parts.  These micropumps are capable of achieving high pressures with low actuating voltages.  Such high performance, small mass and volume, and low power consumption micropumps and microvalves are amenable for implementation at wafer level, ideally suited for chip-based HPLC and other "lab-on-a-chip" sample manipulation applications.  For the Phase I effort, we will design, construct, and testing these micropumps.  The Phase I research will address issues related to performance as well as production methods that can be used for the technology, as well as designing and determining the integrated micro-device and the Phase II prototype.  In the Phase II effort, we will construct and test the final prototypes capable of integrating to HPLC chips and other microfluidic devices.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed high pressure "pump-on-a-chip" microfluidic technology can be readily adapted to NASA's miniature scientific instrumentations for in-situ exploration of bodies in the solar system.  In particular, it is directly applicable to the current microfluidic instrumentation being developed to analyze organic molecules on Mars surface to find signature of life as well as to analyze Titan surface to study prebiotic chemistry on Titan.  It is also potentially applicable to "lab-on-a-chip" implementation of the wet chemistry lab on the Phoenix Mars Lander, which seeks to determine the pH and the abundance of minerals and relevant anions and cations.  The proposed technology has other broad NASA applications including on-chip biosensors and electrochemical sensors.  In addition, the proposed "pump-on-a-chip" technology can also be applied to such applications as clinical diagnostics, spacecraft and biosphere environmental monitoring, and toxicology studies.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The high pressure "pump-on-a-chip" microfluidics technology described in this proposal possesses significant commercial potential for a wide range of technologies and applications in markets ranging from specialty medical and aerospace industries to consumer electronics. Commercial devices based on such microfluidics technology envisioned include components for DNA, protein and drug separation and analysis, chemical analysis systems, drug delivery systems, and embedded health monitoring systems.

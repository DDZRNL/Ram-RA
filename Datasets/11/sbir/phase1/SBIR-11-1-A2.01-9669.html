		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		In this NASA Phase I SBIR program, MATECH proposes to leverage successfully developed laboratory and pilot scale manufacturing technologies to produce low cost Silicon Oxycarbide (SiOC) fibrous-walled high temperature honeycomb structures, hat stiffeners, and rigid fibrous insulators.  A highly scale-able melt blowing fiber manufacturing system was previously developed to produce non-woven mat from preceramic polymer and then formed into a pleated shape using a pleating apparatus.  MATECH has shown that the SiOC fibrous ceramic used to make the core retains its mechanical and thermal stability to temperatures up to 1400&#730;C.  These robust structural airframe materials can be densified with SiOC and ZrOC (for ultra-high temperature) matrix materials to produce a suite of advanced heat shield components.  This suite innovative airframe material systems and fabrication methodology offers robust innovative multifunctional structural high temperature thermal protection systems for demanding high-mass planetary entry, descent, and landing (EDL) applications.  The active support and participation of Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne and Boeing bodes well for a successful Phase I effort and follow-on Phase II program. More significantly, the close collaboration with these major industrial stakeholders enhances the likelihood of a successful Phase III transition into commercialization.

		The Phase I proposal shall demonstrate low cost Silicon Oxycarbide (SiOC) fibrous-walled high temperature honeycomb structures, hat stiffeners, and rigid fibrous insulators.  These robust structural airframe materials can be densified with SiOC and ZrOC (for ultra-high temperature) matrix materials to produce a suite of advanced heat shield components.  These airframe material systems and associated fabrication methodology offers robust multifunctional structural high temperature thermal protection systems (TPS) for next generation RALV and demanding high-mass planetary atmospheric entry, descent, and landing (PAES-EDL) applications. This MATECH SBIR proposal offers a platform of unique formable ceramic materials using Net Shape processing for low cost, readily scale-able manufacturing. Potential applications for this innovative technology include hypersonic leading edges, hypersonic airframes, and heat shields for NASA vehicles. These vehicles include hypersonic re-entry from orbit, hypersonic cruise and high speed accelerators.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Potential Non-NASA applications include hot component parts on missiles, such as MDA's THAAD and SM-3. In addition, MATECH has identified heat shields for the private sector led efforts towards the return of manned space activities in LEO as potentially benefiting from this proposed technology. This could be potentially applied to the on-going efforts of SpaceX, Virgin Inter-Galactic, and Orbital Sciences.

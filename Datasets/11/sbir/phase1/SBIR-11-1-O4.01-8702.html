		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		We propose a method for developing a miniature all-optical Inertial Navigation System. In an optical INS, the rotation sensitivity depends on the area enclosed by a circular optical path, so it is impossible to significantly reduce the size of a standard fiber optic gyroscope or ring laser gyroscope without sacrificing sensitivity. However, using the phenomenon of fast last, which we will produce through Stimulated Brillouin Scattering in a fiber, the sensitivity of a ring laser gyro of a given size can be enhanced by up to 106.  We will use a fiber-based, fast-light enhanced ring laser gyroscope to maintain the sensitivity of existing optical gyroscopes while greatly reducing the physical size of the sensing element. Combined with photonic integrated circuit technologies and standard optical accelerometers, the entire INS package can be greatly reduced in size, weight, and power, resulting in a rugged, compact, high sensitivity INS ideal for launch vehicles and spacecraft.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		?	The system can be used in the tracking and control of launch vehicles for placing payloads into orbital or sub-orbital trajectories.  The reduced SWaP will be very valuable for reducing costs or improving performance.<BR>?	A small, low power inertial measurement device could prove useful on manned or unmanned spacecraft by providing precision inertial feedback during orbital maneuvers or stationkeeping operations.<BR>?	A device, possibly with fewer than 6 axes of sensitivity, could be used to actively stabilize instrument platforms during sensitive astronomical observations or scientific measurements.  This stabilization could be applied to ground-based, space-based, airborne or naval platforms to reduce effects of mechanical vibration, environmental forces, or the earth's rotation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		?	The device will be suited for self-guided ordinance and unmanned aerial vehicles, where traditional high sensitivity optical INS systems are too large to use.  These vehicles require high bandwidth inertial measurements for navigation in areas where GPS is unreliable or jammed by an adversary.<BR>?	INS systems are also frequently used for stabilizing weapons platforms or communications devices mounted on ground and naval vehicles of all sizes.  A reduction in the size of the INS unit can simplify existing designs or even enable new applications which are unfeasible with existing technologies.<BR>?	Commercial aircraft and marine vessels commonly use optical inertial measurement devices for navigation, stabilization, and tracking.  A compact, rugged INS device may prove cost-effective for some situations.<BR>?	There is additionally a possibility of a consumer market for a downgraded version of the sensor using fewer specialized components and reduced stabilization.  The resulting product would provide reduced sensitivity, but could offer a lower price while maintaining small size and low power consumption.  This could be attractive for consumer products which have never before included inertial sensor elements, such as improved GPS navigation for personal vehicles and pleasure craft, automated consumer vehicles, or active shock protection of sensitive devices.

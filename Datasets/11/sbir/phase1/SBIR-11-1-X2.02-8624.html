		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Systima is developing a high performance 25 lbf DACS thruster that operates with a novel non-toxic monopropellant. The monopropellant has a 30% higher density-specific impulse compared to hydrazine and is commercially available off-the-shelf. In Phase I Systima will focus on development of the propellant feed and injection system, and In Phase II these systems will be integrated into a complete thruster design.  The Phase II work plan includes a system demonstrate with propellant in a workhorse thruster.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		There is no limitation to the vehicle control applications to which this technology can be applied; it is suitable to satellite ACS (large or small, commercial or military, intended for low earth orbit or for geosynchronous orbit, etc.), missile system ACS or in-space propulsion systems. The reduced toxicity and handling infrastructure could be especially of interest to re-usable space vehicles, rapid access to space applications and shipboard missile systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		These applications are especially hampered by current toxic monopropellants and would be enabled by readily adaptable green monopropellant technology. Long range missile defense systems for early intercept would also benefit greatly by gaining the benefit from the wide divert capability of a liquid system without the compromising issues of having toxic monopropellants aboard ship or in confined military installations. It is also possible that this technology could be applied to torpedo propulsion systems and emergency power generation systems to provide greater safety and improved handling costs. These systems are also limited by the use of toxic monopropellants.

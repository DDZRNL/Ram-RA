		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Recently, resonant-tunneling-diode (RTD) based circuits employing monolithically-integrated RTD on high electron mobility (HEMT) structures have been developed in a number of III-V systems in order to improve operational speed. The main goal of this program is to develop wide temperature-operable radiation hard monolithically-integrated electronics based on wide bandgap III-nitride epitaxial structures.  In the Phase I program, we propose to develop same-wafer discrete devices (capacitors, HEMTs, and RTDs) by employing a novel multi-layer AlN/GaN heterostructure design, and to demonstrate the radiation hardness of these devices

		Development of monolithically-integrated RTD/HEMT devices in radiation-hard III-nitride materials is anticipated to yield unprecedented operational performance in digital and alanolg  integrated circuits necessary for NASA's long duration missions such as the Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) where high radiation levels and extreme temperatures are expected.

		<BR>
		The proposed improvements in the operation of GaN-based integrated circuits will provides the key enabling technology for production of practical eelctronics for application in harsh environments.  These devices are sought for a number of military and civilian applications, including nuclear power, oil, gas and geothermal drilling, automotive and aerospace industries.

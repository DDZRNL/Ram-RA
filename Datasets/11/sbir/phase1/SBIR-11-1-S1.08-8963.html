		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		The AirCore is a  simple and novel atmospheric air column sampler to validate satellite observation data of greenhouse gases, using a lightweight, inexpensive coated stainless steel coil. The simple design of the leads to cost savings during manufacture and operation. The addition of a UAV to the AirCore system provides much needed functionality and flexibility to the end user of the product: it returns the AirCore to a user-defined location, so that the coil can be retrieved and analyzed rapidly.  The low cost of the sensor combined with the low cost of its deployment will yield cost savings of up to 2/3 over current aircraft-based atmospheric sampling methods. In Phase I, critial Aircore sampler development will be undertaken. Next, the Aircore will be integrated onto a UAV and flight tested. In Phase II, further refinement of the Aircore and UAV design, and the operational procedure will be undertaken.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed UAV and sampler can be used to conduct low-cost, routine atmospheric sampling missions to support emerging carbon credit trading enterprises.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		The proposed UAV and sampler can be used to conduct low-cost, routine atmospheric sampling missions to collect data for future carbon credit trading enterprises. Also, volcanic ash plumes can be monitored to support airline safety. Similarly, plumes of other industrial gases can be monitored using this method, for public health and safety missions.

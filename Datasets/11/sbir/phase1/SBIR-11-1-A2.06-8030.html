		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT</B> (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words)
		<BR>
		Development of hypersonic flight vehicles for airbreathing access to space and for planetary entry poses several design challenges.  One of the primary obstacles is the large uncertainty in predictive capability of models of the aerothermal environment to which these vehicles are subjected. A high priority need for the ground test facilities is instruments which enable remote thermal imaging of entry vehicles with high temperature and spatial resolution, and lower uncertainty than the state-of-the art.<BR><BR>Bodkin Design & Engineering (BDE), with our partners Spectral Sciences, Inc (SSI) and Space Computer Corporation (SCC), has demonstrated a Precision Radiometric Surface Temperature (PRST) sensor to perform stand-off measurements of radiatively heated surfaces.  We propose to adapt this system to the needs of ground test facilities for testing of hypersonic re-entry vehicles.  The sensor will be capable of stand-off imaging of heated surfaces at ranges from 1 to 100+ meters, measuring surface temperatures from 300-4000K, and providing surface temperature maps with spatial resolution of at least 120x120 pixels.  Further, the system will operate as a fast snapshot imager, capable of recording surface temperature data at up to 120 frames per second.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		Commercial applications include any that require non-contact measurement of surface temperatures, and in particular, where the optical properties (emissivity) of the surface may not be known.  Examples may include monitoring surfaces under laser illumination, measuring metal parts during machining (lathe, mill), measuring the temperature of airfoil leading edges.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</B> (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)
		<BR>
		This sensor may be useful to researchers measuring laser damage to materials, and to those analyzing the physics of mechanically induced plastic flow and shear zone evolution.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The focus of this program is the development and validation of formulations, and development methodologies, for optimizing high-performance particulate-loaded bipropellant gels to maximize specific thrust, taking into account not only composition but the effect of particle size and properties on maximum achievable combustion performance. The approach quantifies the maximum attainable loading for given particle size, and the subsequent tradeoff with impacts on combustion efficiency due to incomplete solid phase burnout of larger particles, and conversely the degree of pre-oxidation of smaller particles. The method also allows the physical properties of the gel to be optimized. This improves the competitiveness of gelled bipropellants with equivalent liquids, while incorporating the safety and handling advantages of gels. ERGC Corporation has worked to address this solicitation objective in cooperation with subcontractor Northrop Grumman Space and Technology (NGST) Propulsion Systems, the leader in gel propellant technology.
<BR>
<BR>The Phase II program will continue experimental refinement and property testing of gel formulations (including freeze/thaw cycling to ensure properties are maintained under projected mission conditions), employ combustion modeling to determine those formulations expected to provide the best actual performance, and conduct engine tests to validate the performance of the most promising candidates.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		DoD applications which would benefit directly from this project (i.e., applications which could use aluminum-loaded gels because emissions signature is not an issue) include ATACMS or MLRS.  DoD applications that would benefit indirectly from this project (i.e., applications which could not use aluminum loaded gels because of their high emissions signature, but would benefit from the advancement of the state-of-the-art in gelled propellant development) include the Joint Common Missile program and the Army Miniature Multirole Precision Guided Missile program.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		If successful, this project will provide NASA with: 
<BR>1) Specific bipropellants with maximized combustion efficiency, the safety and controllability advantages of gels, and the ability to retain their properties after being subjected to freeze/thaw conditions.  Such bipropellants will be useful for most NASA propulsion applications including earth-orbit spacecraft, deep-space applications, Mars ascent vehicle applications, and lunar landing applications.
<BR>2) A methodology for determination of maximum performance enhancement expected with nanoparticulate loading; and
<BR>3) Tools and methodology that could be applied for different ingredients.

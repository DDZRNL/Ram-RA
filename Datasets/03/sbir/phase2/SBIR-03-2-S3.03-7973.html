		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) project is considering several approaches to discovering planets orbiting stars far from earth and assessing their suitability to support life. One approach is based on a coronagraph design operating in the visible wavelength regime, which requires both very high surface quality, large aperture, telescope optics and advanced optical systems to reject direct, scattered, and diffracted starlight that is on the order of 1x109 brighter than the light reflected from the planet. The project has the need for advanced optical modeling and design tools that include physical optical calculations to support propagation results at a contrast level of 1x10-11 at the image plane of the coronagraph. The CODE V software is the most advanced software available for a wide variety of optical system modeling tasks and would be ideally suited for the TPF project once the proposed capabilities are integrated. Optical Research Associates proposes to extend capabilities of a proprietary method for beam propagation to support the optical modeling needs of the TPF coronagraph project. The result will be an optical design and analysis tool, available to only current CODE V product licensees, that provides another means for predicting the performance of this astronomical asset.

		The need for extremely high precision optical propagation through a non-ideal lens system (i.e. containing aberrations) has been identified for the TPF project, but similar needs have not been identified for any other market. The optical design and analysis needs for fidelity in the area of physical propagation are unique to the TPF project and, therefore, funding through NASA SBIR Phase II represents the only viable financial mechanism for developing such a capability. Commercial opportunities do not exist to the proposer's knowledge.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The TPF project has a need to validate key concepts by demonstrating their feasibility both in hardware test beds and in software models of the system. Optical modeling tools that implement physical beam propagation capabilities in the presence of optical aberrations do not currently exist that are both accurate enough and flexible enough to support the design and tolerancing of the TPF coronagraph.  Some tools can approach the required accuracy for conceptual designs, but are not sufficiently flexible to allow the type of tradeoff studies with real designs that are necessary.

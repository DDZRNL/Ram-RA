		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		We propose to develop the NJM Sense-It system based on small sensor tags, which include a cardiopulmonary MEMS sensor for measuring heartbeat and breath rates continuously. In addition, the proposed sensor system can be operated in extended bandwidth mode to measure detail cardiopulmonary pattern upon control from the reader. The system operates using a central reader at 915 MHz with as many as 32 sensor tags. A single sensor worn as a Band Aid-like adhesive or strapped tag on the astronaut monitors cardiopulmonary activities. Additional sensors are worn depending on the detail of heart and lung sounds diagnosis data desired. This system has the advantage that tag sensors measuring many additional physiological functions can be added at later date. The extended bandwidth cardiopulmonary data can be displayed locally or telemetered to earth stations and reviewed by clinicians in any situation as desired.

		Our proposed NJM wireless and batteryless monitoring system of cardiopulmonary function is part of the remote patient monitoring (RPM) system. The MEMS tag sensor monitors the heart and lung sounds and communicates with the reader in real time. Data is telemetered to a remote medical diagnostic center where experienced specialists analyze the data respond to events, and report results for review by the cardiopulmonary physician. The physician can be programmed in to receive a summary report daily by Internet. Or in case of severe eschemic and arrhythmic conditions, an emergency medical clinician is immediately informed.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed NJM wireless and batteryless system for continuous cardiopulmonary monitoring is a noninvasive, unobtrusive medical device that will monitor astronaut health, safety and performance risks during flight shuttle missions. The reader has the capability to read multiple tags worn by astronauts. Since each tag has its own identification, the cardiopulmonary function of each astronaut can be separately identified, monitored and presented simultaneously. The reader is interfaced to a larger shuttle computer for data packetizing. The cardiopulmonary data can be telemetered to ground crews who analyze the health condition of the astronauts and respond to events in real-time.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		To meet the challenges of rapid prototyping, direct hardware fabrication, and on-the-spot repairs on the ground and on NASA space platforms, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposed a new Holographic Optical Element-Based Laser Diode Source (HOELDS) system for direct metal deposition (DMD). HOELDS uniquely combines multiple high-power laser diode bars with holographic optical elements, efficient thermal management and innovative focusing optics to achieve a 600 W, 100-micron focused spot for DMD materials processing.  The 7-kilogram, 0.1 cubic meter HOELDS system will be ten times as energy efficient as current 1000 kilogram, 20 cubic meter DMD systems, making in-space DMD processing possible for the first time. HOELDS can process aluminum, which is extremely difficult for state-of-the art DMD systems. In Phase I, POC developed a preliminary HOELDS system, theoretical analysis, computer simulation, and component specifications leading to a proof-of-concept prototype. Melting of lead-tin solder with this prototype was demonstrated at NASA Marshall Space Center. The Phase II effort will optimize the system design, optimize fabrication of the holographic optical elements, and scale up the system into a compact high-power HOELDS system prototype capable of DMD.  The prototype system will be performance tested for in-space DMD, and will be space qualified.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Potential non-NASA applications for HOELDS technology include U.S. Army rapid miniature part production and part repair on the battlefield, on-the-spot metal repair and rebuilding on U.S. Navy ships at sea.  All research labs, government or private,  have a use for rapid prototyping capability, and a portable, efficient, inexpensive system like HOELDS will be an attractive technology.  Likewise, any manufacturer that needs rapid prototyping for models, testing, or replacement parts would want this type of system.  Any aircraft company or shipping company could use the crack- and leak-repair capabilities of HOELDS.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		HOELDS NASA applications include rapid fabrication of parts on the ground as well as in space. The HOELDS system can be incorporated by NASA into existing rapid prototyping systems to reduce the size, weight, and power consumption of existing systems. Its portability makes HOELDS far more useful to NASA sites with several laboratories than a currently available DMD system. DMD technology could shorten time-to-market considerably and accomplish repairs by adding the same part material where needed without causing thermal stress or microcracking. By reducing the size and power consumption, HOELDS will make compact space-based DMD machines possible.

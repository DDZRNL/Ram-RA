		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Mobitrum Corporation has demonstrated the feasibility in the Phase I of " A Wireless Sensor Portal Technology" and proposes a Phase II effort to develop a wireless portal device with Ultra-wideband transceiver targeted for NASA's Earth Science applications, Rocket Propulsion testing, and Center Management and Control for field personnel to send/receive digital and analog data from various sensors for data input, analysis and distribution purposes.  This effort addresses an important NASA technology gap for integrating a system together to link distributed sensors, data acquisition devices, and center control and management.  This effort will include: 1) Wireless sensor portal hardware fabrication; 2) Ultra-wideband sensor module and mini-PCI circuitry design; 3) Ultra-wideband sensor module and mini-PCI hardware fabrication; 4) Hardware integration and testing; 5) Software development and testing; and 6) System integration and testing. The proposed enabling technology will provide NASA a wide range of capability including distributed sensing, monitoring, tracking, and data acquisition. The wireless portal technology will provide an effective tool for Earth Science, Rocket Propulsion Testing, and Data relay for environmental and other sensors for situational awareness.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Commercial applications of the proposed technology will address needs for Wireless USB based on Ultra-wideband technology and application for Radio frequency identification (RFID).  The Ultra-wideband wireless systems allow for non-contact reading and are effective in manufacturing and other hostile environments where bar code labels could not survive. RFID has established itself in a wide range of markets including smart badge, livestock identification and automated vehicle identification systems because of its ability to track moving objects.  There is a significant commercial potential in homeland security, disaster management, and coastal ecology management.  Potential billions market in next 2 years.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		NASA applications of the proposed technology will address needs for data sensing, monitoring, and acquisitions in the following areas: First response emergency; Data relay for environmental and other sensors for situational awareness; Synchronizing of data sources such as air-borne and space- borne systems to ground teams at remote locations; Homeland security applications; Air quality; Aviation; Carbon management; Coastal management; Disaster management; Ecological forecasting; Energy management; Invasive species; Water management; Intelligent Rocket Test Facilities (IRTF) with smart sensor elements, measurement, and field verification applications; Sensing and monitoring for aircraft and emissions.

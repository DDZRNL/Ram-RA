		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Airport configuration is a primary factor in various airport characteristics such as arrival and departure capacities and terminal area traffic patterns.  These characteristics, in turn, are central to a variety of Air Traffic Management (ATM) decisions that in turn affect delays and efficiency in the National Airspace System (NAS).  There is presently poor knowledge about the airport characteristics at each airport and even less information available about how those characteristics are expected to change in the future.  This lack of knowledge about airports results in inefficient local and national traffic management decisions.  Metron Aviation will develop and test a set of models that generate information about airport configuration and related airport characteristics.  This information, which is not currently available or is of poor quality, will improve traffic management decisions, and automation to support those decisions, both at the airports and on a national scale. This work addresses existing gaps in air traffic management automation technologies.  The proposed technology development promise immediate improvements to the NAS.  Rather than requiring a new tool or system to be deployed, the information generated by this work could be absorbed into existing systems and information networks to transparently improve traffic management on a local and national scale.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Non-NASA applications can be grouped into Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) applications and non-Government applications.  Automation that is capable of recognizing current airport characteristics and predicting what those characteristics will be in the future would likely be deployed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at a large number (e.g., 30-50) of airports.  A variety of TFM decision support systems make assumptions about the airport characteristics studied in this SBIR.  Availability of accurate current information and predictions could transparently improve those systems.  NAS users, especially air carriers, are interested in much of the information the proposed work would generate.  However, we believe that NAS users will be indirect customers ? lobbying the FAA to provide such a capability but not purchasing or maintaining the system themselves.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Metron Aviation will develop a set of models that generate information about airport configuration and related airport characteristics that will improve traffic management decisions.  NASA is responsible for continuing to advance air traffic management automation and, therefore, this work is directly relevant to NASA's technology need.  The proposed technology promises immediate improvements to the NAS.  Rather than requiring a new tool to be deployed, the results of this work can be used by existing systems to transparently improve traffic management on a local and national scale.  Existing SMS prediction algorithms that use airport configuration information will be refined or replaced as part of Phase 2 while NASA can use the technology as part of advanced surface automation research.  The configuration recognition capability developed in Phase 2 can be used to provide necessary truth data for post-analysis of SMS performance.  Finally, NASA can apply the knowledge gained in modeling airport characteristics to future research efforts.

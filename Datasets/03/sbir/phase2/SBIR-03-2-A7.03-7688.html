		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The Small Business Innovative Research Phase I proposal seeks to develop a compact, robust in situ spectrometer capable of detecting multiple gas-phase species in planetary atmospheres with ultra-high sensitivity and selectivity.  This instrument will employ a novel room-temperature, widely tunable mid-infrared laser source in conjunction with cavity ringdown spectroscopy.  During Phase I, both the novel laser and the cavity ringdown technology were demonstrated in the 3.3 micron spectral region.  During Phase II, a flight-ready instrument will be constructed, enabling access to a variety of species, including methane, ethane, ammonia, and formaldehyde.  The ultra-high sensitivity of the proposed system will enable these species to be detected at concentrations below 7*10^7/cm^3 per minute, which corresponds to a detection limit of <30 pptv in Earth's atmosphere.  The unique laser source to be constructed in Phase II will also be capable of being integrated into other spectroscopic platforms, in many cases providing a direct replacement for cumbersome cryogenic diode lasers while at the same time significantly improving the spatial mode quality and increasing spectral coverage.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The worldwide market for sensors with the capabilities of the proposed system is significant.  Numerous applications exist in trace gas monitoring, pollution monitoring, industrial process control, and medical diagnostics.  The novel laser system alone possesses significant commercial potential as a replacement for literally hundreds of cryogenic sources that are presently in use.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		NASA applications for the laser and sensor technology described in this proposal include the interrogation of terrestrial as well as potentially extraterrestrial atmospheres for trace species..  The ability to measure formaldehyde and ammonia, specifically, would be of great benefit to current atmospheric research efforts as well as air quality monitoring aboard the International Space Station.  The sensor will have numerous applications in ongoing research missions, including chemical kinetics and transport phenomena studies.

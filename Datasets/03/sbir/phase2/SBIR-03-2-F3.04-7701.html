		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The original goal of Phase I was to study the feasibility of developing an electric sensor that can be used for as many NASA sensing applications as possible. During Phase I, in discussion with the COTR, the development of a ground-based miniature sensor for detecting and measuring the electrostatic potential and charge distribution generated on payloads, spacecrafts and landers was identified as a need of immediate importance to NASA operations at the KSC spacecraft assembly facility and throughout NASA.
<BR>
<BR>The innovation proposed in Phase II is the world's first wearable static electric voltage detection system. This system will be able to detect a static potential at sufficient range to prevent the system's wearer triggering a discharge. Versions of the system will be demonstrated for mounting on a hardhat or helmet of a protective suit, and on the forearm over a sleeve. In addition, the same core technology will be tested in the stationary mode, attached to a doorway to screen personnel entering a restricted area, and on a surface of sensitivity equipment to detect the increase of ambient electric field that might trigger an electrostatic discharge.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		As an electrostatic hazard detector, the sensor has potential applications in many industries including , electronics manufacturing (e.g. semiconductors), oil refining, gasoline vending, printing and paper coating, the aircraft manufacturing industry and many other industries in which machinery that can build up a static charge is in proximity to flammable materials. A related application of the sensor is for use as a commercial lightning hazard and/or strike detector.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Although the sensor is being developed with Kennedy Space Center, it has potential applications throughout NASA. As an electrostatic hazard detector mounted on a worker's suit and/or in a facility, its use would benefit any NASA facility where sensitive electronics are assembled or stored. For space missions, it could monitor charge that builds up on an astronaut walking on the surface of the moon or another planet, on a Rover or Lander, or on the spacecraft itself.

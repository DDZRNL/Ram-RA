		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		We propose to design, build, and test a major new instrument capable of both measuring and polishing the surface of aspheric mirrors up to 1.2 meters in diameter, and up to f-0.5 in speed, either concave or convex.  In the successful Phase I proposal, we laid out the instrument to the component level, and laid out and analyzed every critical subsystem.  We also investigated and experimented with the fluid jet polishing to be used by this instrument, setting the stage for further experiments and ultimate usage in Phase II.  The metrology accuracy goals, supported by previous measurements, are 1 nanometer rms for full aperture figure, and 0.1 nm rms for mid-frequency and micro-roughness.  The full-aperture and mid-frequency metrology approaches are based on previous successful SBIR projects, while the micro-roughness metrology is an improvement on standard Total Integrated Scatter measurements developed under Phase I.  All of the metrology instrumentation is integrated into a single measurement head.  At the end of the project, we will polish and measure an f-1.1, 560 mm parabola, and possibly an 890 mm, f-2.5 sphere.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		A major application would be the continued pursuit by the semiconductor industry of better and better aspheric mirrors as the operating wavelengths shrink.  Required surface qualities are headed below the 0.1 nm rms range as Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV) lithography comes to life.  The metrology and fabrication approaches for such mirrors are extremely limited, and technology such as ours could be an important adjunct to other specialized techniques.  In addition, naturally, to the extent that most of the NASA applications are in the end fabricated by commercial firms, we would enjoy a broad range of large-mirror applications within industry.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		NASA programs include the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) mission, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Jupiter Magnetospheric Explorer (JMEX), the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) system within the Solar Dynamics Observatory, and the Reconnection and Microscale (RAM) probe.  All have 0.5 meter ? 1 meter-class mirrors, some large and convex.  Another example is the Spherical Primary Optical Telescope (SPOT) project, an IRAD effort underway at NASA GSFC.  (We plan to use a SPOT mirror as a secondary test piece.)  Other examples would include myriad silicon carbide systems.  Although silicon carbide presents its own difficulties, our technology should not be fundamentally affected.

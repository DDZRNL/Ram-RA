		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		NRC's Committee on Government Data Centers made a set of technology recommendations for data centers meet user needs and develop the long-term record of environmental change. ArC is a low cost scalable Archive Storage Management System that will help NASA respond to the NRC recommendations.  The ArC architecture is innovative in the replacement of current tape-based archival systems with a highly distributed disk-based system that provides unprecedented ease of use implemented over commodity Linux clusters using scalable indexing and load balancing algorithms. 
<BR>
<BR>The Phase II Technical Objectives are to develop a full-scope prototype system, evaluate its performance using the EOS Science Investigator-led Processing System (SIPS) on OMIDAPS, and incorporate performance improvements. The prototype will provide a 36TB archival system that will enable archive administrators automate the day-to-day operations of the archive, ensure the preservation of authenticity, provide audit constructs, and achieve  the lowest possible cost of operation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		ArC will increase the real-time performance of active archives and enable NASA to bring more of the permanent archives into active archives. Applications include Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAAC's), Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Core System (ECS) Synergy Program, SEEDS (Strategic Evolution of ESE Data Systems), NSSDC.

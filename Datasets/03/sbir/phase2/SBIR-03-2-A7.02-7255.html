<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A system for autonomous detection and exploitation of weather phenomena for endurance or range enhancement for loitering unmanned air vehicles is presented. The proposed system consists of hardware and software for coarse identification of geographical areas where advantageous weather phenomena (such as soaring conditions) are present. A custom autopilot and sensors enable the fine detection of the phenomena, and cause the UAV to adopt an optimal flight path that exploits the phenomena. The proposed system consists of custom hardware, software, and sensors. We have demonstrated a simulation of the system in Phase I, and we will render this in hardware in Phase II. We will also complete full flight test of the system on our 40 lb class UAV in Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Phase II SBIR will result in high endurance schemes for loitering UAVs, innovative flight control systems for UAVs, optimal flight path determination and execution. These developments dovetail with current NASA efforts to develop more intelligent and autonomous air vehicles for use in science mission, military and homeland security missions. The concepts and systems can be ported to small manned aircraft as well. <br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed system can be used to increase the endurance or range, and/or reduce the fuel consumption of loitering air vehicles operating at low-to-medium altitudes. The methods described here can be adopted for extending the endurance of small aircraft in emergency situations as well. The proposed autopilot can be used by sport glider and motorglider pilots. Unmanned air vehicles are increasingly being used for military, homeland security and science missions. In particular, we will investigate the use of this technology for small (<40 lb) and medium-sized (~ 600 lb) UAVs which we are developing for homeland security and science mission applications.

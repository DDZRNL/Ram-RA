		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The objective of this Phase II project is to develop and demonstrate a compact and reliable oscillator technology for the frequency band from 100 ? 250 GHz for use in terahertz local oscillators and transmitters. The new oscillators rely on MMIC technology that is reliable and robust, offers the best overall performance and will be suitable for volume production and commercialization. These oscillators meet immediate needs for NASA's Earth Science program, specifically for terahertz radiometers for studies of the atmosphere and climate change. The oscillators are also useful for a wide range of other scientific, military and emerging commercial applications. The Phase I study demonstrated the feasibility of the new oscillators through the development and demonstration of an oscillator at 146 GHz suitable as a driver for an 874 GHz cloud ice radiometer being developed at NASA/GSFC. This new component greatly exceeds the performance of any other commercially available oscillator technology while maintaining a compact size, power efficiency and all solid-state construction. The Phase II research is focused on achieving greater power for higher frequency terahertz sources, improving power efficiency, achieving more compact integration of the subcomponents and extending the basic design concept throughout the 100 ? 250 GHz band.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The new oscillators will become primary components in commercial terahertz receivers and sources. Applications of this technology include chemical spectroscopy, radio astronomy, weather monitoring, plasma diagnostics, biomaterial analysis, electron spin resonance, and diagnostic instruments for particle accelerators. Possible military applications include compact range radars, covert communications systems, imaging systems, and chemical, explosive and bioagent scanners. Biomedical researchers envision the use of terahertz imaging and spectroscopy for the real time analysis of diseases such as skin cancer. Potential large-scale commercial applications include portal security imagers and scanners, medical diagnostics for clinical use, last-mile data links, and industrial process control.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This technology will enable the development of powerful and frequency agile terahertz sources to be used as local oscillators for terahertz heterodyne receivers. Such receivers allow NASA researchers to study the chemistry and dynamics of the Earth's atmosphere, molecular clouds and the atmospheres of other planets. The Phase I effort demonstrated a prototype oscillator for an airborne receiver to investigate the effect of clouds on the radiation balance in the atmosphere. The Phase II research will result in the demonstration of an optimized oscillator and the extension of this critical technology for receivers throughout the terahertz band.

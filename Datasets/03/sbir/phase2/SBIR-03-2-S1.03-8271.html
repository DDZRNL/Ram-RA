		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		In this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Program, Syscom Technology, Inc. will implement an integrated processing scheme to fabricate a conductive multifunctional high-strength, high-modulus Metal/Polymer Composite Fiber (MPCF) for power and signal transfer and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding applications in space and aerospace vehicles. The Phase I study has successfully demonstrated that High phosphorous Electroless Nickel (HPEN) can be readily deposited onto properly etched PBO fiber. The HPEN coated PBO fiber showed the superior mass retaining (31.5 to 38.5) characteristic comparing to that of the uncoated PBO fiber in atomic oxygen erosion test. Additionally, the tensile mechanical strength and the DC conductivity of the MPCF essentially unchanged after a fluence of 5.04x1020 (atoms/cm2) atomic oxygen. In Phase II program, the revised processing scheme enables a full control of the processing conditions, such as fiber tension, bath chemistry during each step of the fiber preparation leading to the optimization of the mechanical and electrical properties of the PBO fiber. It is anticipated that the metal coating will not only protect the underlining polymer from harsh space environment, but also affords the resulting MPCF with advantages over metal wires in weight savings, mechanical flexibility, durability and strength.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Although the Electrotextile or smart textile is still in its infancy, it has been clearly demonstrated that the future cloth or fabrics will not only protect the wearer from environment, but also will have intelligent built-in features, such as multifunctional sensors or computing devices. In contrast to rigid electronic component, the E-textile will be truly flexible, soft and comfortable to wear and touch. Future E-textiles applications are boundless and limited only by human's imagination. In order to bring these potential applications into marketable products, a strong, durable and conductive yarn, compatible with the textile fabrication process, is in serious demand.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Syscom Technology, Inc. (STI) will execute an integrated processing scheme to produce high-strength multifunctional Metal/Polymer Composite Fibers (MPCF) for power and signal transfer, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding application. It is expected that the conductive MPCF will have tremendous advantages over current high strength copper conductor in weight savings, flexibility, durability and mechanical strength. The STI will try to implement several products for NASA space applications, namely EMI shielding in wiring and cable, space tether, flexible and wearable heating fabric, and wearable electronics or sensor.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This NASA Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project will develop a compact, low-cost, wavelength locked seed laser for injection locking high powered Nd:YAG lasers used in a range of lidar remote sensing applications including molecular profiling of the atmosphere.   Precise wavelength control of the seed laser will be achieved by actively locking the laser wavelength to an absorption line in molecular iodine. The key innovation in this SBIR effort is the use of nonlinear optical waveguides both to frequency modulate and to frequency double a portion of the seed laser beam  to generate the appropriate optical signal for locking to the iodine absorption line.  Using an all-waveguide based approach will result in a compact, robust package that will withstand temperature, shock, and vibration levels associated with NASA's airborne and space based remote sensing platforms.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The seed laser system developed during this effort will also benefit non-NASA lidar based remote sensing platforms that require wavelength locked seed lasers. In addition to its use as a Nd:YAG seeder, the laser will have applications in sensing and environmental monitoring, and basic research.  Sensing applications include fiber optic sensors in use by the military (as well as the private sector) which require very stable low noise laser sources.  Low-power wavelength locked lasers are also finding use in precision metrology systems at both 1064 nm and 1319 nm.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The seed laser platform being developed in the SBIR Phase II project, because of its compact and rugged package, will enable stable operation on airborne and space based remote sensing platforms and will therefore directly benefit several of NASA's lidar based remote sensing projects, including the Molecular Lidar program being developed at NASA/LARC, and the Wind Lidar program being developed at NASA/GSFC

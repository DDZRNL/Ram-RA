		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		One of the ultimate goals of sensor research is to build an integrated unit that harnesses its energy from its surroundings and reacts to, and transmits, any changes in its environment in a predictable and reliable manner.  There are several components to this universal goal of a self-contained sensor unit: the power module, the sensor module, the control module, and the transmission module.  The goal of this proposal is to develop a whole class of truly stand-alone, large-area, distributed sensor systems on a flexible substrate ? a MEMS skin.  
<BR>The Phase II program will deliver a suite of novel processes to fabricate large-format, self-sufficient sensors on flexible, multilayer substrates.  The first layer, a copper-on-flex substrate, acts as the interconnect layer for power distribution.  The second, a Si-on-flex substrate, utilizes a thin-film a-Si solar cell, integrated with Anvik's technology to integrate MEMS and IC devices.  The two substrate layers are connected using photoablated micro-via patterns in the Si-on-flex layer.  These sensors could include strain gauges for surface stress measurements, IR imagers, environment pollution/quality monitoring, etc. Our results in Phase I have given us an excellent footing to launch our Phase II workplan and to layout a preliminary Phase III commercialization strategy.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The focus in this proposal has been on space-related applications and therefore on large-area distributed sensors.  Immediate extensions can be found in the commercial aircraft industry for these sensors.  Similar applications can be found in the automotive industry for safety testing and continuous monitoring of the auto-body or a ship hull.  With further development, these skins could be applied to clothing applications for military and commercial applications in the emerging e-textile market.  All these applications will benefit greatly by the large-area stand-alone capability of these sensors.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		There are innumerable applications in free-moving sensor systems, space-based MEMS, and distributed sensor networks for health monitoring of space-based systems.  The technology described is independent of the exact nature of the sensor that is integrated into the system.  Using an accelerometer, for example, will enable large-area distributed monitoring of vibrations over complex surfaces.  The use of a chemical sensor will allow applications in hazardous gas monitoring over large areas.  The integration of MEMS and the associated circuitry in a single unit is a giant step forward in improving the sensitivity and performance of these sensors.  The proposed integration of a-Si based solar cells and a communication interface takes this approach to the next level where the sensor becomes truly stand-alone.  The use of a flexible substrate enables applications to conformable and very-large area surfaces that were until now not possible.

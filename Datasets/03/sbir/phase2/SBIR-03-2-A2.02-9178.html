		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The recent development of magnesium diboride superconducting wires makes possible the potential to have much lighter weight superconducting coils for heavy aircraft motors than with any other potential metal or ceramic superconductor. The magnesium diboride superconductor can be cooled to 20 K by the liquid hydrogen fuel.   The lighter weight coils, especially in the rotor, will enable a lighter weight support structure so the motor weight will be reduced even more for the same horsepower motor.  For this NASA SBIR Phase II our objective is to design, construct, test, and assembly MgB2 rotor coil packs to replace the copper rotor coil packs for the cryogenic motor test bed being built for NASA

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Manufacturers of large electrical systems desire to increase the efficiency, and decrease the size of their systems in order to reduce costs. Presently manufacturers' of transformers, motors, generators, fault current limiters, transmission cables, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems are pursuing superconductor wires to achieve these objectives.  To make major cost improvements with superconducting systems, the barriers have been the higher cost of cooling at liquid helium temperature (4K) for traditional metallic superconductors and the high wire cost for ceramic high temperature superconductors at 20-30 K temperatures.  Low cost MgB2 superconductor wires operating at 20-25K can lower the upfront and ongoing operational costs of superconducting systems.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Besides motors for large aircraft, magnesium diboride superconductors can benefit NASA applications for many applications were light weight power components are required such as transformers, inductors, power conditioning.   Other magnet applications that magnesium diboride wires can be considered for are ADR coils, magnetic bearings, actuators, MHD magnets, and magnetic launch devices.

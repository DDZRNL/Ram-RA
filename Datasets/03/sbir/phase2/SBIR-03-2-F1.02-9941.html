<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovation is to combine traditional and cutting edge optimization techniques into an existing powerful object based organic enterprise decision network called FrameworkCT.  This combination would represent not only a leap in the field of optimization itself but also in the methods by which these models are produced for optimization process in the first place.  This will be the first time ever that (i) multidisciplinary model integration, (ii) distributed parallel processing, (iii) statistical simulation, and (iv) optimization algorithms will be put together to solve complex systems engineering optimization problems.<br><br>In our Phase I research we have not only demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed innovation but in our preliminary tests we uncovered important synergies between the existing neural network database foundation of FrameworkCT and neural network optimization as well as between the current massive parallel processing capability and genetic optimization algorithms.  Or overall effort is closely aligned with NASA's new initiative of going back to the moon, mars and beyond.  This alignment with a current enterprise decision system will help insure the ultimate usefulness of the proposed innovation to NASA as well as industry and result in a tangible benefit during and immediately following the conclusion of the project.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
The need for focused investments in the area of the enterprise decision process is imperative for the success of all other investments being made by NASA.  At present, large organizations like NASA's, expend a great deal of time and money making enterprise decisions.  In addition, the long term impact associated with poor decisions can adversely effect an organization for many years in to the future.  Millions of dollars could be saved by placing enterprise decision technologies like FrameworkCT at the forefront of NASA's investment priorities.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
The problems faced by NASA in the enterprise decision process are not unique, but shared by all medium to large system integrators throughout the government, industry and even the world.  The significant improvement of combining optimization within an existing enterprise class decision network is substantial.  Successful implementation of this combined system would save NASA and industry billions of dollars annually by reducing significantly the false starts, redundant effort, long lead times and globally non-optimal solutions characteristic of the early enterprise decision process of complex systems.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
JEM Engineering proved the technical feasibility of the FlexScan array?a very low-cost, highly-efficient, wideband phased array antenna?in Phase I, and stands ready to develop it into a fully-functional, flight-qualifiable prototype in Phase II.  JEM developed an S-Band (2.0-2.3 GHz) antenna array design appropriate for the stratospheric balloon application through requirements definition, modeling, and performance predictions. The critical technology for this array is an electrically-controlled Variable Delay Line (VDL), used to provide true time-delay for beamsteering.  VDLs were designed, built and tested, and shown to have excellent performance. The VDLs were tested over 2.4 million cycles without degradation, indicating good life, especially for the balloon application.  A 4-port linear beamformer was built, and used to validate the beamformer concept. The objective of the proposed 24-month Phase II effort is to develop, prototype, and demonstrate a flight-qualifiable FlexScan phased array that achieves the bandwidth, antenna gain, and scan range required for a balloon-borne TDRSS data link in S-band, while meeting environmental requirements. Upon completion of Phase II, the FlexScan array will be ready to commercialize for the balloon-borne application, with other NASA and non-NASA commercial applications soon to follow.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA robotic and manned vehicles all require communications, and data rates are rising, increasing the need for high-gain links. Many also benefit from radar?often not an option due to the limitations of current gimbaled dishes and phased arrays. To achieve its goal of solar system exploration, NASA needs an alternative to these antennas. The FlexScan array will provide this alternative in a low-cost, low-power, low-complexity, lightweight, high-gain, steerable-beam antenna. The Phase II effort is focused on stratospheric balloon TDRSS communications, but this technology can readily be extended to meet the need of many of NASA's vehicle and explorer programs. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
FlexScan antennas are useful for virtually any application where a single high-gain beam is needed and the required scanning rate is not too rapid. The low cost of these antennas, their simplicity, and their excellent electromagnetic performance makes these antennas very attractive. The U.S. Army has a great interest in Satellite Communications On-the-Move (SOTM), which requires a light, agile, low-cost and robust steerable-beam antenna. Unattended sensors, radar for missiles, and particularly radar for automobiles are all areas where a cheaper alternative to current antennas with high performance is needed. The FlexScan array is a nearly-ideal alternative for these applications.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Automated detection of land cover changes between multitemporal images (i.e., images captured at different times) has long been a goal of the remote sensing discipline.  Most technology in this area has focused on methods for detecting and identifying land cover or surface object changes in two or more images, but precise co-registration of images remains a key challenge. In fact, image-to-image registration and image-based change detection are intricately related, as the success of conducting both relies on the precision of the other; software that supports these functions should do so in an integrative manner. Image registration is the key factor influencing the success of detecting land cover changes at or near pixel scale.  We will develop tools in the form of a "software development kit" (SDK) specifically optimized for precise co-registration of two or more images with minimal user interaction, with the primary motivation to enable change detection algorithms to focus on salient changes rather than highlight image registration errors.  The SDK will be available to NASA at no cost, after which we will build user applications based on the SDK for commercial offering.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Three commercial partners are currently included:  Stewart Geo Technologies, which utilizes imagery in its real estate and title businesses (a vertical market application); Digital Globe, a leading source for satellite imagery that has a need to generate "second generation orthophotos" by co-registering new images to prior images; and Research Systems Inc., developer of the ENVI software, with an interest in adding automated image co-registration tools into ENVI, utilized worldwide to support many of NASA's "National Applications".  Positive Systems also has an internal need for better tools to support its service business offerings.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Dr. Jim Anderson has expressed a need for an image co-registration plug-in for ENVI to support research at SSC.  In addition, we will work with the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LPDAAC) to support NASA affiliated researchers on programs such as REASoN, Carbon Cycling, Water and Energy Cycling, and Land Cover/Land Use Change.  Many of these NASA projects require co-registration of multitemporal land satellite data sets from ASTER, MODIS, MISR, and Landsat ETM+ obtained through the LPDAAC.  Finally, we will work with NASA JSC to provide tools for georeferencing their vast archive of astronaut photography.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Switching fabric (SF) is the key component of the next generation of back plane interconnects. Low power, TID and SEU resistant and high bandwidth upgradeable communication between computer nodes are of utmost importance for future NASA missions. The current state off-the-art binary SF interconnect architectures have high power consumption and latency due to the necessity to perform internal data conversion and synchronization in order to recognize redundant bits and extract useful information from the data stream. The high power consumption of the SFs limit their application in the next generation of nano-satellites. In order to minimize latency and reduce power consumption, we propose a novel, robust, radiation tolerant and easy-to-align SF based on a multi-level power efficient Low Voltage Differential Signal interface. Our approach uses differential multilevel signals to mark a reference high-level bit position in one of the differential channels. Because the marked pilots will follow the high logic level in one of the differential outputs, they will regularly occur at the same bit position and ensure stable and easy recovery of the low-speed clock signal, which will be used as a reference for multi-channel data alignment and will synchronize high speed clocking circuitry using a standard clock multiplier technique.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Introduction of new system applications demanding the reconfigurable high throughput   provided by the novel multi-level SF interconnects will guarantee significant advantages with increasing interconnection network speed demands by large scale computer systems, and supercomputers.  This will help the system designers to increase processing power of future large computer systems performing for example 3 D simulations, MRI image analysis and HDTV video multi-cluster video processing, for homeland security, DOD and other industrial applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The success of this program will result in the development and fabrication of a power efficient, robust, low latency SF for the next generation of NASA space missions.  The potential range of other applications will include a new generation of computer systems for spectral image data processing, shared bus computer architectures, and a variety of on-board data acquisition systems.  Our protocol transparent and expandable interconnect will be adaptable to various types of communication networks.

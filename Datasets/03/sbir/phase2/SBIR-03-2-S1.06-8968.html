		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		High-efficiency UV detectors will be developed in the Phase II program with ZnO and its alloy (ZnBeO). ZnO and ZnBeO are a very suitable material for fabrication of high-speed, high-detectivity, and radiation-hard UV detectors due to their unique structural, electrical and optical properties.  The proposing company (MOXtronics) has shown the feasibility of fabricating new ZnO p-i-n UV detectors in the Phase I. Such UV photodiodes will be improved for high-efficiency UV detection by using heterojunction p-i-n structures and/or Schottky contacts.  In the Phase II efforts, commercial-typed heteojunction ZnO/ZnBeO-based PIN and MSM photodiodes will be fabricated and demonstrated.  These photodiodes will be used for broad near-to-far UV detection.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		High-performance ZnO/ZnBeO-based UV detectors could be used in non-NASA commercial applications.  These applications include flame and heat sensors, medical applications (sterilization), detecting hazard biochemical agents, UV calibration devices (tanning monitors), plasma diagnostics, and engine (missile) monitoring.  These ZnO/ZnBeO-based UV detectors will be introduced quickly into the commercial market based on their potentials for many applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		ZnO/ZnBeO-based p-i-n and MSM UV detectors will satisfy the NASA requirements for device compactness, light weight, low power consumption, and radiation hardness. These detectors could be used for a variety of NASA applications, including, for example, exploration of UV to EUV radiations from the outer space or the sun, and for opto-electronic communications (ship-to-ship, or ship-to-ground).

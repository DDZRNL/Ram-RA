		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Many space missions require relative navigation between several spacecraft systems or between spacecraft and rovers or remote controlled probes, such as spacecraft inspection, docking, rover control, formation flight, automatic landing of UAVs, and automatic material handling. Ranging and communication are key functions for these types of applications. The ranging update rate and data rate directly affect the performance of relative navigation. UWB radios are very suitable to the above needs because it can be made to be very low power, low-cost, compact, and lightweight. Furthermore, UWB transceivers for relative navigation will have wide field-of-view compared to optical or image based sensors. Another benefit of UWB is that can co-exist with other radio equipment used by the spacecraft without causing co-site interferences or being interfered by other radio transmission. UWB radios have been demonstrated to be able to perform high-speed communication and good ranging rate separately, but the data rate or the ranging update rate will be greatly compromised if one wants to perform UWB communication and tracking simultaneously. The goals of this Phase II project are to develop a superior UWB transceiver that can provide higher update rate and can provide the maximum ranging update and data rate simultaneously.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		We have identified many non-NASA markets for the technology developed in this SBIR effort, including Autonomous navigation of Unmanned Air Vehicles, Warfighter/Firefighter Situation Awareness System, and Autonomous Materials Handling. For each of these areas, there are significant government and civilian customers. The same hardware can also be used for asset tracking in warehouses, hospitals, manufacturing plants, and offices.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The technology developed in this SBIR effort can benefit many NASA applications, including autonomous Satellite Docking, Formation Flight of Spacecraft, Formation flight of UAVs, interspacecraft communication, communication between rovers and spacecraft, and astronaut EVA communication networks.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Building on the success of our Phase I efforts, Mikro Systems, Inc. (MSI) proposes to advance the state-of-the-art in high resolution, high-aspect-ratio X-ray/gamma-ray collimator fabrication by reducing slit pitch by a factor of ~2, from 35 microns to 20 microns, using an innovative hybrid micro-machining technology.  
<BR>
<BR>Fine grids having high-aspect-ratio (>50:1) and made from dense materials are the enabling components for solar and astrophysical imaging missions requiring high angular and/or spectral resolution at X-ray/gamma-ray energies.  Instruments for these missions are severely constrained by size and mass considerations, and any technology that allows a reduction of size and/or mass without reducing image quality would contribute significantly to NASA's ongoing instrumentation development.
<BR>
<BR>Angular resolution is a function of the grid-pitch and distance between grids in a bi-grid collimator. Consequently, this advance in technology will have a significant effect on the angular resolution and/or instrument length and mass of grid-based optics required for x-ray and gamma-ray imaging in space. In Phase I, MSI demonstrated the technical feasibility of producing collimator grids with pitch as fine as 16 microns.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		MSI is applying this advanced collimator technology to a number of commercial and research products, including collimators, detector arrays, and scatter reduction grids for medical imaging applications including mammography, computed tomography, and nuclear medicine.  In addition, our technology is being applied to non-medical radiography applications for homeland security.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		MSI collimator technology is directly relevant to the following NASA X-ray and gamma-ray space imaging programs: 
<BR>
<BR>1.The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-ray (STIX) instrument under consideration for the ESA Solar Orbiter mission (Robert Lin, PI); 
<BR>2.Collimators for the Particle Accelerator Solar Orbiter (PASO) mission, included in NASA's Office of Space Sciences Sun Earth Connections Roadmap; 
<BR>3.Constellation X-ray mission (Nicholas White, Project Scientist) planned to start in 2007; 
<BR>4.Future high-resolution / high-sensitivity instruments for solar x-ray, and for both medium- and high-energy gamma-ray imaging;
<BR>5.Future MIDEX proposal for solar flare x-ray and gamma-ray imaging spectroscopy.
<BR>
<BR>In addition to collimators, MSI's micro-fabrication technology is applicable to at least two other areas of direct interest to NASA: 
<BR>       Micro-well Detectors for Neutron Imaging, and 
<BR>       Millimeter Wave (MMW) sensors.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The objective of the project is to develop an open architecture, computer aided analysis and control design toolbox for distributed parameter systems, in particular, this effort aims at creating computational tools for emerging applications in aerodynamic analysis and control of high performance aerial vehicles. For small-unmanned aerial vehicles a well-designed network of micro actuators can enable aggressive performance not possible using traditional control surfaces such as ailerons, elevators, rudder and flaps. Even for larger aircraft the emerging paradigm of control involves an array of actuators and distributed sensing and actuation. In addition to enhanced performance these control architectures can provide greater redundancy to confront actuator failures. In Phase I, various aspects of the model definition, control parameterization, model reduction, control design and simulation for verification were illustrated for a benchmark problem. In addition, a computational architecture leveraging commonly available tools to the scientists/engineers was defined. The proposed toolbox in conjunction with commonly used general purpose software will provide designers the ability to seamlessly test control design for aerodynamic applications by integrating and automating several key steps in design cycle. These tools will find commercial applications not only in the emerging unmanned aerial vehicle industry but other land, sea and air vehicles as well.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Design of air, land and sea vehicles involving aerodynamic and fluid flow has always been of interest to NASA. The proposed computational tools will help integrate the aerodynamic, structural and control features leading to vehicles capable of greater performance by enabling evaluation of these varied aspects at an early stage. With these tools specification, modeling, control design and simulation can help optimize the design process of aerial vehicle systems. This will enhance the designer's ability to bring recent advances in sensor/actuator technology and control design to engineering practice. The open architecture of the control toolbox and integration will well known tools helps easy extension of the toolbox to other important applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		With the continuing development of small scale, inexpensive, locally "intelligent" embedded actuators and "distributed" sensing, it is increasingly becoming possible to achieve truly distributed control of engineering systems. This ability to "distribute" control authority throughout the system enables the possibility of sophisticated control of distributed systems, such as those involving aerodynamic flow. Engineers/Scientists require computational tools to help analyze and design such systems. Although, the primary application is tailored towards small and micro air vehicles, these tools can be adapted and will find continuing use in industry including design of sea, air and land vehicles.

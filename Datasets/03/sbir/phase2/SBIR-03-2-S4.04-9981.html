		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		     This innovative SBIR Phase II proposal will develop next generation products for Thermal Control Material Systems (TCMS) an adhesives based on the next generation nano-cluster chemistry based new binder systems, through the systematic investigations to tailor required unique performance properties with reliability and durability.  The efforts address a critical need of NASA which plans to undertake challenging exploration missions in high radiation orbits for high power thermal management.  This Phase II product development and validation is mainly proposed to fulfill the issues related to the material obsolescence and the technology gap, and to present next generation product concepts from the new class of binder material chemistries that are dielectrically engineered with required secondary emission properties.  Thus, this timely proposal can fulfill the need of the multifunctional binder based products that have a required thermal shock, thermal cycling performance and potential to improve the affordability.  The proposed efforts will generate needed validation data to generate the confidence in the developed products and will carry out needed optimization of the proposed products.  It will also provide needed input to Phase III opportunities to the mission officials from JIMO, ISS and to the various officials of DoD and NRO on the issues, where the next generation materials can make a significant difference.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		     The DoD, NRO and commercial industry are planning several satellites for the broad band communication activities.  The FAA and NASA are also envisioning commercial space based radars for air traffic control. Such platform structures are expected to be, if not as large as ISS, but at least sizable - where the charge accumulation can be an over riding concerns.  These planned candidate fleet designs of such integrated space systems may require putting assets in the mid-earth orbits for over all optimization and minimization of mission costs.  Such mission and fleet designs can be possible only if the material technologies are made available that have the needed space environment stability built into them for the required reliability and durability along with the charge dissipation abilities.  Currently no material technology exists that can mitigate high energy electron and proton induced degradation effects.  Many other NASA exploration, planetary, commercial and DoD platform hardware will also benefit form these TCMS and Zero CVCM adhesives products proposed for development in Phase II.  The concepts for products like: adhesives and DSR can benefit the NRO's hardening and robustness initiative significantly. The cost effective dividend provided by the charge mitigation applications of the binder chemistry by either dip coating or the rub priming of the binder systems can also have major appeal to Non-NASA applications.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		  The suggested next generation binder system based TCMS products and Zero CVCM adhesives can benefit their applications to enhance the multifunctionality and assist in high-power thermal management challenges with improved affordability. The use of envisioned products based on the binder system developed in Phase I can enhance NASA's ability to carry out the high power space science and the exploration missions in the planetary orbits and the several sun earth connection study mission orbits and for the missions planned for the vision moon, mars and beyond, where the severe electrons and protons are present as one of the main degrading species.
<BR>The stable dielectrically engineered binder system is a central requirement to any NASA space program. For ISS the structure is grounded to the negative of the solar array and hence is about 140 volts below plasma potential. The discharge across the discontinuities caused by the micro-meteoroids can generate electromagnetic interference and even sputtering of the underlying metallic layer. The rub-primed binder that fills the micro-porosity resulted from the anodized aluminum at the surface can help with prevention of electromagnetic interference. This has potential to simplify the grounding schemes and minimize the costs associated with the same. The envisioned binder system based products proposed in Phase II have multiple core abilities to significantly impact the various NASA missions like: JIMO and ISS risk reduction initiative.

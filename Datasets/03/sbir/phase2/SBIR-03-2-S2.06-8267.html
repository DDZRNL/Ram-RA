		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The overall goal of this proposed Phase II SBIR program by Epitaxial Technologies is to develop a compact, low-cost, low power, low noise and ultra-sensitive avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays with built-in optical pre-amplification (in addition to internal electrical gain) and having a fill factor and bandwidth of 90% and 5.0 GHz respectively. In Phase I, we established the feasibility of the concept by demonstrating APDs and APDs with built-in optical amplification with 3 GHz bandwidth and estimated NEP of 1 nW. In Phase II, we will build on these results and optimize the novel APD structures and the APD/optical amplifier integration process. To do this, we will design, model and simulate the performance of the APD arrays with built-in optical pre-amplification and optimize the fabrication process for array production. . In particular, a hybridization technique will be developed to integrate the arrays with readout integrated circuits (ROIC) using an innovative bonding technique at the wafer level. Further, we will design, fabricate and test 1 x 16 datacomm photoreceiver arrays with -52 dBm sensitivity at 1E-9 BER and 2.5 Gbps, along with 32 x 32 imaging ladar arrays with 1 pW NEP that are capable of true photon counting.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Potential DOD applications include: airborne 3-D imaging LADAR transmitter/sensor (and sophisticated image processing) to penetrate dense trees and camouflage in order to detect, identify, and characterize targets on the battlefield such as tanks and armored personnel carriers, missile seekers, passive imaging camera with the capability of generating real-time displays of imaging scene. Commercial applications include: commercial receivers operating in the 1.1-1.5 micron wavelength range for fiber optic communications and free space communication and production monitoring and control in the automotive, and steel industries.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This innovative technology will have numerous important NASA applications, such as free space laser communication systems for intersatellite communications, and near-IR spectroscopy, 3-dimensional imaging LADAR for geographical mapping of terrestrial or extra-terrestrial features, navigational guidance, surveillance through foliage, forestry inspection and agricultural monitoring. As a position sensitive sensor its is suitable for tracking satellites, vehicle docking, navigation, and guidance, photon correlation spectroscopy, low power consumption but very sensitive ground based beacons. Other applications include earth remote sensing to survey crops, forest foliage, and natural resources and measurement of the spatial and temporal variation of water and clouds for atmospheric research.

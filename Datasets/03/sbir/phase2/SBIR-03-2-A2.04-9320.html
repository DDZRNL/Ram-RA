<p><strong>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</strong><BR>
  It is proposed to develop and   implement a computational technique based on Energy Finite Element Analysis   (EFEA) for interior noise prediction of advanced aerospace vehicles that will   expand NASA's noise prediction capability at the early stage of design process.   In many situations, aerospace structures are subjected to high frequency   mechanical and/or acoustic excitations. Presently, noise performances of these   products are determined experimentally, which is not feasible at the early   design stage or by using computational simulation technique based on Statistical   Energy Analysis (SEA). SEA requires high level of analyst expertise and in some   instances, testing of the product's components. An alternative computational   simulation technique for high frequency vibration and noise prediction based on   EFEA conceptually offers several unique features. EFEA can predict the spatial   variation of the energy in structures and the acoustic cavities. Local power   input and damping treatments can also be modeled in EFEA. More importantly, EFEA   is based on extensively used and comprehensively developed finite element   method. The use of finite element method for both low and high frequency noise   and vibration problems will provide the users a unified framework for the   resolution of problems where the frequency spans a wide range.   
<p><strong>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</strong><BR>
  The   software product developed under this proposed work will enable NASA to predict   interior noise using a more versatile tool than currently exists for noise   prediction. As an improved alternative to currently used modeling software, an   EFEA modeling software will increase capability and reduce the cost of modeling   for aerospace structures.  
<p><strong>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100   WORDS)</strong><BR>
  Reduction of noise is of major concern in many industries. For   example, in automotive industry, the increased use of telematic devices require   reduced interior noise environment. By integrating the EFEA software developed   here with appropriate optimization algorithm, one can optimize the interior   noise environment. Since EFEA is a general numerical tool for noise reduction,   it can be easily adapted for noise control in other industries since the same   features that are of interest to NASA will be of interest to aerospace,   automotive, naval, trucking and consumer product industries.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		In this Phase II SBIR contract Tai-Yang Research Company of Tennessee proposes to design, fabricate, and test an ultra-lightweight High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) magnet utilizing Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) diamond technology. The proposed CVD/HTS magnet will combine ultra-lightweight and ultra-high reliability and thermal stability. When built, the CVD/HTS magnet will be the most technologically advanced conduction-cooled HTS magnet ever constructed.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Commercial sales of superconducting magnets represent over a $ 3 Billion per year industry. The two largest commercial existing markets are MRI and NMR, both of which are used by the medical and bio-technology industries. Most other potential commercial applications stem from the electric utility industry and inlcude: transformers, ac/dc motors, ac/dc tranmission cables, generators, flywheels, fault-current-limiters, and magnetic separators. To date, successful HTS based prototypes have been fabricated for most electric utility functions. If technically and economically viable, HTS enabled products are forcasted to be over a $ 10 Billlion dollar industry by 2010. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		HTS magnets have commercial applications potential within NASA anywhere superconducting magnets are implemented. Exsamples of applications include plasma propulsions, adiabatic demagnetization experiments, etc. CVD diamond technology has applications anywhere high strength, high thermal conductivity, and low density are required.

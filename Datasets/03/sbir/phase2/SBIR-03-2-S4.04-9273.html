		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Closed Brayton Cycle (CBC) space power system is one of the most efficient energy conversion technologies for nuclear and solar electric propulsion. The recuperator is critical to enhance CBC efficiency. An advanced light weight recuperator was proposed to significantly reduce the mass (up to 70%) of the State-of-Art (SOA) metallic recuperator and to improve its performance by using advanced high conductivity carbon-based materials. In phase I, prototype cores were fabricated and tested successfully. In Phase II, performance of recuperator cores will be investigated in detail, integration technologies will be improved, structural and assembly issues will be addressed, a 30 ~ 50 kWt subscale recuperator will be designed, prototyped and tested.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed light weight high performance heat exchanger technology offers high commercial potentials in many non-NASA applications. It is particularly attractive for primary heat exchangers of aircraft including both civil and military aerospace vehicles. In addition, the proposed concept may also be used in thermal management of military ground vehicles, navy warships, sport cars, nuclear energy utilizations where weight is a main consideration as well as performance.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The prime application of the proposed light weight high performance recuperator is for a Brayton cycle related power conversion system currently being proposed for deep space explorations including JIMO program. In addition, the proposed concepts and related technologies may also be used for space and aerospace environmental control, thermal management, power electronics cooling and many others

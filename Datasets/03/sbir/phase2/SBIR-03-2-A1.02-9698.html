		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Significant emphasis has been placed on aircraft fuel tank safety following the TWA Flight 800 accident in July 1996.  Upon investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the explosion of the center wing tank (CWT) resulted most likely from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture.  The growing concern of aircraft fuel tank safety has taken an added dimension in the post 9/11 world where both commercial and military aircrafts are vulnerable to terrorist attacks utilizing MANPADS (MAN-Portable Air Defense Systems), explosives in shoe/socks, and small arms fire.  Fuel tanks also need protection from explosions caused by ballistic impact, lightning, and other sources of ignition.  In Phase I,  InnoSense LLC has demonstrated the feasibility of an all-optical oxygen sensor capable of detecting oxygen at 40,000 feet elevation down to the ambient level.  This Phase II proposal discusses how InnoSense LLC would develop a prototype and perform field testing. The project team possesses seventy person-years of optical sensor related hardware and software expertise.  InnoSense has attracted $300,000 in Phase III follow-on funding for further engineering.  Innosense will deliver the prototype to NASA, complete with software, manuals, and schematics.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The upgrading of fuel tanks aboard commercial, freight, military, and corporate jets to avoid potential explosion from fuel vapor will require oxygen sensor.  The current world market totals roughly 40,000 aircraft in service today growing to 60,000 aircraft by 2020.  Other potential applications include monitoring storage tanks containing volatile chemicals (such as hydrogen gas) that can make explosive mixture with oxygen.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The oxygen sensor can be used across all NASA enterprises where measurements in air are needed.  Innovations in the project will minimize calibration needs and reduce crew time during space exploration missions. The sensor platform is amenable to constructing devices for biomedical, materials processing, and environmental applications in space as well as on the surface of the moon and mars.  The sensing device will find applications in lunar outposts and in the International Space Station for monitoring the environmental control and life support systems (ECLSS) or for combustion studies under microgravity.

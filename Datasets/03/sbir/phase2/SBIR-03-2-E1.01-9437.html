		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed work builds a prototype flyable instrument sensor system, based on the preliminary design from Phase 1, capable of operating from a UAV platform to detect and precisely locate wild land fires and quickly transmit the important fire parameters to ground firefighting units. The overall design leverages the results of recent developments at SenSyTech for the real-time geocorrection. It incorporates camera sensors with new Quantum Well Infrared Photodetectors (QWIP) which offer high signal-to-noise ratio, high spatial resolution, small size, and require low power.  The optical design uses a whisk broom scan configuration providing both high spatial resolution and wide field of view for large area coverage in a short time. The geo-corrected, classified fire information is compressed for efficient transmission to the Incident Command Team by a direct communication link.  Our goal is to make this information available within 10 minutes of acquisition.

<BR>The Fire Mapper will demonstrate the feasibility of a small, cost effective system that can meet the commercial market requirements and be used in UAV's or a wide variety of commercial and military piloted aircraft.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		In addition to fire mapping, SenSyTech believes there are significant market opportunities for many other applications including disaster response, surveillance, and thermal mapping.  Any situation where high sensitivity, high resolution, georeferenced, real time thermal imagery brings value represents a potential application.  Possibilities include detecting unauthorized persons or vehicles in restricted areas, thermal mapping of ground water flow, or thermal mapping of disaster sites, such the World Trade Center, to assist and safeguard recovery crews.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Fire Mapper will demonstrate an important operational utility for UAV's.  Data from Fire Mapper will permit comparison with MODIS and other satellites to evaluate the use of new high performance thermal IR detectors that may be used on future satellite systems for detection and mapping of forest fires.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		
<BR>There exist a need to develop, identify, and classify various materials that can be used in the fabrication of electrodynamic tethers for various applications.  These applications consist of but not limited to power generation, orbital maneuvering, and planetary exploration.  A momentum exchange (MXER) tethers utilizes the electrodynamic tether interaction with the planetary magnetic field to provide thrust to a payload in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).  While technological challenges, both materials and non-materials related, currently limit the utilization of the MXER concept, significant advances in materials science will allow the maturation of the system into a viable technology for propulsion in and beyond LEO.  Tether materials-related advances are primary for improving the operation and lifetime of the propulsion system.  Critical materials properties in need of improvement include increases in tensile strength, electrical conductivity, shock resistance, continued flexibility during exposure to an environment rich in radiation and energetic atomic oxygen.  Furthermore, the tether design must incorporate materials with the required characteristics in a manner to allow tolerance to repeated micrometeorite impacts without significant loss of the aforementioned properties.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The materials developed and examined under the proposed program can be utilized in numerous applications.  These applications will have broad market potentials for terrestrial and non-terrestrial uses.  Such examples include electrical shielding, environmental shielding (space and terrestrial environments), communications, power transmission, and flexible electronics.  The applications that will benefit the most are those where weight, flexibility, and durability are of a premium.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		These materials will allow the development of Momentum Exchange tethers such as MXER within a reasonable expectation to progress to hardware prototypes.  The electrodynamic tether propulsion method exchanges momentum with a planet's rotational angular momentum through electrodynamic interaction with the planetary magnetic field. Momentum exchange tethers or MXER concepts use orbital energy to provide a high thrust to a payload in LEO.  The research and development efforts of this program will yield flexible, lightweight, space-durable conductors.  These conductors would have application in many space mission applications where weight savings is of value.

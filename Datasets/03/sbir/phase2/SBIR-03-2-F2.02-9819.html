		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		All research and development in the nation's space program is being aligned around the new Exploration Systems Enterprise vision. The proposed work product for this SBIR II, a Universal Model Repository (UMR) to reduce time and costs for a wide range of mission simulation and training applications, is designed to serve that vision. The UMR will allow NASA and its contractor community to use a license-free online database to store 3D geometry, procedures, animation, functional specifications and simulation assembly templates. The UMR will be delivered with the following three critical template simulation applications: 1) simulation template and applications for crew medical training in health and safety on long duration missions for ISS and Constellation/CEV; 2) simulation template and applications for the design of human-robotic systems and work practices to support long duration surface facilities on the Moon or Mars; and 3) simulation template and applications for rapidly developed, low cost just-in-time virtual training for in-flight ISS and future Constellation/CEV crews.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This platform has been engaged in a project for the teaching of safety practices to children with Autism in a controlled study funded by the National Institutes of Health at Emory University in Atlanta. Other commercial applications include use in the construction industry to simulate work packages, the design of factory floors where people work in concert with robots, surgical theaters where physicians and staff need to optimize the utilization of space, time and equipment, as a multiplayer game platform, and as an engine for battlefield training involving humans and robotic and virtual agents.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		NASA commercial applications of a Universal Model Repository include design simulation for operability and full virtual vehicle lifecycle management (ISS completion, Constellation/CEV and Prometheus), crew health and safety work practices and training, EVA crew refresher training, mobile agents and human/robotic systems design and field testing, telepresence interface development, lunar and Mars base design concepts, virtual astronaut modeling including haptic interfaces, and NASA outreach and K-12 programs (such as Space Camp).

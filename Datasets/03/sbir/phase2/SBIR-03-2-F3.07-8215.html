		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		 CCT has designed and prototyped, as part of the Phase-1 SBIR, a generic platform independent software capability for exchange of semantic control and monitoring information. In addition, CCT has laid the foundation for auto-generation of semantic construction and interpretation libraries from semantic databases that can be used for message-based communications between loosely coupled systems. This new capability will reduce development, operations, and support costs for legacy and future systems that are part of ground and space based distributed command and control systems. It will also establish a space systems information exchange model that can support future highly interoperable and mobile software systems. CCT has also leveraged Phase-1 results to develop a common data description language approach for NASA-ELV launch operations, creating a pathfinder that will eventually allow all launch service providers, range systems, and ground operators to use common data descriptions, processes, and tools for ground systems configuration.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		New telemetry and command exchange standards will serve to enhance the capabilities of CCT's existing command and control product line, allowing CCT to offer data exchange and semantic processing capabilities not previously available in a commercial control and monitoring product. CCT also plans to modularly construct this new semantic processing middleware as an independent product that can be used in any message based communication system, and applied to any XML semantic schema, including military communications gateways, and the telecom industry name a few.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The availability of a platform independent, low cost, advanced data description exchange services for NASA's many space/ground systems would provide a tremendous cost savings via reduction of software development cost to migrate legacy and new systems towards more capable data exchange standards. There would be an even greater cost savings realized from the streamlining of mission preparation processes.  
<BR>Advanced exchange standards for control and monitoring would also contribute to the eventual design of next generation spaceport command, control, and monitoring systems that are evolvable and capable of supporting heterogeneous vehicles and spaceport systems.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used as an analysis tool to help the designer gain greater understanding of the fluid flow phenomena involved in the components being designed. The next step in the design process is to modify the design to improve the components performance, typically performed manually by the designer in a trial and error fashion. The innovations proposed herein will provide important advances in the state-of-the-art of automatic CFD shape deformation and optimization software. Optimal Solutions Software (OSS) has been developing a software program called Sculptor, which provides capabilities to perform shape deformation and optimization in CFD design. When the innovations proposed herein are included in Sculptor, and coupled with NASAs Stennis Space Centers (SSC) CFD codes, a truly innovative and significant design tool will be available to perform automatic shape optimization. Sculptor can find new geometric shapes, in a timely manner that likely would not have been discovered without its use. Therefore Sculptor can innovate when used by knowledgeable engineers.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The non-NASA commerical application are numerous indeed.  Practically any sytem or component that involves fluid dynamics, heat transfer, mass transfer, chemically reacting flow, including combustion, can benefit by applying the innovations that will be developed in this Phase II effort.  Applications can be found in aerospace, automotive, marine, biomedical, chemical, electronics, power generation, etc.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The innovative tools included into Sculptor will allow NASA engineers to perform shape optimization for computational fluid dynamic design  efficiently in many areas including: - Rocket motors: nozzles, combustors, injectors, diffusers, etc., - Heat exchangers, - Aerodynamic shapes of aircraft, spacecraft, automobiles, trucks, etc. - Valves, general pipefittings, elbows, T-fittings, etc. Practically any component's performance that involves fluid and/or heat flow or chemically reacting flow (including combustion) can be optimized with these tools.  In the search for ever improved components for space travel, these tools could help with many projects in support of the newly planned Moon and Mars missions.

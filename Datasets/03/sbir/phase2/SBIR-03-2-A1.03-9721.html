<p><strong>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</strong><BR>
  The goal of Phase I study was   to investigate advanced pattern recognition techniques for use in fault   diagnosis. Three individual experts have been developed based on Auto   Associative Neural Networks (E-AANN), Kohonen Self Organizing Maps (KSOM), and   the Radial Basis Function based Clustering (RBFC) algorithms. We have used a   Matlab Simulink model of a Chiller system to test our algorithms. The set of   individual experts are later managed by a Gated Expert algorithm which assigns   the experts based on their best performance regions. <BR>
  In Phase II, we propose   to implement our results on two dynamic systems. The first is a Chiller system   at the Texas A&amp;M University. The second is an engine under study in Pratt   and Whitney under a contract to Professor George Vactsevanos from Georgia Tech.   The end deliverable of Phase II will be a complete dynamic Case Based Reasoning   (GED-CBR) system managed by a Gated Experts algorithm all coded in Matlab.   GED-CBR will be highly applicable to dynamic systems that can benefit from the   power of Dynamic Case Based Reasoning managed by a powerful Gated Experts   architecture. It is expected that GED-CBR will find applications in prognostics   of the nuclear reactor on board the JIMO spacecraft. <BR>
<p><strong>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</strong><BR>
  We have   established a collaborative R&amp;D relationship with Professor John Bernard of   the MIT Nuclear Power Plant. Professor Bernard is interested to work with us on   the NASA's new initiatives on using nuclear power energy on its new space   exploration spacecrafts such as the JIMO spacecraft. Also, after the terrible   Challenger accident, the need for careful prognostics is more and more required.   Our work will be of interest to the fault diagnostics and prognostics of the   Space Station Freedom and the Space Shuttle systems.  
<p><strong>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</strong><BR>
  We   expect that our chief non-NASA customer will come from DOD and in particular the   Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). Other industries such as companies like Sigma Quest   can use our technology to assist them in handling the huge amounts of data that   they need to manage for the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM).

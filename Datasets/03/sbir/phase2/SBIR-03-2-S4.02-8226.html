		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a new class of electronic devices called solid state vacuum devices (SSVD<SUP>TM</SUP>s), a highly enabling technology for extreme high temperature radiation hard electronics.  SSVD<SUP>TM</SUP>s merge solid state semiconductor technology, including process fabrication techniques, with vacuum electronics, and, in this case, specifically thermionic vacuum electronics. SSVD<SUP>TM</SUP>s have already been demonstrated for highly demanding high frequency applications. Thermionic SSVD<SUP>TM</SUP>s, in which vacuum transport is by thermionically emitted electrons, are especially promising due to their intrinsic internal high temperature operation and radiation hardness.  SSVD<SUP>TM</SUP>s are extremely well suited for extreme environments that, for example, exist on or near Venus.  InnoSys proposed and successfully demonstrated in Phase I of this SBIR project SSVD<SUP>TM</SUP> triodes/field effect transistors and the associated assembly and sealing to meet the requirements needed for extreme high temperature electronics.  In particular, SSVD<SUP>TM</SUP> electronics were successfully experimentally demonstrated fully operational at 500C. In addition, radiation insensitive SSVD<SUP>TM</SUP> electronics were also successfully experimentally demonstrated during Phase I of this SBIR project.  Small scale extreme temperature, radiation insensitive SSVD<SUP>TM</SUP> integrated circuits (ICs) will be developed during Phase II of this SBIR project.  Currently no other existing electronics can address this extreme environment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		SSVD<SUP>TM</SUP>s are currently being developed commercially to address commercial markets in communications(i.e.,base stations,broadband and millimeter wave communications),and power control and conversion.Potential non-NASA commercial applications for extreme temperature and radiation environment (EXTREME)SSVD products include down hole and geothermal markets and applications and radiation insensitive electronics. The potential applications for SSVD technology and products are vast and include:
<BR>low frequency to millimeter wave sources for communications and other applications;radiation hard/insensitive electronics;control and sensing electronics for nuclear reactors;power supplies and converters;control, monitoring and sensing applications for harsh environments in terrestrial, automotive, avionics, and aeronautics; aerospace engine monitoring and surface controls; automotive in-cylinder and exhaust;process industry and chemical process control and monitoring;power generation;jet engine and power turbine generators;sensors and detectors;high and extreme temperature robotics;and hydraulic replacement on aircraft with uncooled EXTREME smart MEMS SSVDs.Other applications pertinent to this SBIR,for example,include three dimensional microfabrication and micromachining coupled with the possibility of extreme temperature,radiation hard/insensitive harsh environment electronics.In addition,the possibility of coupling extreme high temperature electronics and communications is very attractive.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Missions to Venus have to operate at 460C and need operational amplifiers, instrumentation amplifiers, switches, analog muxs, motor controllers, H bridges, dc to dc power converters, inverters, and digital to analog and analog to digital converters.  SSVDs can be fabricated to directly operate at 460C enhancing mission life and eliminating bulky thermal management systems.  Additional applications include Giant Planets, Deep Probes, Project Prometheus related missions, Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO), Jovian radiation belts, nuclear power systems, nuclear reactors, nuclear propulsion and other fission-based space propulsion/power systems.  SSVDTM extreme radiation and temperature electronics located next to reactors can last 15+ years.

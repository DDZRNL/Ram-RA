		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		In the Phase I research, Surface Optics Corporation (SOC) demonstrated a durable silver mirror coating based an ion assisted, thermal evaporation process.  The recipe for this durable silver mirror system was developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) but was based on a reactive sputtering process.   In the Phase II research, process scale-up issues will be addressed so that the process may be implemented in SOC's large aperture coating facility.  SOC recently developed a novel vacuum coating system that utilizes a translating electron beam evaporation source.  This system is capable of producing highly uniform optical films on curved substrates up to 3-meters in diameter.  The combination of SOC's novel manufacturing methods and LLNL's coating designs, will establish a unique and very valuable coating resource for the astronomical community.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Commercial applications for the technology include large, ground-based telescopes such as the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, as well as, home astronomy telescope mirrors and optical gratings.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This research will benefit NASA programs such as the Terrestrial Planet Finder Mission (TPF) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).  SOC is currently developing a solar sail film in conjunction with SRS Technology.  A protected silver coating would significantly enhance the performance of solar sail propulsion concepts, compared to traditional aluminum coatings.

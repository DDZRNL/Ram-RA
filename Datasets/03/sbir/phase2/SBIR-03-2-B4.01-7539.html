		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		We propose a dual objective innovation that has valuable NASA applicability and tremendous commercial potential.  The first innovation is the structure determination of osteoporosis, immune system diseases, and radiation damage repair proteins utilizing proprietary neural network based algorithms.  The long-term results from this innovation could provide effective medical countermeasures for bone loss, immune system compromise and harmful radiation effects seen in astronauts upon long-duration space missions. The second innovation is a commercial grade multipurpose neural network based informatics system configurable for automated, real-time sensory data input and automatic correlation identification applicable to autonomous astronaut health monitoring and environmental correlation.  This innovation also has significant commercial applications in the health care industries as a hospital wide health monitoring and environmental correlation system.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The drug targets have earth based commercial potential that will lead to drug royalties.   We also anticipate that drug discovery entities including pharmaceutical, biotech companies, and academic institutions will subscribe to the proposed fee-based service.  The neural network based informatics system has significant commercial applications in the health care industries as a hospital wide health monitoring and environmental correlation system. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The first innovation will facilitate drug development to enhance crew health in long term space flight missions.  The long-term results from this innovation could provide effective medical countermeasures for bone loss, immune system compromise and harmful radiation effects seen in astronauts upon long-duration space missions.  
<BR>The neural network based informatics system will allow configuration as an automated, real-time sensory data input and automatic correlation identification system applicable to autonomous astronaut health monitoring and environmental correlation.  An application of this innovation is the neural network identification of space flight bone-loss to environmental factors.

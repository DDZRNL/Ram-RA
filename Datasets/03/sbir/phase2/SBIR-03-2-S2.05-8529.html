		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The objective of this proposal is to deliver state-of-the-art, bench-top deployable, large-throw and tip/tilt, low cross-talk, high resolution, highly scalable and fast response wavefront control devices (deformable mirror, or DM) based on micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) fabrication processes. The device consists of Segmented Membrane Arrays (SMA). The design uses highly uniform (both mechanically and optically) arrays of mirror pixels to eliminate the cross talk with adjacent elements, which is usually observed in continuous membrane devices. It opens new opportunities to make ideal deformable mirrors with large-throw and independent addressing capabilities.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Wave-front correction can also be used for retinal imaging applications.  Currently, there does not exist a small, high performance deformable mirror that can adequately be used for these applications.  The successful development proposed here can potentially advance the state-of-the-art towards fulfilling those applications.  
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The successful creation of the MEMS SMA opens up new applications in wave-front control optical systems such as those used in telescope applications, for example in systems such as the Adaptive Nulling System in the Terrestrial Planet Finder program.

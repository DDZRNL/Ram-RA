		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		GRID has had a successfully completed Phase I 'Mobile Online Intelligent Decision Support System' (MOIDSS).  The system developed into a total solution that supports the ability to send and receive digital and analog data from sensors such as photography cameras, spectrometers, infrared and thermal scanners and other system sensors using the 'cube' computers and mobile Personal Data Adapters (PDA's).  The data from the sensors can be accessed rapidly in real-time within a GIS using GRID 'geospatial-realty intelligent linking database' (GRILD) autonomously using GPS geospatial authentication.  The system has successfully received data using wireless networking systems such as spread spectrum, UHF, and satellite communication systems.  Using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions allows a solution that is not proprietary and proven security biometric identification. This system uses GRID's customized software with partners ESRI and Leica Geosystems.  The solution was designed with input from local first responders and facility managers. GRID is prepared to move to the next phase to enter the market with a valuable product.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Similar facilities can utilize the system to support activities With MOIDSS<SUP>TM</SUP> the user can add existing data from the map server or collect new data using multiple sensors such as a Hydrolab<SUP>TM</SUP>, ground Lidar system, hand held spectrometers and other advanced sensors. Users can move around maps and spatial information that is local on the handheld or via a true client/server interface.  This is possible by using high speed  wireless communication. Users will be able to edit data, navigate on the ground, and collect measurement metric information.  This allows potential Non-NASA Commercial Applications to be created in multiple areas.
<BR>
<BR>Scientific Investigation with a method to spatial store and interface with data with GRILD. Having the ability to query and request Earth Science Data On-Demand will assist field investigators to compare and fuse real-time data. 
<BR>
<BR>Resource managers will have the ability to collect GIS information in the field about the facilities they manage.  MOIDSS<SUP>TM</SUP> to use access server information from a distant location. For example, a city manger or farmer can obtain satellite information within the field to assist in making quicker solutions.  
<BR>
<BR>Others that could utilize the system include College Campus, Military Installations, Ports, Chemical Refineries, and Manufacturing Facilities.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		There are a number of applications for MOIDSS<SUP>TM</SUP>:
<BR>
<BR>Earth Science:
<BR>The Earth Science directorate can utilize MOIDSS<SUP>TM</SUP> to georeference and calibrate satellite image products.  For example, Landsat images can utilize the system to ground truth products in real-time.  The solution allows users to access imagery in real-time within the field to assist NASA in determining the quality of products delivered to customers. 
<BR>
<BR>Facility Management:
<BR>MOIDSS<SUP>TM</SUP> can be used to set control point on site to a homogenous coordinate system. This fixes the coordinate system and spatial reference frame that all data is collected and coordinated.  A central base station GPS can be used to update the existing control points horizontal and vertical values.  The total solution can be used to assist the facility management to have access to all data sources and develop a GIS Standard.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed research is focused on developing an aerocapture decelerator
<BR>that is substantially lighter than other approaches by using lightweight,
<BR>fiber-reinforced films in its construction and by being a smaller size
<BR>(higher ballistic coefficient) than previously studied ballutes that operate without thermal protection.  A second objective is to develop an innovative method of control for deployable aerocapture decelerators employing shape-morphing lift modulation.  Aerocapture is strongly enhancing for planetary exploration because the decelerator mass is less than the fuel mass needed for the same delta-V, and therefore results in a higher payload fraction in orbit.  Inflatable drag devices are a promising type of aerocapture decelerator because (1) they are lighter than conventional fixed-geometry aeroshells, and (2) they can be much larger than the interior of a launch fairing and thus enable heavier spacecraft.  This aerocapture technology also applies to supersonic decelerators for Entry, Descent and Landing Systems (EDLS) and to other systems requiring supersonic deceleration and stabilization.  Trajectory control by shape-morphing lift modulation also enhances EDLS as part of precision guided landing capability.  The anticipated Phase II results include the design,
<BR>manufacture and testing of a full-scale, flight-weight inflatable torus,
<BR>advancing the key inflatable technology for aerocapture decelerators to TRL
<BR>4.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		There are three classes of non-NASA commercialization opportunities: 1)
<BR>commercial space organizations, 2) European Space Agency, and 3) US
<BR>Department of Defense.  Commercial launch service providers are presently
<BR>examining the feasibility of using an inflatable supersonic decelerator
<BR>(Hypercone) as part of a recovery system for reusable components of launch
<BR>vehicles (details are competition sensitive).  ESA's potential applications
<BR>of Hypercone technology mirror those of NASA: planetary aerocapture, and
<BR>supersonic decelerators for EDLS.  US DoD programs include the need for both supersonic decelerators/stabilizers and structurally robust exo-atmospheric inflatable devices.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Inflatable aerocapture technology and the related supersonic deployable
<BR>decelerator (Hypercone) will have broad applicability for future NASA needs.  Specifically, Hypercone holds the promise of a highly efficient, low mass fraction, high drag, highly stabilizing device for the following
<BR>applications: 
<BR>
<BR>-  Aerocapture for outer planet exploration;
<BR>-  Decelerator/stabilizer for CEV boost phase crew escape;
<BR>-  Aerocapture and aerobraking in the atmosphere of Mars, extending
<BR>payload masses well beyond the capability of parachutes;
<BR>-  Earth-return orbital aerocapture from L1 or the moon; and
<BR>-  Earth aerocapture for sample return from Mars.

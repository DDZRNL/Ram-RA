		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Black Forest Engineering has identified innovative modifications in uncooled focal plane array (UFPA) architecture and processing that allows development of large format long wavelength infrared (8-14 ?m) imaging sensors to meet future NASA system requirements for a light weight, low power, and radiation tolerant imager. These modifications allow development of bolometer-based large format UFPA, with a pixel pitch of 20-?m and 1024x768 pixel elements with sensitivity comparable to commercially available UFPAs with 30-?m pixel pitch. The identified modifications are applicable to amorphous silicon bolometer-based UFPAs, such as those manufactured by Raytheon Commercial Infrared in Dallas, Texas.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Black Forest Engineering's proposed large format focal plane array has non-NASA commercial applications such as radiometers, security and surveillance systems, medical imaging, gas/chemical analyzers and vision enhancement for navigation at night and in fog.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Black Forest Engineering's proposed large format (1024x768) focal plane array has NASA commercial applications for remote sensing applications such as aircraft, balloon-borne, space flight platforms, Planet Landing Aid in Dust Storms, Thermal Emission LWIR Imaging. Radiation tolerance and no need for temperature stabilization make it practical for a wide range of systems, especially applications requiring low power consumption and long life.

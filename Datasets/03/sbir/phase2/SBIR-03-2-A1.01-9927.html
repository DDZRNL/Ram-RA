<P><B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>The TerraBlocks<SUP>TM</SUP> 
3D terrain data format and terrain-block-rendering methodology provides an 
enabling basis for successful commercial deployment of flight-appropriate and 
certifiable Synthetic Vision (SV) systems. The methodology focuses on 
mission-critical, real-time, embedded terrain rendering with emphasis on 1) 
efficient and compact terrain/texture dataset storage, 2) rendering accuracy, 3) 
rendering determinacy, and 4) a lightweight embedded computer and data storage 
platform. <BR><BR>The innovation exploits the use of an encoded terrain data 
storage format coupled with real-time, terrain-block-based 3D rendering. The 
compact and efficient TerraBlocks encoded terrain data format inherently 
provides zero-error full-mesh near-field terrain data, powers-of-2 levels of 
detail, and data compression of full-mesh source terrain datasets. The 
TerraBlocks terrain block-based rendering provides deterministic render rates 
bounded by worst-case processing requirements, an on-the-sphere rendering model, 
and spatially-filtered, smoothly continuous, level-of-detail rendering. 
<BR><BR>TerraBlocks technology closes the gap between existing 
visualization/simulation (VisSim) terrain-rendering approaches and the accuracy, 
performance, and platform demands of flight-deployable SV systems. The Phase I 
project conclusively showed the technical merit and feasibility of the 
TerraBlocks methodology. <BR><BR>The Phase II project objective is to provide a 
flight-appropriate, research SV 3D terrain-rendering toolkit for NASA's Aviation 
Safety and Security Program (AvSSP) and the solid basis for Phase III, 
flight-certifiable SV avionics embodiments. <BR>

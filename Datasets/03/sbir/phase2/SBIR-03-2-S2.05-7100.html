		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Primary mirrors for large aperture telescopes (> 10 m) are collections of smaller (1-2 m), typically hexagonal, often aspheric, optical segments.   NASA's next generation specifications demand high precision optical surfaces with practically zero edge exclusion in order to maximize image contrast and resolution.  Magnetorheological finishing (MRF) is a sub-aperture process demonstrated to be effective for fine figure control and polishing of a variety of optical glasses and crystals.   The relatively small size and high removal rate of the MRF tool could allow efficient correction of  "print-through" patterns (or other mid-spatial frequency errors) often observed after conventional polishing.  MRF, however, can suffer from edge effects, because the MRF polishing spot changes as it moves over the edge of the part.  Current control algorithms assume the spot remains constant, resulting in edge errors on the order of half of the spot size in width. In Phase I, we identified a promising method of counteracting edge effects. In Phase II, we will develop, test, and refine three software- and process-based solutions, and apply them to polishing an optic of relevance to NASA's needs.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		In addition to many ground-based, large, segmented telescopes (including the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) umbrella project which also includes the CELT, GMST, and VLOT programs), successful completion of this work could benefit other industries that require large, high precision, optical surfaces.  This includes, for example, (a) next generation EUV lithography systems, (b) commercial satellite and surveillance systems, and (c) many DoD applications that require high precision, optical surfaces.  The precision optics market will benefit through higher precision "small" optics (e.g. prism surfaces).  A final benefit could be reduced edge exclusion on semiconductor wafer and photomask substrates.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		This work could benefit many NASA programs that depend on large optics. For example, the James Web Space Telescope (JWST), which the National Academy of Science ranked as one of NASA's top science goals for this decade, will require 18 large mirror segments.  Other NASA programs include, (a) Structure and Evolution of the Universe (SEU) programs for space-based, large aperture telescopes that look far into space, (b) Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) programs for airborne or space-based instruments that image the Earth and (c) Sun-Earth Connection (SEC) programs for UV & EUV imaging of the Sun and its interaction with the Solar System.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		A prototype Next Generation MK III Lightweight HUT/Hatch Assembly will be fabricated and delivered during Phase II.  Maximum weight reduction for the Hard Upper Torso - Hatch assembly will be acheived via the innovative material selection and cross sectional redesign investigation Air-Lock conducted during Phase I. The intent is to fabricate a lightweight HUT/Hatch Assembly best suited for space & planetary (or lunar) exploration. This Next Generation MK III Lightweight HUT/Hatch Assembly will be a rear entry assembly and have full "plug and play" capability with previous MK III suits.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Future applications benefiting from the enabling technology will center around low production quantity structures where lighter weight is a goal.  Prefabricated military structures and aircraft structures (such as wing spars) are ideal fits.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Besides a lightweight prototype HUT, the manufacturing process of lightweight robust materials will be dlviered to NASA as an enabling technology.  Possbile applications include prefabricated, life critical, lightweight pressurized compartments such as airlocks.

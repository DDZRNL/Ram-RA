		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed innovation is a wireless laser power transmission system employing a dual-use photovoltaic concentrator at the receiving end. Specifically, the laser receiver/converter employs thin stretched-membrane Fresnel lenses to focus continuous or pulsed laser light onto small photovoltaic cells, thereby reducing cell cost and improving cell conversion efficiency. The dual-use approach can be implemented in several ways, to allow the same photovoltaic concentrator array to be used as a solar array and/or a laser receiver/converter array. Specifically, the photovoltaic concentrator employs multi-junction cells for high-efficiency solar radiation conversion, and single-junction cells for the high-efficiency laser radiation conversion. A prototype lens/cell unit was successfully tested in Phase I, and a more optimal array will be built and tested in Phase II.  The new modular laser/solar photovoltaic concentrator will have many NASA, military, and commercial space applications. Applications include spacecraft arrays receiving laser input from other spacecraft or from Earth; lunar or planetary arrays receiving laser input from nearby spacecraft or from Earth; and Earth-based arrays receiving laser input from space solar power (SSP) spacecraft. The dual-use capability enables state-of-the-art solar operation when sunlight is available (e.g., illuminated orbit portion), and laser operation when sunlight is not available (e.g., eclipse orbit portion).

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		DOD and commercial applications will include space-based, earth-based, and unmanned aerial vehicle arrays for laser-only, solar-only, or dual-use radiation collection and conversion.  Space applications will include all types and classes of missions, including LEO, MEO, GEO, deep space, and planetary, including on the moon, asteroids, Mars, etc.  Earth applications will include the solar-only array as an improved replacement for the ubiquitous planar silicon cell arrays; the laser-only array to receive power from a space-based or ground-based laser;  and the dual-use array to collect sunlight by day and to collect laser light from a space solar power (SSP) spacecraft by night.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed dual-use laser/solar photovoltaic concentrator innovation addresses a universal need for all space missions: electrical power. Therefore, the innovation will have innumerable NASA applications. Uniquely, the proposed innovation can be used in a laser-only, solar-only, or dual-use mode, all at state-of-the-art performance levels, enabling the same basic lens/cell module to serve many different applications. NASA applications will include space-based arrays, aircraft- or airship-based arrays, and planetary arrays, for laser-only, solar-only, or dual-use radiation collection and conversion. Applications will include all types and classes of NASA missions, including aircraft, airship, LEO, MEO, GEO, planetary, Moon/Mars exploration, and deep space missions.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The Phase II research comprises designing, constructing, and testing a chip-based capillary electrochromatography (CEC) prototype for separation and analysis of organic and inorganic molecules including amino acids and ions.  The innovation of the proposed technology stems from its ability to achieve high sample retention and selectivity and yet maintain high separation efficiency, thus filling an important gap between the current technologies of capillary electrophoresis (CE) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).  Such microfluidics devices will enable analyte samples to be prepared, processed, and analyzed in "lab-on-a-chip" (LOC) type instrumentation in Micro Laboratories applications. In addition, they will be engineered for integration with established LOC analysis systems.  The Phase II Research will address issues related to the performance and production methods for the technology.  Commercial devices based on the Phase II prototype will be constructed and subsequently refined and commercialized during Phase III.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed technology will enhance the performance of the commercial "lab-on-a-chip" technologies, enabling new approaches to chemical and biomolecular detection and analysis to implemented. The applications in broad commercial arenas range from drug and chemical compound analyses in the pharmaceutical industry to genomics and proteomics in the growing biotechnology industry.  Additional commercial applications include performing blood analyses, detecting chemical and biological agents for homeland defense initiatives, drug delivery systems, and providing forensic analyses at crime scenes.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed chip-base capillary electrochromatography (CEC) devices can be used to develop miniature analytical or "lab-on-a-chip" technologies used to perform rapid, in-situ chemical and biological analyses for applications ranging from maintaining crew health in manned missions to performing in-situ analyses during Mars microrover missions.  Additional potential aerospace applications include identifying contaminants and pathogens present in air and water in space stations, and providing in-situ analyses on terrestrial environments such as Mars and Nereus.

		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The development and implementation of passive phased array antennas (PAAs) offers significant performance benefits over the current active arrays. The keys to successful development are the low-loss phase shifters and the integration of these phase shifters into modular and scaleable antenna architecture for broad utilization for high data rate communications.  The Phase I effort designed a dual-beam, dual-band 4GHz and 6 GHz along with an optimized High Dynamics Modem to support SATCOM telemetry utilizing commercial satellite services, specifically the Intelsat system. The proposed effort will build on this Phase I Phased Array ? High Dynamics Modem design development and include the fabrication, testing and integration of the PAA antenna and high dynamics modem with appropriate RF transceiver (COTS) such that an Intelsat ready communications system test unit is built, tested, validated and delivered to NASA for evaluation.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The dual-beam, high-dynamics satellite communications system as designed and prototyped in this Phase 2 effort, will provide sufficient performance to support broadband SATCOM services to commercial aviation, marine, rail and other mass transit and private vehicle requirements.  This global reach-back with a high data rate service can either be to a single user or can be the backhaul for an 802.11 or other 'final link' to passengers traveling at high rates of speed or highly irregular motion. Most of these applications will benefit from a reduced performance comms system compared to the NASA ELV requirement.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed application supports Telemetry and Range Safety utilizing commercial satellite systems for expendable launch vehicles, which should experience a substantial acceleration in launch schedules to support the new Manned Missions to Mars/Moon. When the Antenna-to-Baseband Communications System is integrated with the ELV, it will enable Telemetry Data to work on commercial satellite systems to relieve the already overburdened ground- and satellite-based systems currently employed by NASA for a "pay as you go" capability. This prototype system can also be utilized for aeronautical applications where specific critical 'Black-Box' recorded data is transmitted for real-time analysis of potential flight deviations/critical failures.

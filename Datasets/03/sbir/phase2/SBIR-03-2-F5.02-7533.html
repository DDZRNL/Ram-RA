		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		NASA requires a small, lower power "ranging" sensor that produces a depth map of the scene (the exterior of the Space Shuttle, the International Space Station or a future Space Solar Power Satellite) to inspect for damage.  By combining innovative designs with MEMS-based scanners and off the shelf electronic and optical components, this program will develop a low power, miniature LADAR system with 1 mm resolution at 10 meters weighing <300 g, costing orders of magnitude less compared to the state-of-the art systems.  This LADAR will be capable of providing high resolution 3-D images of Space Shuttle Thermal Protection System for damage assessment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Because of its 10X reduction in cost and 20X reduction in size without performance sacrifice, the proposed system will have numerous commercial applications in surveying, navigation and guidance, collision avoidance, damage assessment, inspection, surveillance, medical, and manufacturing. Markets for this technology includes medical diagnostic imaging and assisted driving. Both of these markets represent multi-billion dollar business opportunities. 
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		NASA applications include damage assessment, inspection, navigation and guidance for the space shuttle, space station and satellites.  In addition, the small size, low power and high sensitive features of the micro-LADAR allow it to be carried by astronauts or spacecrafts for analyzing and quantifying the physical characteristics of geological objects (rocks, soil, etc.), virtually independent of the surface roughness, color, or reflectivity.

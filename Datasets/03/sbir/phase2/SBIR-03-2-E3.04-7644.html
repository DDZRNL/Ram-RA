<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA missions are being designed for multi-sensor data collection and synthesis using diverse temporal, spatial and spectral resolutions for use by multiple teams of mission specialists and scientists.  This project offers two closely related technologies of 3D surface and volume (a) meshing, modeling and compression, and (b) registration and matching that will benefit the distribution, sharing and use of fused datasets. Various machine intelligence and data-driven methods are used to generate a novel 3D meshing, modeling and compression methods based on hierarchical tetrahedral and binary triangular decomposition schemes applicable to surfaces and volumes, providing high compression performance. Meshing is progressive and adaptive to any resolution and for any selected region in the scene/data, thus making it possible to model certain regions with high resolution while leaving the remaining parts coarse. (2) Registration is performed iteratively to search for optimal alignment of overlapping 3D models by minimizing an error objective function subject to an error tolerance. Following alignment, an integration algorithm fuses overlapping models. The anticipated results are effective 3D surface and volume meshing, modeling, compression and registration technologies that significantly benefit NASA's missions.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
The 3D tools being developed for this project will be used as a post-processing tool for 3D datasets generated by any current or completed NASA mission (e.g. Mars Rover).  Moreover, the tools could also be designed and integrated into planned NASA missions in earth science, deep space and the local solar system as a functional component in mission operations related to 3D data acquisition, processing and transmission.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
UC intelligent 3D technologies will provide a highly efficient top-down progressive 3D meshing, modeling, registration/fusion and recognition capabilities for 3D GIS (e.g. terrain mapping & modeling), medical imaging (e.g. computer-aided detection), security & surveillance, training, simulation and virtual reality markets (e.g. terrain modeling).

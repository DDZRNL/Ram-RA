		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The development and performance evaluation of new carbon/carbon (C/C) and carbon/silicon-carbide (SiC) composite structural components has been hampered by the lack of reliable strain sensors that can survive up to the exceedingly high temperatures (3000 F) up to which these materials must be tested. Existing off-the-shelf high-temperature strain sensors, including free filament electrical strain gages and optical fiber based strain sensors, currently do not have the necessary performance characteristics to tackle the next generation of C/C and SiC composite material testing programs. Free filament electrical strain gages cannot be used reliably over 1800 F (1000 C) and conventional optical fiber strain sensors with the appropriate protective metal coatings can operate reliably only up to close to the melting point of the silica (2000 F/1100 C). To meet the growing needs for strain sensors that can withstand future high temperature testing regimes, Lambda Instruments, Inc. proposes to develop sapphire optical fiber sensors. The 3600 F (1987 C) melting temperature of optical quality sapphire fibers, their low profile geometry, and the inherent immunity of optical fiber sensors to electromagnetic interference make sapphire fiber-based sensors particularly well suited for the proposed application.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Revenues for fiber optic sensors in 2008 is expected to reach $350 million.  A large part of this market demand will come from the combustion engine and turbomachinery industry which is already the leading consumer of sensors on the worldwide market.  Even though fiber optic sensors are uniquely capable making measurements under harsh environmental conditions, they still need to achieve large volumes, low unit prices, and long operational lifetimes before industries are willing to put them into widespread use.  The proposed Phase II program will be a large step in validating the commercial viability of fiber sensors for harsh environments.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The primary NASA application for the proposed high temperature sapphire optical fiber strain gages is for structural performance monitoring of emerging C/SiC and C/C composite components that must be characterized up to 3000 F. Other potential NASA applications based on the proposed sapphire optical fiber sensor technology include strain, temperature, and pressure sensors for performance monitoring of ramjet/scramjets during research and operation as well as for continuous structural health monitoring of the next generation space vehicles to maintain performance and safety standards throughout all phases of the mission.

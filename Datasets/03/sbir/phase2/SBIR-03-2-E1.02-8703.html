<p><strong>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</strong><BR>
  In Phase II we will develop   transparent Nd:Yttria ceramic laser materials that can operate at 914 nm and 946   nm suitable for applications in ozone LIDAR systems. We will strive to further   optimize Nd:Yttria ceramics with a focus on improving the overall transmission   of the material as well as optimizing the Nd dopant concentration. The goal is   to develop Nd: Yttria laser materials with high figure-of-merit (FOM) that do   not suffer from Nd concentration quenching. We will investigate Nd:Yttria   ceramics as solid-state laser materials. Initial testing will be done at the   primary emission wavelength of 1.07 ?m. Laser performance studies will be based   on pulsed, quasi-cw, and cw end-pumping schemes. We will also develop the Nd:   Y2O3 ceramics for laser applications at 914 nm and 946 nm. The optimized ceramic   materials developed will be used for laser experiments at 914nm and 946nm.   Initial experiments will be carried out at reduced temperature (77K). After   successful demonstration of low-temperature lasing at 914nm/946nm, the   possibility of efficient lasing at higher temperatures (up to 300K) will be   explored. Different laser designs will be employed including end-pumping schemes   and the thin-disk laser configuration. 
<p><strong>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</strong><BR>
  The   ceramic laser material that will be developed during this research will have   potential applications in LIDAR remote sensing applications. Nd:Y2O3 has   emission lines at 914 nm and 946 nm, which, when frequency tripled, correspond   to ~305 nm and ~315 nm. These wavelengths are of particular interest for   differential absorption lidar (DIAL). DIAL techniques are used to determine   molecular constituent concentrations present in the atmosphere such as ozone and   green house gases, which are of particular interest because of their impact on   the environment. 
<p><strong>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100   WORDS)</strong><BR>
  Polycrystalline ceramic lasers have enormous potential commercial   applications. Commercial applications include remote sensing, chemical detection   and scientific research. Furthermore, the cost to produce ceramic laser   materials is potentially much lower than that for single crystal materials   because of the shorter time it takes to fabricate the material and also because   of the possibility of mass production. <BR>

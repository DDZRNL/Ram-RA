		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Our innovation is a high-speed method for the prediction of aerodynamic debris fields that employs an extensive database of generalized empirical equations coupled with interpolation and localization techniques.  An essential element of our innovation is the vehicle independence of the equations database which allows it to be generated once and applied to any vehicle.  The large-scale operation of unpiloted aircraft within the National Airspace (NAS) will require a very high tempo of flight risk assessments, both for pre-mission planning and in the event of unplanned anomalies or deviations from the approved flight path.  These risk assessments will require a large number of debris field predictions each of which will involve predicting the expected impact point and impact dispersion of many distinct representative debris pieces.  Our innovation is aimed at making this volume of predictions feasible and cost-effective.

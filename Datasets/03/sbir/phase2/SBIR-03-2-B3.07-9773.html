		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The aim of this proposal is to develop a low power consuming solid polymer electrolyte based, miniaturized electrochemical CO2 sensor that can continuously, accurately and rapidly monitor CO2 for monitoring and control approaches of plant-production environments, to aid in NASA's biomass (edible food) production research. The proposed sensor will introduce a much simpler, lower cost and more accurate alternative to the existing infrared CO2 measurement technology to measure CO2 and study its effects on plant growth. During Phase I, in addition to concept feasibility demonstration, the ability of the proposed sensor to detect (0 - 10) % CO2 in a wide temperature (15 ? 45)degrees C, and humidity (10 ? 99) % RH was demonstrated. In Phase II the sensor will be integrated into a complete instrument and will undergo extensive testing for accuracy, specificity, longevity and statistical comparison to existing technology. The instrument will be small, lightweight and will allow for independent operation of the sensor complete with calibration routine, adjustable applied potential settings and digital display of numeric results. The unit will be battery operated with an AC converter and battery re-charger.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		There are substantial commercial applications and markets, beyond the NASA application, for a high performance, low cost CO2 sensor.   Indoor air quality control systems is a major market discussed in the Phase II commercialization plan.  Other applications include measurement and control of CO2 in: agricultural applications such as greenhouses and controlled atmosphere storage of produce and flowers, medical applications such as expired and transdermal CO2, food and beverage industry for long shelf life packing of foods and improved quality and taste of brewed alcoholic and carbonated beverages.

		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The proposed solid electrolyte electrochemical CO2 sensor would have applications in NASA's ground and space based fundamental biology research programs to study effects of CO2 concentration on biomass (edible food) production and plant growth. The sensor could be configured for closed or nearly closed plant growth chambers or plant culture bioreactors to accurately and continuously measure and control CO2 concentrations in the range of (0 ? 10)%.

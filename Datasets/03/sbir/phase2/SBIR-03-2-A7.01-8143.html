<p><strong>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</strong><BR>
  The purpose of the project is   the development of a computational package for bifurcation analysis and advanced   flight control of aircraft. The development of relevant analytical and   simulation-based technologies for the prediction and control for fail-safe   adaptivity under adverse and upset conditions is an important step in advancing   flight safety goals. Impaired aircraft operate much closer to bifurcation points   than a fully functional vehicle. Thus, it is necessary to be able to evaluate   aircraft and flight control system performance near stability boundaries.   Understanding behavior near operational limits and developing control and   recovery strategies for these circumstances is fundamental to achieving that   goal. To that end TSi proposes an integrated set of computing tools involving   symbolic, numerical and visualization environments. In phase I, the architecture   was validated using a benchmark problem. Phase II proposes the extension of the   results from Phase I into a commercial package to be made available to the   analyst/designer of fault tolerant control algorithms.   
<p><strong>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</strong><BR>
  The   primary application area of the proposed work is to improve the safety and   performance of commercial and military aircraft. However the developed tools   based on modern nonlinear dynamical systems theory can be adapted to a broad   range of engineering systems where nonlinear phenomena is of interest including   other aerospace vehicles, ground and sea vehicles, hazardous chemical plants,   nuclear power plant, robotic manipulators and others. Additionally, the design   techniques will also provide a framework to conduct bifurcation analysis for   various systems in an integrated package. Although, the primary market for the   first commercial release of the software is in the aviation, the automobile   industry represents a lucrative market for the tools with little modification as   well.  
<p><strong>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</strong><BR>
  NASA   created the Aviation Safety Program to develop technologies focused on the   national goal of reducing the fatal aircraft accident rate by 80% by 2007. The   objective of the work is the development of a rigorous and practical framework   of bifurcation analysis and control design techniques to address fail safe   adaptation in adverse and upset conditions. The successful completion of the   project will deliver flight dynamic analysis, control design and visualization   tools in a single package significantly enhancing the ability of the engineer to   design fail safe and failure recovery systems for commercial aircraft.

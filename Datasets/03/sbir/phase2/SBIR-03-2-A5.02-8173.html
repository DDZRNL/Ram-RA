		<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Seldon Laboratories, LLC, proposes a lightweight, low-pressure water purification device that harnesses the unique properties of carbon nanotubes and will operate for an extended period of time to remove microorganisms from large quantities of water. Seldon's proprietary production process results in a membrane composed largely of carbon nanotubes fused to one another. This project will build on the successful results of the Phase I testing to treat higher volumes of water by creating larger membranes and housings suitable for use in spacecraft. The very low pressure requirements will significantly reduce energy and other input requirements. The device will be sufficiently versatile so as to be incorporated into existing systems or used as a standalone system for water treatment.

		<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		Immediate applications for the device include industrial water purification systems such as where purified water is integral to the product (e.g., bottlers) or process (e.g., semiconductor manufacturers). Other applications include the household where it can be used in both point-of-entry and point-of-use systems. Finally, it will also be beneficial to municipal water treatment systems that are increasingly looking for alternatives to the health and safety risks of chemical disinfection.
		<P>
		<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
		The innovation should significantly reduce the power requirements of closed loop water treatment systems for spacecraft and eliminate the need for hazardous chemical treatments. It may also be used to treat fluids other than water on spacecraft. For ground-based applications, it can be used to replace or enhance exisiting drinking water purification systems and purification systems used for industrial processes or decontamination.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Makel Engineering Incorporated (MEI) and Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) propose to develop a MEMS based, minature solid state sulfur oxide sensor for use in emission measurements.  The result of this effort will be a compact, robust means of SOx monitoring in high temperature gas emission streams has not been developed previously.  The proposed system is based on previous research on advanced micro-machined gas detection sensors developed for sensitivity to other gaseous components (e.g. CO2, O2, NOx).

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed sensor will provide improved emission monitoring capability with a small, low power, robust sensor system.  This will enable a cost effective method to instrument ground test facilities and vehicles and has the potential to be integrated into vehicle exhaust systems.  Additionally, health monitoring of personnel on the ground and in the crew cabin can be improved with the ability to monitor SOx compounds.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed SOx sensor has direct applications in monitoring large diesel IC engines, gas turbines, refineries, and power plants which must reduce their levels of sulfur emissions.  The potential to integrate these sensors in multiple locations and their low power requirements and small size make them very attractive for these monitoring activities.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Tai-Yang Research of Delaware proposes to design and fabricate an HTS double-pancake coil in support of the VASIMR experiment. The proposed HTS coil will implement novel CVD diamond technology for a lighter system weight with greater thermal uniformity and stability. CVD diamond technology in combination with HTS magnets offer significant advantages over traditional technology in terms of system reliability.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
HTS magnets have commercial applications potential within NASA anywhere superconducting magnets are implemented. Exsamples of applications include plasma propulsions, adiabatic demagnetization experiments, etc.
<br>
<br>CVD diamond technology has applications anywhere high strength, high thermal conductivity, and low density are required.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
HTS magnets have several non-NASA commercial applications including: 1) motors and generators, 2) transformers, 3) cables, 4) magnetic separation, 5) fault-current-limiters, etc.
<br>
<br>CVD diamond technology has applications anywhere high strength, high thermal conductivity, and low density are required.

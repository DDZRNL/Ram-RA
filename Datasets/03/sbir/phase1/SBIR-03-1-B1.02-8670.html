<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Crucibles comprised of an internal ceramic liner in direct contact with a metal reinforcement are desired to maximize heat transfer between the sample and the furnace for materials processing experiments in microgravity.  Previous work by Plasma Processes Inc. has demonstrated forming techniques to provide reinforced crucibles that survive quenching and produce samples with enhanced microstructural features compared to samples processed in conventional ampoule/cartridge assemblies.  However, incorporation of thermocouples has been limited to either inside the crucible cavity or on the external surface of the metal reinforcement.  The science requirements of several NASA principle investigators prevent the placement of thermocouples in these locations.  In addition, a failure detection technique based on the use of krypton gas is required on some microgravity furnaces.  Therefore, ?smart? crucibles are needed that incorporate thermocouple grooves and a reservoir for krypton gas storage within the crucible wall.  Because of intimate contact between all the layers of the ?smart? crucible, optimum heat transfer rates are maintained.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Safer, thermally enhanced containment cartridges for processing materials science experiments on earth and in microgravity will be developed.  In addition, the fabrication techniques developed will enable the production of smart components containing internal features and sensors for other commercial NASA applications such as rocket nozzles, high temperature furnace components, thermal and radiation shielding, nuclear and power generation components, and thermal stir weld tools.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Electronics and microchip manufacturing, high temperature furnace and retort components, rocket motor throat inserts, radiation shields, heat pipes, power generation equipment, nuclear components, beam and sputter targets.

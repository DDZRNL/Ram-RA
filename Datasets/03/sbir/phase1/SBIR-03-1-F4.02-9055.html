<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) facilities require the development of reliable systems for the disinfection of microorganisms.  There are several disinfectants that have been used, or proposed for use in CELSS facilities, including hypochlorite, iodine, ozone, silver, and quaternary ammonium compounds.  All of these compounds suffer from at least one of several major drawbacks:  (1) they are replaceable items and must be replaced after consumption; (2) in situ generation of the compound creates a safety concern; (3) in situ generation is not yet technically feasible; (4) in situ generation is incompatible with CELSS equipment infrastructure.  Additionally, many of these compounds have been linked to crew health problems after extended flight periods.  Substitution of these conventional biocides with a safe, antimicrobial compound for which in situ generation is safe and possible is urgently needed for crew safety, maintaining process equipment, and solid waste sanitation.  The aim of this project is to develop an on-demand electrochemical hydrogen peroxide generator that can be operated in microgravity from electrolysis of water with no consumable chemicals.  Hydrogen peroxide also has the potential to be regenerative within the overall system as it breaks down into water and oxygen during the sanitizing process.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
 Hydrogen peroxide offers a wide variety of performance and logistical advantages for space missions due to its ability to disinfect either in liquid or vapor phase. It can be used to control biofilms from aqueous environments, such as found in hydroponic systems along with fluid handling components and measuring equipment. It can also be used to sanitize and deodorize stored dry solid waste, function as a general purpose disinfectant, and produce potable water. Other uses include food sanitation, disinfection of fresh produce, periodical cleaning of hydroponic systems and sanitizing surfaces.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed electrochemical device for generation of a disinfectant can be easily modified without the gas/liquid separator designed for space, to suit a variety of ground based applications. Hydrogen peroxide is a versatile disinfectant, and electrochemical generators are easily scaled up or down. Miniature devices will find applications in household devices to be fitted to refrigerators or all-in-one mop systems; larger point-of-use devices can produce high quality potable water. The use of the on-demand disinfectant generator will find applications in cafeterias and hospitals where disinfection of hands of workers is essential to avoid disease transmission.

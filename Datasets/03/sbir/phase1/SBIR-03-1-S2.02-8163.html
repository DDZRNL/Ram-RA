<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This research is aimed at producing lightweight, lowcost solar modules to power NASA?s terrestrial balloons.  The innovation is to utilize thin dendritic web silicon solar cells, produced exclusively by Solar Power Solutions, as the basis for these modules.  At 100 mm thickness, dendritic web silicon crystals are the thinnest in commercial production today.  Solar cells produced from these crystals have a specific power of 580 W/kg (AM0, 1350 W/m2, 25?C).  Modules currently produced from these cells have a thickness of 0.65 mm and a specific power of 175 W/kg.  A further innovation is to reduce the silicon thickness from 100 mm to 70 mm  to increase the cell specific power to 770 W/kg, and to reduce the module thickness from 0.65 mm to 0.30 mm by using silicone films as adhesive layers.  This gives a module specific power of 300 W/kg.  Achieving such a high specific power is important for NASA terrestrial balloons, especially given the expected module price of only $10/W.  To evaluate durability, modules will be subjected to extremes of temperature, humidity, and vibration, then retested.  A complete system for supplying 2 kW continuously will be designed, and a scaled?down version (100 W) will be constructed and tested.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This project is aimed at producing a power system to supply 2 kW continuously for NASA stratospheric long duration balloons.  Approximately 8 kW of high specific power solar modules are needed for each 2 kW system (assuming the equivalent of full sunlight is available for one quarter of the day, while the system must produce power 24 hours a day).  At a price of $10/W, these modules would cost $80,000 for each system.  Additional potential NASA applications could include power for LEO satellites, stratospheric airships, and high altitude solar powered airplanes. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are a variety of non-NASA commercial applications for thin, high specific power solar modules.  Examples include modules mounted on the top of refrigeration trucks to power the refrigeration unit, modules mounted on the roofs of cars to power cooling fans inside the cars, and building integrated solar modules which require the conformability to curved surfaces. In addition, light weight modules may be used for commercial airship based telemetry and portable power for the military. The commercial potential of these non-NASA systems is estimated to be at least 500 kW/year, equivalent to sales of $5,000,000/year at $10/W.

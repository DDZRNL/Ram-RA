<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) technology holds great promise for power and propulsion demands of NASA current and future deep space explorations. Closed Brayton Cycle (CBC) space power system is one of the most efficient energy conversion  technologies for nuclear electric propulsion. There are three heat exchanges in CBC and the recuperator is very important to enhancing CBC efficiency. An advanced light weight recuperator is proposed for reducing mass of the State-of-Art (SOA) metallic recuperator in CBC while improving its performance by using advanced materials. The feasibility of the proposed recuperator will be demonstrated and key technical issues will be investigated during Phase I. Three concept designs of heat exchanger cores will be developed and prototyped. Their performance will be determined. Based on experimental data, a sub-scale recuperator for CBC will be outlined preliminarily. The proposed recuperator is anticipated to offer significant mass saving in comparison with the metallic recuperator.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The prime application of the proposed light weight high performance heat exchanger is for a Brayton cycle related power conversion system currently being proposed for deep space explorations. In addition, the proposed concepts and related technologies may also be used for space and aerospace environmental control, thermal management, power electronics cooling and many others. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed light weight high performance heat exchanger technology offers high commercial potentials in many non-NASA applications. It is particularly attractive for primary heat exchangers of aircraft including both civil and military aerospace vehicles. In addition, the proposed concept may also be used in thermal management of military ground vehicles, navy warships, sport cars, nuclear energy utilizations where weight is a main consideration as well as performance.

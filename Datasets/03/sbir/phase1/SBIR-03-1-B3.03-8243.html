<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Through recent manned spacecraft expeditions, it has become clear that there are significant hazardous features that affect the health and vitality of space crewmembers. To make extended manned space missions a practical reality, it is critical to monitor and to provide countermeasures for a variety of health threats. These monitoring and remediation systems must also fit the space environment, must be lightweight and unobtrusive, and must provide continuous monitoring, recording and reporting of crewmembers? vital signs. Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) proposes just such a system. It meets the critical need for a portable, unobtrusive sensing array system, in situations where ambulatory equipment is not available. This integrated system will facilitate important medical decisions, leading to improved crew health. The design uses advanced optical fiber sensing technologies to measure the electrical activity of the heart and arterial blood pressure, together with sophisticated digital data acquisition and real-time signal processing modules. The proposed integrated system can be used continuously without limiting the physical activity or dexterity of the crewmember. By the end of Phase II, IOS will produce a system prototype that will be capable of acquiring human ECG and blood pressure measurements using an array of optical sensors.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Manned space missions require prolonged stays of crewmembers. Increasingly complex outer space missions will require continuous monitoring of the flight crew?s vital signs. The unobtrusive nature of IOS?s sensor array system will make it easy for astronauts to wear, and will provide an opportunity for NASA to monitor cardio physiologic parameters of the spacecraft crew on a full-time basis.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed "wear-and-forget" system can monitor the health of aircraft pilots, dispatchers, and other mission critical personnel. It can be successfully utilized in military situations: the Army Objective Force, Future Combat Systems initiative; the US Navy monitoring of cardiovascular health in seamen on submarines, deep-water divers, and other situations where blood pressure levels depend on oxygen supply systems.  It can also be used in the prevention of sudden infant death syndrome, timely detection of arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, physiological stress, asthma, and other cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases; monitoring the health of nuclear plant operators, firefighters, and emergency personnel.

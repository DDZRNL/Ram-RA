<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
	International Electronic Machines (IEM) Corp., a leader in multisensor monitoring solutions, proposes the design (in Phase I) and creation (in Phase II) of the Reactive In-flight Multisensor Security System (RIMSS). RIMSS would be an extremely affordable (less than $5,000) system which would improve safety and security within an aircraft by detecting abnormal events (including but not limited to unusual passenger or crew activities, losses of pressure, deviations from flight plan, movement or fire in cargo areas, and so on), automatically alerting the crew to these events, and recording the entire event. This will be accomplished through the combination of proprietary and innovative imaging hardware, acoustic monitoring, IEM?s unique and proprietary event and object detection, tracking, and identification software. RIMSS would continue to function even in the event of power loss through a unique backup system, and would be able to transmit data securely to designated ground stations. The imaging portion of the system will work in all lighting conditions and the entire system will be rugged and able to endure for many years of reliable service. RIMSS is made possible through IEM?s extensive experience in all relevant fields, including imaging, 360? vision systems, acoustic /visual target detection, and many others.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The RIMSS system and its components offer significant opportunity in the field of air safety and security (military and commercial aircraft). They can assist in the detection and/or prevention of violent behavior by passengers (terrorist or air-rage), early warning of situations such as shifting cargo or fires in cargo areas, and with the audio subsystem's signal recognition and beamforming capabilities offers significant ability to localize sounds which signal mechanical anomalies.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Similar applications of security and safety exist in other transportation areas -- maritime (cruise ships, military vessels), railroads (passenger and possibly freight), etc. Spinoffs or adaptations of the specific elements of RIMSS, such as the neural-network based behavior recognition and IEM?s AED algorithm, have wider applicability in any security or surveillance monitoring application, yielding a considerable market opportunity amongst the over 300,000 local, state, and federal personnel authorized to make arrests and the organizations to which these personnel belong, and another in static security arenas -- military bases, shopping centers, commercial installations, etc.

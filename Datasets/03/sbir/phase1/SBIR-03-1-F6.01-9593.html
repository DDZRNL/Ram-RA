<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
CITTP provides an intelligent tutor system (ITS) framework for individuals to rehearsing their team tasks using computer based high-fidelity simulations. CITTP is used as a complement and a cost effective means to make join team integration more effective. CITTP concentrates in defining three key elements that a team ITS must have: (i) authoring tools to define training scenarios; (ii) intelligent simulated entities that play team members roles in these scenarios; and (iii) natural language understanding capabilities that allow simulated team members to react intelligently to the trainee communications. CITTP will allow instructors to create operational scenarios and to customize methods to automatically evaluate trainee decisions. CITTP will monitor student's actions in order to provide feedback identifying the concepts where the student has demonstrated either a satisfactory proficiency or a need for remediation. CITTP will also formulate a remedial course of instruction tailored to the student needs. In phase I we will identify the modeling techniques and the natural language capabilities needed to create effective intelligent simulated team members.  We will also develop a limited prototype of CITTP to demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness. In phase II we will deploy CITTP for the NASA domain and team identified during phase I.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA will greatly benefit from CITTP by providing team members the possibility of rehearsing their tasks before and after joint integration simulations. Mission operations that would benefit include scientific data gathering; payload operation integration center; problem resolution in the spacecraft, base, and science gathering operations; preventive maintenance and housekeeping activities; and mission planning.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Teams are ubiquitous in workplaces. Besides being useful for training NASA mission crew, CITTP can also be used by commercial and government organizations to train their employees in teamwork. CITTP can be used by organizations such as hospitals, the airline industry, the military, and other organizations where effective teamwork is critical.

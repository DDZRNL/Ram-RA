<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
It is proposed to create a rugged, reliable, compact, standardized imaging system for hypervelocity and re-entry vehicles using sapphire windows, small imagers, and independent telemetry.  Such a system is a novel creation that can tolerate the severe aerothermal environment associated with hypervelocity flight.  The proposed system answers a critical need for enhanced situation awareness, performance characterization, and rapid anomaly resolution.  Images of control surfaces, vehicle health, separation deployment, plume dynamics, combustion behavior, and many other vehicle properties provide a rapid, global assessment of the flows and control status of aerospace vehicles and propulsion systems using a standardized diagnostic package.  The system design includes a window, window mounting system, camera, and independent telemetry system.  Work in Phase 1 will include computational aerothermal modeling, window, mount, camera, and telemetry design, preliminary hazards analysis, and feasibility/ applications assessment.  A Phase 2 prototype will be designed and fabricated for testing at a NASA facility, and finally used on a variety of vehicles in Phase 3.  It is expected that the imaging system will have broad application for NASA, DOD, and commercial aerospace vehicles.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
An on-board imaging system would allow direct and global monitoring of many parameters that determine the critical capabilities of many NASA vehicles.  Capabilities include: bow shock visualization, leading edge condition, thermal surface mapping, body surfaces degradation, control surface actuation, shock/surface interaction, engine inlet flow monitoring, engine component/combustion monitoring, plume phenomenology, separation events, and situational awareness.   NASA vehicles needing the system include: X-43A, X-43C, ISTAR, HYFLY, FAAST, FALCON, X-37, OSP, AAS, Aero-Assisted OTV<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>

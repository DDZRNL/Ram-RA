<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Many future advances in NASAys ability to perform cutting edge space science will require improvements in cryogenic system technology, including the development of light-weight, low vibration, highly-efficient, long-life cryocoolers. One such cooler, currently under development, is the pulse-tube/reverse-Brayton (PT/RB) hybrid cooler. Of critical importance to success of the PT/RB is the development of the small-scale turbine required for the reverse-Brayton stage. We propose to build such a turbine for inclusion in a brassboard PT/RB soon to be constructed under a separate contract. The turbine will incorporate pressurized bearings that generate a supporting force by applying a high-pressure source of gas to a flow restriction that exhausts into the bearing clearance and onto the turbine shaft surface. Pressurized bearings provide support even in the absence of shaft rotation and therefore eliminate rubbing contact and increase the life and reliability of the bearing. Also, because pressurized bearings do not directly depend on viscous action for operation, relatively larger clearances can be used without significantly sacrificing rotordynamic performance at low temperatures, thus making them cost effective.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed turbine with pressurized bearings will make the pulse-tube/reverse-Brayton cryocooler currently under development by Atlas Scientific possible. This low vibration, highly-efficient, long-life cooler will be capable of providing cooling at temperatures below 10 K. The development of such coolers is critical to taking advantage of future advances in detector, telescope, and instrument technology. The same technology may form the basis for higher temperature or higher capacity applications, such as liquefiers or zero-boiloff dewars.  In addition, miniature turbine-based devices are relevant to applications such as Brayton cycle power sources for future space missions.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A potentially large non-NASA market for the PT/RB cooler also exists. One possible application involves cooling low temperature superconducting electronics such as those being developed for DoDys Joint Tactical Radio Systems (JRTS). According to Dr. Elie Track of Hypres, this application alone could require as many as 100,000 units of the proposed cooler. Further, the potential commercial market for these systems may eventually be as high as 120,000 units per year. In addition, there are potentially large markets for economical cryocoolers in both the semiconductor and communications industries.

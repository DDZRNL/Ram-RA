<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A new servo-drive technology is available to support energy storage and navigation for micro-satellites.  Exploiting the ?pinning? effect of high-temperature superconductors, high-speed momentum wheels can be suspended in a stable condition that is virtually independent of speed (unlike magnetic levitation).  Aside from the motor drive, this levitation system is compact and highly energy efficient.  To be effective it requires a drive that is equally compact and energy efficient.  It also requires extremely high servo performance with especially low torque ripple.  Barrett proposes an innovation to support such a compact/efficient drive amplifier.  Phase I will focus on feasibility of this approach and Phase II will support prototype design and aggressive space qualification of this unit.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This SBIR will result in servo-amplifier electronics and control intelligence that efficiently and reliably drive high-temperature-superconductor-levitated momentum wheels on micro- and nano-satellites.  Today?s off-the-shelf electronics are an order of magnitude more bulky.  They are also more power hungry, more expensive, and less robust than the proposed amplifiers.  Combined with high-temperature-superconductor levitation, these systems are expected to endure 10^5 deep-discharge cycles.  Where radiation panels can be used in place of cryocoolers, the lifetime is anticipated to exceed 30 years.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In satellite power-systems and attitude-control support, these electronics will help enable a proliferation of ever-smaller orbital satellites for a widening array of commercial aerospace applications.  Barrett expects to collaborate with large companies such as Honeywell, Boeing, and GE in support of this key component technology.
<br>
<br>Preparation for space qualification will further the hardening of Barrett?s servo amplifiers for niche terrestrial applications as well.  Radiation hardening and design for temperature extremes will enable these electronics to be used in telerobotic slaves for nuclear-remediation activities as well as in robots that can be deployed robustly in homeland-security search-and-rescue missions.

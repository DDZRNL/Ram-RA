<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
New lithium battery electrolytes must be developed if these they are to be successfully deployed on NASA Platforms operating at -100oC to +100oC.  Giner, Inc. has proposed an approach to preparing lithium ion conducting electrolytes which will provide cell current densities sufficient to carry the microwatt to milliwatt levels required for Low Earth Orbital Applications.  Phase I will examine the low temperature phase behavior of the new electrolytes, ionic conductivity and chemical electrochemical stability in primary and secondary lithium cell environments, with exposures of up to +100oC in order to assess the likelihood of long cycle-life performance.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
 
<br>The proposed low temperature stable lithium ion electrolyte will make possible the use of lithium ion rechargeable and potentially lithium metal primary batteries in NASA applications at sustained low temperatures.  These will include micro to milliwatt power for LEO microspacecraft.  The high specific energy and energy density and reliability of these cells will permit long unattended platform operating times (long cycle life) and thus reduce the frequency of replacement or shuttle-based maintenance.
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Low temperature performance afforded by the proposed lithium ion conducting electrolytes, together with the high specific energy and energy density of lithium and lithium ion cells will make them more attractive for use in outdoor portable consumer devices.  These include cell phones, laptop computers, PDAs and recreational camping and hunting equipment which the consumer is likely to use outdoors in winter.  Additional commercial applications include power supplies for remote industrial, transportation and communication beacons, sensors and transmitters in cold weather climates; and portable equipment used for polar exploration.

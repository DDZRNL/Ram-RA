<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an innovative solar cell design that combines nanotechnology with conducting polymer photovoltaics to achieve extremely low weight, flexible solar cells of almost any size and shape that far surpass current solar cell efficiencies. This proposal demonstrates the potential of this design for increased efficiency and low weight by prototyping single-layer solar cells (compatible with future tandem-cell architecture) with spectral responses tuned to the solar spectrum.  The project develops approaches to explore the four main technical areas that are currently limiting nanocomposite photovoltaic cell performance: illumination intensity saturation, conduction efficiency, charge-separation efficiency and dispersion control of nanomaterials in a host matrix at high concentration.  In Phase I, these technical areas are explored to determine the magnitude of potential performance improvements that can be achieved by optimizing these parameters in Phase II, and compare these projections to the maximum performance predicted by theory.  In Phase II, the information gathered in Phase I will be used to produce a prototype of an optimized, lightweight, low-cost, flexible solar cell with efficiency greater than 15%; amenable to large-scale, low-temperature manufacturing and eventual transition to tandem-cell designs for efficiency > 30%.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Space applications exist for solar cells with high power-to-mass and power-to-volume ratios that can provide a primary power generation source.  This technology has the potential to provide higher efficiency at 100x lower mass than today?s state-of-the-art tandem solar cells.  In addition, the inherent flexible nature of these cells could provide dramatically reduced launch-volume over current solar arrays by being rolled up for launch and storage, further reducing the overall launch costs and increasing available payload space.  Specific examples of use in earth science observation missions include satellite spacecraft, surface and ground testing assets, manned and unmanned aircraft, and land-based vehicles.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercial applications exist for high performance, low-cost solar cells that can provide an alternative power generation source.  Specific examples of use include on-grid building integrated electricity generation systems; on-grid wholesale power generation; remote off-grid power generation; and portable power generation.  While terrestrial application do not require the same level of efficiency as satellite-based applications, this has historically only been a matter of cost.  The proposed technology has the potential to provide efficiencies 3x higher than typical terrestrial cells, at 5-10x lower cost; this has the potential to change the entire landscape of commercial solar power relative to traditional fossil fuels.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
OPTRA proposes to develop an optical tracking system that is capable of recognizing and tracking up to 50 different objects within an approximately 2 degree x 3 degree field of view. The system output will be 3-dimensional trajectories for each of the objects. The primary function of the system is to monitor the first 2 minutes of a space vehicle launch; following any catastrophic event at launch this system will provide a wealth of detailed information that can be used both in real time, and in subsequent accident analyses. The proposed system consists of three high-resolution digital cameras with telephoto lenses mounted on GPS-equipped servo-controlled ALT/AZ platforms. The system hardware will consist largely of commercially available off-the-shelf components, resulting in proven performance, high reliability, and low cost. A key element in the proposed effort will be the development of robust target identification and tracking algorithms, as well as the algorithms needed to convert the 3 separate 2D trajectory sets to a single 3D trajectory set

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The immediate NASA application is for use in monitoring spacecraft launches. The system will augment radar tracking systems and will provide greatly improved spatial resolution combined with versatility and economy. The same systems may also find applications in monitoring NASA test flights of conventional aircraft.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Non-NASA applications include monitoring of weapons testing by the DoD, monitoring of aircraft test flights by both the DoD and by commercial aircraft manufacturers, and general surveillance both by Federal agencies, and non-Government customers. With minor modifications, the software can be made capable of recognizing and tracking individuals in a scene

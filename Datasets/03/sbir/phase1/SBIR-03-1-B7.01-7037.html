<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The VirexLab, the centerpiece of this Tietronix proposal offers significant innovation to NASA and to the Marshall Space Flight Center, implementing the Biological and Physical Research Enterprise education and outreach activities. VirexLab will be a collection of rich immersive settings with both hands-on and virtual components. These settings will focus on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning objectives. The objectives will integrate learning across the boundaries of subject matter, platform (setting), and institution yielding intellectual merit rarely seen in a single learning tool, an innovation in OBPR?s educational excellence. Tietronix proposes to develop a Virtual Reality (VR) educational system that can be used in multiple formats such as multimedia CD-ROMs, kiosks for museum settings, VR stations, and web sites that can be accessed from anywhere in the world. The VR lab would allow the students to experiment with devices as if in the microgravity of space or Earth gravity. The significance of our proposed innovations is that learners, both students and adult life-long learners, will participate in hands-on, immersive environments to experience NASA?s missions and discoveries.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The potential applications cross all six NASA Enterprises. The activities, the process to develop the activities, and the audiences apply to each enterprise. This collection of rich immersive settings with both hands-on and virtual components will serve OBPR, Space Science, Aerospace Technology, and other NASA Enterprises to focus on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning objectives. This Tietronix-generated virtual reality tool will use modeling, simulation, and computer graphics to help learners understand why NASA works at developing technologies to enable the next explorers to go beyond where we have been, while assuring the survival of humans traveling far beyond Earth. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The VirexLab will be marketable to museums, libraries, school districts, anywhere a kiosk can be placed. The potential for students and the general public to learn about space related science is vast. Many federal buildings such as airports, court houses, and legislative buildings would allow for a kiosk for visitors to use. The tool will be structured such that multiple venues could use the software to educate and entertain. As NASA continues its research, the software can be easily updated.

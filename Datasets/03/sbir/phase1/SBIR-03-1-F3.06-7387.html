<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
RTI will design and optimize an 80 W, 77K cryocooler based on the reverse turbo Brayton cycle (RTBC) with four identical coldheads for distributed cooling. Based on preliminary analysis, the single centrifugal compressor with integrated motor will be 10 cm in diameter and 15 cm in length, and rotate at about 100,000 rpm. Each coldhead (consisting of a recuperative heat exchanger, turbo-expander and cold side heat exchanger) is expected to be about 6X6X15 cm in linear dimensions, and weighs about 0.2 kg. Key technical innovations are superior aerodynamics for a compact, reliable and efficient compressor, distributed RTBC cryocooling with a single compressor, and techniques to drastically minimize performance-degrading axial conduction in recuperative heat exchangers. Microfabrication is a key enabler for implementation of this concept. Phase I will involve system design, and design and fabrication of the compressor. The Phase II goal is to integrate the compressor with motor, electronics and gas foil bearings with a target isentropic efficiency of 80% at a pressure ratio of 1.75. It is expected that the coefficient of performance of the overall RTBC system when completed would be at least 0.12, with the minimum and maximum cycle temperature being 64 K and 440 K respectively.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The project will develop a highly reliable, compact, light-weight, efficient and flexible cryocooling system with significant improvements in performance compared to the current state-of-the-art. The proposed design will also allow distributed cooling with multiple coldheads. This cryocooler is expected to find niche applications in propellant storage, transport and handling. In specific, distributed cooling feature will greatly enhance applications related to ZBO (zero boil off) control, propellant densification, transfer line / storage tank prechilling. With no dependence on gravity, or lack thereof, the proposed system can perform equally well in space and on ground.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Since commercial and military satellites require cryogens and propellants as well, all of the benefits that the proposed system can offer to NASA applications are also applicable to those non-NASA applications. Further applications include distributed sensor cooling of large military and commercial space systems, cryocooling needed for medical process and equipment such as cryo-surgery and MRI, cooling of superconducting electronics for telecommunication. Compact and light design of the propose system can enable desk-top MRI machines, thus allowing wider access. Superconducting electronics would allow wider range and much improved signal quality for wireless communication devices and cell towers.

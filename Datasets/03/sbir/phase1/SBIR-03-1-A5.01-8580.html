<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Faced with ever-increasing projections of air traffic, NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have been developing advanced technologies to increase traffic-handling capacity at existing airports.  Efforts to increase airport capacity approach the problem on two fronts: the first is to increase the number of runways (i.e. more usable space), and the second is to develop new technologies to achieve reduction in aircraft separation and consequently increase in landing rate per runway (i.e. higher density). Although increasing usable runways is ultimately inevitable, doing so often imposes new technical problems that compromise efficiency and safety.  Modifying an existing airport layout increases surface traffic complexity with a higher level of aircraft and surface vehicle traffic, resulting in increased occurrences of runway crossing.  A previous NASA-funded research addresses the air traffic control needs for ground-control operations with the development of a Ground-Operation Situation Awareness and Flow Efficiency (GO-SAFE) system.  A new Surface Operation Automation Research (SOAR) project explores the concept of collaborative automation between the GO-SAFE system and a Flight-deck Automation for Reliable Ground Operation (FARGO) system. The currently proposed effort will advance the interface technology to help the flight crew achieve the precise taxi control envisioned for the FARGO system.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The technologies to be developed under this SBIR are applicable to NASA?s Aviation Capacity Program and Aviation Safety and Security Program, to contribute to their goals of improving air traffic efficiency and safety.  In particular, the pilot interface technologies are useful for realizing the SOAR concept, which is being developed under support from the VAMS project.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Like most of the products developed under the NASA Aviation Capacity Program and Aviation Safety and Security Program, the technologies sought by this SBIR proposal are targeted for civil aviation.  As the global travel requirements increase and the major airports execute their plans to increase capacity through expansion, efficient taxi operations and runway crossings are quickly becoming major issues at these airports.  The technologies to be developed under this SBIR can be adopted by the avionics manufacturers in conjunction with other technologies currently under development by the NASA programs.

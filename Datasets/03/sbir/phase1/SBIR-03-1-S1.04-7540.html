<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The current push to develop small satellites, referred to as microsatellites (<100 kg) and nanosatellites (<10 kg), has resulted in the need to miniaturize several key technologies, including the propulsion system. Trade studies have been performed for these small satellites, and optimization of the propulsion system with respect to mass shows that cold-gas systems will result in the lowest overall system mass despite their low specific impulse. One way to improve the overall performance of a cold-gas propulsion system without suffering a weight penalty is to use Tridyney instead of helium or nitrogen cold gas. Tridyne, a non-explosive mixture of nitrogen (or helium), hydrogen, and oxygen, offers a 20-28% increase in specific impulse over nitrogen. The limitation of Tridyne for small satellites is that the particle size of commonly used granular catalysts is unsuitably large for use in a micronewton thruster. Coarse particles will result in propellant channeling with little reaction taking place, and a loss of performance. In this project, Ultramet proposes to build upon its experience with monolithic catalyst beds and develop a small, low pressure drop, monolithic catalyst bed optimized for use with Tridyne.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed technology can be used by any small spacecraft where, due to its low mass, the total required impulse over the life of the mission is small. This includes both Earth-orbiting satellites and planetary flyby spacecraft, as well as Sun-Earth Connection (SEC) missions.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed technology would offer significant mass advantages to any spacecraft where the total required impulse over the mission duration is less than about 1000 lbf s. Such satellites are being baselined for missions where numerous small satellites offer significant advantages over a single, large satellite. In terms of overall system/network reliability, the distributed nature of a constellation of microsatellites is a significant advantage.

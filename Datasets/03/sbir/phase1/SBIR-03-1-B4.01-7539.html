<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovation will utilize self learning neural network technology to determine the structure of osteoporosis, immune system disease, and excess radiation DNA damage target proteins that will facilitate drug development to enhance crew health in long term space flight missions. This system is innovative because: 1) the proprietary neural networks will provide a unique understanding of the often non-linear crystallization process of the targets; 2) the system will objectively utilize the osmotic second virial coefficient to identify optimal screen components; 3) a commercial predictive database will be developed that may eliminate the need for initial crystallization screening and increase the rate of structure determination thus offering tremendous commercial potential as a fee based service.  This dual use innovation is applicable to subtopic B4.01 Space Commercialization because this approach will focus on the development of osteoporosis, immune system disease, and excess radiation DNA repair targets which will improve crew health on long term space missions and will provide an earth-based commercial service to drug discovery entities.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
We anticipate that drug discovery entities including pharmaceutical, biotech companies, and academic institutions will subscribe to the proposed fee-based service.  The focus of the service will be to expedite the drug discovery process by increasing the rate of protein structure determination through revolutionary neural network technologies and intellectual expertise.  The development of the neural network prediction database in the Phase I and Phase 2 grants will allow us to reduce the time to market required in structure based drug design and increase the rate of structure determination that will lead to better drugs for all mankind.

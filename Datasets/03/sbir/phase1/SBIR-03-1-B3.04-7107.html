<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal addresses the need for food processing equipment for crews on long-term Advanced Life Support Systems (ALSS) missions. It is proposed to design a food extruder that will efficiently process wheat and rice flour into breakfast-cereal-type food. In addition, the design will incorporate an oil extraction system for peanuts, and a milling/grinding system for wheat, rice, soybean and peanuts. The design of this food processing system will rely on the use of a single lightweight motor, with interchangeable attachments to do the extrusion, oil extraction, and milling/grinding. This work will merge the extruder-building expertise of Wayne Machine & Die Co. with the food processing expertise of Rutgers University's Food Science team to produce a unique and versatile food processor design for the planetary surface missions. The deliverable of this project will be a complete engineering design of a food processing system, including AutoCAD drawings from which the hardware could be manufactured in a Phase II contract.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
It is proposed to design food processing equipment that could be used in a long duration space mission. The equipment will take the form of a versatile food extruder that will produce cooked food products from rice, wheat, potatoes, soybeans, etc. In addition, the equipment will be adapted to press oil out of peanuts and mill grain.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The major advantages including lightweight, modular construction, the ability to function as an oil expeller, miller/grinder and extruder are a unique combination of product attributes that demonstrate a unique selling proposition. First, the Versatile Extruder (VE) will be marketed to food research and development laboratories located in academic, government and business settings. Presently, these laboratories need several machines to perform all the tasks that the VE can accomplish in one machine, saving space, utility connections and ensuring cross-compatibility among functions. Second, food service establishments, home users and on-site testing agencies like the USDA will be targeted with a light-duty, low cost model VE which will feature robust plastic components, opening new avenues of cost effective micro-extrusion, milling, grinding and oil expulsion. Third, Wayne will develop a complete line of universally capable laboratory, pilot plant and production scale line of food extruders using technology based on the VE.

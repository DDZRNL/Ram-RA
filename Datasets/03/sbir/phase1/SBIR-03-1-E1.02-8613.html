<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
There is an important need for compact, light weight, short pulse laser sources for LIDAR applications. Recently, over 100 Watts of output power has been demonstrated from a glass fiber laser. Two advances have made this possible. These are the availability of high power diode lasers for pumping and the development of double cladding of the fibers. For several reasons it is possible to achieve significant improvements in these results by using single crystal fibers rather than glass fibers. Using the Laser-Heated Pedestal-Growth (LHPG) technique to grow single crystal fibers of Yb:YAG, we are proposing to develop a diode-pumped, double-clad fiber laser of Yb:YAG emitting at 1.03 microns and Q-switched using a new passive material.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Because the key benefits of the double clad single crystal fiber lasers are that much higher powers and efficiencies are possible in a compact lightweight package that can be easily cooled, this system can find applications in space, balloon borne systems, UAVs and aircraft systems. By wavelength shifting, many molecular species can be probed by LIDAR.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Because of the high efficiency of the proposed laser it will find military applications in such devices as LIDARs, designators, range finders, etc. They could find wide usage in medical systems where present systems are large, heavy and expensive. Areas such as micro-surgery, diagnostics using laser induced fluorescence by wavelength shifting and imaging by optical tomography. For a high power device many material processing applications come to mind.

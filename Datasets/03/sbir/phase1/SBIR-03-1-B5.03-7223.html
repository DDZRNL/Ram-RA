<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Nanobiotechnology is a rapidly advancing frontier of science with great potential for beneficial impact on society. However, successful design of these systems is an extremely complex, laborious task with large failure rates. Current models describing the molecular behavior are too slow (nanoseconds) and expensive while device design codes lack the necessary nanophysics. Our overall objective is to develop a generalized, multiscale, multiphysics CFD (continuum)-based design software where nanoscale effects of arbitrary biosystems are accurately, efficiently and seamlessly integrated with coarse-grained models carrying molecular information. To accomplish this task we propose a three-level modeling effort. First molecular calculations (Molecular Dynamics, Monte Carlo) are undertaken to elucidate the fundamental and essential molecular behavior. Next, stochastic simulation methods (Master, Fokker-Planck, or Langevin) will be seamlessly integrated with continuum approaches are developed to describe the mesoscale, fast time scale averaged behavior of these molecules.  Finally, the information from the stochastic models is coupled to the continuum CFD model. In Phase I, the feasibility of this approach will be developed and demonstrated in the context of nanopore based sequencing device.  The Phase II work will focus on model generalization, validation and improved usability (speed, robustness, GUI). The research is leveraged on substantial prior effort in the area.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA is launching a sustained Space Biology program focused on in-vivo health monitoring and therapy on the Earth and in space. Nanotechnology is poised to play a critical role in the achievement of this goal. It has been recognized that an essential need is the development of integrated methods to model analytical chemistry, of sensors physics, microfluidics, and most importantly biochemical molecular recognition methods on nanoscale devices/platform. The development of the proposed technology will accelerate the development of a wide class of nanobiotech devices in areas such as sequencing, sensing & detection, in-vivo diagnosis and drug delivery, repair of tissue/cell damage among others<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The market for research and development of integrated nanobiosystems is growing rapidly (estimated research amounts to over a billion dollars).  CFDRC develops and markets CFD-ACE+, the industry leading software for biomicrofluidic design.  With the addition of the multiscale modeling capability, CFD-ACE+ will be marketed for the design of microfluidic-based nanobiosystems.  It is currently licensed to pioneering academic researchers (MIT, UC Berkeley, UCLA, Stanford, Los Alamos etc.) as well as to the Bio-MEMS industry (Caliper, Aclara, Sequenom, Motorola Biochip, Applied Biosystems, Agilent, Honeywell, Micronics, etc.).  Endorsement letters from several companies engaged in this research (Nanoink, Integrated Naotechnologies) as well as the founder of a leading Nanotech Institute (NSTI) endorsing the value of this research are attached.

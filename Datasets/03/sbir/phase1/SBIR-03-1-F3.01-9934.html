<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A refrigeration cycle is proposed for development which can reduce compressor work and increase cooling effect, by eliminating a portion of the irreversabilities associated with the reverse-rankine cycle refrigeration process.  This process improves efficiency without the use of complex turbines, multi-stage architecures, or mechanical expanders, all of which add system complexity and reduce reliability.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This refrigeration cycle has the potential to improve refrigeration efficiency for space station and future planetary missions applications.  This technology has particular benefit in applications were elevating the heat rejection temperature to reduce radiator area is of interest.  Analysis has shown significant system mass savings for lunar base applications.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This technology has excellent potential for commercialization once developed into a practical system.  The best use will be for refrigeration application were the temperature difference between the evaporator and condenser are large, such as operating a freezer in a hot ambient.  Increases in efficiency on the order of 30% are expected.

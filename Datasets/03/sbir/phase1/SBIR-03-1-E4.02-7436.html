<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The system proposed in this effort will allow the handicapped individual with hand/arm motor impairment to use the computer and access digital libraries on the Internet and in internal networks in a more effective manner. Furthermore, the system allows full use of the actual keyboard and mouse so that terminals enabled with the proposed software are still useful for the general public. Because of supporting internal IR&D, in Phase I we will create a complete pre-production prototype and Cybernet will initially provide this system free of charge for download from NASA digital library sites (as a NASA public service to the profoundly handicapped).
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The goal of this project is to develop a web deployable software package that demonstrates the means for enabling the profoundly disabled access to digital technology including NASA digital libraries, computer applications, and the worldwide web.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed technology will be delivered to disabled users through the web free of charge after Phase I development.  This will be done through the project web site operated by Cybernet and through web links from relevant NASA digital library sites.  Arranging this will be done after a successful Phase I demonstration to NASA. It will then be used for other disabled personal aiding products.

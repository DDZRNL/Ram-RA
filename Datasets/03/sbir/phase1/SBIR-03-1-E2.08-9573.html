<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Many satellites, spacecraft, and radar antennas with spun and de-spun configurations require the transfer of power across rotating interfaces in lieu of slip rings and/or flexures.  This is particularly true for systems that have to demonstrate a long life expectancy.  The rotary transformer has desirable characteristics of high reliability and low noise, which qualify it as a viable replacement for slip rings.  The rotary transformer is essentially the same as a conventional transformer, except that the geometry is arranged so that the primary and secondary can be rotated with respect to each other with negligible changes in electrical characteristics.  The power transfer is enabled by magnetic coupling across an air gap.  There are not any wearing contacts, noise or contamination problems due to lubrication or wear debris.  The development of a rotary power transformer will use the same ?Quiet Converter? technology that was used on WF/PC-II, Articulated Fold, Mirror Actuators (Hubbell Space Telescope), MISR and Mars 05 Op-Nav Camera.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA can use this enhanced, rotary transformer technology in many ways.  This style of rotary transformer can replace slip rings, giving scientists a new tool that supplies power with a low EMI background noise.  The rotary transformer will not (a) handicap the system with unknown life, (b) leave a buildup of debris that causes unbalanced leakage currents, or (c) produce wiper contact noise that gets worse with time.  There are many applications for this kind of power:  spin-stabilized satellites and spacecraft, surface rovers, radar antennas, solar arrays, and science instruments.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are numerous commercial applications that require high reliability for power and signal to be transmitted through a rotary joint, which can use this technology.  Commercial applications for such a rotary transformer would be: shipboard radar and sonar in a salt air environment; remotely autonomous, solar- powered fire lookout stations and weather stations; airport radar antennas, operating in a continuous circular 360o, reconnaissance scanning; unmanned aerial vehicle; real-time combustion engine analysis; and real-time aircraft propeller analysis. All of these applications require signal and power across a rotating interface where service and downtime cannot be tolerated.

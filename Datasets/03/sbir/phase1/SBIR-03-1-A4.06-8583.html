<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A cylindrical, low-mass, high-efficiency, leak-proof cryogenic valve will be designed using composites and exotic metals.  Based upon cryogenically-proven Venturi Off-Set Technology (VOST) the valve has no stem-actuator, few moving parts, and an overall cylindrical shape.  The valve geometry will help reduce launch vehicle complexity and facilitate assembly and test.  Reliability and safety and will be enhanced due to the inherent simplicity and leak-proof design of the VOST valve.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Potential NASA uses include both launch vehicle and extraterrestrial use.  Ground-based applications will benefit from enhanced thermal performance which will reduce recurring costs.  Vehicle applications benefit from low-mass and compact, cylindrical geometry.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Non-NASA uses include military and civilian aircraft, chemically corrosive industrial environments, and medical applications.

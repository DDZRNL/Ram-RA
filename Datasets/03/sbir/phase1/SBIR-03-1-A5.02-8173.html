<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Seldon Laboratories, LLC, proposes a lightweight, low-pressure water filtration device that harnesses the unique properties of nanoparticles to destroy or remove waterborne pathogens. A 2-inch diameter version of the device is estimated to allow a flux rate of 100 ml/minute at less than 0.05 psi. The device is composed of a conductive material that should limit fouling and promote the efficient recharging of the membrane. The innovation represents a significant advancement in membrane technology as it offers superior filtration effects with significantly reduced operating costs. The device could be incorporated into existing systems or designed as a standalone system for water treatment. It is expected that Phase I would demonstrate of the feasibility (efficacy and cost considerations) of the system and Phase II would result in prototype development.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The innovation should significantly reduce the power requirements of closed loop water treatment systems for spacecraft and eliminate the need for hazardous chemical treatments. In a scaleable design, it could also be used as a point of use water treatment device to ensure the safety of the water as it is used for drinking or other purposes.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This innovation offers significant benefits to industrial and municipal users of water treatment technologies. By reducing or eliminating the use of power and chemicals, customers will realize significant savings in the operating costs of water treatment. The innovation could also be incorporated into household point of use water filtration devices to significantly improve their effectiveness on waterborne pathogens without sacrificing performance or requiring power.

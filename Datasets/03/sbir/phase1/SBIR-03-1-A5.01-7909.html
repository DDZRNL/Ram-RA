<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposed project aims to demonstrate the feasibility and utility of a data mining system designed to facilitate the interpretation of information obtained from distributed information sources. Each source providing data on high value data would be modeled as an information retrieval system. This approach is effective whenever several systems are available that are used by different groups to retrieve information from databases defined in the same information universe. 
<br>For purposes of insuring comparability and defining a shared information universe for investigative operations, a uniform resource identifier (UFI) will be used to filter the raw data. An independent retrieval system, defined on the distributed databases of UFIs, will be implemented for the sources. The collective results of these systems will be used to determine (in real-time) a norm for any given search. This norm will then be used to identify either high-profile or unusual activities that warrant further investigation.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In order to reduce the risks inherent in space flight, it is essential to provide tools that enable efficient visualization of human causal factors that could directly contribute to accidents.  The envisioned ?Anthony-Pro? will eventually assist in preventing mishaps through real-time identification of accident precursors prior to launch readiness review.  Mined data could be displayed graphically and could be used in automated identification of trends and enhance supervisory monitoring activities. Extracting human mishap data in order to eliminate future reoccurrence, will also further NASA and the FAA?s mission to increase the safety and capacity of the NAS.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Anthony-Pro is applicable to any aviation or space operation with high value information spread over disparate data sources.  This is especially true where there is a potential for loss of life or substantial economic value.  Providing enhanced visualization of the information (e.g. fault trees), with the ability to highlight the most important information that warrant attention or investigation would make it more desirable. An incomplete list of potential uses include aircraft manufacturing, simultaneously mining data from multiple automobiles "black boxes" by insurers, and management and maintenance of municipal bus, military motor pool, commercial (UPS, FedEX), and maritime fleets.

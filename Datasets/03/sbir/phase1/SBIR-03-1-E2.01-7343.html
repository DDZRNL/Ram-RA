<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
GMA Industries, Inc. proposes produce a lightweight, fully polymeric but intrinsically conducting hybrid material that can be applied towards the production of next-generation sealants, structures and components.  This will be achieved through the production of a single wall nanotube (SWNT)-containing matrix material, using wet chemistry processes and methods.  An ability to incorporate the significant electronic, mechanical, thermal properties, scattering- and optical-limiting properties of carbon nanotubes into a homogeneously dispersed covalently-bound structural matrix will provide a platform for the creation of a new class of composite matrices that addresses NASA's desire for multifunctional composite materials that harness superior thermal, mechanical, and optoelectronic efficiencies.  Furthermore, it is anticipated that a capability for real-time, in-situ monitoring of the structure's health can be incorporated within the architecture of these composites?whose susceptibility towards an assortment of phenomena (mechanical, chemical, optical, electrical, magnetic, etc.) can be further manipulated?through synthetic modifications of the SWNT component of the matrix.  No such carbon-nanotube derived material is currently available.  In Phase 1, the feasibility of producing such a composite will be demonstrated.  Phase II will involve the further process optimization, development, and full characterization of this material.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Deformation properties are suitable for in-situ strain sensing and the temperature dependence of the transport properties are suitable for in-situ material temperature sensing.  Composites are also suitable for the production of (i) rugged, radiation hardened and infrared obscuring optoelectronic devices; (ii) improved electromagnetic interference shielding and radar absorbing materials; (iii) protection against lightning and electromagnetic warfare, and (iv) efficient temperature dissipating materials for rocket, hypersonic aircraft and ballistic missile technologies.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Computer hardware platforms; non-corrosive replacement of metals in the automobile and civil engineering industry; supplants metal as a structural and conductive material.

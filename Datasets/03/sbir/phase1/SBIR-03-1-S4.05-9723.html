<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Gaia Genomics proposes to develop an instrument for the detection of earthborn and/or planetary life forms that are based on a nucleic acid paradigm.  Highly sensitive reagents will be developed to detect DNA- or RNA-based organisms.  The components of the proposed system are simple, rugged, stable, and inexpensive, and detection will be both rapid and highly sensitive.  In Phase I, we will synthesize the diagnostic reagents and demonstrate proof-of-concept by their ability to detect nucleic acids.  In Phase II, they will be incorporated into a portable prototype instrument designed for single- or multi-sample detection.  The resulting device will be ideal for use as a survey tool for NASA Astrobiology interplanetary missions (Topic S4, Sub-topic 05).  
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The instrument will be capable of monitoring the presence of earthborn life forms during NASA-sponsored interplanetary travel.  The instrument will be particularly useful for monitoring space vehicles and equipment to ensure that earthborn organisms are not inadvertently introduced to extraterrestrial sites and to comply with Planetary Protection Protocols.  It will also provide a survey tool for identifying the most promising areas for targeted exploration in the search for extraterrestrial life forms at planetary landing sites, if the organisms are based on a nucleic acid paradigm.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A compact, portable, low-cost DNA detection instrument capable of providing rapid results in the field will be commercially attractive.  Applications include the survey of sites that are potentially contaminated with environmental pathogens (environmental monitoring firms, local water districts, hospitals) or biological weapons (NASA, Departments of Defense and Homeland Security).  This technology will save time and resources by providing a primary screen to identify sites that need more detailed evaluation.  Second generation instruments will be tailored for specific pathogens (or groups of pathogens), for example anthrax or SARS virus.

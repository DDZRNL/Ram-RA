<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
With the advent of mobile commerce technologies, the realization of pervasive computing and the formation of ad-hoc networks can be leveraged to the benefit of the NASA Spaceports in several technical areas.  The Automated Service Discovery (ASD) architecture will allow a portable real-time Expert System to be used to aid in the Service Discovery, management of communications links, and fault detection isolation and recovery for vehicle health management.  The ASD system will allow significant cost reductions for fielding and maintaining systems at the Spaceports.  Flight systems can save weight by relying on encrypted wireless links rather than connections to a wiring harness for data transfer.  Ground based systems can reconfigure on the fly using wireless and connection oriented ad-hoc networks.
<br>
<br>This proposal also addresses the need for a standardized command, control and monitor system for ground and space infrastructure.  ASD will use the same Expert System for execution of the ASD algorithms to derive suggestions for least-cost paths for data connectivity.   The ASD system will provide a capability for the real-time Expert System to query for service capabilities and adjust goals and constraints based on available resources.  The ASD implementation will be machine, language, and operating system neutral.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The ASD system has applications in flight environments and throughout the ground based infrastructure at the NASA Spaceports.  The ability to form LANs and WANs in an ad-hoc manner will be beneficial to NASA throughout the life cycle of an orbiter, ISS Module, test equipment, simulators, and even the building management infrastructures.  The ability of a system to sense its surroundings and autonomously configure a network connection will save significant time and support costs.  NASA can specify standardized interfaces that will allow vendors to have true plug and play capabilities throughout the Spaceport infrastructure.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
ICS has a track record of leveraging technology from one project to aid another project.  ICS will promote the ASD technology to DoD and commercial sectors.  Air Force Research Lab has already expressed interest in Transformational Communications.  The ASD system and its algorithms can be packaged in an FPGA for development of adaptor cards and an integrated chipset to be included in future hardware component designs.  The ASD system could become and enabling technology for Mobile Commerce applications and appliances for private and public sector for ad-hoc networks.

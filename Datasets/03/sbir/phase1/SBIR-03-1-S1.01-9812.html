<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Mikro Systems, Inc. (MSI) will advance the state-of-the-art in high resolution, high-aspect-ratio x-ray/gamma-ray collimator fabrication into the micro-slit regime (slit pitch on the order of 10-20 microns) through the use of an innovative hybrid micro-machining technology.  To achieve high resolution imaging at hard x-ray and gamma-ray energies, grid-based optics are currently required.  Fine grids, having high-aspect-ratio (>50:1) and made from dense materials, are the enabling components for solar and astrophysical imaging with high angular resolution at x-ray and gamma-ray energies.  Instrumentation for these missions is severely constrained by size and mass considerations. Since the angular resolution scales with the grid-aperture to instrument-length ratio, the ability to produce grids with finer pitch has the direct result of higher angular resolution and/or overall reduction in instrument size and mass.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
MSI collimator technology is directly relevant to the following NASA x-ray and gamma-ray space imaging programs: 
<br>1)The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-ray (STIX) instrument under consideration for the ESA Solar Orbiter mission, 
<br>2)Collimators for the Particle Accelerator Solar Orbiter (PASO) mission, included in NASA?s Office of Space Sciences Sun Earth Connections Roadmap, and 
<br>3)Multi-grid arrays for the proposed Cyclotron/Nuclear Explorer (CYCLONE) project, submitted as a proposed NASA Small Explorer (SMEX) mission.  
<br>4)Future high-resolution / high-sensitivity instruments for solar x/gamma-ray imaging.
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
MSI is applying this advanced collimator technology to a number of commercial and research products, including collimators, detector arrays, and scatter reduction grids for medical imaging applications specifically mammography, computed tomography, and nuclear medicine.  In addition, our technology is being applied to non-medical radiography applications for homeland security.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Applied Science Innovations, Inc. proposes to develop a new tool of 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) for cellular level imaging at video frame rates and dramatically reduced probe cross-section.  Existing commercial OCT tools are focused in ophthalmology, where examination is external to the eye, the size of the probe is not important, and cellular level resolution is not required.  The patent-pending 3D OCT will provide three-dimensional imaging in scattering media with improved resolution, depth of field, and minimal mechanical adjustment.  The proposed approach is based on novel probe designs, original coherence scanning, and advanced signal processing.  The flexible imaging probe will have dramatically reduced cross-section, compared to the existing systems, enabling the first ?3D camera through a needle? for functional imagery, including in-vivo histological examination.  Phase I will include theoretical studies and implementation of a limited experimental prototype to arrive at the proof of concept.  First generation packaged prototype will be developed in Phase II of the project and delivered to NASA Glenn Research Center for evaluation and field tests.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA applications will include measurement and micro-control technologies for health monitoring and health management of experiments, astronauts, and astronauts' environments, enhanced capability to image functioning biological systems at the cellular length scale, providing three-dimensional imagery of the sample.  Additional applications of interest to NASA include real-time 3D imaging of plant cells, cellular studies of microgravity effect on immune system, and examining of structures in biochips.  3D OCT will be applicable for diagnostics of the performance of labs-on-a-chip, including detecting the presence of bubbles and particles and removing or characterizing them, as well as measurement of fluidic movement.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Non-NASA commercial application include biomedical imaging (market size approaching $20B at a growth rate $1B per year), including cancer detection and cardiovascular diagnostic imaging.  Other potential biomedical applications are in ophthalmology; developmental biology; dermatology; dentistry; gynecology; urology; gastroenterology; laryngology; surgical guidance and intervention.  In minimally invasive surgery, the 3D OCT can work in combination with conventional endoscopes to provide ?close-up? three-dimensional views of cells in the areas of interest for ?real-time biopsy?.  Non-biomedical applications of 3D OCT are envisioned in high-density data storage, polymer matrix composites, wafer-level inspection systems for manufacturing of microchips and micro-electromechanical systems, and industrial inspection systems.

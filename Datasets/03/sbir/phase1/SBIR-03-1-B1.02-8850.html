<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Due to the extensive amounts of data generated from the genome sequencing projects, the focus of genomics has shifted from elucidating DNA sequence to the interpretation of gene function.  In addition, as proteins are most often the targets of drugs, a method of studying the genome at the protein level is fueling the pharmaceutical industry?s interest in proteomics.  By interpreting the interacting partners of a protein of interest and stimuli that affect these conditions, much can be learned about the protein?s function.  To help fuel the proteomics revolution, Agave BioSystems, in collaboration with Dr. Robert Boyd, of the Institute of Optics at the University of Rochester, proposes to develop an ultra sensitive analytical tool based on whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonator technology for the detection of protein-protein interactions.  Simulations have demonstrated that WGM resonator technology can provide several orders of magnitude greater sensitivity as compared to current detection mechanisms such as SPR.  The microfabrication of this detection mechanism, coupled with microfluidic systems to be developed in the Phase II, will result in a disposable biochip that can be readily used in a small, compact and portable instrument.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Proteomics will be instrumental for the understanding of the role of gravity in the function of biological processes.  The development of miniature advanced proteomics tools will aid in biological discovery in a wide variety of applications including on spacecraft platforms and planetary surfaces.  This technology is especially important in providing the data that complements the genomics data that is now becoming readily available to biological experiments during spaceflight, i.e., what genes are being activated or deactivated as a result of a change in gravity and what those changes mean in terms of the proteins that they encode. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A method of studying the genome at the protein level is fueling the pharmaceutical industry?s interest in proteomics.  By interpreting the interacting partners of a protein of interest and stimuli that affect these conditions, much can be learned about the protein?s function.  The truly innovative instrument proposed will be small and inexpensive, combining advances in solid-state optics and microfabrication with classical microbiology.  Given the extensive commercial markets that exist in genomics, we anticipate a significant commercial opportunity for this advanced, highly sensitive, and economical proteomics tool.

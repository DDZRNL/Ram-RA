<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
There is significant need for arrays of miniature sensors that are completely wireless.  Ideally these sensors would be built as an integrated device, including sensing elements, computation/signal conditioning, communication, and an on-board power supply.  However, they have not been developed due to the difficulty with integrating sensing ele-ments, and the absence of miniature power supplies.  The purpose of this Phase I program is to address these two issues, and make viable, wireless, miniature sensors. Bipolar Technologies has pioneered the development of micro-scopic rechargeable batteries, built with IC processes, for direct integration into microcircuits.  When combined with miniature energy scavengers, a hybrid power supply can be created, to provide autonomy for wireless sensors.  During Phase I, the concept of using a miniature hybrid power supply will be demonstrated with arrays of prototype sensors, built with commercial off-the-shelf components.  Microscopic, microfabricated lithium polymer batteries will be engineered, fabricated and used as part of the hybrid power supply.  Phase II will be used to refine the micro-fabrication processes used to make batteries and sensors, so that completely integrated multisensors can be delivered to and used by NASA.  This micropower supply will enable a new class of completely wireless sensors.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Arrays of low-maintenance, autonomous sensors will increase functionality and decrease cost of new engineering systems.  These include not only spaceports, but vehicles and land-based operations.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Networks of miniature wireless sensors will have a wide range of uses, and could represent a market of over a billion dollars.  They will be used in security systems, environmental monitoring, process/chemical industry, aerospace vehicles and almost anywhere wireless technologies are used.

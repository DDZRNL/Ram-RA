<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Los Gatos Research proposes to develop wafer-based capillary electrochromatography for lab-on-a-chip (LOC) applications.  These microfluidic devices will be engineered for integration with chemical and biomolecular LOC detector systems.  For Phase I, a chip-based capillary electrochromatography system will be constructed and tested.  The Phase I Research will address issues related to the performance of, as well as production methods that can be used for the technology. An integrated microfluidic system will be designed, and specifications for the Phase II Prototype will be determined.  The suitability of the technology for present NASA LOC applications will be assessed, and relevant commercial markets and products will be identified.  Commercial devices based on the Phase II prototype will be constructed and commercialized during Phase III.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed wafer-based capillary electrochromatography devices can be used to develop miniature analytical or ?lab-on-a-chip? (LOC) technologies, used to perform rapid, in-situ chemical and biological analyses for applications ranging from maintaining crew health in manned missions to performing in-situ analyses during microrover missions.  Other potential aerospace applications include monitoring air and water to identify contaminants and pathogens in space stations, and providing in-situ analyses on terrestrial environments such as Mars and Nereus.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed technology will enhance the performance of the commercial lab-on-a-chip technologies, enabling new approaches to chemical and biomolecular detection and analysis to be implemented.  Commercial applications of the technology include performing blood analyses, detecting chemical and biological agents for domestic preparedness, drug delivery systems, and providing forensic analyses at crime scenes.

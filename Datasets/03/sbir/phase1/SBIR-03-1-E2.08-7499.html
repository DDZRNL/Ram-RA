<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This NASA SBIR Phase I program proposes the development of a high thermal conductivity (400 W/mK), low coefficient of thermal expansion (7-10 ppm/?K), and light weight (3-4 g/cm3) functionally graded material (FGM) heat sinks for microelectronic packaging applications. The uniquely defined ?FGM concept? pursued in this project uses a metallic package base that consists of a light metal matrix composite material to provide low thermal expansion and a high thermal conductivity functional core to  cool the high power semiconductor die. The thermal performance of the heat sink is doubled by using the high thermal conductivity functional core bonded through the body of the heat sink.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The new heat sinks are intended for the manufacturing of demanding airborne microelectronic applications where low weight and thermal, electrical, and mechanical performance are the prime objectives. They are intended for high power microwave packaging applications and optoelectronic packaging applications that need lighter, higher performance heat sinks for aeronautics and aerospace crafts. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercial applications in microelectronic and optoelectronic packaging are well served by this technology.  The new light, high thermal conductivity, heat sinks will find applications in conventional RF power, microwave, and mm-wave packages that are used in wireless telecommunication infrastructure for cellular phones, base stations, high definition television (HDTV), and satellite communications. Examples include LDMOS FET, HBT, MESFET, Bipolar, HEMT, MMIC applications.  These heat sinks can also be used in automotive ignition systems, military radar and guidance systems, cable TV, medical and research lasers, genetic analysis equipment and intranet equipment.

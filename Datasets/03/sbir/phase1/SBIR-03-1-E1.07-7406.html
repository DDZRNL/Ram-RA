<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Future instruments and platforms for NASA's Earth Science Enterprises will require increasingly sophisticated thermal control technology. Temperature control for microelectronic and optoelectronic components is often accomplished with thermoelectric (TE) coolers. Because of the performance limit of thermoelectric (TE) materials, a commercial one-stage TE cooler can provide about, at most, 70 K maximum temperature difference, when its hot end remains at room temperature. Therefore, multistage thermoelectric coolers should be applied to obtain larger temperature differences at better coefficient of performance (COP). In the proposed SBIR program, Reveo will develop and commercialize a revolutionary manufacturing technology, which can package an enormous amount of thermal couplers into a miniaturized volume, thereby significantly improving the cooling capability of multistage thermoelectric devices. This enabling process technology is known as Massive Filo-layer Technology (MFT). Compared to current technology, Reveo?s approach enjoys numerous advantages:
<br>
<br>?	Extremely compact. MEMS level miniaturization.
<br>?	Exceptionally high cooling capability (150K and below)
<br>?	Manufacturing process can be integrated into industrial thin film device process.
<br>?	Great cost saving by consuming less thermoelectric material.
<br>?	Highly scalable and upgradeable.
<br>?	Enabling much more flexible multistage thermoelectric device configuration.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Proven feasible, this technology can have a significant impact on the thermal control technology for future instruments and platforms for NASA's Earth Science Enterprises. NASA is at the advent of using smaller and higher resolution instruments. By using advanced thermoelectric coolers capable of providing cooling at 150 K and below, NASA?s instrumentation capability will be significantly improved, in terms of stability, resolution, and speed. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
An extremely powerful, compact and low cost thermoelectric micro-cooler also benefits other thermoelectric applications such as portable refrigeration, micro-coolers for infrared detector/laser diode/CCD/PC microprocessors, temperature controllers for critical components, thermal cyclers, and other temperature management tools. Two areas that are both growing especially rapidly and have a critical need for thermoelectric coolers are in microprocessors and image sensors.

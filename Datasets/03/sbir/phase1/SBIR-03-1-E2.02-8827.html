<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
To determine pointing and position vectors in both local and inertial coordinate frames, multi-spacecraft missions typically utilize separate attitude determination and formation metrology systems.  For low Earth orbits (LEO), fleet position and geometry knowledge is almost exclusively achieved by using GPS data or ground uplink.  In the ab-sence of this information, inter-satellite ranging between all member elements (e.g. RF, optically) is required in or-der to determine the system topology.  While this represents a functional solution, the Earth Science (ES) Enterprise program has established a priority for the deployment and coordination of large fleets of space platforms.  In re-sponse, AeroAstro proposes to develop an integrated vision-based GN&C system technology for attitude and forma-tion determination of multi-spacecraft missions.  To achieve this capability, the design will incorporate a novel miniature star tracker (currently under development by AeroAstro), with a suite of innovative network algorithms.  Requiring only a single node-node range measurement and communication of processed vision data from member platforms, fleet geometry determination will be insensitive to orbit altitude, topology, near-field interference, and proximity.  In addition, AeroAstro will utilize its significant experience in developing microsatellite systems to de-liver a design that is optimized around simplicity, cost, and efficient use of available platform resources.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed vision-based navigation system will prove directly applicable to resource- and budget-conscious NASA science missions seeking to exploit the capabilities of multiple-spacecraft formations. Platforms conducting simultaneous, spatially separated measurements of time-variant properties or interferometric observations, will require the navigation and formation knowledge which the integrated VBAFDS provides.  In addition, large fleet deployments of microsatellite platforms will benefit from the reduced power, mass, and processing requirements.  Currently there are several programs under preliminary development that would directly benefit from access to a VBAFDS, including the Magnetic Constellation, Solar Flotilla, and Magnetospheric Multiscale.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Many DoD agencies have demonstrated a serious interest in formation flight and proximity operations, exemplified by AFRL?s TechSat-21 program, DARPA?s SPAWN on-orbit logistics program, and NRO?s investigation of interferometric Earth observation missions.  The desire to deliver capability to orbit as a small, distributed system will necessitate an efficient, highly capable means of  determining platform attitude and formation geometry in variety of fleet configurations and for minimal resources.  The algorithms which serve as the core of this project will also be applicable to autonomous operation of unmanned air, ground, and sea vehicles for both government and civil applications.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
For a distributed aperture sensor, especially at infrared and optical wavelengths, the relative position of the aperture components must be known and controlled precisely.  When the aperture components are on separate independent spacecraft, determining the relative range and bearing is the challenge our proposed innovation addresses.  The estimation of the relative range and bearing will be used in the positioning and control of remote sensors.  Using a laser cross-link between the spacecraft, the fine positioning (25 cm) stage can be accomplished using the network protocols, message structure and by leveraging a balanced system of range and synchronization we have developed and employed on experimental and operational systems.  For hyperfine position (1 micron) we propose to use the same cross-link since the laser wavelength is the same size as the requirement.  Tuning is accomplished by setting up an interference pattern between the two satellite laser beams and adjusting the focal plane for the maximum intensity.   To solve the phase ambiguity that will arise, we propose to further modulate the lasers with a pseudo-random noise code and integrate over several code chip intervals to resolve the ambiguity and reach the 1 micron requirement.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
With the combined fine and hyperfine positioning system, NASA can now deploy distributed aperture satellite sensor systems that cover the complete electromagnetic spectrum from radio to visible frequencies.  These systems will now allow experiments to be conducted for telescopes and radiometers to observe both deep space and earth looking environmental monitoring.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
For Earth bound systems visible and IR telescope apertures can be distributed about an open plane or even across mountaintops and focusing can be accomplished through the use of this system automatically.  Other applications can include geophysical monitoring where GPS and standard laser range finders are currently inadequate to measure and monitor small changes in the movement of earthquake plates.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Program, Syscom Technology, Inc. (STI) will fabricate a metallized multifunctional composite fiber from a high-strength, high-modulus poly(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) fiber for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding in wiring and cable applications in space vehicles. High phosphorous content Electroless Nickel (HPEN) will be coated uniformly onto the PBO fiber by utilizing a novel fabrication process recently invented by STI. It is anticipated that the superior corrosion resisted HPEN coating will not only protect the PBO fiber from the harmful atomic oxygen (AO) erosion and ultraviolet (UV) radiation damage but also will protect the underlining PBO fiber from the impact of debris and micrometeoroid. In case the HPEN coating was damaged during operation, the high phosphorus content in the EN coating (10 to 13 wt%) may "self-heals" and form a protect phosphate layers after AO exposure and therefore protects the inner materials from further decomposition.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
These high strength lightweight multifunctional Metal/Polymer Composite Fiber (MPCF) will have tremendous potential for the applications such as space tether, solar cell arrays, thermal blanket, space antenna and electromagnetic shielding (EMI). The replacement of material counterpart in existing satellites or space vehicle with multifunctional MPCF will result in not only substantial weight-savings but also enhanced performance durability in the space environment.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
These high strength lightweight multifunctional Metal/Polymer Composite Fiber (MPCF) will have tremendous potential replace metal wires for power and signal transfer and EMI shielding in automobiles and aerospace vehicles leading to improved system performance and reduced cost. Most important, a durable, lightweight, ultrastrong and yet flexible, and conductive yarn will facilitate the growth of the emerging ?electronic textile? industry.

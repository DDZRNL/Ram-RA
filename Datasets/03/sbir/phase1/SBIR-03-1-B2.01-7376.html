<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Crossfield is proposing to develop a low cost, single chip plant bio-monitor using an embedded MEMs based infrared (IR) spectroscopy gas sensor for carbon dioxide and oxygen sensing, a temperature sensor, a visible light sensor, and a MEMs based soil moisture sensor.  In addition, the signal conditioning, A/D converter, and processor will be implemented on the same monolithic chip, providing NASA with a smart biosensor chip for monitoring and data logging plant life environmental stress.  A second, commercially available chip will provide a wireless interconnect to a remote monitoring station, enabling any suitably equipped computer, such as a laptop or a fixed display station to monitor the condition of a networked array of such sensors.  The MEMs sensors are innovative Crossfield designs and the small, two-chip Wireless BioSensor is sufficiently low power to enable indefinite life time by energy scavenging from the environment.  Under Phase I, the system will be demonstrated using analysis, simulation, and a demonstration breadboard of key elements.  The monolithic sensor will be fully developed under a Phase II effort.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Wireless MEMs Biosensor supports the NASA Fundamental Biology Program in understanding the effects of gravity on plants and animals by enabling the remote monitoring of atmosphere and water (nutrient) environments, as well as enabling the control and data logging of experiment container environments. The BioSensor employs a suite of four sensors to measure respiration, evapotranspiration, photosynthesis, and other environment variables in plants.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The commercial potential of the Wireless MEMs Biosensor is very large, with applications in agribusiness, forestry, pharmaceuticals, and the home consumer.  Commercial green houses can use the BioSensor to support different environments according to the product (such as tropical plants versus temperate or mountain climate).  Another potential application is the controlled plant growth employed by the pharmaceutical industry. Finally, the largest potential market is in agribusiness.  This includes large farms and forestry, where monitoring the plant growth environment is a major concern, since there is little control other than watering and adding nutrients.

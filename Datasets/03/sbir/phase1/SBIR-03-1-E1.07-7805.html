<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Laser diodes are the key component in many space-based applications ranging from communication systems to optical sensors/detectors.  Laser diode emitters however dissipate large amounts of waste heat of their own from the small footprint of the device.  As a result, the dissipating heat flux from the laser diodes can reach a level as high as 1kW/cm2.  The performance and reliability of laser diode arrays can degrade severely if the waste heat is not properly managed.  Indeed temperature control is critical when the laser diode arrays are used for pumping a solid-state laser such as Nd:YAG.  The solid-state laser has a narrow absorption bandwidth and requires a narrow pump source.  Any variation in temperature throughout the array will cause the emitters to emit different wavelengths, thus increasing the bandwidth of the array.  Spray cooling is probably the only available thermal control technology capable of dispersing heat fluxes of this extreme level (>200W/cm2).  Spray cooling is a heat removal method by an evaporative heat transfer process.  In this research project, a novel concept that combines a conventional refrigeration cycle and spray cooling technique into one system is proposed as the solution to extremely high heat flux problems.

The intended application for the VCRL/SC concept is the cooling of high heat flux laser diode arrays in space-based communication systems.  Laser diode emitters dissipate large amounts of waste heat from the small footprint of the device.  As a result, the dissipating heat flux from the laser diodes can reach a level as high as 1kW/cm2.  The performance and reliability of laser diode arrays can degrade severely if the waste heat is not properly managed.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
As electronic devices place ever-increasing demands not only on power requirements but also on packaging technology to reduce size and weight.  A recent market survey indicates that the heat density requirement will exceed 1kW/cm2 for high power electronics in a near future.  Examples of high power electronics are power converters, switches, motor drives.

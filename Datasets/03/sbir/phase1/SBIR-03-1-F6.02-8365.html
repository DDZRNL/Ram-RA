<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
	The integration of the analysis tools with the advanced visualization capabilities in The Intelligent Flight Support System (IFSS)  can provide a unique method for investigating dynamic spatial problems.  The IFSS will use a simple joystick driven navigation paradigm to navigate throughout the environment by simply flying through the space.  In this manner, the FC has the ability to move around and into the ISS while maintaining a fixed gaze towards the ISS.  This allows the FC to view the ISS and Space Shuttle from different perspectives and perform several different analyses that provide input to the IFSS visualization software.  The user interface will be comprised of two distinct data and intelligent components.  The data component provides FCs with all currently used displays at MCC while the intelligent component is used to provide the FCs with what-if, goal-seeking and graphing capabilities.  In addition, an expert system will be embedded in the intelligent component allowing FCs to perform more sophisticated analysis, such as dual angle operations, feathering for docking, shadow analysis, auto tracking.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Intelligent Flight Support System (IFSS) proposed here promotes situational awareness at MCC with an interactive virtual model of the ISS and Space Shuttle combined with data and decision support displays.  IFSS also incorporates an intelligent component to model various characteristics of space vehicle systems when predictable results of unknown scenarios are required.  IFSS supports FCs in the planning, communications, command, and control operations of the ISS and Space Station by providing knowledge and skills that are unavailable from internal representation.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The current distributed VR technology market condition has been described with ?positive fluidity?.  While VR technology is considered poised for professional application, market leaders and operational trends/standards are still evolving.  Progress would include establishing acknowledged leading manufacturers, compatibility specifications, performance levels, economical costs and human expertise.  However, rapid technology mutation and evolution characterizes all information technology markets not to negate the promising outcomes of distributed VR technologies.

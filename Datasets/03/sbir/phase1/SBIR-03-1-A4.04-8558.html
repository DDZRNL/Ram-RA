<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Gamma titanium aluminide (TiAl) alloys with their low density (~3.9g/cm3), good elevated temperature strength, stiffness, creep resistance and acceptable burn and oxidation resistance have excellent potential for use in high temperature aerospace applications at temperatures between 500oC to 1000oC instead of the currently used high density (~8.9g/cm3) Ni-based superalloys. However, its poor intermediate and room temperature ductility cause conventional manufacturing operations such as rolling, forging or drawing to be difficult for titanium aluminides, thus leading to very high cost of TiAl components (currently up to $10,000 per 30? by 12? by 0.04? sheet from an offshore source, Plansee in Austria). In the proposed program cost-effective flat products (sheet/foil) and NNS ?chunky? components of monolithic TiAl and composites concepts (TiAl/Ti high-temp alloy/TiAl, TiAl/Ti3Al/TiAl, and TiAl/ceramic concepts) will be fabricated by a patented loose sintering approach. This low cost approach, which allows flexibility in gauge product, a hot pressing approach, microstructure and mechanical properties of the products as well as formability and joining/diffusion bonding capabilities will be evaluated with the goal of achieving the requirements for structural use. These components can be used in next generation launch vehicle airframe (experiencing extensive aerodynamic heating) and engine applications.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The driving force behind developing an innovative, low-cost TiAl-based alloy sheet/foil, TiAl/Ti/TiAl composites sheet and NNS ?chunky? TiAl product by the P/M approach, if for use TiAl alloy sheet/foil for thermal protection honeycomb structures and other structural components for aerospace launch vehicles applications, and for commercial engines and ATF/JSF propulsion system applications. This technology can be used in space systems and the next generation of weapon systems, Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), requiring lightweight structures. NASA and the Air Force will likely integrate an innovative, low-cost TiAl-based alloy sheet/foil product by the P/M approach for military engines and aircrafts, a potential large market for military application.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Innovative low-cost technology can be used in both commercial and military aircrafts, requiring lightweight structures. Major domestic aerospace companies such as Goodwich Aerospace, Boeing Co. and aero engine OEM?s namely General Electric, Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce Allison will likely integrate an innovative, low-cost TiAl-based alloy sheet/foil product by the P/M approach for engines and aircrafts, a potential large market for commercial application.

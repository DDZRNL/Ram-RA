<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA has determined that the use of modular and reconfigurable components is critical for the success of future large and complex space systems.   In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to be able to assemble and reassemble modules both on the ground and on orbit.  Therefore, it requires a means to join components that is simple, reliable, and non-intrusive as well as strong and stiff enough to withstand multiple connections and disconnections.  AeroAstro?s solution is to apply a new micro-scale mechanical joining technology, Vaccro, to the modular space systems.  Created by VACCO Industries, Vaccro is analogous to ?metal Velcro? in that two surfaces will mechanically adhere to each other upon contact.  Depending on the type of Vaccro used, these bonds can be either permanent or reversible.  With this technology, the surfaces of space system components and modules would be micro-machined with Vaccro features during the ground fabrication process.  With slightly different channel geometries, the surfaces can be peeled apart and rejoined, or they can be made such that the surfaces lock together permanently.  AeroAstro along with VACCO Industries, proposes to determine the specifications for and material qualities of a space suitable Vaccro product.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The potential of Vaccro technology to NASA, and indeed any significant space mission, is the prospect that it offers for modular construction of space systems either autonomously (when coupled with other technologies) or via robotic and/or EVA methods.  The proposed technology would enable the incremental build-up of complex space systems with an inherent ability to swap-out modules that are in need of replacement due to failure or performance upgrade.  Also, the ability to reconfigure a fully functional space system from a microgravity experiment to a communications experiment could significantly increase the ROI on space systems.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The ability to interconnect space modules on orbit at places where man does not travelvastly expands the envelop of applications.  An ability to connect modules without cables, bolts, or tethers, but simply through an accurate docking process, could extend the reach of man to places that are simply unreachable or unaffordable today.  Defense and commercial systems might also benefit from the Vaccro technology.  Additional transponders launched as piggy-back payloads could be added or malfunctioning transponders replaced, on geosynchronous communications satellites.  Also, military UAV?s might be more rapidly reconfigured in the field to increase their utility or modify their mission application.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
ZONA proposes to investigate a novel family of algorithms designed to solve the boundary condition identification problem (BCIP) to extract accurate multi-dimensional heat transfer coefficient maps that are required for the design of advanced/revolutionary turbomachinery components. ZONA will develop, implement, and verify FILM-ID a general-purpose package based on a Boundary Element Method (BEM) inverse algorithm for accurate retrieval of multi-dimensional film coefficient distributions (h) using either transient or steady temperature inputs. This method can be used with broad-band or narrow-band thermochromic crystal or laser induced fluorescence thermal imaging techniques and incorporates a new technique which provides robustness to input temperature uncertainties. The proposed method is flexible and easy to implement for examination of arbitrarily complex geometries encountered in turbomachinery as it requires only surface mesh.  
<br>
<br>Phase I will focus on: (1) establishing the importance of the multi-dimensional modeling of the inverse boundary identification problem, (2) developing analytical methods for narrow-band thermochromic liquid crystal, and (3) fine-tuning the regularization process. Phase II will focus on code development, extensive verification, extension to 3-D modeling, and development of user-friendly interfaces and help manuals. It is anticipated that the proposed method will replace the conventional 1-D method for heat transfer coefficient retrieval.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed tool will impact the turbomachinery design and test facilities at NASA for whom an accurate prediction of the film coefficient distributions over advanced turbine blade designs and other components is crucial in the determination of the system efficiency and capacity. In addition, an accurate prediction of the temperature field over such components will provide with a realistic thermal stress distribution, vital in the advanced mechanical design of turbomachinery systems. A user-friendly Windows-driven package, FILM-ID, will be produced. Graphical interfaces will be provided for display of input data, boundary conditions, and resulting h maps (steady and transient).<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
FILM-ID will be of immediate use for the power generation and aircraft engine industries towards which distribution and sale will be targeted. In addition, heat transfer R&D labs will be targeted. The commercialization potential of FILM-ID not only finds its place in industry where novel heat transfer design processes are undertaken but also in academics as it can serve its purpose as a learning tool for experimental convective heat transfer and inverse problem methods in heat transfer. Although the main customer-base has been identified, a marketing study will be undertaken in Phase II to expand the prospective customer base.

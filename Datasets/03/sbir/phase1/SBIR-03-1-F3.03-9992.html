<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to develop, test, and prove the feasibility of a methodology for an inferential system for the generation of crash site likelihood maps. These maps will assist in the prioritization of candidate aircraft crash sites to be searched by Search and Rescue (SAR) operations. The crash site likelihood maps will be created by the fusion of the knowledge and experience of experts in aircraft crash site identification, together with, among others,  knowledge about weather condi-tions, terrain information, and aircraft models.  These maps will indicate the most likely areas where an aircraft may have crashed, and will allow SAR operations to focus their resources in these areas first, leading to faster and more efficient rescue operations.  The proposed work di-rectly and innovatively addresses NASA's Search and Rescue (SAR) mission, by targeting the improvement of SAR operations.  This proposed approach offers the innovation of the intelligent fusion of a variety of data, information and knowledge sources to generate crash site likelihood maps.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary application of the proposed effort within NASA is that of assistance in search and rescue operations. The resultant technology is not restricted to only search and rescue, however, and may be applicable to any geographic search applications, as needed by NASA.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Military use of the resultant technology for both search, and search and rescue operations is one apparent use of the proposed work. In addition, private sector use of the proposed technology includes basic service provider industries with physical outside plant facilities, such as electrical, telecommunications, water and natural gas providers. It is expected that the technology will be useful in locating existing outside plant facilities and fixtures, and also in determining potential locations for new facilities.

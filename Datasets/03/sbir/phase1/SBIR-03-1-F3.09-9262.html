<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Lightweight, high-temperature radiators are needed for future, high-efficiency power conversion systems for Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP).  Creare has developed flexible radiators that are extremely lightweight, stowable in small volumes, and deployable with small forces and incorporate micrometeorite protection.  The present technology is limited to 350 K operating temperature due to the use of thermoplastic adhesives in the construction.  In this proposal we plan to develop a high-temperature radiator panel to extend the range of operation needed for NEP systems.  Our innovation is a novel material combination and fabrication method that enables radiator panels with low weight, high fin efficiency, and adequate strength at high temperature.  Our lightweight radiator panel offers a factor of four reduction in weight compared with present honeycomb structures and will approach 1 kg/m?.  In Phase I, we will prove the feasibility of the fabrication process and demonstrate the ability of the panel to operate at high temperature.  During Phase II, we will develop a subscale radiator to demonstrate the advantages of the technology.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This radiator technology is needed for NASA?s Prometheus program.  Future planetary exploration missions using NEP systems will require high-temperature radiators for heat rejection.  The proposed radiator panel technology supports ongoing NASA research efforts (RF03-272702) specifically to develop heat rejection systems for this application.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Many commercial communications satellites are being built that would benefit from lightweight radiator panels.  At high ratios of rejected power to physical size, small commercial satellites need deployable radiators.

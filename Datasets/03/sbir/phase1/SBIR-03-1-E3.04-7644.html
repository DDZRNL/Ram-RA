<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA missions are being designed for multisensor data collection and synthesis using diverse temporal, spatial and spectral resolutions for use by multiple teams of mission specialists and scientists.  This project offers two closely related technologies that will benefit the distribution, sharing and use of fused datasets.(1) Artificial intelligence and machine learning is used to generate a novel intelligence-based 3D meshing, and compression method based on hierarchical tetrahedral and binary triangular decomposition applicable to both surfaces and volumes, providing high compression performance . Meshing is progressive and adaptive to any resolution and for any selected region in the scene, thus making it possible to model certain regions with high resolution while leaving the remaining parts coarse. (2) Meshing is then interleaved iteratively with registration to search for optimal alignment of overlapping 3D models by, in one case minimizing an error objective function, and in another case maximizing a similarity measure for aligning decomposition trees associated with the overlapping models. Following alignment, an integration algorithm fuses overlapping models. The anticipated results are effective 3D modeling and registration technologies that significantly assist NASA?s R&D mission.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary application for NASA is a high performance 3D modeling, compression, registration, fusion and recognition engine for use in earth science, deep space and solar system exploration and observation with multisensor data collection and analysis requirements.  This software application would assist NASA researchers, scientists and engineers in R&D and operational tasks.  By providing a radically improved way to model, compress and fuse 3D data, this project will increase the quality of data presented to NASA users and the resulting analysis.

<br>Note: This proposal is submitted under E3.04 but it is also highly relevant to E3.01.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Across a number of markets, industries and research disciplines, there is increasing demand for 3D modeling and fusion to understand, model and solve scientific, technical and commercial problems.  However, current users are inhibited from extensive use of 3D modeling and registration due to accuracy issues with current fusion/registration techniques and heavy computational and network resources (i.e. processing, storage and transmission) needed to reconstruct, display and manipulate 3D data sets.  UC?s technology will provide a 3D compression, modeling and registration/fusion engine for security & surveillance, homeland security, medical imaging and other markets.

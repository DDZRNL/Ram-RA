<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
TeamVision proposes that we research the feasibility of incorporating an adaptive object based optimization system into an existing multi-user object oriented application integration framework.  Successful implementation of such a system would save NASA and industry billions of dollars annually by reducing significantly the false starts, redundant effort, long lead times and globally non-optimal solutions characteristic of the early decision process of complex systems.  Fortunately, recent breakthroughs in software engineering have demonstrating a practical and proven strategy to this seemingly intractable problem.  The wide spread adoption of Object Oriented languages like C++ in the last ten years has created a revolution in modern software development.  This move away from serial and procedurally based languages to Object Oriented languages has allowed teams of software programmers to collaborate on large and complex software development projects unthinkable under the old language paradigms.  TeamVision is the first company, through a previous NASA-SBIR?s and private funding, to develop and commercialize a software solution that utilizes this approach in the early decision process.  The proposed innovation builds on this successful track record and would significantly expand the field of optimization into new areas.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Two new catogories of wireless batteryless sensors are proposed: magnetoelastic and LC type.  These sensors are also chipless which provide significantly lower cost and also higher operating temperatures than chip-based sensors.  This technology is al alternative to SAW (surface acoustic wave) wireless sensors that cannot operate through many materials layers, such as in a vehicle structure or fuel tank.  Magnetoelastic sensors and LC sensors operate at lower frequencies that have better penetration and also enable lower-cost readers and antenna arrays to be constructed.  Among the parameters that can be sensed are: temperature, pressure/strain, humidity, and chemical enviroment. The PI is the inventor on several patents (others pending) for these sensor technologies.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The purpose of the research into ?Compliant Actuator? design will be to demonstrate to prototype level a low profile fully integrated control mechanism. This mechanism will be the first of its kind in that it enables independent multifunctionally integrated control including all i/o, processing, control and power functions in a single compliant package that uses a active piezoceramic substrate. A compliant actuator can integrate a choice of piezoceramic actuators including piezoceramic wafers, MFC?s, NASA Flex-Pak or QorTek?s Thunder bimorphs etc. as its substrate/activation component as to yield a wide variety wideband controlled actuation systems with high s/n ratio. Used as a strain actuator, it extends with internal applied voltage while bonded to the surface of a structure. Used as a bimorph actuator, it bends with applied voltage while clamped firmly at one end in response to the internal thin film sensor measurements

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Within NASA the proposed technology would have direct application to programs as diverse as large area boom assemblies such as solar sail or antenna to aircraft tail control or surface morphing. Through the new proposed integration and manufacture process, ?Compliant Actuators? will provide a more reliable system by eliminating the external wiring and interface connections and replacing these with low risk trace interconnects. Such actuators are of substantial interest since they can be embedded in or attached to the surface of a flexible structure for distributed deflection, surface vibration damping, active twist, and acoustic control of curved and flat panels.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Even the latest piezoelectric commercially available packages must add-on additional external power, sensing, processing, and control components in order to function. Moreover, the device specific manufacture approach of such products is not amenable to migration to other piezoelectric designs and devices. The proposed technology is easily copied over to many device geometries, materials, and designs. This advance will enable easy integration of piezoelectrics into a wide variety of volume-manufactured products.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose a Phase I SBIR research project that will result in a feasibility demonstration of a miniature divert engine producing precise impulse bits smaller than 100 millinewton-second. The miniature engine will be suitable for stationkeeping and attitude control for a miniature light-weight satellite. This technology demonstration program will capitalize on miniature engine technology developed by Enigmatics and SAIC under MDA SBIR Phase I and Phase II projects, combined with a novel engine design for the proposed application.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Miniature (nano-) satellites have been proposed to fly in formations or "constellations," making continuous measurements of in-situ conditions in low-Earth orbit and monitoring changes in the Earth's magnetosphere and upper atmosphere produced by fluctuations in the solar wind.  A sparsely populated array separated by large distances could provide high-resolution information on astronomical objects.  They can also provide stereo views of Earth or other bodies using identical sensors from different angles. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The first mass-produced product that will utilize this technology will be small, autonomous, low-cost MKVs deployed in a NMD system fielded by the U.S. Defense Department.  It is difficult to say what the size of this market is, because it depends on the thoroughness with which the defense is supposed to protect and the magnitude of the threat (i.e., whether it is designed to protect against a small attack by a rogue nation or one launched by a major nuclear power).  Estimates of the eventual cost of this system range from the tens to hundreds of billions of dollars.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
 TA&T, Inc. proposes an enabling fabrication process for high voltage isolators required in high power solar electric and nuclear electric propulsion (SEP and NEP, respectively).  State-of-the-art propellant voltage isolators have sufficient performance for existing ion and Hall thruster engines with voltages of a few kilovolts.  However, future high thrust, high specific impulse (Isp) engines will have to support beam voltages >10kV to meet performance requirements.  If existing isolator designs are simply scaled-up for higher voltages, then a significant mass penalty is incurred.  The proposed fabrication approach, known as ceramic stereolithography(CSL), is an automated, layered manufacturing process that enables net shape, monolithic ceramics with complex geometry.  The process is beneficial as a rapid, low cost fabrication approach that enables exploration of novel isolator designs with complex internal flow passages.  The process is also beneficial for isolator production, because it is capable of making the complex structures as a single piece ceramic, eliminating the liability associated with multi-piece construction necessary using conventional ceramic fabrication methods.  The Phase I project will involve process development, device design, prototype fabrication and testing in collaboration with Aerojet Corporation (Redmond, WA).

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary target platforms are high power electric propulsion engines including gridded ion, Hall Effect, PIT, MPD and VASIMR.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercial applications such as ion implantation will also benefit from this technology.  Spin-off applications of this novel fabrication approach include catalyst support structures, microchannel devices and heat pipe evaporators.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A propulsion system is proposed that is based on acceleration of ions emitted from a thin, solid-state electrochemical ceramic membrane.  This technology would provide a versatile propulsion system that would be suitable for long-term, low-thrust missions throughout the deep-space to near-Earth range.  The specially formulated and fabricated membrane in combination with an applied bias voltage will be used to ionize propellant electrolytically and selectively pass ions from the membrane through an ion acceleration stage thereby producing an energetic ion beam and generating thrust.  Previously, electrostatic ion propulsion systems have used ion production mechanisms based on electron bombardment ionization, contact ionization, or direct ion extraction from field emission structures.  In contrast, ceramic membranes operate at modest temperatures and are theoretically capable of forming ions at ion energy costs that approach dissociation energies (e.g., ~1-2 eV/ion).  In addition to being readily scalable to larger sizes, the ion flux through the ceramic membranes is easily controlled over large ranges and this enables deep throttling capabilities.  Ceramic membranes are rugged and insensitive to contamination from atmospheric gases, and they have displayed very long lifetimes in similar applications.  Furthermore, ceramic membranes do not require the high voltages associated with field emission schemes.

The Emissive Membrane Ion Thruster (EMIT) device would perform deep-space to near Earth mission duties very well.  It has the flexibility of throttlable thrust and extended continuous operation.  In comparison to existing ion sources that depend upon electron bombardment techniques that are provided by expensive RF approaches or by short-lived DC electrodes, the EMIT device would be a) more efficient in terms of power consumption, b) potentially much cheaper and easier to implement, c) scalable to very small and very large areas with very small volume requirements, and d) require less maintenance.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Oxygen ion beams provide an important role in sputter deposition of thin dielectric coatings for a range of industries from opto-electronic device fabrication to architectural glass production.  Moderate energy oxygen ion beams are finding applications in fabricating SOI structures in semi-conductor devices through shallow oxygen ion implantation into silicon.  Scientific instruments that rely on sputtering by oxygen ions (e.g., SIMS) will benefit from small, specially designed EMIT devices.  In fact, the EMIT device could be integrated into Labs-on-a-Chip MEMs systems that are being developed where it could potentially run on the air surrounding the chip.

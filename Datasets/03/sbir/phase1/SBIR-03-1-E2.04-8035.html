<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Architecture Technology Corporation (ATC) will design, model, implement, and demonstrate extensible, embedded agents that will continuously adapt the behavior of the Internet-standard Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to the unique requirements of near-Earth space communications.  These embedded agents will enable TCP to adapt its behavior based on exogenous information, such as satellite ephemeris and ground station locations, or the current characteristics of the communications path as determined by lower-level protocols or periodic end-to-end tests.  By extending the transport protocol, this approach will improve near-Earth communications for all higher-level protocols that use TCP, such as FTP or HTTP, and will eliminate the need to modify these applications for space communications.  Initially, embedded TCP agents will enable TCP to maintain sessions, transparently to applications, across temporary losses of communications, such as when a satellite passes between ground stations.  Embedded agents can easily be extended to mitigate other effects of near-Earth communications, such as variable latencies or bit error rates.  While TCP has been widely researched, modeled, and extended, embedded TCP agents are unique in providing an extensible, production-quality platform for quickly integrating cutting-edge research results into products that will support the unique needs of near-Earth space communications and other demanding communications environments.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Embedded TCP agents, when combined with the Mobile IP protocols and split-TCP proxies such as Indirect-TCP, can enable a distributed ground station architecture that will provide robust end-to-end Internet connectivity between a researcher and experimental equipment onboard an orbiting satellite.  The researcher will appear to have a continuous TCP connection to the satellite, and will not be aware of temporary communications losses as the satellite moves between ground stations.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Embedded TCP agents will be useful in improving the performance in any mixed-medium communications environment, including Internet/satellite and mobile Internet/wireless communications.  The distributed gateway architecture enabled by embedded TCP agents would be applicable to a tremendous variety of commercial applications.  For example, wireless service providers could use it to provide robust TCP sessions with mobile devices.  Likewise, satellite service providers could offer persistent TCP sessions to or through low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites.  The embedded TCP agent architecture is directly applicable to the mobile tactical environment of the Army's Future Combat System (FCS).

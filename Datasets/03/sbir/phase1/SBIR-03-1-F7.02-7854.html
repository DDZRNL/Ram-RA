<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Propulsion test stands are designed for thermal and pressure loads for certain classes of engines.   These plume induced loads are:  radiative heating, acoustics and direct impingement convective heating and pressure loads.  Existing test stands will be used to test a wide variety of new propulsion systems, engines and engine components which will require the evaluation of the test stand design to handle loads that are a function of engine location, chamber pressure history and gimbaling.  Existing models require large numbers of individual calculations to evaluate the various engine operating parameters.  The Phase I effort will utilize existing models to develop a PC based test stand design constraints model that automatically determines engine operating limits for existing facilities.  The Phase I effort will establish test stand design data base requirements, modify existing test stand environments models to automatically cycle through the entire range of engine operating parameters for a single design variable, and demonstrate the model for an existing stand.  The Phase II effort expands the models capabilities for all design constraints and develops a CAD module for importing test stand design information.  This effort is innovative in that it will greatly reduce the cost/time for testing new engine designs.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The initial use for this technology is the evaluation of current engine test stand components plume induced design criteria relative to engine location, chamber pressure history and gimbaling limits for new engines/components that have never been tested on a particular test stand.  The Phase II model can also be used to rapidly provide the design criteria for new test stand for a particular engine or engine component.  The Phase II model will also have the capability of being used to evaluate spacecraft, launch vehicle and missile designs that are influenced driven by plume induced environments.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This package will be easily marketable to commercial spacecraft and launch vehicle developers based on its versatility, simplicity, accuracy and ease of use by personnel who are not experts in all aspects of plume induced environment and/or test stand/spacecraft/missile/launch vehicle design.  This model will be fairly inexpensive and will allow commercial designers to perform propulsion trade studies and determine the subsequent impact on the system design at a fraction of the current cost.  Components of the model can be used for design evaluation of system that involves high speed/high temperature gaseous or two phase flows.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Future manned space exploration missions will require high power electric propulsion.  VASIMR thrusters are the most attractive option because they offer short transit times and low propellant usage.  A key component in VASIMR thrusters is the cryogenic electromagnets.  Cooling systems for the magnets do not currently exist.  The innovation of the proposed project is a high-capacity turbo-Brayton cryocooler for thermal management of VASIMR electromagnets.  The cryocooler has heritage in the space-qualified unit that was developed by Creare for the Hubble Space Telescope.  Turbo-Brayton cryocoolers are ideal for space applications because they are lightweight, compact, efficient, highly reliable and have long maintenance-free lifetimes (>10 years).  Furthermore, the technology scales well to high cooling capacities and is inherently simple to integrate with multiple cooling objects; attributes that are particularly beneficial for VASIMR systems.  In Phase I we will design thermal management systems for VASIMR thrusters at power levels consistent with near-term flight experiments and future manned space exploration missions.  During Phase II, we will demonstrate a prototype thermal management system.  In Phase III we will develop the complete thermal management system, integrate the system with a VASIMR thruster, and demonstrate the system through tests in a thermal vacuum chamber.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This program will result in the development of a high-capacity turbo-Brayton cryocooler that is compact, lightweight, consumes minimal power, and is simple to integrate with spacecraft systems and cooling loads.  Space applications include cooling systems for high-temperature superconducting magnets for electric propulsion, and observation platforms requiring large arrays of infrared and X-ray detectors; and cooling systems for cryogen storage for planetary and extraterrestrial exploration missions, extended-life orbital transfer vehicles, long-term geosynchronous missions, in-space propellant depots and extraterrestrial bases.  Terrestrial applications include cooling systems for spaceport cryogen storage and cryogen transportation systems.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Non-NASA commercial applications include cooling systems for high-temperature superconducting magnets in motors and magnetic resonance imaging systems; laboratory- and industrial-scale gas separation, liquefaction, cryogen storage and cryogen transportation systems; and commercial orbital transfer vehicles and satellites.

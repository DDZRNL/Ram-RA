<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The objective of the project is the design and development of an open architecture, computer aided control design toolbox for distributed parameter systems, in particular to aerodynamic control for high performance applications in aerial vehicles. Especially, for unmanned aerial vehicles, small actuators can have a big aerodynamic impact. An effective controlled network of distributed micro actuators and sensors can enable aggressive performance not possible through traditional control surfaces like aileron, elevator, rudder and flaps. Even for larger aircraft the emerging paradigm for control involves an array of actuators and distributed sensing. In addition to enhanced performance this provides much greater redundancy that can be utilized to confront battle damage or actuator and sensor failures in commercial jet liners. We propose the use of integrated set of computing tools including 3D drawing tools, symbolic processing tools, numerical tools and visualization software for 3D animated graphics for the development. With continuing advances in distributed actuation and sensing technologies these tools will find widespread application in emerging unmanned aerial vehicle industry. The toolbox in conjunction with commonly used numerical software will provide designers the ability to seamlessly test control design by integrating and automating several key steps in the design cycle.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Design of air, land and sea vehicles involving aerodynamic and fluid flow has always been of interest to NASA. In this proposal the coupling design of aerodynamics, structures and control will lead to vehicles capable of greater performance and also help evaluate designs at an early stage. The successful completion of the project will provide engineers with a comprehensive set of tools to specify, model, design controls, simulate, evaluate and optimize flow aerial vehicle system designs. This will facilitate in bringing the recent advances in control, sensors and actuator technology to engineering practice. The open architecture will allow new techniques to be incorporated into the computational framework.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
With the continuing development of small scale, inexpensive, locally ?intelligent? embedded actuators and sensors it is becoming increasingly possible to achieve distributed control of systems. The capability to ?distribute? control authority throughout a system and to sense state variations both locally and globally opens the door to sophisticated control of systems that involve aerodynamic flow. There is need for tools to help design and develop control systems for such systems. Distributed actuation problem in aerial vehicles is used to demonstrate feasibility of the approach. Although, the primary motivation is tailored towards micro air vehicles these computational tools will find widespread application in the industry including the design of sea, air and land vehicles.

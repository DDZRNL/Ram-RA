<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose the development of a CTE-matched, liquid-cooled, high thermal conductivity heat sink for use in spacecraft thermal management applications.  The material of construction of this heat sink has four properties that are critical: high normal and specific thermal conductivities, low CTE, high temperature resistivity, and moldability.  Its thermal conductivities are higher than that of copper, so the thermal resistance across this heat sink will be lower than one made of copper.  At the same time, it has a low CTE, which is slightly less than silicon and close to the CTE?s of most semiconductor and optical materials.  CTE-matching is critical in space applications because of the wide variations in ambient temperatures, which can lead to delamination of heat sinks from electronics or their fracture.  This material can withstand very high temperatures, so a faster CVD diamond deposition process is feasible.  The diamond layer maximizes the thermal spreading at the heat sink-device interface (important for devices that are sensitive to temperature gradients) and also provides electrical isolation of the electrical components being cooled.  Finally, the material is moldable, so heat sinks with complex external geometries, e.g. curved for optics, and internal surfaces can be fabricated inexpensively.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Our proposed heat sink technology will satisfy the ever-increasing demands of thermal management in space-based applications.  As more sophisticated and higher power devices are employed in spacecraft, our heat sink will be able to provide the necessary cooling load and increase the reliability of the total system.  Even moderate and lower power systems will benefit from the enhanced thermal spreading and reduced thermal stresses that will be occur with the utilization of our heat sink technology.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
We are currently working on developing a similar heat sink using Al/SiC for high heat flux power modules.  The demand for power modules that can handle higher voltages and currents are growing, as these power electronic components are needed for distributed electrical power systems, hybrid and electrical vehicles, and many military programs.  The Navy in particular has been very actively funding the development of power module systems, in support of their All-Electric-Ship program and several new weapon system concepts.

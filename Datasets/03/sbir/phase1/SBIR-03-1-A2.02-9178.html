<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
For electric propulsion systems for large aircraft it is desirable to have very light weight electric motors.   Cryogenic motors offer much lighter weight than conventional iron room temperature motors.  Superconducting cryogenic motors can offer much more lighter weight motors than just cryogenically cooled copper motors.  Magnesium diboride, a light-weight superconductor wire, cooled in the available liquid hydrogen fuel, is the ideal candidate coil material for large aircraft motors.   During the Phase I we will demonstrate using this new wire in coil forms that will show feasibility of fabricating exciter, rotor and stator coils in a Phase II motor demonstration.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Besides large aircraft motors, magnesium diboride superconductors can benefit NASA applications for superconducting ADR coils, transformers, inductors, magnetic bearings, actuators, MHD magnets, and other potential power conditioning applications.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercialization of magnesium diboride superconducting wires will allow less expensive and more open MRI systems for medical use, and lower cost and more efficient systems for power utility applications such as transformers, reactors, motors, generators, fault current limiters, and SMES.

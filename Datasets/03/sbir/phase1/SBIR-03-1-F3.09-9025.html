<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Stirling Technology Company (STC) proposes to integrate an existing Multi-Cylinder Free-Piston Stirling Engine (MPFPSE) with innovative compact linear alternators. Future manned and unmanned scientific and exploration missions will require substantially more electric power from nuclear, solar, and other heat sources than existing launch-capable systems can effectively provide. A scalable, cost-effective, safe, reliable, low mass, robust, high-efficiency, heat-to-electric power convertor is proposed. Innovative aspects include: 1) increased power density through the use of a double-acting MCFPSE, 2) increased system efficiency by improving phase angle and reducing alternator losses, and 3) an innovative duplex linear alternator design with the potential to improve efficiency and reduce mass. This advanced dynamic power system for heat-to-electric power conversion is based on a free-piston implementation of the well-known Siemens four-cylinder heat exchanger interconnection arrangement combined with highly reliable, flexure-supported linear alternators. These proven technologies provide high power density, while retaining the simplicity and long-life inherent with flexure-supported hardware, as evidenced by an on-going 79,000-hour (9-year) maintenance-free, degradation-free endurance test at STC. Power convertors based on this innovative arrangement are scalable up to tens of kilowatts, while modular combinations of coaxially-aligned, opposed power convertors will produce very low net vibration forces.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Potential space applications include solar dynamic and nuclear-reactor power and/or propulsion systems for manned and unmanned flights, and government and commercial solar-satellite power convertors. Space cryocoolers based on the proposed innovation could be implemented for higher efficiency and power density than current Stirling cryocoolers.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Terrestrial applications include remote and distributed power generation, residential and industrial cogeneration, and solar power conversion. STC's commercialization strategy is to continue to leverage development contracts into related commercial development contracts, and then into a staged commercial production sequence, focusing initially on high value-added markets where the unique advantages of STC?s long life, maintenance free machines can justify higher costs. As production increases, costs will decrease allowing expansion into lower-cost markets. By using like technology throughout its family of machines, the success of one product or market brings about reductions in cost and furthers the commercialization efforts for other products and markets.

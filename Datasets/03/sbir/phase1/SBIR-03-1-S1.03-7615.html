<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Using innovative chip thinning technology married with recently available packaging technology, this effort will produce Mechanically Flexible Multifunctional Active Silicon chips.  By thinning pre-fabricated silicon chips down to the order of microns, bonding and encapsulating them in flexible polyimide materials; the resulting crystalline silicon chip can be flexed like a piece of paper where all the components ? the wiring, passives, and active silicon chips ? can be rolled, bent, and folded to virtually any shape and size.A Mechanically Flexible Active Silicon System is the next generation of MCM-D technology.  Evolving from Chip-on-Flex to Chip-IN-Flex where the active silicon chips are themselves mechanically flexible, this technology will enable countless space, mobile, sensing, and advanced architecture systems for NASA.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Applications include lab-in-a-teacup that can be inflated into a large active semiconductor sensor array, foldable electronics for compact microsatellites, and 3-D architectures for neural network parallel processing. Flexible active semiconductor sensors could be laminated to the walls of microsatellites, large solar or active phased array radar panels could be ?unrolled? instead of unfolded, making transport and deployment simpler.  Flexible chips will offer improved control and better reliability in vibration, CTE, and G-forces and new system architectures will be enabled resulting in smaller and fewer system heat sinks, faster neural networks, and easier system upgrades and rework.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Flexible chip technology will enable heart monitors that can be laminated onto a patient?s chest or a cell phone that can be wrapped around a pencil.  With this technology, any portable electronic device could be rolled up and put into the user?s pocket, wearable electronics will become lighter weight and more conformal, and sensors, electronics, and displays can laminated onto a wall.  Other applications include non-rigid (bendable) smart cards, electronic upgrade cards that can be laminated to the inside of a portable device, and vertically connected stacked chips for 3-D processing.

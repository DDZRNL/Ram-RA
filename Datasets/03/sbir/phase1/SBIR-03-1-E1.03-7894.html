<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Picarro, Inc proposes to develop the first cavity ringdown spectroscopy (CRDS) system to measure fluorescence, absorption, and scattering properties of atmospheric aerosols in real-time and in-situ. These unique capabilities will enhance NASA?s studies of aerosol properties including single-scatter albedo, size distributions, and particle types. The fluorescence spectra will enable discrimination between biological and non-biological aerosols. The flight-deployable instrument will weigh less than 25 kg and have a measurement time resolution of 1 second. Our approach utilizes a high-finesse CRDS cavity to measure extinction and to enhance the scattering and fluorescence signals attainable using low power diode laser based light sources.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
We anticipate commercial applications in the monitoring of pollution and air quality. There is a market for particulate sensors in semiconductor fabrication facilities. We also see a large potential market for monitors for domestic security agencies to detect aerosol dispersed biological warfare agents. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The instrument will enable new measurements of aerosol optical properties required to develop more accurate models of global climate. It will help elucidate the sources and effects of bioaerosols on human and animal health. The instrument has military applications for the early detection of biological agents.

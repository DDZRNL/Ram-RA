<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed NASA Phase I SBIR will generate closed-cell foam thermal protection system materials which do not need waterproofing, and which can be applied as a coating to replace impregnation densification processes and which can potentially protect critical structural elements from penetration of hot reentry gases in the event of damage to the external insulation.  Specifically, the program will demonstrate preceramic-polymer derived syntactic foams and  plasma sprayed syntactic foam coatings which can survive exposures to 2500 F erosive gases while being waterproof and able to withstand high pressure water-jet cleaning processes.  The proposed foams and low density TBC?s could replace a portion of the foam insulation on the SRB and external tank, as well as providing a backup TBC to protect space transportation system structures in the event of localized insulation failure.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Primary applications for the advanced thermal protection system to be developed in this project are for the Space Shuttle, to replace AETB tiles with a waterproof closed-cell tile system, or to replace the current impregnation densification system with a thermally sprayed TBC (on the tile or on the vehicle).  The proposed TBC also can be used as a fail-safe backup, protecting Shuttle structures from short-term gas exposure due to limited failure of the current TPS.  Other applications include the Shuttle orbiter TPS, reaction control system, avionics and the external tank.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Primary commercial applications are in the foundry refractories market where corrosion- and erosion-resistant thermal barrier coatings are a primary need for blast furnace hoods, linings for submerged entry nozzles, slide gate plates and slag lines.  Potential commercial applications include high temperature, low-mass structures for heat cycle and gas turbine engines, ramjet engine components, furnace heat recovery units (recuperators), electromechanical devices and sabots for hypervelocity projectiles.  The flexible blanket system has direct application to high thermal load sealing requirements, such as close-coupled catalytic converters and turbine engine hot gas path seals.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The objective of this proposed Phase I SBIR effort is to develop and assess the feasibility of an innovative new flight instrument proposed to replace the traditional Turn Coordinator (or Turn-and-Slip Indicator) currently found in most general aviation (GA) aircraft.  The primary innovation is the inclusion of climb-dive information and gyroscopic heading, in addition to the turn-rate information now available, in one low-cost display.  In essence, this new ?r-Gamma? display concept will ?fuse? flight information on one display that the pilot must now gather and correlate from among five separate indicators whenever the aircraft experiences loss of the Attitude Indicator (AI) and the Heading Indicator (HI) due to vacuum system or gauge failure.  The innovative technology that makes this concept feasible and affordable, with a projected cost similar to that of today?s Turn Coordinator, is derived from a technique called ?Air-Data Tracking,? recently developed and flight tested by our firm under an SBIR contract that involved tracking the flightpath of a small USAF sensor vehicle.  We firmly believe this concept has the potential to improve significantly the safety of emergency ?partial-panel? flight operations in GA aircraft.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed r-Gamma system might serve as a substitute for gyroscopic attitude indicators in any atmospheric application.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The commercial application of the proposed r-Gamma system is to serve as an improved substitute for the Turn Coordinator currently found in virtually all GA aircraft.  The r-Gamma instrument will provide substantial additional functionality and greatly improved safety for GA aircraft, and at price comparable to that of the Turn Coordinator and substantially below that of available alternatives.  It is currently reported that there are roughly 200,000 GA aircraft registered in the U.S. alone.  The nearly 70% of those are light single-engine aircraft, probably equipped with conventional Turn Coordinators or equivalent are potential candidates for the r-Gamma system.

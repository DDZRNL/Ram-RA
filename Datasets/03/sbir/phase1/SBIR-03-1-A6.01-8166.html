<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Reducing uncertainty in the prediction of limit cycle oscillations (LCO) and other nonlinear aeroservoelastic phenomena is critical to flight safety.  To do so requires nonlinear methods.  First-principles based methods (CFD/CSD) have made considerable progress but still cannot predict LCO from the outset.  NEAR proposes the development of two innovative nonlinear data-based methods to characterize aeroservoelastic systems using flight-test data.  The proposed methods provide a natural extension of existing linear methods, provide uncertainty estimates of the prediction, and are applicable to flight-test data.  Both approaches are formally related.  However, their practical implementations place various limitations on the physics they represent.  The Phase I effort will document, on a benchmark test case, the advantages and disadvantages of each method.  Phase II will further develop the most promising approach and demonstrate its use on flight-test data, such as data from the F18-AAW.  Special emphasis will be placed on the problem of data generalization across flight conditions, which is key to ensuring safe and efficient envelope-expansion flight testing.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed multiresolution-based identification system provides a unique capability that will extend the usefulness of wind-tunnel and flight-test data by producing compact, reduced-order models for use in aeroelastic analyses.  The formulation of reduced-order models in aeroelasticity is important for several reasons: (1) cost reduction and speed-up of preliminary design cycles, (2) understanding of nonlinear behavior and elimination of later surprises, and (3) real-time aeroservoelastic control applications.  The proposed technology supports NASA's goal of increasing safety and efficiency of flight testing.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The market for efficient aeroelastic analysis tools is driven by new aircraft, missile, and reusable launch vehicle design and by the need for multiple aeroelastic analyses over time as a consequence of aircraft modifications and expanded/changing missions.  These are important areas for defense contractors.  The proposed linear and nonlinear identification system also has a broad range of applications, including but not limited to, electromagnetic pulse hardening of aircraft systems, computational electromagnetics (photonic switching devices, ultrawideband technology), noise reduction (acoustic liners), polymer processing (extrusion blow molding), and earthquake and geoenvironmental engineering.

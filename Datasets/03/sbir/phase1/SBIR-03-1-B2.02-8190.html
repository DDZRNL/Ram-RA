<P><B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>This proposal outlines planned 
development for a low-power, low-mass automated urine sample collection and 
preservation system for small mammals, capable of long-term operation in an 
isolated environment. It brings together earlier waste management and 
preservation techniques from NASA and other laboratory research in a novel 
manner, enabling solid-state storage and chromatographic analysis of urine for 
periods of up to 8 weeks. Urinary compounds, particularly those indicative of 
bone metabolism and protein turnover -- such as calcium, sodium, potassium, 
3-methylhistidine, creatinine, corticosterone, histidine, n-telopeptide, 
hydroxyproline, pyridinoline, and deoxypyridinoline -- are one of the most 
valuable sources of data for studying musculoskeletal changes over time in 
response to altered stimuli, including loading environment. Since urine 
collection is non-invasive and provides a wealth of knowledge, including bone 
loss, muscle atrophy, and general stress, it is an ideal candidate for automated 
collection and storage. However, in common laboratory practice, urine samples 
must be collected, then frozen or analyzed within hours. The development of a 
urine collection and preservation system for common experimental small mammals 
will enable fundamental space biology research programs to substantially 
increase data gathered in the long-term studies planned for the International 
Space Station and other vehicles. 
<P><B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>The MAUS 
architecture developed in Phase I will be immediately applicable to 
partial-gravity, hyper-gravity, and ground-based studies, with strong potential 
for extension to microgravity applications. The system?s key interfaces will be 
compatible not only with the Mars Gravity Biosatellite Payload Module, but with 
the Advanced Animal Habitat-Centrifuge (AAH-C) in development for the ISS 
Centrifuge Accommodation Module (CAM), and with static and ventilated isolator 
caging systems in widespread use by ground-based laboratories. This latter 
market represents a huge arena in which the MAUS technology might be applied.
<P><B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>A 
successful Phase I would result in a MAUS system design which could be 
manufactured and ready to operate in ground laboratory facilities during Phase 
II. This product would have immediate relevance to terrestrial small rodent 
research applications, and since it is designed for ground or spaceflight use, 
would be readily adaptable to flight experiments as well. As Phase II 
progresses, the product will be refined for both ground and flight operations; 
depending on the feedback we receive from our market assessment and contract 
monitor, and on engineering constraints, the original MAUS design may evolve 
into a single ground- and spaceflight-compatible design, or into two separate 
products.

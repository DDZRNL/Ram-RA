<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal seeks to address the topic of developing an on-board propulsion device which will significantly increase capabilities and reduce costs for Earth science spacecraft.  The propulsion device which is proposed here is a microwave powered, electrothermal thruster which will utilized nitrous-oxide as a propellant. The device is referred to a MET-100, a Microwave Electrothermal Thruster which has a nominal power output of 150 W.  The thruster will utilized 300 W of spacecraft power and develop a specific impulse of 300 seconds.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The eventual goal of developing a low power nitrous-oxide fueled electrothermal thruster will be applicable to a NASA spacecraft and redefine the possible mission profiles in future space endeavors.   Future applications include interplanetary and exo-solar system missions for space exploration and search for extraterrestrial life. The cost of such endeavors will depend to a great extent on the specific impulse of the propulsion systems. This effort will create a foundation for a breakthrough technology that would potentially extend the mission range and scope of a variety of NASA missions.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Satellites orbiting the Earth find many civil and military functions.  Commercial satellite and military surveillance missions are moving towards development of clusters of satellites in low orbit.  A market study performed by RSI has concluded that the dominant portion of the satellite market within the next decade will be commercial communication satellites, with a large proportion being small-size LEO satellites in large constellations.  The LEO and MEO systems average annual deliveries of about 75 satellites per year over the next decade, with LEO systems comprising approximately 50 satellites per year.

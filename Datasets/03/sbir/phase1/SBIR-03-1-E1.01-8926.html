<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
During our Phase I SBIR research, we propose to integrate a novel low-temperature large-strain actuator technology into Fabry-Perot optical filters. The resulting ruggedized tunable optical filters will be able to withstand severe temperature extremes, shock and vibrations. The low-cost actuator contains integrated metrology, which is used to reference wavelengths and compensate for vibration and temperature fluctuations. Ruggedized tunable Fabry-Perot optical filters with integrated meterology will find imaging and LIDAR applications on airborne and spacecraft platforms. Commercially, the actuator technology will find applications in telecommunications and storage media devices.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The actuator technology will find application in a variety of tunable optical devices such as rugged tunable Fabry-Perot filters for imaging or LIDAR. These optical filters will be suitable for space or airborne flight where environmental extremes are a concern. Additional applications may include remote positioning applications aboard space telescopes or other alignment critical devices.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The low temperature actuator technology developed in Phase I will find use in a variety of high technology devices whose performance characteristics can be altered by changing the spacing between two plates. These devices include tunable optical components for dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) applications such as tunable optical light sources and optical receivers. Optical beam steering devices based  on the Phase I actuator technology can be configured into  optical add/drop multiplexers or optical cross-connects. Finally, low-cost nanopositioning actuators will enhance existing performance in applications such as optical or magnetic storage devices.

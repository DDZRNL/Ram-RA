<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Recognizing the needs and challenges facing NASA Earth Science for data input, manipulation and distribution, Mobitrum is proposing a ? Wireless Sensor Portal Technology? specifically for field personnel to send/receive digital and analog data from various sensors for data input, analysis and distribution purposes.  The need for development of cooperative communications at distributed sensor network encompasses the design of portable wireless computing device, which in real-time send and receive digital and analog data from variety of sensors, provide effective initial field verification of data, and distribute the data to various nodes and servers at collection, processing and decision hub site.  A Sensor Wireless Portal Technology is therefore needed for sensor communications at distributed and networked environments where the operations include multiple sensor data input, manipulation and distribution.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Mobitrum anticipates the following applications that NASA will be benefit from the proposed wireless sensor portal technology:
<br>
<br>1) Field communications device for spatial data input, manipulation and distribution.
<br>2) Sensor, measurement, and field verification applications.
<br>3) Biometric identification applications
<br>4) Data collaboration and distribution applications
<br>5) Condition-aware applications
<br>6) Location-aware applications

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The commercial market for wireless PDA based applications is growing tremendously in recent years. However, not many tools are available to allow information to be automatically transmitted to people for training and operations conducted anywhere wirelessly. Mobile professionals, educators, students, and individuals all stand to benefit from useful applications. Finance, business, transport operations, construction, health care, law enforcement (including homeland defense), emergency response and natural disaster management are all examples of areas where these tools could be highly leveraged thereby enhancing the information flow and coordination of activities.

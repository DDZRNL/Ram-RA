<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
	Visidyne proposes to develop a design for a small, lightweight, high resolution, in x, y, and z Doppler imager to assist in the guidance, navigation and control (GN&C) of satellites as for a chaser-target vehicle type scenario.  It could therefore be used for rendezvous, circumnavigation, inspection and docking.
<br>	Key elements for the design are Visidyne?s patented imaging LADAR or monocular 3-D camera design and an innovative, CCD chip extracted from MIT/Lincoln Laboratory, a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC).  A novel feature is the ability to cancel, null any gross relative motions between vehicles, thereby greatly improving on the achievable attitude, pose precision.

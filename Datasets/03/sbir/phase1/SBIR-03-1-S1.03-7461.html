<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Accurate absolute position, velocity, attitude and precise relative navigation are critical capabilities for unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) to improve their autonomy and reduce the mission life-cycle cost. This Phase I project investigates a low cost, miniature reconfigurable autonomous navigation system for all flight missions of the UAV. The proposed approach employs a flexible Federated Kalman filtering architecture and an onboard knowledge-based expert system to integrate a MEMS IMU, a multi-antenna GPS receiver, a Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) receiver, a data link receiver for DGPS corrections, and a radar altimeter. The configured integrated GPS/MEMS IMU system presents a high degree of navigation performance for UAV?s flight phases, release, cruise, approaching, and landing. The configured multi-antenna GPS interferometer/MEMS IMU integration provides a navigation solution for the UAV?s cruise operations, while the configured GPS/WAAS/MEMS IMU/Radar Altimeter integration provides precise approach and landing capabilities for the UAV. An intelligent neural network is applied to perform multi-sensor failure detection and isolation, and redundancy management. AGNC commercial products and AGNC US patents providing advanced integration technologies for MEMS IMU, GPS, WAAS, and radar altimeter will insure a successful project.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The technologies provided with this project can be of great benefit to many NASA applications, such as, the Airspace System (AS) program, the next Generation RLV program, a variety of platforms (piloted and unpiloted aircraft, balloons, terrestrial platforms, sea surface) for the Earth Science (ES) Enterprise program.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed system can be directly applied to the General Aviation (GA) navigation field. It provides reliable, accurate, and affordable navigation information to the pilot of a general aviation aircraft during all flight missions. It accommodates growth in air traffic management while reducing the aircraft accident rate.

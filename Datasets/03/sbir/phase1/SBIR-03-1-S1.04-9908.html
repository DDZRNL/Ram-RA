<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
To achieve the capability to affordably produce scores of nano-spacecraft for envisioned constellation missions, a new manufacturing process is needed to reduce the time and cost of fabricating and testing the nanosats.  However, to achieve substantial savings, a fundamental paradigm shift in how spacecraft are built must be made.  Current spacecraft are built with the same processes and procedures used in the 1960?s, whereas electronics technology has gone far beyond that of the early days.  So while the size of satellites has steadily decreased, the manufacturing time has not experienced similar reductions.  Given that labor to build a satellite remains the single largest element of cost, the opportunity remains to dramatically shorten program schedules and lower cost through the infusion of new techniques and innovative processes in the construction of structures, electronics, harnessing and most importantly the testing process.  AeroAstro proposes to set aside the conventional rule book and explore a broad range of Design for Manufacture material and process innovations that could lead to a dramatic shortening of the micro/nano-satellite manufacturing timeline with concomitant savings in unit manufacturing cost.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The creation of a new nanosat manufacturing process would substantially improve the affordability of nanosat constellation missions, such as MagCon or MMF,  perhaps reducing the cost per spacecraft sufficiently to allow adding additional satellites to augment the constellation and enhance the mission's science.  Additionally, this capability could enable a broad variety of other nanosat missions, specifically those that do not meet NASA's current cost/benefit threshold.  Alternatively, the techniques and processes in the new approach might be adapted to the fabrication of other spacecraft types and sizes.   <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
While few other agencies or organizations have NASA?s interest in the use of nanosat constellations for science missions, there are a variety of opportunities which would benefit from a low-cost nanosat manufacturing process.  For instance, the low cost nanosats could enable the creation of a commercial nanosat communications constellation, or perhaps a nanosat remote sensing constellation.  Additionally, the military may take advantage of the capability to produce munitions-grade spacecraft for tactical space missions.  Alternatively, the military might use the basic nanosat as a core spacecraft, but modified for a specific mission.

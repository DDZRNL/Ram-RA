<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA?s future space science missions cannot be realized without the state of the art energy storage devices which require high energy density, high reliability, and low cost dielectric materials. T/J Technologies proposes to develop and demonstrate high energy density, fast-rise, and high reliability dielectric materials for these applications. The key element of our approach is the development and demonstration, in a breadboard configuration, the feasibility of a new high energy density polymeric dielectric film based on organic-inorganic nanocomposites with tailored structure and composition that will increase the dielectric constant and dielectric strength of the host polymer, polypropylene. This material will possess the high reliability, high dielectric constant, and high dielectric strength needed to develop energy storage devices such as capacitors that will meet or exceed the stored power system needs for the aforementioned applications. Future work of this proposed research, during phase II, will be mainly focused on developing all the associated technologies. The research will enable the development of high-energy electrical storage systems that is critical for NASA space mission as well as for tactical and strategic pulse power applications such as electric armor, particle beam accelerators, high power microwave sources and ballistic missile applications

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed nano-reinforced composite material will enable the production of reliable, high energy density power storage units such as film capacitors for NASA space missions. Due to the unique, nano-scale, and inter-molecular reinforcement within the composite material, in comparison with polypropylene, it will possess improved thermal, mechanical, and other properties besides the dielectric properties. It may serve as a new class of engineering plastic and a cheap replacement for some polymeric components. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed composite material may find its use in the development of high-energy electrical storage systems required for tactical and strategic pulse power applications such as electric armor, particle beam accelerators, high power microwave sources and ballistic missile applications. It may also benefit some future commercial defibrillator systems which higher energy density capacitors are needed to achieve size and weight reduction.

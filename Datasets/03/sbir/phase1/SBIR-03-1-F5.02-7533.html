<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
SiWave proposes to develop an innovative, ultra-compact, high resolution, long range LADAR system to produce a 3D map of the exterior of any object in space such as the Space Shuttle, the International Space Station or a future Space Solar Power Satellite to inspect for damage.  Our approach combines coherent optical detection with a small transmitting beam for high-speed scanning and fast electronics for image processing.  The use of coherent detection overcomes the problems of weak signals (due to the limited power) and signal fluctuations caused by surface roughness. The resulting LADAR system weighs less than 300 gm and has a resolution of 1 mm at 10 m.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This development will result in a low power, LADAR system for inspecting space craft in space.  This is critical for assessing damage to the Internation Space Station or spacecraft during launch or maneuvering or docking and do to formulate a remediation strategy if warranted.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercial applications for this technology are in high resolution 3D imaging, laser communication and blood flow measurement based on Doppler shift.

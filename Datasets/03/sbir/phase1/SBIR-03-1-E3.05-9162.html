<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Locating, summarizing and presenting large collections of Earth science data in a highly distributed and networked environment is critical in NASA's mission for Earth Sciences. Technologies supporting management, storage, search and retrieval of very large, distributed, geo-spatial earth science data volumes are urgently needed to cope with the impending data survivability crisis. For instance, the EOSDIS archive data growth rate is currently about 1 petabyte/year. NRC's Committee on Coping with Increasing Demands on Government Data Centers recently made a series of recommendations on which emerging technologies can help data centers meet user needs and build and maintain the long-term record of environmental change. In this proposal, we propose to design, develop and prototype Extrieva - a low cost scalable Archive Storage Management System innovation, which embraces several of the NRC technology recommendations. In particular, Extrieva is a disk-based solution as assessed by NRC to be now competitive with tape for long-term, archival-class storage. Moreover, with its self-management and automation features implemented over commodity Linux clusters using distributed indexing and load balancing algorithms, Extrieva offers a low cost scalable solution with unprecedented ease of management addressing the needs of EOSDIS' diverse global users base.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAAC's) need the type of scalable archive storage management system offered by Extrieva. The NASA Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Core System (ECS) Synergy Program provides a strong example of the need for better archiving solutions. In particular we will look to provide NASA with technology infusion from our prototype as recommended in the SEEDS (Strategic Evolution of ESE Data Systems) findings. Extrieva will enable NASA to bring more of the permanent archives from the data centers such as the National Space Science Data Center into active archives.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Extrieva's has applications at NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS) CLASS (Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System) program, NIMA's current initiative in relying on commercial satellite imagery for intelligence, homeland security and environmental response, NARA's Electronic Records Archives (ERA) program, and National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP) from the National Library of Congress. Commercial applications include PAC (Picture Archives and Communications) in health care, enterprise email, voicemail and financial record archive management.

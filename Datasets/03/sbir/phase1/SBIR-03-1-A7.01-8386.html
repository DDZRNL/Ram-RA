<P><B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>To remain competitive, the US 
aerospace industry must continually improve system performance (e.g. increased 
adaptation and autonomy), enhance safety (e.g., fault tolerant systems), and 
reduce costs. These improvements demand avionics software that is orders of 
magnitude more complex than that used in current operational systems. While 
software complexity is increasing, there is a tremendous (and appropriate) 
pressure to ensure that new designs are safer to operate than the simpler 
systems they replace. In many cases (e.g., damage-adaptive control), methods 
that can improve vehicle performance are not used because verification and 
validation (V&amp;V) tools that help ensure the complex system will not behave 
in an unexpected way are not available. The proposed research will lay the 
groundwork for such a tool by building on prior work by the authors in four 
unique areas: (1) the tool will work in the MATLAB/Simulink environment and will 
be easy to set up and operate, (2) the tool will be modular and allow easy 
integration of a variety of closed-form analysis methods, (3) the tool will aid 
in evaluating system performance as well as stability, and (4) the tool will 
assist in piloted simulation and flight test design. 
<P><B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>The 
proposed technology is relevant to the Global Civil Aviation goal and Enabling 
Technology requirements of the NASA Aero-Space Enterprise. NASA is keenly 
interested in pushing the envelope in the area of smart, adaptive, and 
intelligent aerospace vehicles; however, in many cases, the algorithms, methods, 
and software for such systems are ahead of our ability to verify and validate 
them. The proposed technology directly addresses this issue and will be 
essential if the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of such systems is to be 
advanced. 
<P><B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>The 
initial market is the US Aerospace industry. As the industry moves to implement 
advanced control technologies in next generation vehicles, and to retrofit the 
existing military and commercial fleets to improve safety and performance, 
V&amp;V tools that can pave the way to certification will become essential. 
Additionally, the flexible design of the proposed tool will allow it to have a 
broader appeal. The general performance evaluation framework for Simulink 
systems will appeal to a broad range of MATLAB users, making the algorithms 
developed under this effort appropriate for marketing as a general use MATLAB 
toolbox.

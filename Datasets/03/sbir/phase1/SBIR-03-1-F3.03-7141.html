<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Improving safety while increasing the pace of space launches requires improved communications capability. An increasing volume of real-time data from numerous sensors and systems can be transmitted to the ground if connecting links can be improved. One way to accomplish this is to use existing commercial satellites to supplement overburdened NASA communications systems. Used as an adjunct service, additional commercial capacity would act to increase launch safety, allowing an increased amount of data to be transponded to ground systems without detracting from the reliability of existing communication systems. Existing NASA links could continue to be used for mission critical requirements.
<br>Limitations of two technologies prevent the transponding large amounts of data via commercial satellites. The first is a conformal antenna technology that can provide high gain by steering its beam toward the GEO satellite. The second is high-speed modem technology that can track a remote modem despite the wide dynamics experienced during launch and maneuvers. 
<br>Paratek proposes to design a dual-beam, passive, electronically steered phased array (utilizing our proprietary Parascan?, phase shifters) and a highly dynamic modem to provide the communications link for spaced-based range applications. The system will leverage commercial Intelsat C-Band transponder network (4 GHz & 6 GHz).

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA (and DoD) launch schedules for ELVs is facing increased activity in addition to the commercial interest for both ELVs as well as the significant commercial space efforts for manned reusable launch vehicles (RLVs) that could utilize such a system.  These organizations must be able to use commercial SATCOM as their telemetry link once they are down range. Such a system could also be used for space-based links between NASA systems.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Live SATCOM telemetry for commercial airlines for a condition-based or real-time black box down link to the airlines and/or the FAA would be an excellent application. Here the conformal antennas would be integrated into the airframe structure. The product could also support high data rate telephony or Internet connectivity for distribution to passengers.
<br>Derivative applications include SATCOM terminals that would utilize either the individual components/subsystems developed under this effort or the entire system (i.e., a modem to electronically steered beam antenna (gain in the 8-12 dBi range) system can provide a very cost competitive solution for voice and data services)

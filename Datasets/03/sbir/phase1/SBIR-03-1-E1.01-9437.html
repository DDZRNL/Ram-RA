<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The design of a UAV mounted Fire Mapper system is proposed. The system consists of a multi-band imaging sensor, a data processing system and a data communication system that are capable of detecting fires and providing fire information in near real time to an Incident Command Team. The sensor incorporates high performance QWIP IR detectors and a compact, lightweight scanner derived from an earlier NASA SBIR program. Location and platform attitude measurements are made and this information is combined with a DEM and applied to the image sensor output, producing fire and terrain image information that is GIS compatible. The Phase I work will assess available technologies, develop algorithms, evaluate tradeoffs and produce a preliminary design for a prototype system that can be built and flight demonstrated in Phase II with a NASA supplied UAV platform.
<br>
<br>To accomplish these goals, the program will leverage the background of the NASA science team, the USDA Forest Service fire crews, SenSyTech airborne imaging experience and other SenSyTech customer experience; all of which have contributed to methods and systems for wildland fire detection and mapping.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Fire Mapper will demonstrate an important operational utility for UAV?s.  Data from Fire Mapper will permit comparison with MODIS and other satellites to evaluate the use of new high performance thermal IR detectors that may be used on future satellite systems for detection and mapping of forest fires.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Successful completion of this work will open the commercialization of UAV?s for fire mapping.  SenSyTech believes there are additional non-UAV markets for fire mapping systems such as this to U.S and foreign government agencies and to commercial aerial survey companies.  The Fire Mapper package has other potential applications including Homeland Security, where it could detect campfires of aliens along U.S. borders and to monitor pipelines for terrorist damage.  Any ?emergency response? requirement where a quick overall view of areas damaged by tornadoes, floods, hurricanes or earthquakes is foreseen as additional applications.

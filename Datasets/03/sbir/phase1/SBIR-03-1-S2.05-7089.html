<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Integration of three proven, non-contact, optical metrology techniques with an emerging new polishing approach in a single machine will enable the rapid production of large aspheric mirrors with nanometer-class overall accuracy, excellent smoothness, and nearly arbitrary radius of curvature (concave or convex) and aspheric form.
<br>
<br>Two of the metrology approaches are a multi-point profilometer that we have previously demonstrated to have nanometer-level accuracy for low spatial frequencies; and a curvature-measuring profilometer that we have previously demonstrated to have 0.1-nanometer-level accuracy for mid-spatial frequencies.  In addition, we propose the simple addition of a scatterometry-based measurement head for high spatial frequencies.  The baseline polishing approach is fluid jet polishing, which has been shown to be capable of both fine grinding and polishing. A new understanding of the synergism of these metrology techniques with ductile polishing promises to take in situ metrology and optical fabrication to a major new level.
<br>
<br>NASA is continually pushing the frontier in astronomical and earth-observing optical systems.  Many of these systems, whether they operate in the x-ray (at normal incidence), ultraviolet, visible, or infrared, have the meter-class (and beyond) optics that would greatly benefit from this technology.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Planned NASA programs which could utilize the proposed optical fabrication/metrology machine include the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the High Resolution X-ray Explorer (HIREX), a variety of MIDEX missions, the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM), and the Planet Finder (TPF).<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A major application would be the continued pursuit by the semiconductor industry of better and better aspheric mirrors as the operating wavelengths shrink.  Required surface qualities are headed below the 0.1 nm rms range as Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV) lithography comes to life.  The metrology and fabrication approaches for such mirrors are extremely limited, and technology such as ours could be an important adjunct to other specialized techniques.

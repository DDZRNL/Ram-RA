<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Clear Science Corp. proposes to develop computational methods for designing active flow control systems on aerospace vehicles with the primary objective of controlling lift, drag, and flow separation.  Simulated control inputs will include moving boundaries for aerodynamic shaping and aspirating walls for virtual shaping and separation control.  The software will include model order reduction, system state estimation, integration of low-dimensional models and estimators with high-order CFD-based models for control-in-the-loop simulations, and the integration of turbulence models with control models.  CSC is developing reduced-order flow control models for laminar, incompressible flow based on a proper orthogonal decomposition of the primitive flow variables, and we will extend the methods to compressible formulations with conserved variables and turbulence models.  We will develop and demonstrate our computational methods using LaRC's CFD code, CFL3D.  Control models and estimators will be modular in the form of both embedded and pre-processing subroutines, enabling off-line and in-the-loop control design and testing. The project will include the application of modeling and estimation techniques to moving-mesh problems for control simulations with time-dependent system disturbances (e.g. changing angles of attack) and wing warping control input.   Phase I work includes a demonstration of the technical merit of the tool and the development of a detailed Phase II work plan.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovation offers new computational tools for designing next-generation air vehicles. The project represents an enabling technology for high-lift systems that ties directly to NASA?s Breakthrough Vehicle Technology (BVT) Program, the Morphing and Aerospace Concepts to Test (ASCoT) Project, and its Micro-Aero-Adaptive Flow Control (MAAC) element. Integrating methods of modeling flow control systems with existing NASA software will provide in-house tools to complement wind tunnel/flight tests that are ongoing under the aegis of the Efficient Aerodynamic Shapes and Integration component of the 21st Century Aircraft Technology (TCAT) Programs. All of these programs reflect NASA?s commitment to the advancement of commercial aviation. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The commercial product to be developed is integrated CFD software for designing and simulating active flow control systems in aerospace and industrial applications. The corresponding market includes designers of aerospace, automotive, and industrial systems for which flow control is critical. Potential applications of the software include control system designs for high-lift wings on commercial aircraft (enabling short take-offs and alleviating airport congestion), noise control in aircraft and land vehicles, high-lift blades in rotorcraft, low-distortion jet engine inlets, and high-mixing combustors.  Integrating the software into a validated NASA code and demonstrating it on cutting-edge problems will attract commercial customers from the aerospace community and from related manufacturing industries.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Evaluation of the technical and scientific feasibility of developing a model and sensor for the analytical optical determination of particle biogeochemical properties in natural waters is proposed.  The objective of the proposed work is 1) to develop an inversion model, termed the General Optical-Biogeochemical Inversion (GOBI), for the analytical determination of particulate organic carbon (POC) and other biogeochemical properties from optical measurements, and 2) to develop an in-situ optical sensor (in Phase 2) for measurements of POC and other biogeochemical properties in natural waters based on the GOBI.  For the first time, the model would allow in-situ analytical determination of POC irrespective of changing particle composition.  Current empirical models are not applicable in case II waters. The GOBI model will be based on recently peer-review published analytical inversion models authored by the Principal Investigator and collaborators.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In-situ, analytical measurements of biogeochemical properties of particles in seawater are needed for remote sensing algorithm development in case I and case II waters.  Compatibility with autonomous platforms will enable extensive data sets to be collected in concert with remote sensing imagery over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. NASA research areas involving carbon cycling, global climate change, sediment transport, riverine particle deposition at continental margins, harmful algal blooms, and general water quality monitoring all require an understanding of the concentration and composition of particulate matter in seawater.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are numerous science applications for in-situ measurements of biogeochemical properties such as POC and TSM that range from carbon cycling studies to environmental monitoring.  Coastal monitoring and observation through the US Ocean Observing program and GOOS is expected to be one of our fastest growing market segments in years to come.  We also expect the GOBI sensor to be applicable to many freshwater research pursuits.

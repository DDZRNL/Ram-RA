<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The overall goal of the proposed program by Epitaxial Technologies is to develop a compact, low-cost, low power, low noise and ultra-sensitive Avalanche Photo Diode (APD) arrays with built-in optical pre-amplification (in addition to internal electrical gain) and having a fill factor and bandwidth of 90% and 5.0 GHz respectively. We will accomplish this by developing novel APD structures and integrating the APDs with vertical cavity semiconductor optical amplifiers (VCSOAs). In Phase I of this project, we will design, model and simulate the performance of the APD arrays with built-in optical pre-amplification having -47 dBm sensitivity and lower noise than existing APD operating at 1550 nm. We will design and fabricate the 4 x 4 photodetector array with internal optical gain of 20 dB and assess its performance. In Phase II, we will design, fabricate and test the 256 x 256 arrays along with monolithic photoreceivers using detectors having built-in optical preamplifier and internal gain. In particular, we will combine photodetector arrays having built-in optical preamplifier with the Readout Integrated Circuits (ROIC) using an innovative bonding technique at the wafer level, in order to demonstrate single photon counting by operating in the Geiger-mode for solid state imaging LADAR receivers.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This innovative technology will have numerous important NASA applications, such as free space laser communication systems for intersatellite communications, and near-IR spectroscopy, 3-dimensional imaging LADAR for geographical mapping of terrestrial or extra-terrestrial features, navigational guidance, surveillance through foliage, forestry inspection and agricultural monitoring. As a position sensitive sensor its is suitable for tracking satellites, vehicle docking, navigation, and guidance, photon correlation spectroscopy, low power consumption but very sensitive ground based beacons. Other applications include earth remote sensing to survey crops, forest foliage, and natural resources and measurement of the spatial and temporal variation of water and clouds for atmospheric research. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Potential DOD applications include: airborne 3-D imaging LADAR transmitter/sensor (and sophisticated image processing) to penetrate dense trees and camouflage in order to detect, identify, and characterize targets on the battlefield such as tanks and armored personnel carriers, missile seekers, passive imaging camera with the capability of generating real-time displays of imaging scene. Commercial applications include: commercial receivers operating in the 1.1-1.5 micron wavelength range for fiber optic communications and free space communication and production monitoring and control in the automotive, and steel industries.

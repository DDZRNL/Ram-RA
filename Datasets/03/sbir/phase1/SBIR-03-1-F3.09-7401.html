<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
There is a need for high energy (~ 200 Wh/kg) and high power (> 500 W/kg) density rechargeable Li-ion batteries that are safe and reliable for several space and consumer applications.  State-of-the-art rechargeable Li-ion batteries are incapable of fulfilling these stringent requirements.  We propose to develop high energy and power density nanocomposite cathodes that will lead to thermally stable, high energy and power density Li-ion batteries.  Working in collaboration with a leading developer of Li-ion polymer batteries, in Phase I, we will demonstrate that it is possible to produce a stable and high power density nanostructured cathode, along with good energy density.  As part of Phase I work, the electrochemical properties of these nanostructured cathodes will be evaluated in Li and Li-ion test cells with a liquid electrolyte.  In Phase II, prototype batteries will be fabricated and tested for performance, along with the optimization and scaling of the nanocomposite synthesis process.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Rechargeable Li-ion polymer batteries are becoming attractive for several military and space applications.  These batteries are being used in government furnished equipment (e.g., camera, laptop computers and camcorders) for space applications.  Additionally, Li-ion polymer batteries can potentially replace Ni-MH batteries, which are being used for several space applications, including supplement battery pack (called Areba rechargeable battery pack) to power astronaut?s various accessories (e.g., wrist computer, glove heaters) during Extravehicular Activities (EVAs), and Avionic batteries (8 modules connected in parallel, each module ~ 28V) for the Crew Return Vehicle, X-38<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The broader impact of the proposed program will be the availability of economical, high power and high energy density secondary Li-ion polymer batteries for several military and consumer applications.  The cathode in Li-ion batteries is a very important constituent and accounts for a worldwide market of more than $250 million/year.  Consequently, an economical, high energy density cathode has a major role to play as Li-ion batteries evolve in year to come.

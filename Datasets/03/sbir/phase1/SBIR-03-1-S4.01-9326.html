<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Thorleaf Research, Inc. proposes to develop a miniaturized high pressure atmospheric sampling inlet system for sample acquisition in extreme planetary environments, such as those encountered in the lower troposphere of Venus or the atmospheres of the gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. This addresses a key technology gap for planetary studies, mainly how to acquire and prepare samples for in situ analysis while meeting challenging mass, volume and power constraints. Although miniaturized mass spectrometers and other low power instruments are under development by NASA for in situ measurements, the great potential of such instrumentation for exploration of the Solar System will not be realized without complementary developments in the technology for collecting and preparing samples for analysis.  Our proposed approach collects an atmospheric gas micro-sample at high pressure and transfers it into a protected low pressure environment within a small pressure housing for analysis by GC/MS, mass spectrometry or other techniques that inherently require low pressures for operation. This new technology will enable in situ measurement of the composition and key isotope ratios in high pressure planetary atmospheres down to trace levels.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The primary application of Thorleaf Research?s proposed high pressure atmospheric sampling inlet system for planetary atmospheres is to provide enabling technology to help meet NASA needs for future NASA Discovery Program Missions in extreme planetary environments such as the lower troposphere of Venus and atmospheres of the gas giants.  Our sampling inlet system will be especially useful when coupled to new miniature mass spectrometer technology, such as that currently under development at NASA/JPL.  The system can also be readily adapted to many other types of detectors of interest to NASA. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Analysis of commercial instrumentation markets shows that two of the three major growth areas for analytical instrumentation are real-time analysis and environmental monitoring, with projected annual growth rates of more than 15%. Our modular design approach for the high pressure atmospheric sampling inlet system will help it be adapted for high pressure measurement needs in scientific, energy exploration and environmental monitoring applications. Thus, technical developments in the proposed program could have a significant market impact.

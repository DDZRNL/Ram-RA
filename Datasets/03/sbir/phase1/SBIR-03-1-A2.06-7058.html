<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Laser induced thermal acoustics (LITA) is a nonintrusive, transient-grating optical technique that provides
<br>simultaneous high-accuracy measurements of velocity, sound-speed, and thermal diffusivity among other
<br>parameters. In a fluid of known composition, sound speed and thermal diffusivity are readily correlated to
<br>temperature and density. Thus LITA provides a measurement of thermodynamic state. We are developing a
<br>computer-controlled semi-portable LITA system for robust, long-baseline measurements. This novel system
<br>automatically adjusts its own alignment to optimize accuracy. In prior work, LITA velocimetry was incorporated
<br>into this system and demonstrated. System level requirements for multi point LITA measurements were identified
<br>and system components, which as a whole, meet these requirements were designed or identified. In the proposed
<br>effort, elements of the design will be separately validated and will then be incorporated into a complete system for
<br>delivery to NASA in Phase II. By providing velocimetry and multi point capability the proposed system will beideal
<br>for high-value ground-test experiments.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Because LITA is the first non-intrusive flow diagnostic that can be used to measure instantaneous
<br>thermodynamicstate and velocity simultaneously at a point in an unseeded flow, it may replace combinations of
<br>other diagnostic tools such as laser Doppler velocimetry and intrusive probes in aerodynamic ground test facilities.
<br>Additionally, LITA provides accurate measurements over a wide range of conditions including high-pressure and
<br>reacting flows, making it a valuable technique for combustor and chemical reactor test and development. Because of
<br>its automatic alignment, calibration, and data analysis, the high-measurement-rate LITA-based instrument we
<br>propose will open new markets in instruments for aeronautics, propulsion, combustion, and industrial process
<br>systems research and development.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Laser Induced Thermal Acoustics (LITA) is the first non-intrusive flow diagnostic that can be used to
<br>simultaneously measure instantaneous thermo-dynamic state and velocity at a point in the flow. As such it may
<br>serve as a replacement for combinations of other diagnostic tools such as laser doppler velocimetry. Additionally,
<br>because LITA works accurately over a wide range of flow conditions including high pressure and reacting flows,
<br>LITA offers a valuable tool for combustor and chemical reactor test and development. APRI anticipates a significant
<br>market for LITA based instruments.

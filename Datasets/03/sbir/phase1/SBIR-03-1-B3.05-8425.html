<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Small Business Innovation Research program will develop a novel surface-enhanced Raman (SER) sensor that will perform real-time chemical analysis of urine.  It will provide key physiologic information to monitor astronaut health and indicate appropriate preventative treatment.  The Phase I program will demonstrate feasibility by establishing the ability of sol-gel chemistry to both select key chemicals: amino acids, biomarkers, drugs, and metabolites, and enhance their Raman signals.  The Phase II program will design and build a prototype ?On-Demand Urine Analyzer? for ground-based measurement.  This will include interfacing the SER sensor between a sampling system and a Raman instrument.  The Phase II program will also design a low mass, low power version of this system (Figure 1) to be used on the International Space Station (ISS) and other vehicles employed during extended space flight missions (e.g. Mars expedition).

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed on-demand urine analyzer will benefit NASA by providing key physiologic information to monitor astronaut health and indicate appropriate preventative treatment during shuttle, space station, and future extended missions in space.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed on-demand urine analyzer could be used to detect kidney diseases (e.g. polycyclic kidney disease), detect metabolic disorders in newborns (phenylketonuria), monitor drug administration during medical operations (especially chemotherapeutic drugs), and detect drug abuse.  It will also be invaluable to the pharmaceutical industry, where it can provide trace analysis of new drugs as they are tested during drug development.

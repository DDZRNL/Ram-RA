<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used as an analysis tool to help the designer gain greater understanding of the fluid flow phenomena involved in the components being designed. The next step in the design process is to modify the design to improve the componentys performance, typically performed manually by the designer in a trial and error fashion. The innovations proposed herein will provide important advances in the state-of-the-art of automatic CFD shape deformation and optimization software.  Optimal Solutions Software (OSS) has been developing a software program called Sculptor, which provides capabilities to perform shape deformation and optimization in CFD design.  When the innovations proposed herein are included in Sculptor, and coupled with NASAys Stennis Space Centerys (SSC) CFD code, a truly innovative and significant design tool will be available to perform automatic shape optimization.  Sculptor can find new geometric shapes, in a timely manner that likely would not have been discovered without its use.  Therefore Sculptor is an innovator in and of itself, when used by knowledgeable engineers.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The innovative tools created and included into Sculptor will allow NASA engineers to perform shape optimization and computational fluid dynamic design quickly and efficiently in many areas including:
<br>-  Rocket motors: nozzles, combustors, injectors, diffusers, other rocket motor components, 
<br>-  Heat exchangers, 
<br>-  Aerodynamic shapes of aircraft, spacecraft, automobiles, trucks, etc.
<br>-  Valves, general pipefittings, elbows, T-fittings, etc.
<br>Practically any component's performance that involves fluid and/or heat flow or chemically reacting flow could be optimized with these tools.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The same tools created in this project will be able to help Non-NASA government and commercial entities solve complex CFD-based shape optimization problems such as:
<br>-  Automobile intake manifolds, exhaust manifolds, air conditioning ducts, fans, radiators, external aerodynamic shapes, etc.
<br>-  Aircraft and airfoil shapes, turbomachinery, intakes, diffussors, combustors, etc.
<br>-  Plastic mold injection ports, thicknesses of molds, etc.
<br>-  Reactor design for efficient mixing, combusting, potentially reducing polutants being created in the reactors.
<br>-  Practically any component that involves fluid and/or heat flow as well as chemically reacting flow could be optimized with these tools.

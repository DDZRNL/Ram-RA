<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Los Gatos Research, Inc. (LGR) proposes to develop a flight ready instrument, capable of deployment on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to simultaneously measure in situ aerosol extinction and scattering coefficients.  The instrument will be lightweight, compact, robust, integrate into UAV platforms, and be capable of simultaneously measuring aerosol extinction and scattering coefficients to 0.1 Mm-1 with a 1 second sampling rate.  This highly innovative instrument, based on cavity-enhanced laser spectroscopy, will operate autonomously, and continuously stream data for storage or downlink.  By significantly increasing the speed, sensitivity, and accuracy of in situ aerosol optical property measurements this instrument will enhance NASA flight studies of atmospheric aerosols and their effects on the radiative balance of Earths atmosphere.  These studies seek to identify how aerosol optical properties vary through the lower troposphere, and further determine under what conditions surface-based measurements of these properties be used to calculate the direct aerosol radiative forcing from a measured aerosol optical depth.  These studies are also of great use in determining how in situ measurements compare to remote sensing measurements.  The ability to gather in situ aerosol optical property data from UAV-based instrumentation will both complement and greatly enhance existing ground based and flight instrumentation.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA commercial applications for this in situ aerosol instrumentation include a compact, lightweight instrument targeted at manned or UAV research flights in the troposphere, and an autonomous, ruggedized instrument package targeted at research flights in the stratosphere.  We anticipate interest in a tropospheric flight instrument from various US Government laboratories performing atmospheric research, including NASA-Ames Research Center, NASA Langley, NRL/Monterey, DOE, and NOAA/CMDL.  The rugged, autonomous, and high-sensitivity requirements of stratospheric flight instrumentation would also be well served by this platform, but this is a highly specialized, boutique market segment that we would expect to fulfill on a contract basis.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Non-NASA commercial applications include a low-cost instrument targeted at ground based research / automated monitoring stations, and OEM particle monitors.  Ground-based instruments will be marketed to regulatory monitoring customers including power plants, factories, chemical plants, airports, public buildings, and various oversight agencies.  We expect an early research and testing market, gradually evolving to voluntary and then mandatory compliance driven monitoring.  For particle monitoring, high performance semiconductor manufacturing is evolving toward containment of the microenvironment within the tools and docking modules that transfer wafers between tools, and there is a strong need for ultrasensitive, in situ particle monitoring (ISPM) systems.

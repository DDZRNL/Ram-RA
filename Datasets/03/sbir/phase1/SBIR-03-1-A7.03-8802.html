<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
An electrochemical power plant is proposed by MicroCell Technologies to provide power to terrestrial flight platforms. Our power plant is based upon a proton exchange membrane fuel cell that is coupled with a hydrogen fuel supply cartridge that will provide readily scalable power levels up to 1 kW of power at 24 VDC. The hydrogen supply cartridge may be readily exchanged between missions helping to shorten the turn-around time for the flight vehicle. The design of the fuel cell power plant is based upon using hydrogen and ambient air that will operate over varying temperatures, humidity, and altitude to provide reliable power to the air vehicle. During the phase I program, we will demonstrate the feasibility of our power plant operating at a lower module wattage near 50 watts with an integrated fuel supply that will last for 12 hours. A phase II program will develop and deliver a 1000 W, 24VDC power plant that may operate for up to 12 hours.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
	The success of this electrochemical power plant for terrestrial air-vehicles will result in a robust electrical generator with energy densities of 2300 W-hr/kg and 2480 W-hr/liter, capacities that are significantly greater than that attainable with present day batteries. The major benefits of the proposed approach are a high power density and specific energy density that are attainable independent of orientation and attitude, a feature that allows wider applicability and usage of the fuel cell generator.
<br>This improved power generator will enable NASA to deploy terrestrial flight platforms for longer durations or to carry heavier payloads since the generator has a high gravimetric and volumetric energy density.
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The applications of this improved energy storage system may be directed toward commercial markets that typically employ batteries to obtain higher energy density or longer run-time performance. This proposed technology is well suited toward replacing batteries with a multi-billion dollar market potential.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
An AutoCategorizing Knowledge Management Engine ("AKM") will automate key capabilities for both human-human and human-agent collaboration tools in aerospace information systems:
<br>*  Automatic organization of shared and new information, by a standards-based interface to other knowledge tools, based on an effective auto-categorization engine;
<br>*  Immediate incorporation of new knowledge into auto-updated taxonomies, and extension for new topics; 
<br>*  Automatically updated knowledge organizations for groups, individuals, and specialized activities;
<br>*  Knowledge discovery of new and emerging themes in data and discussions.
<br>The result is that AKM will:
<br>*  Improve usability and collaboration potential for shared sites of working, learning, and discussion;
<br>*  Help to build communities of practice for growing technical efforts such as the NASA Taxonomy;
<br>*  Speed and improve sharing of knowledge within NASA and with its larger community;
<br>*  Help to evolve the shared, developing, interoperating NASA ontologies.
<br>AKM will be prototyped in Phase I as an extension of three existing products (Taxonomize's Auto-Categorizer, Resource Aid, and Stochastic Analyzer) and applied to selected NASA information programs.  In Phase II AKM will be productized for extended NASA, government, and commercial application.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
AKM can augment environments and programs that seek to make knowledge more readily available for individual or collaborative use.  NASA has several current collaborative initiatives, including those in ARC Collaborative and Assistant Systems (e.g., SemanticOrganizer projects ? ScienceOrganizer, InvestigationOrganizer, Greenhouse Collaboratory); the NASA Grid of CICT's Computing, Networking, and Information Systems project; the NASA Taxonomy; NASA Technology Portal; and NASA's association with the National Airspace System (such as NAS's Unified Decision Management System ? UDMS).  AKM is not a full collaboratory itself, but a high-powered acceleration engine to improve the availability and usage of knowledge in collaborative and multi-usage environments.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Taxonomize plans to market AKM to augment government and commercial information-management products: including ERP, data mining, eLearning, and enterprise portals; to customers who seek adaptive, anticipatory, and discovery-aiding uses of knowledge.  Besides collaborative and investigatory uses, financial and analytical areas also seek to identify emerging themes and trends.    AKM can be licensed as a module for KM tools such as the Inxight, Broadvision, Microsoft, IBM, and Autonomy platforms.  AKM can be marketed either as an embedded component or as an ASP or web service: i.e., a middleware accessory for information portals and other knowledge-management tools.

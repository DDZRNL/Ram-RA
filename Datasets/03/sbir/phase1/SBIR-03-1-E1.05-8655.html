<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA is committed to measuring precipitation on a global scale. In 1997, NASA launched the Tropical Rain Measuring Mission which carried the first spaceborne precipitation radar (PR). Operating at 13.8 GHz, the PR demonstrated the potential of spaceborne radars to map global precipitation. To improve rainfall estimates, the next generation system being proposed for the NASA Global Precipitation Mission is a dual-wavelength (Ku/Ka-band) PR. While operating at two different frequencies will yield additional information on the drop size distribution, it will also mean a significant increase in size, mass, power consumption and cost. 
<br>
<br>The proposed Phase I effort will investigate the required innovations to design and build a Ka-band differential frequency PR. Such a system will potentially provide the same advantages as a dual-band PR without the same increase in size, mass, power and cost. This Phase I study will focus on developing a wide-band (10% BW) Ka-band amplifier, a wide-band matched-beam single aperture antenna and a novel Ka-band differential frequency PR system design. This design will lead to a prototype system that can be flown on high-altitude platforms such as the NASA ER-2.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed novel airborne Ka-band DFPR system will support GPM efforts by providing essential data to improve precipitation retrievals, aide in calibration/validation studies, and potentially lead to a lower cost, smaller spaceborne system that would enable GPM to fly more active sensors leading to improved spatial and temporal coverage. Since the Ka-band DFPR system will be highly sensitive to clouds, it can provide crucial information in precipitation initiation studies and can support the NASA CloudSat mission.  Further, the precipitation measurement capabilities of a follow-on mission to CloudSat will be greatly enhanced by including this system as part of the payload.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed Ka-band DFPR system, with a lower cost and size compared to its dual-wavelength counterpart, will enable many research institutions; such as university, government and private sector research labs, to advance their efforts in the areas of precipitation studies, weather forecasting and long-term climate forecasting. With billions of dollars being spent on weather products and forecasting, a ground-based compact version of this system will improve local QPE measurements and forecasts. Initial market research shows a strong need for such a system and RSS plans to aggressively pursue this opportunity.

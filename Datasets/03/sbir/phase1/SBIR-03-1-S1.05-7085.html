<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Aquilent, Inc. proposes to support the effort of Virtual Space Physics Observatory (VSPO) by developing services to expand the VSPO search capabilities, developing tools that facilitate metadata conversion and input, and integrating existing standalone visualization applications to operate in the VSPO environment. 
<br>
<br>This proposal seeks to:
<br>?	Enable scientists to execute advanced search queries. (Queries which rely on more then product description metadata)
<br>?	Enable scientists to utilize VSPO middleware capabilities directly from visualization applications.
<br>?	Develop services that provide support for advanced search queries. Integrate these services into the VSPO architecture.
<br>?	Develop a metadata editor tool, designed to simplify metadata entry/mapping associated with describing data products. 
<br>?	Integrate standalone visualization applications such as ViSBARD[1] to work seamlessly with VSPO middleware. 
<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The visualization component of this proposal, the adaptation of ViSBARD, has potential NASA applications for scientists and researchers interested in the display and analysis of multiple disparate vector data sets. The data search and query component of this proposal has potential application inside NASA in the development of Virtual Observatories and in the Earth Sciences domain where metadata search and definition are required. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Possible commercial applications for the ViSBARD component of this proposal outside of NASA include the study of fluid or aerodynamics and vector quantities. The search components of this proposal have non-NASA applicability as well. They provide tools for strategy consulting to entities and companies in the areas of metadata definition and custom search tools.

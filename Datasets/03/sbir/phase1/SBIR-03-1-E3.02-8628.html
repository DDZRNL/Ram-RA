<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Unlike the world wide web or general libraries, digital libraries typically serve a specialized community of experts sharing a relatively narrow focus, such as some aspect of law, science, technology, or business. Moreover, these experts are not ?casual users?; they have stringent information requirements. For these reasons, digital libraries increasingly invest in sophisticated methods for indexing and retrieving their information assets.  This proposal describes an innovative approach towards indexing and data retrieval that will dramatically imporove this process.
<br>
<br>The goal of our research is to develop and test a method of knowledge-based information retrieval, in which a request for information is posed as a question, and information sources are identified that pertain to steps in the logical process of answering the question. We aim to develop automated methods that:
<br>1) Receive a user?s question requesting information,
<br>2) Find relevant information sources, and
<br>3) Explain their relevance to the user?s request. 
<br>
<br>To evaluate our results, we plan to build an information retrieval system for the wide variety of users needing information on the effects of global climate change, and to measure its success compared with human experts and conventional systems.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Our final product developed in Phase II will have broad application within NASA beyond the original domain of Earth Science Enterprise Technology.  Our solution for Digital libraries will be of use to all the NASA centers for use by domain-expert scientists and engineers seeking answers to their technical questions.  The methods and specific software to be developed has general purpose application to all of NASA?s scientific and engineering databases.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Because of the general-purpose nature of our approach, the methods and software we will develop in Phase II will have board commercial appeal for any application utilizing a complex digital database.  This includes military, intelligence and civil organizations, such as law enforcement and forensic organizations, newswires, focused library searches, and corporate intelligence.  A great potential of our work is in converting it from an intelligent retrieval tool for digital libraries into a general-purpose web search engine.

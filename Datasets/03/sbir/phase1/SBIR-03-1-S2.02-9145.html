<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
	A program is proposed to research the applicability of a unique phased array technology, dubbed FlexScan, to S-band and Ku-band communications links between stratospheric balloons and TDRSS satellites.  If successful, FlexScan phased array technology will provide high antenna gain with a narrow beam that can be steered up to 60? off broadside from a planar, low cost, low profile package.  Compared to fixed, broad-beam antennas, this can be translated to increased communication range, higher data rate, reduced weight, and reduced power consumption.  Concept feasibility will be assessed by modeling, prediction of array performance, and the fabrication and test of breadboard demonstration hardware for critical technology components.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA commercial applications include: 1) Airborne antennas for satellite data links between stratospheric balloons, aircraft, or other vehicles and TDRSS or other satellites, and 2) high-gain steerable antennas for air-to-ground data links.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Non-NASA commercial applications include: 1) Airborne antennas for wideband data links on commercial aircraft, 2) Air-to-ground data link antennas for military communications between aircraft or unattended airborne vehicles, and ground vehicles, and 3) radar seeker antennas for tactical missiles.

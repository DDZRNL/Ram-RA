<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Reliable energy systems with high energy density capable of operating at high temperatures, pressures and radiation levels are needed for certain NASA missions. Batteries based on solid-state ceramic oxide composite electrolytes provide the benefit of operation at temperatures up to 550o C.  The current high-temperature Li battery technologies use carbonate, chloride and other molten compounds based electrolytes within porous separators. The operating temperatures of these systems are limited to below 450o C due to reactivity of these electrolytes with electrode materials and issues associated with sealing and packaging such batteries systems. Solid state electrolyte based batteries can be packaged to be leak proof  under extreme conditions as there are no liquid components involved. Ceramatec Inc. is proposing to develop LiAl-solid electrolyte-FeS2 battery system based on co-pressed and laminated electrode-electrolyte structures. The Li ion conductivity of the solid electrolytes developed at Ceramatec approaches 10-1 S/cm at 400o C, and are chemically compatible with the selected electrode materials.  These batteries can be developed as either primary or secondary battery systems for use at temperatures above 400o C. In our Phase I SBIR program, single cells will be fabricated and their specific energy, cyclability and rate capability will be evaluated.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA desires to develop rechargeable batteries that can operate above 400? C with high energy (> 200 Wh/kg), good cycle life (> 200 cycles at 80% depth of discharge). These batteries will be used to power inner solar system exploration vehicles and devices within. These batteries are expected to perform at high temperatures, pressures and radiation level conditions. We are proposing to develop an all solid-state Li battery technology to address the need.  Practical realization of this battery technology will provide a safe and reliable high temperature power source with good rate capability, cycle life and shelf life.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed battery technology can operate between room temperature to 550? C, which makes it useful for a wide range of applications. This battery can also be made as a high energy primary battery. The main non-NASA applications are for vehicle traction, load-leveling and as stationary energy storage (SES) batteries. The low temperature version of this battery can meet USABC?s combined cost ($100/kWh) and performance target for battery powered electric vehicles. The high reliability and safety of this battery coupled with high energy density is ideal to power implantable implanted electronic devices.

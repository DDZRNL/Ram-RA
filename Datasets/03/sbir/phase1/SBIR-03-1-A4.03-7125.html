<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Interface coatings for fiber-reinforced composites are an enabling
<br>technology for high temperature ceramic matrix composites. Because of
<br>their availability and relative cost, graphite fibers are preferred for
<br>many structural composite of interest for space propulsion applications.
<br>However, high temperature stable silicon carbide fibers are also of
<br>interest, even though they are higher cost. Recent work at Synterials,
<br>has suggested that a thin layer of carbon at the surface of the fiber is
<br>key to preventing corrosion of the fiber and subsequent fiber strength
<br>reduction on graphite fibers. The proposed work will evaluate three
<br>interface coatings one three graphite fibers and one silicon carbide
<br>fiber. The coating are: B4C, Si-doped BN/Si3N4 and HfC. The coatings
<br>will be evaluated by preparing mini-composites via a polymer plus CVI
<br>processing route.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
These materials should find application in commercial and military
<br>aerospace engines as well as power generation components.
<br>
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A successful demonstration of this technology will have utility for many
<br>high temperature structural applications. These should include control
<br>surfaces, and engine components for advanced reusable launce vehicles.

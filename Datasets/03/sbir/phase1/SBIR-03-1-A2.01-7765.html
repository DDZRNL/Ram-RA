<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Evaluation and enhancement of the acoustical performance of turbomachinery requires knowledge of the acoustic sources. However, the noise generation mechanisms associated with turbomachinery are complex and as result it is not easy to identify these noise sources. The development of an integrated experimental/numerical technique that is based on holography and is applicable for the identification and ranking of complex noise sources is proposed. A new technique based on potential integral equations will be developed to rapidly evaluate the noise sources of complex structures. Generalized acoustical holography that is applicable for arbitrary geometry is extended by incorporating aeroacoustic noise sources in the presence of mean flow.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Innovative lightweight radiation shielding materials are enabling to shield humans in aerospace transportation vehicles and other human habited spaces. Multifunctional materials which provide non-parasitic shielding as well as structural performance is needed.  Boron can provide neutron and cosmic radiation shielding, but the only available boron fiber is a large diameter monofianant on a tungsten substrate whose high Z number preclude it use in radiation applications.  This program will develop boron fibers on carbon (low Z no.) fiber tow substrate utilizing an existing system for spreading carbon fiber tow and chemically vapor depositing (CVD) coatings.  Processing will be optimized to produce high strength boron fiber tow which will be utilized in select polymer matrix composites to demonstrate the multifunctionality of structural and radiation shielding.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA commercial applications include multifunctional boron fiber reinforced composites to aerospace transportation vehicles which provides radiation shielding for humans.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Boron fiber tow will constitute a paradigm for boron fiber applications which have wide scale potential uses throughout aerospace lightweight composites in polymer and metal matrices as well as applications in defense systems and sporting goods such as golf clubs and shafts.

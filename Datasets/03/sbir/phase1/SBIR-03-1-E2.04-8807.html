<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
High-performance, radiation-hard, widely-tunable integrated laser/modulator chip and large-area avalanche photodetectors (APDs) are key components of optical transmitters and receivers that can dramatically lower the barriers to deployment and operation of high capacity in-space optical communication links.  Agility Communications develops and manufactures widely-tunable CW sources and transmitters based on chip-scale integration of a Sampled-Grating Distributed Bragg Reflector (SG-DBR) laser with an Electroabsorption or Mach-Zehnder modulator. The performance characteristics of these devices include 40 nm wavelength coverage, multi- Gigabit/sec data rates, low drive voltage, and compatibility with high spectral efficiency and high-sensitivity modulation formats. Agility has licensed low-noise APD structures patented at the University of Texas at Austin.  These devices have achieved record-setting noise and gain-bandwidth performance and are ideally suited for space-based, high-bandwidth optical links.  During Phase I of this project we will study the effects of proton irradiation for SG-DBR lasers, InGaAsP bulk electroabsorption and electro-optic modulators, and APDs with InAlAs multiplication structure. Based on the results of Phase I, optimum chip design and process technology will be selected for development of small, efficient, radiation-hard integrated optical components in Phase II of the project.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Widely-tunable lasers monolithically integrated with fast optical modulators in a single semiconductor chip and large-area APDs are the key components for realization of small, highly efficient, radiation hard communication transmitters and receivers for WDM multi-Gigabit/sec optical links for inter-satellite networks, communication among NASA spacecraft and commercial GEO networks, and to and from spacecraft in LEO, MEO, or GEO orbits to ground networks. These optical transmitter features are also critical for the development of aircraft-based optical communication and sensing systems where power and space are limited.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Widely tunable lasers monolithically integrated with fast optical modulators in a single semiconductor chip represent the key component to the development of next generation dynamic optical networks. Integrated widely tunable transmitter enables increased number of channels and bit rates, increased network flexibility through electronic remote wavelength provisioning, and cost effectiveness. Additional value of such transmitter for present telecom networks is in the areas of inventory reduction, both in the manufacture and operation of WDM systems.  Applications of widely tunable transmitters also include broadband sensors for oil exploration, chemical analysis, and structural damage analysis.

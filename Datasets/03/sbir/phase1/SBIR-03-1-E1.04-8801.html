<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In this Phase I SBIR proposal we describe our plan to develop two key technologies for future combined radar/radiometer systems operating at L-band.  The first, a dual frequency, dual polarization microstrip antenna array, will allow a 1.2 GHz radar and a 1.4 GHz radiometer to share a single aperture. The second, an integrated transmit/receive (T/R) module, will combine a 2W transmitter with digital phase and amplitude control with a low-noise down-converting receiver. Phase I research will involve selecting appropriate broadband patch and feed network designs, evaluating their performance using GENESYS, a commercial RF simulation package. Candidate T/R module designs will also be evaluated using GENESYS. The imaging capability of the resultant designs will be tested on realistic ocean and land scenes using a custom software package developed by ProSensing.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Radar/radiometer systems are being investigated by NASA GSFC for remote detection of ocean salinity, soil moisture, sea ice and snow cover. Successful development of the antenna and T/R networks will provide NASA will two key elements of a future combined radar/radiometer system. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The antenna technologies developed through this research will result in more compact and lower cost antenna designs which will enable the construction of salinity and soil moisture sensors suitable for use on a variety of small aircraft.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Energies and Power Densities of Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs) are limited by the size and weight associated with the liquid pump, which must circulate the methanol/water fuel mixture so that 1) methanol and water can be added as needed, 2) heat can be removed, and 3) CO2 can be removed.  Automating these needs with appropriate control is difficult, especially under zero-gravity conditions.  New design strategies are necessary with reduced overhead, if miniature DMFCs are to become a reality for Robotic terrestrial and Earth observation missions.  The proposed work will demonstrate a DMFC with a means for continuous adjustment of water and methanol content in the anode fuel mixture of an air-breathing DMFC using piezoelectric micropumps.  The micropumps are expected to be tolerant to zero-gravity and potentially will work more efficiently in the absence of gravity and thus provide an added benefit for DMFCs used in space.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed micropump-feed Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC) will provide a commercial product for use on multiple NASA manned missions, micro satellites, planetary probes and space station needs where power supplies are needed to operate with minimal or no human intervention and in zero gravity.  Micropumps are currently becoming commercially available with associated cost reduction associated with replacing large pumps and circulation systems used in present-day DMFS. The low cost of methanol  together with increased in energy and power densities will save mission costs and reduce payload weights as compared with primary and secondary batteries.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There is a huge market for new and replacement power supplies for light weight portable consumer products including cell phones, PDAs, cameras and laptop computers.  The proposed improvements in DMFC operation will contribute to the power and energy density, reliability, safety and ease-of-use which will make them competitive with batteries for these consumer markets.  The miniature pump-operated DMFCs will add considerable convenience over the complex systems available today and will be less orientation-sensitive and much quieter.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NextGen Aeronautics, Inc. proposes the development of the innovative use of morphing structures for maneuver and flight control as a project for NASA?s Revolutionary Flight Concepts (Topic A7.02).  Although aircraft morphing for mission performance enhancement is currently receiving much attention from the research community, there is not a great emphasis on utilizing the same technology for flight control.  NextGen, with its extensive experience in smart structures, smart actuation and aircraft morphing has a unique combination of skills and background to develop the proposed concept.  NextGen has proposed a morphing fan wing concept as the platform for this project, based upon well-understood flight characteristics and apparent ease of integration.  Asymmetric deployment of the fan wing will be utilized to effect roll control of the aircraft.  NextGen intends to verify the feasibility of this concept in Phase I, with an eventual flight test planned for Phase II.  NextGen will address the critical issues involved with this concept (structures, actuation, skin technology, etc.) in bringing the technology to maturation.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Morphing aircraft are currently a going concern within NASA Langley under the Morphing Aircraft and Hyper-Elliptic Cambered Span programs.  NextGen?s proposed project is entended to break new ground in demonstrating the use of morphing structures (heretofore employed only for the purpose of expanding aircraft mission capability) as a means of primary flight control.  Lessons learned in the area of control law development, actuation power requirements, morphing materials and morphing structures will be applicable to all morphing projects, particularly those currently being pursued by NASA.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In addition to demonstrating revolutionary applications for aircraft morphing, NextGen?s project is specifically aimed at UAV functionality in order to serve the exploding markets for commercial UAV aircraft.  Already being used for inspection of utility lines in remote rural areas, the application of UAVs is suggested to almost any arena where inexpensive, high-quality surveillance/reconnaissance is required.  Specific uses include border or shoreline patrol and sniper detection.  The enhancements offered by NextGen?s proposed project will expand this field and add to the performance within existing applications.

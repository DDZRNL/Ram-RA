<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Aerobot vehicles for missions on Titan require envelope materials that are strong, light and durable. Unlike terrestrial balloon materials, these must be able to withstand flexing at temperatures of 90K without developing pinhole leaks. To meet this requirement, it is proposed to use Lamart?s experience in lightweight laminated sailcloth and ultra light film lamination to create a material for this application. This will be a laminated combination of multiple thin films and fabric. Test capabilities will be created and correlated to those already done at NASA-JPL. Literature search and sample testing will determine the appropriate film, adhesive, fibers, and fabric weave. Further testing will determine the minimum manageable film thickness and the minimum amount of adhesive needed to meet the mission requirements. Laminations of multiple layers of thin film will be tested to determine the benefit of this schedule compared to single layer equivalent films. Small quantities of the most promising film and fabric laminate designs will be produced on a narrow width laminator that duplicates the process used to produce full sized products and tested for flex durability.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The prime application for the material to be developed under this contract will be for the NASA Titan aerobot program. Other NASA applications would be on other balloons for both terrestrial and extra terrestrial use. Information learned in the design of materials that remain flexible at very low temperatures would be useful for other NASA applications including cryogenic pressure vessel bladders.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Materials for low temperature industrial applications requiring high strength, light weight, flexibility and low permeation will benefit from the information learned during this research.

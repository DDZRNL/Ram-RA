<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
TRS Technologies proposes to develop low-temperature multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) capable of operating at cyrogenic temperatures (<77K).  These capacitors will be based upon quantum paraelectrics and relaxor ferroelectrics. The MLCCs will have high volumetric efficiencies, low dielectric losses, and a reduced temperature coefficient of capacitance.  In the Phase I program TRS will fabricate MLCCs that operate at or below 77K and will demonstrate their feasibility for cryogenic capacitors by characterizing the dielectric properties (capacitance, loss, insulation resistance, breakdown strength, etc.) at temperature from 12K to 300K.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The potential NASA commercial applications of this technology include very low-temperature capacitors for high-power voltage converters, energy storage, and instrumentation.  These capacitors will be useful for a variety of NASA missions including the international space station, the next generation space telescope, communications satellites, deep space probes, and planetary exploration.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are a number of potential non-NASA military and commercial applications for cryogenic capacitors.  Military applications range from ship-based energy conversion, storage, and distribution, to high-power electro-magnetic weaponry, as well as avionics.  Commercial applications include low-temperature sensing, magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic energy storage, cooled high-efficiency power generation and distribution, and magnetic levitation transportation.

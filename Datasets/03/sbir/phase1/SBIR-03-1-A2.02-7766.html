<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
As solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) approach commercialization, interest in broader applications of this technology is mounting.  While the first commercialized systems are being designed to provide 3-5 kW in stationary and automotive auxiliary power unit (APU) applications, aerospace and military users are considering integrating SOFCs into larger, airborne systems with considerable commercial payback.  SOFCs are aligned to displace inefficient, noisy, and polluting technologies such as diesel generators that will provide both economic and environmental motivation to prospective users.  NexTech Materials will develop a solid oxide fuel cells that demonstrate high power density, targeting 2W/cm2, a level of performance that will enable the compact, lightweight systems required for aerospace applications to become a reality.  Such high power density SOFCs will provide the bridge from stationary residential power systems to airborne auxiliary power units.  The fuel cells that result from these applications will lead the way to efficient and clean aircraft.  This Phase I work will focus on processing and evaluating highly conductive electrolyte and electrode materials and the incorporation of these materials into high power density, SOFC cells suitable for commercial stack fabrication in Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The technology developed in this program will provide high performance SOFC materials and systems for airborne power systems.  The materials developed in this program can be used in power systems ranging from commuter planes to auxiliary power units for large commercial airliners, and are particularly well suited to ?more electric? designs.  Such power systems will directly reduce fuel use and pollution resulting from aircraft in the United States.  In addition, the incorporation of such high power density cells into regenerative fuel cell designs would enhance the available power for high-altitude aircraft and airships.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The high power density materials and designs resulting from this program will find wide applicability in as compact power supplies for military and commercial users.  Military applications, where highly mobile dense power sources are required to displace heavy and bulky battery systems are numerous, include radios, sensing and imaging equipment and heads-up displays for dismounted soldiers.  Such compact power systems could power autonomous vehicles for military and commercial surveillance vehicles.  Commercially, high power density SOFCs would be desirable for portable generators where lighter, smaller systems would provide easy transportation.

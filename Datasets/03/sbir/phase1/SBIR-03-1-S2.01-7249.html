<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to utilize a new detector material, polycrystalline mercuric iodide, for background suppression by active anticoincidence shielding in gamma-ray spectrometers. Two proposed NASA missions will require anticoincidence shielding for gamma-ray spectrometers: the Mars Lander and a Space Science Vision Mission expected to visit Titan, one of Saturn?s moons. Shielding improves the performance of gamma-ray spectrometers by reducing the effect of charged particle interactions which can not be distinguished from true gamma-ray interactions by the spectrometer. Active shields produce a blanking signal when a charged particle is detected, so that the signal from the spectrometer can be ignored during the spectrometer?s charged-particle interaction. While it is well know that this technique produces significant improvement in gamma-ray spectrometer performance, the technology to implement it is lacking. The attributes of mercuric iodide make it an excellent candidate for anticoincidence shielding detectors. Because of its detection characteristics, light weight, small size, low cost, robustness, and ease of application to non-planar geometries, this material can replace the costly, heavy, and bulky scintillator/photomultiplier tube (PMT) systems currently in use. The application of this new material for space-based astrophysical observations will provide excellent background suppression with improved mass and volume characteristics.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Space-based gamma-ray spectrometers will benefit from the proposed polycrystalline mercuric iodide active anticoincidence shield. Gamma-ray spectroscopy is a widely used tool in planetary science and astrophysics, providing valuable information on such diverse topics as planetary composition and the nature of gamma-ray bursts. Both the proposed Mars Lander and a proposed Space Science Vision Mission for visiting Titan will require anticoincidence shielding for their gamma-ray spectrometers.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Because of the small volume and flexible shape of the proposed mercuric iodide detectors, they have a potential application as coincidence or anticoincidence detectors for charged particles in complex high-energy physics detectors, where detector volume near the emission point is often extremely limited. By placing the material onto a curved surface, detectors may be placed in spaces previously unused because planar detectors do not fit. Medical imaging x-ray systems have a natural geometry of detectors located on a hemispherical plane; curved detector surfaces may eliminate some artifacts and lead to improved efficiency due to improved detector packing fraction.

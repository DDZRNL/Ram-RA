<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
SiWave proposes to develop a compact, low-cost MEMS-based pressure sensor for very high temperatures and low pressures in hypersonic wind tunnels.  Most currently available pressure sensors use a micromachined diaphragm whose deflection is dependent on pressure.  The deflection is typically measured by techniques that are not suited for high temperature (>~200?F) operation, or that are insensitive to small (<~0.1 psi) pressure changes.  As a result, no commercial sensors cover 0-5 PSI at temperatures above 200?F, despite the fact that this regime is important for NASA?s hypersonic wind tunnel testing programs, as well as for hypersonic flight avionics.  SiWave?s proposed pressure sensor is a novel implementation of squeeze film resonant sensor approach, with a sophisticated multi-element resonator designed for very high Q and temperature stability, made from silicon carbide.  The device is controlled by distant external electronics.  These innovative features result in a sensor with high accuracy (0.005 PSI) over an unprecedented temperature range (up to 650?F), and the potential to be manufactured in dense arrays.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA requires an ultra-small low-cost pressure sensor suitable for both high and low temperature and pressures from .005 to 5 PSI.  The quality and quantity of data obtained in hypersonic testing of aircraft and spacecraft components is severely limited by the large size and narrow temperature range of current pressure sensors.  Development of technology for future hypersonic commercial aircraft would benefit greatly from the availability of low cost pressure sensors that are very compact and can operate over the full range of temperatures and pressures experienced during hypersonic flight.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed device has applications in the military, commercial aeronautics, automotive, and consumer products. Markets for this technology include altimetry, aircraft air speed measurement, automotive emissions control, vacuum sensing in harsh environments and down hole drilling.  The total annual pressure sensor market is more than $1 billion. In automotive applications alone tens of millions of manifold absolute pressure and barometric absolute pressure sensors are sold each year and are found in most passenger vehicles.

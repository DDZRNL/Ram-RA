<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Aviation and Air Traffic Management researchers are increasingly utilizing complex regional or NAS-wide simulations to evaluate future concepts. These analyses require many thousands of flights (a flight schedule) that are each accurately defined for every stage of the flight (a flight plan).  Current methods of generating these huge input datasets are costly and time-intensive. The largely manual nature of the current process and lack of existing automation tools leaves great potential for significant errors in the data sets.  We propose to develop a powerful automated system for future demand generation.  This tool will be able to input a variety of existing FAA and NASA flight data sets, provide the user with extensive options on defining the future demand data set, and output new flight data sets in formats compatible with major research simulation and analysis tools. This capability will provide NASA and FAA research programs with significantly better analysis conclusions through the new ability to perform extensive sensitivity studies on new concepts to ensure they are robust to alternate potential future demand scenarios.  This is crucial to ensuring the decision to proceed with a multi-million dollar Decision Support Tool development is robust to alternate future demand possibilities.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Within NASA aviation research, our demand generation application can be used to advance research efforts including advanced airspace system concept fast-time and/or human-in-the-loop evaluation and demonstration, ATM decision support tool performance and benefit evaluations, human operator (e.g., pilot, controller, or dispatcher) stress testing, aerospace vehicle-NAS integration studies, and ATM concept environmental impact studies. In general, NASA simulation capabilities exist for these areas but the capability for efficient generation of new flight demand is lacking.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The FAA or other international air traffic service providers can use our product to create future demand for their airport and airspace demand, capacity, noise and emission analyses to support future airport and airspace planning and design efforts. Commercial airlines can combine their internal flight schedules with the future flight demand generated from our product to evaluate the operability of the flight schedules airlines created and support fleet planning and optimization. Future extensions to the tool can support improved simulation and stress-testing to support planning and analysis of other transportation networks such as the nation?s highways.

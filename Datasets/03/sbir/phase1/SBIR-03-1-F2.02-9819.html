<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Phase I proposal seeks support to extend the BrahmsVE architecture to support a multi-agent human-centric simulation of a hypothetical future ISS which is equipped with interior agents (PSA) and exterior tele-operated agents (Robonaut). An Agent Broker module will be constructed as well as detailed interior and exterior ISS 3D virtual world models containing PSA, Robonaut, human (astronaut-agents) and major subsystems. Input from expert advisors at several NASA centers will be sought to create this macro-level simulation of work practice within a hypothetical future ISS.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA commercial applications of BrahmsVE with multi-agent capability include modeling and simulation for Intelligent Virtual Station, SimStation, Personal Satellite Assistant, Robonaut, Mobile Agents, Mars Science Laboratory and Titan missions, telepresence interface development, Virtual Digital Human and NASA outreach and K-12 programs (Space Camp).<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Non-NASA applications of BrahmsVE with multi-agent capability include DOD and DOE energy project simulations, simulation of semi and fully autonomous robotic agents for defense and security, K-12, college and museum education in the area of human-robot interaction and space exploration, online and packaged robot games applications, as a visualization and design tool for factory automation, and use of the multi-agent, human-centric capabilities of BrahmsVE to support research on the use of wireless, mobile personal assistant devices.

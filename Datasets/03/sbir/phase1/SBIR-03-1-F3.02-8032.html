<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We offer a novel liquefier that has the potential to simultaneously increase thermodynamic efficiency and significantly reduce complexity.  The ?active gas regenerative liquefier? (AGRL) uses an array of discrete micro compressor-expander units  in a periodic heat exchanger to accomplish extremely efficient liquefaction of hydrogen and other cryogenic fluids.  When an array of these units are combined into a highly effective regenerator with excellent heat transfer, low pressure drop, and low longitudinal conduction, the potential for a extremely efficient regenerative refrigerator and/or liquefier is created.  The capability to directly couple the compression of a working gas within a unit with the simultaneous expansion of a working gas within the same unit allows distributed work input and recovery from near ambient temperature to cryogenic temperatures as low as ~20 K.  By using this micro compressor-expander unit, the net work input is reduced substantially to that required for a very efficient refrigeration cycle, no matter what the temperature span of the liquefier.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The use of cryogenic storage of liquids such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen are integral to the operations of the space station and other space missions. The power required to accomplish the liquefaction of such cryogens is key factor in overall system design, especially if the power for the liquefaction has to be supplied in space and subsequently rejected in space.  The sizes of solar panels, parasitic heat handling systems, and space radiators all are significantly influenced by  the power demands; to reduce these demands enables various missions to be feasible.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The conceptual designs that CFS has preliminarily analyzed can be developed into highly efficient, simple, reliable, and inexpensive cryocoolers with broad defense and civilian applicability. The system can be used for refrigeration, densificatio, and liquefaction of cryogens. We believe this is truly a potential breakthrough in cryocooler development.

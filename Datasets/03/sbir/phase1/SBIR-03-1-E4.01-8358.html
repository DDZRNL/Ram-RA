<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Automated detection of land cover changes between multitemporal images has long been a goal of the remote sensing discipline.  Most research in this area has focused on methods for detecting and categorizing changes captured by two or more images [Jensen, 1991, Singh, 1989; Coppin and Bauer, 1996], but precise coregistration of images is required and remains a key challenge [Dai and Khorram, 1998, Stow and Chen, 2002, Verbyla and Boles, 2000].  This SBIR project team proposes to develop a software package specifically optimized for automatic and precise coregistration of two or more images, which will in turn enable change detection algorithms to focus on salient changes rather than highlight image registration errors.  In accordance with this subtopic?s guidance to  ??focus on the systems engineering aspect of application development rather than fundamental research??, our project will emphasize integration of state of the art methods to create a flexible, robust, and easy to use tool.   Presuming success through Phase II, this will enable NASA researchers and unsophisticated users to minimize or eliminate false ?changes? caused by image coregistration errors and thus increase utilization of Earth Science observations from NASA sensors and other data sources (IKONOS, aerial photography, etc.).

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The NASA application that arguably has the greatest need for the proposed technology is Homeland Security.  The colossal task of securing borders, bridges, dams, pipelines, power plants, etc., can in part, be performed utilizing remotely sensed data.  As such, detecting changes that could potentially threaten the security of these essentials is vitally important to those responsible for Homeland Security.  Other National Applications that can benefit from this technology include: Coastal Management, Invasive Species and Community Growth.  These application areas commonly use remotely sensed data and have an ongoing need to monitor changes in that image data.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Less sophisticated users are seeking changes using moderate- and high-resolution Earth imagery for an increasing number of applications.  Examples include the U.S. Border Patrol (monitoring borders for smuggling of illegal immigrants and contraband as well as potential terrorist threats) and city and county governments (monitoring changes in historical land use/land cover in support of local planning efforts).  In the private sector, many companies already utilize change detection applied to remotely sensed data to generate their products and services (e.g., GDT, providing street and highway data, and SRC, providing geographically-based demographic analyses).

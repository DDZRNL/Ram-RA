<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate, based on a new class of electronic devices called solid state vacuum devices (SSVD?s), a highly promising enabling technology for extreme high temperature radiation hard electronics.  SSVD?s marry solid state semiconductor technology, including the process fabrication techniques, with vacuum electronics, and, in this case, specifically thermionic vacuum electronics. SSVD?s have already been demonstrated for highly demanding high frequency applications. Thermionic SSVD?s, in which vacuum transport is by thermionically emitted electrons, are especially promising due to their intrinsic internal high temperature operation and radiation hardness.  SSVD?s should be extremely well suited for extreme environments that, for example, exist on or near Venus.  Currently no existing electronics can address this extreme environment.  InnoSys proposes to demonstrate thermionic SSVD? triodes/field effect transistors and the associated assembly and sealing to meet the requirements needed for extreme high temperature electronics.  In particular, to demonstrate this capability, 460oC electronics for low noise (less than 10 nanovolt/square root(Hz)) and 0 to 100 volt or higher output circuitry and appropriate innovative temperature and pressure assemblies and sealing techniques needed for reliable and sustained operation of SSVD? devices for NASA robotic, sensor and actuators applications will be studied.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The number of potential NASA applications for SSVD?s are significant and include high temperature electronic devices, circuits and sensors, energy conversion, power supply applications, radar, and microwave and millimeter communications. SSVD?s are very flexible in their potential applications and can be designed in a number of different configurations and can be integrated with other components and systems to address additional applications.   SSVD?s have potential NASA terrestrial, space and planetary exploration applications.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
SSVD?s are currently being developed to address commercial markets in communications (i.e., base stations, broadband and millimeter wave communications).  InnoSys believes there are a significant number of high temperature applications in, among others, avionics, automotive, geothermal, oil exploration, nuclear, industrial controllers, distributed control systems, high temperature sensors, harsh environment electronics, and fuel combustion.  This proposed SBIR should put InnoSys in a very good position to commercially develop high temperature discrete and integrated circuit SSVD? electronics for the commercial marketplace.

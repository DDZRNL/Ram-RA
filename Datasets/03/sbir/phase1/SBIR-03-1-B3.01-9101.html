<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Maintaining a healthy atmosphere in closed life support systems is necessary for the well being of the crew and success of a space mission. Current trace contaminant control systems for removal of trace contaminant gases from cabin air are based on activated carbon filter and high temperature catalytic oxidation. However, activated carbon and high temperature oxidation air cleaners suffer from absorbent saturation and poisoning, which leads to off gassing. Also, the units become a breading ground for microorganisms, and the activated carbon generates a potentially hazardous secondary waste stream. In this Phase I project Lynntech proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of using a reagentless advanced low temperature catalytic air-revitalizing unit based on a nanoparticulate photocatalytic filter to eliminate both chemicals and microorganisms from air. The benefits of this approach are its low cost, low power consumption, longevity, diverse flow rate capacity, size and performance. In addition, it is reagentless and it does not generate a secondary waste stream. In the Phase II project, a fully operational prototype will be delivered to NASA.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Maintaining a healthy atmosphere in closed life support systems is necessary for the well being of the crew and success of a space mission. The proposed technology will allow maintaining a healthy atmosphere by effectively removing and destroying trace contaminant gases and airborne microorganisms from cabin air.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The novel air cleaning process will find commercial applications in many areas where the destruction of microorganisms, ozone, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), and other toxic organic contaminants are needed, e.g., in air pollution control in industries and enclosed environments. Potential markets include utility power plants, semiconductor industries, paper plants, oil refineries, petrochemical plants, mining, sewage, treatment plants, painting operations, electroplating industries, chemical and pesticide manufacturers, point booth emission, passenger vehicles (e.g., cars, buses, trains), commercial airplanes, tight buildings, homes, hospitals, etc.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A mapping solution will be developed that allows for geospatial-reality intelligent linking database with remotely sensed images.  This system is designed to use Earth Science datasets to support NASA Center Operations.   Mobile Online Intelligent Decision Support Systems (MOIDSS?) can be deployed in a variety of NASA facilities and commercial industry facilities.  This solution will support a range of technologies, such as, handheld field computers, Real-time Kinematic Global Positioning Systems (RTK-GPS), and wireless networking systems.  This solution will utilize current of the shelf (COTS) technology, which is presently integrated in the NASA facilities.  Commercial software will be developed for automated data collection and validation of spatial information.   The innovative technology and theory will enable fusion of data in situ by using the geospatial-reality intelligent linking database (GRILD).  This solution can be used by emergency response management teams, homeland security groups, and engineering staff to make vital decisions with all available spatial data. The goal of this project was to develop an innovative idea using advance methods and technologies to help NASA Earth Science and Center Operation directorates.  Geospatial Research Innovation Design (GRID) proposes and supports this SBIR.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
MOIDSS? can be used to assist the NASA facility management by supplying access to all Earth Science Data Sources.  It is an emergency support system that utilizes site-collected information and spatial database information to make decisions necessary to protect the life and welfare of NASA site personnel.  MOIDSS? offers a simplified solution for users with little knowledge of GIS by using the geospatial reality intelligent linking database algorithm.  This system has the ability to store or terminal gigabytes of information in the field to first responders to natural or man-made disasters based on spatial location<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Resource managers will have the ability to quickly collect GIS facility information.  MOIDSS? can be used access server information from distant locations. For example, a city manger or farmer can obtain satellite information within the field to assist in making decisions.  Others that could utilize the system include College Campus, Military Installations, Ports, Chemical Refineries, and Manufacturing Facilities. This system has GIS and Surveying field data collection potential and allows real-time information generation and verification.  Wireless encrypted communication safeguards information by allowing a true client server interface to data without it being stored locally in a field unit.

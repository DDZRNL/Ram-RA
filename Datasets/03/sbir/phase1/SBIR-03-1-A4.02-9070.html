<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Nassau Stern Company is investigating an approach for manufacturing oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) aluminum in bulk rather than powder form.  The approach combines novel ceramic injection molding technology to produce preforms for subsequent pressure infiltration casting with aluminum.  The preforms contain between 30 and 40 volume percent sub-micron aluminum oxide and 60 to 70 volume percent nano-porosity.  The resulting ODS aluminum could be near net-shape or as a billet ready for secondary processing.  If successful, this approach will eliminate defects associated with consolidating powders into bulk form, such as contamination, adsorbed gas and non-uniform packing.  Elimination of these defects will allow the ODS aluminum to perform closer to theoretical tensile strength, especially at elevated temperatures.  ODS aluminum is also expected to possess exceptional elevated temperature fatigue behavior, vital for aerospace propulsion components and structures.  The high level of aluminum oxide will also improve thermal expansion and stiffness behavior of the ODS aluminum.  The envisioned elevated temperature performance of ODS aluminum will open up a wide range of space and aviation applications not feasible for conventional aluminum alloys.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The improved performance of ODS aluminum, especially at elevated temperature, would permit its application to structures for launch vehicles as well as space and satellite structures.  The material would also be suitable airframe structures, ducting and turbine shrouds and missile fins.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The increased stiffness and thermal expansion behavior makes ODS aluminum suitable for structural components contained in precision optic systems and computer disk drives.  The performance at elevated temperatures would be beneficial for internal combustion engine pistons, cylinder liners and connecting rods as well as disk brake rotors.

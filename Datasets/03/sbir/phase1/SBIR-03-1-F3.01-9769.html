<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The main goal of spacecraft thermal control systems is to maintain internal and external temperature within acceptable boundaries while minimizing impact on vehicle mass, complexity and operability. Paragon is proposing to develop an integrated radiator/structure design approach that will permit efficient thermal performance of the integral radiator while simultaneously serving as a load bearing structure member. The innovation in the proposed design is to integrate the radiator within the stressed skin of the vehicle thereby achieving a superior lb/sq ft penalty over conventional designs while establishing a baseline coating system that will survive the ground, launch pad and ascent environments.  An additional possibility will be to achieve survival of coatings in a leeward reentry environment for added benefit to reusable OSP concepts. Our proposal would advance the state-of-the-art in integral radiator designs for conformal structure applications by reducing the key technology development risks so they can be considered for the next generation manned space systems, such as the OSP, as well as other applications.  The central objective of the combined Phase I and Phase II work plan is to take load bearing, environmentally compatible radiator designs from the present position of TRL 3, to TRL 5 or 6.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The immediate need for this technology is in the Orbital Space Plane program, as these types of radiators are being used in baseline configurations.  Conventional and deployed radiators are being carried as a risk mitigating fall-back, though with significant weight, and operability penalties.  Discussions with contractors indicate that future Reusable Launch Vehicles may also benefit from integral thermal control system technology such as that proposed. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
While solving many of the same fundamental RLV issues, successful application of radiator systems for NASA also offer innovative new solutions for Defense Department applications with many of the same fundamental design issues including thermal control for space control missions, RLV?s and thermal signature control for national space assets.  Furthermore, Paragon?s innovations resulting from the proposed Phase I effort would benefit high thermal density applications such as transmitters on commercial spacecraft, and could replace expensive and toxic heat pipes in commercial spacecraft battery packs as passive thermal control solutions become insufficient to satisfy the requirements of high thermal density applications.

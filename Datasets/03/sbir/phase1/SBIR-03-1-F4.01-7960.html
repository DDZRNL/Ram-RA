<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Next Generation MK III Lightweight HUT/Hatch Assembly will maximize the Hard Upper Torso - Hatch assembly weight reduction through the combination of innovative material selection and cross sectional redesign. The intent is to research, identify and down select robust lightweight materials that are best suited for space & planetary, (or lunar) exploration.  This Next Generation MK III Lightweight HUT/Hatch Assembly will be backwrd compatible with previous MK III suits. 
<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A light weight space suit for planetary (or lunar) exploration can be worn longer by the astronaut with less fatique thus allowing more exploratory tasks to be completed.  Additionally, the Next Generation MK III Lightweight HUT/Hatch Assembly will improvement astronaut mobility.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are many potential applications of the Generation MK III Lightweight HUT/Hatch Assembly for the Department of Defense, Industry and the private sector. Such possibilities are light weight life support components, robust material technologies that will potentially have many possibilities.

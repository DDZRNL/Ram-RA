<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Small Business Innovative Research Phase I proposal seeks to develop a compact, robust in situ spectrometer capable of detecting multiple gas-phase species in planetary atmospheres with ultra-high sensitivity and selectivity.  This instrument will employ a novel room-temperature, widely tunable mid-infrared laser source in conjunction with cavity ringdown spectroscopy.  During Phase I, the 3.3 to 3.5 &#61549;m spectral region will be targeted, which overlaps the spectral absorption features of variety of hydrocarbons, including methane, ethane, and formaldehyde.  The ultra-high sensitivity of the proposed system will enable these species to be detected at concentrations below 7*107/cm3 per minute, which corresponds to a detection limit of <30 pptv in Earth?s atmosphere.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA applications for the instrument described in this proposal include the interrogation of extraterrestrial atmospheres for trace species, as well as in the study of Earth?s atmosphere.  The ability to measure formaldehyde, specifically, with the promised sensitivity would be of great benefit to current atmospheric research efforts.  Additionally, the described instrument will have applications in monitoring spacecraft life support systems.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The worldwide market for gas sensors with the capabilities of the proposed system is quite large.  Numerous potential applications can be found in trace gas monitoring, pollution monitoring, industrial process control, and medical diagnostics.

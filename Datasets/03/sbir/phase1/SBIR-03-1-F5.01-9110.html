<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Michigan Aerospace Corporation has been funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) over the past several years to investigate on-orbit satellite docking and servicing technology.  One of the key technologies required for all of those operations (rendezvous, docking, and inspection) is the sensor.  For rendezvous and docking, the guidance sensor(s) must measure bearing angle, separation, closing rate, and the six degree of freedom (6-DOF) orientation between the two spacecraft.  Currently, multiple sensors are required to measure these variables under limited dynamic conditions.  Michigan Aerospace Corporation proposes to take one of the steps in establishing the feasibility of using the Sandia Scannerless Laser Radar (SLR) as an end-to-end rendezvous, docking and inspection sensor.  This Phase I effort will focus on developing a methodology and preliminary algorithms for processing the range data to extract information about a target spacecraft, such as position, orientation and rates.  Sensor performance requirements, hardware development and risks will also be assessed.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The compact size, sensitivity, resolution, pixel acquisition rates, reliability and potentially much lower production cost distinguish Sandia?s scannerless version of LADAR from other conventional architectures.  Scannerless Flash LADAR (Laser Detection and Ranging) Imaging has all of the desired features for a robust spacecraft rendezvous, docking and inspection sensor.  This sensor technology and the algorithm development proposed here should fulfill the requirements for cooperative as well as non-cooperative rendezvous, docking and inspection.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
In addition, the related military and civilian applications are extensive.  Applications exist in face recognition for Homeland Security, tactical target recognition from aircraft, underwater mine detection, and industrial inspection.  As with many advanced technologies, the space and military application will build the technology foundation for commercial/consumer applications.  In the future, 3-D imaging may be as commonplace as color cameras and computers are today, and at comparable price points.

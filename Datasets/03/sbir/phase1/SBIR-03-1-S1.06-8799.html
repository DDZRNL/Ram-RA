<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In this program, we will develop a novel process for fabricating large-area ultraviolet diffraction gratings on curved surfaces. This process is based on a unique conformable maskless projection lithography system technology that has been developed by Anvik Corporation. The UV gratings that will be fabricated using this technology would be attractive for integration into imaging spectrometers, for example, for studying the solar corona and solar emissions, and their influence on the earth environment. In this program we will identify the patterning requirements for curved UV gratiings and we will demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating gratings using conformable maskless lithography. Anvik?s conformable maskless technology offers a number of advantages compared with currently available grating fabrication techniques, most significantly, it enables the patterning of sub-micron gratings on substrates having large sags.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The work performed in this program will lead to a conformable maskless lithography technology that will be used to fabricate high-performance curved ultraviolet gratings. These gratings will be useful in a wide array of scientific instruments used for space-based ultraviolet imaging. Additionally, the conformable maskless technology can also be used to fabricate curved focal planar arrays, which would enable high-resolution large-field camera systems?these would be useful for astronomy and for remote sensing of the earth environment. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The work performed in this program will lead to improved ultraviolet spectoscopic instrumentation for general scientific purposes. It will also lead to wide field-of-view remote sensing and surveillance equipment, which would have applications in crop management and homeland security, respectively. The curved maskless lithography technology would also have biomedical applications, particularly in the area of implants, where surface texturing can selectively promote tissue growth.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to develop an innovative, versatile and extensible, continuous-thrust trajectory optimization tool for planetary mission design and optimization of continuous-thrust spacecraft missions. A working title for this new tool is ?Apache.? Apache will be a platform-independent and user-friendly tool that eliminates piecewise optimization. A key to Apache?s versatility and extensibility is the use of object-oriented Java language. Specific innovations and features include: 
<br>
<br>* Operates in complex gravity models,
<br>* Automatically and seamlessly handles multi-body transitions,
<br>* Supports solar and nuclear electric, electrodynamic tether, solar sail and hybrid propulsion options, 
<br>* Includes non-gravitational force models such as solar pressure or atmospheric drag,
<br>* Models solar occultation periods appropriately and automatically,
<br>* Calculates radiation dosage from trapped radiation belts,
<br>* Optimizes static and dynamic variables using a gradient-based algorithm to size spacecraft systems, and to select flight times and thrust-steering profiles,
<br>* Uses analytical solutions to generate a good initial guess for the optimization method, and
<br>* Written in Java to facilitate the development of an extensible architecture and promote platform independence.
<br>
<br>Apache responds directly to the subtopic call for ?continuous-thrust mission design consisting of a synthesis of trajectory, vehicle, and operations considerations,? which enables analysis capability to lead technology development.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA could use Apache for planetary and space science missions that use continuous-thrusting propulsion. Planetary missions include the Dawn mission, the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) mission, and future deep space missions.  
<br>
<br>Apache could also support the analysis of continuous-thrust propulsion for scientific observatory emplacement and recovery for refurbishment and/or repair. 
<br>
<br>Apache could also be used to carry out technology sensitivity studies in order to facilitate technology requirements definition. Optimal electrical engine operations, such as optimal power distribution and specific impulse modulation, could be produced by Apache.  Users could define spacecraft requirements for a variety of missions modeled using Apache.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercial customers include organizations that could benefit from trajectory optimization and from technology definition and mission design modeling that can be generated, in part, by using Apache.  Potential customers include: Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Ball Aerospace, and General Dynamics.  These organizations could use Apache to achieve objectives of DOD and Airforce contracts, and to optimize trajectories and define technological requirements for commercial space flight.

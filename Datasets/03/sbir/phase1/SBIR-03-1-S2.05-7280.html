<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
TRS Technologies proposes a novel single crystal piezomotor for large stroke, high precision, and cryogenic actuations with capability of position set-hold with power-off.  The proposed concept will advance the state-of-art cryogenic actuations considering the excellent cryogenic properties (with d33 and d31 at 30K similar or higher than that of PZT at room temperature) and the great electromechanical coupling of single crystal piezoelectrics, and the novel design of the ?wobbling mode? piezomotor with ?33 mode? single ring stacks instead of the conventional ?31? mode plates for excitation. In the Phase I project, the cryogenic properties of single crystal piezoelectrics with various crystal cut will be investigated. FEA modeling that takes into consideration the special properties of single crystals and a cryogenic environment will be conducted and a novel piezomotor with ?33? mode single crystal ring stacks and screw driven structures will be built and characterized at temperatures from 300 to 20K. At the conclusion of Phase I program the feasibility of ?wobbling mode? piezomotor for large stroke cryogenic actuation will be demonstrated. Optimization of the single crystal piezomotor design and the development of a large aperture cryogenic mirror or reflector will take place in Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Cryogenic actuators with large stroke, high precision, and position set-hold at power-off characteristics are desired for NASA adaptive optics, deployable truss structures, antenna tuning, and positioning. In particular, the proposed cryomotor could be used for shape control actuators, position control actuators and force control actuators for the primary mirror on JWST and in other space-exploring missions. Large stroke screw driven actuators will also advance vibration control for flexible structures, which have been largely used in spacecraft because of their lightweight and deployability.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Large stroke, high precision actuators have applications such as active vibration control and structure morphing, RF communication tuning, bio-medical manipulators, photonic tooling, micro/nanofabrication and nanoassembly which require over mm stroke while keeping step resolution around nm.

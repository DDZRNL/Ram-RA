<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Live from Space Station? Outreach Payload (LFSSOP) is a technologically challenging, exciting opportunity for university students to conduct significant research in the biological or physical sciences culminating in a university student built payload that is launched and placed on the International Space Station. Experiment features will be accessed and controlled by high school students via a Live From Space Station? (LFSS) Internet computer interface. A national competition for university students will be implemented to award the payload contract.  A separate national competition designed for elementary students will be initiated to help the university awardee name their payload.  Museums and science centers will be the LFSSOP curriculum dissemination and training sites, as well as public outreach sites intended to intrigue and excite individuals of all ages. Exhibit kiosks running LFSS systems data, audio, video and student payload-related computer interfaces will stimulate public interest in the space sciences and the uniqueness of on-orbit research.  Further, the excitement of working on a scientific problem, devising a payload to collect data, and analyzing results to prove a theory that will contribute to the body of knowledge in the biological or physical sciences will motivate and inspire students to study math and science.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The LFSSOP program will effectively expose a great number of our country?s students and public to exciting, live ISS activities while fostering a positive image of space exploration and research for the benefit of humankind.  The payload program will bring together the public, universities, schools and museums in the name of space science.  Subsequent implementations will ideally include live participation in Missions to Mars, Lunar Explorations, Solar Exploration, Planetary Exploration, and Earth Sciences.  The LFSSOP program will assist NASA in delivering live, hands-on demonstrations of math, science, and engineering concepts directly to schools and the public. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The LFFSOP program payload control interface is marketable to other payload developers and investigators not involved in the outreach program.  The LFFSOP program educational interface is marketable to science-technology museums, public, other educational venues and commercial science sites.  The National Air & Space Museum, McWane Center, Discovery Place, and Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex have provided letters of support indicating their excitement at the prospects of the LFFSOP program reaching maturity.  The Challenger Center/Star Station One, representing over 100 science-related facilities, has also provided a letter of support indicating a desire for involvement with the LFFSOP curriculum and products.

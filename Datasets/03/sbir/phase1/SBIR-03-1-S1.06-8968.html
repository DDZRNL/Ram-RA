<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Radiation-hard UV detectors will be developed with ZnO in Phase I efforts by MOXtronics, Inc. (MOX).  ZnO is a very suitable material for fabrication of high-speed, high-detectivity, and radiation-hard UV detectors due to its unique structural, electrical and optical properties.  MOX has achieved several breakthroughs for making p-type ZnO and ZnO p-n junction/Schottky diodes, which allows fabrication of ZnO UV detectors.  High-efficiency ZnO UV detectors will be fabricated on ZnO substrates by using ZnO PIN structures.  In Phase I, ZnO PIN diodes for UV detection will be fabricated and demonstrated.  High-efficiency solar-blind ZnO UV detectors will be developed in future Phase II efforts.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
ZnO-based UV detectors will satisfy the NASA requirements for device compactness, light weight, and low power consumption. These detectors could be used for a variety of NASA applications, including, for example, exploration of UV radiation from the outer space or the sun, and for opto-electric communications (ship-to-ship, or ship-to-ground). <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
High-performance ZnO-based UV detectors could be used in non-NASA commercial applications.  These applications include flame and heat sensors, medical applications (sterilization), UV calibration devices (tanning monitors), plasma diagnostics, and engine (missile) monitoring.  These ZnO-based photodetectors will be introduced quickly into the commercial market based on their potential for many applications.

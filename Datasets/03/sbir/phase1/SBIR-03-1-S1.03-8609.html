<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
An integrated unit that harnesses its energy from its surroundings and reacts to, and transmits, any changes in its environment in a predictable and reliable manner would be of significant benefit to the sensor community.  Advances in Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS), silicon, SiGe, and GaAs fabrication technologies have helped to constantly add new sensing and communication functionality in a given device footprint.  A significant limitation with the current state-of-the-art processes though, is the constraint to fabricate devices and circuits on a relatively high-cost, defect-free, single-crystal, base substrate.  This has also limited the potential of an integrated mixed-material design solution that is a key to high-performance communication systems.  Finally, a lack of large-area processing tools has precluded the development of a stand-alone, large-area sensor skin.  Building on Anvik?s proven, large-area, excimer laser based recrystallization and annealing technologies, and ongoing efforts in developing MEMS process technologies on flexible substrates, we propose to develop a fabrication technology to enable wireless communication circuitry on low-cost, flexible base substrates for large-area ?skins?.  There are several applications for this technology in free-moving sensor systems, space-based MEMS and distributed sensor networks for health-monitoring of space based systems, and commercial applications such as cell-phones and PDAs.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are innumerable applications in free-moving sensor systems, space-based MEMS and distributed sensor networks for health monitoring of space-based systems.  The technology described is independent of the exact nature of the sensor that is integrated into the system.  Using an accelerometer, for example, will enable large-area distributed monitoring of vibration over complex surfaces.  The use of a chemical sensor will allow applications in hazardous gas monitoring over large-areas.  One of the key constraints in industrialization and system design is cable management.  Using an easily attached (adhesive-backed) skin with a wireless communication capability will greatly ease integration of such skins.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The focus in this proposal has been on space related applications and therefore on large-area distributed sensors.  Immediate extensions can be found in the commercial aircraft industry for these sensors.  Similar applications can be found in the automotive industry for safety testing and continuous monitoring of the auto-body or the ship hull.  With further development, these skins could be applied to clothing applications for military and commercial applications in the up and coming e-textile market.  All these applications will be able to use the large-area stand-alone capability of these sensors.

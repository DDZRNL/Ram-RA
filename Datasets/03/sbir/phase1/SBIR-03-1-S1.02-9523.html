<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are two distinct approaches to aerocapture: drag modulation and lift-vector control.  All current research under the NASA ROSS In-Space Propulsion Technology Program is based on the drag modulation approach.  However, a growing number of researchers are convinced that lift-vector control will be necessary, particularly for the more challenging planetary destinations such as Neptune.  Vertigo will research concepts for spacecraft aerocapture using an innovative attached inflatable forebody decelerator that employs lift-vector control.  Compared to drag modulation, lift-vector control expands the entry corridor to provide the needed margin for the total of the statistical uncertainties associated with navigation and atmospheric property estimation.  Because aerocapture uses aerodynamic forces and not propulsion to decelerate, the amount of fuel required for a mission is greatly reduced.  During Phase I Vertigo will define a concept for an attached inflatable forebody decelerator that incorporates lift-vector trajectory control.  The results of the Phase I research will form the basis for a Phase II program in which we will perform a detailed evaluation of all aspects of the conceptual aerocapture system to converge on a single design concept for multiple aerocapture missions, and completely analyze the characteristics of spacecraft utilizing the selected aerocapture concepts.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The NASA Strategic Plan includes the objective of exploring the solar system.  Studies have shown the benefits of aerocapture for decelerating from hyperbolic approach speed to a planet into an orbit about the planet.  Recent work has shown that inflatable aeroshells have the potential to improve aerocapture capability and that this improved performance may be enabling for planetary destinations that have demanding aerocapture performance requirements, such as high lift-to-drag (L/D) and aerodynamic heating.  A good example is Neptune aerocapture, which has a very high arrival speed resulting in severe thermal environment and a high L/D requirement compared to other destinations.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Several commercial enterprises are actively developing reusable aerospace vehicles that may benefit from this aerocapture technology.  Inflatable aeroshells have the potential for improving aerocapture performance for Earth entry, and may be enabling for some missions that require large mass and volume, thus providing a growth path for missions with large cargo and reusable launch subsystems.

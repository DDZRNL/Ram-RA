<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Proposed is a pressure vessel with 25% better Fracture Strength over equal strength designed Fiberglass to help reduce 10 to 25% weight for aerospace use. 
<br>
<br>Phase I is a proof-of-concept to make a 4? diameter x 24? long cylindrical vessel. Phase II will make 12? or larger diameter x 48? long vessels.  The vessel will be used to store compressed gases and liquids for aerospace applications where impact damage is a possibility.
<br>
<br>A pressure vessel has openings for nozzles etc. Fracture toughness (KIC ) and strength are both used to design a safe vessel which would meet leak-before-fail and other conditions.  In the proposed innovation high toughness 580 KSI (4000 MPa) steel wires woven in net shape will be used. Wire counts are proportional to transverse and longitudinal stresses and a polymer covers the net. The ends are uniquely overlapped to preserve maximum strength.  Cost is substantially low.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Fuel Storage: A 10 to 20% lighter weight compared to fiberglass-polymer pressure vessel at low cost 
<br>- Storage of Chemically challenged fluid replacing costly stainless steel or other metals;
<br>- Medical Application for lightweight oxygen and other gas tanks with good damage tolerance
<br>- General application such as portable pressure tanks.

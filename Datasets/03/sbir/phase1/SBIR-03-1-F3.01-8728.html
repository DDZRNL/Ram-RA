<P><B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>Considerable design work has 
been devoted to the development of cryogenic liquid storage containers. 
Containers which hold cryogenic liquids such as liquid nitrogen, oxygen, 
hydrogen, etc. often are double walled vacuum insulated or super insulation 
flasks, bottles or tanks. Vessels so designed for space applications have the 
lowest cryogen evaporation rates of any available, but research is ongoing to 
render these containers less permeable to heat flux. We propose a different 
approach to increasing the cryogenic liquid hold time. We propose increasing the 
heat needed to drive off the cryogenic liquid by fundamentally changing the heat 
needed to cause evaporation of the cryogenic liquid. Our unique approach should 
not be confused with technology developed to support cryogens during shipping or 
other mechanical gyrations, exploits the unique physics and chemistry of 
nanomaterials and their interaction with the cryogenic liquid. Successful 
development of the proposed technology will result in longer hold times, 
decreased payload mass, lower volume, increased safety and decreased energy 
utilization. 
<P><B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>NASA will 
derive substantial benefits since many cryogenic thermal issues exist in space 
technology. Storage of cryogens in fuel and oxidizer tanks at the launch site, 
on orbit, and in transit vehicles, storage of cryogens for thermal management 
and storage of biological tissues, and the recuperation of cryogens will be 
positively impacted by longer hold time, lower mass and lower evaporation rates. 
Our technology will decrease the need for resupply, increase mission duration, 
increase safety and provide better pressure management, decrease energy usage 
for cryogen recuperation, lower cryogen payload mass, decreased launch fuel and 
oxidizer costs. 
<P><B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>All 
industries or commercial enterprises which utilize cryogenic fluids, will enjoy 
cost savings because the evaporation rate of the cryogenic liquids will be 
reduced. Manufacturers of cryogenic liquids will benefit from decreased energy 
cost since the energy needed to condense the cryogenic liquids will be reduced. 
Cryogens will become more portable and so the military will enjoy more wide 
spread use cryogenic liquids, and extend the hold time of cryogens in existing 
applications. This translates into lower resupply needs, longer duration 
missions and missions using cryogens into more extreme environments.

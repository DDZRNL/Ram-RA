<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
We propose to develop the NJM Sense-It system based on small sensor tags, which include a cardiopulmonary MEMS sensor for measuring heartbeat and breath rates continuously. In addition, the proposed sensor system can be operated in extended bandwidth mode to measure detail cardiopulmonary phonic pattern upon control from the reader. The system operates within a central reader at 915 MHz with as many as 50 sensor tags. 
<br>A single sensor worn as a Band Aid like adhesive or strapped tag on the astronaut monitors cardiopulmonary rates. Additional sensors are worn depending on the detail of phonocardiograph diagnosis data desired. This system is based on the mature technology of phonocardiography now thought at all medical school. This system has advantage that tag sensors measuring many additional physiological functions can be added at later date. The extended bandwidth cardiopulmonary data can be displayed locally or telemetered to earth stations and reviewed by clinicians in any situation as desired.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Monitoring, and analyzing astronaut cardiopulmonary function during flight shuttle missions, and responding to the event.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The commercialized product with disposable tag-based sensors can replace the jungles of wiring and/or battery powered monitoring devices currently in use by the millions worldwide. The medical devices could be part of the remote patient monitoring system at non-clinical setting where at the local center, experienced, certified monitoring specialists analyze the data respond to events, and report results in the manner prescribed by the referring physician.

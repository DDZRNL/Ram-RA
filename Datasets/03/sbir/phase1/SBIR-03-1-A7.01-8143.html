<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Modern bifurcation analysis methods have been proposed for investigating flight dynamics and control system design in highly nonlinear regimes and also for the validation of control systems prior to flight. In this project we propose to build a computer analysis system that integrates symbolic and numerical methods within an interactive graphical framework. The system will be designed to enable flight dynamical analysis and control system design and analysis around bifurcation points. It will based on prior work by the investigators, bringing together bifurcation analysis tools, nonlinear control design tools and new methods developed by them that addresses bifurcations in controlled dynamical systems. The project is unique in three respects: 1) it integrates symbolic and numerical computing methods to achieve more efficient and more reliable results, 2) it provides a powerful user interface that allows essential visualization options and enables the analyst to build and modify models and choose from a variety bifurcation analysis tools, and 3) it integrates symbolic nonlinear control system analysis constructions so that the analyst has the means to ask the appropriate questions in this highly nonlinear regime.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The tools proposed, relate directly to improved safety and performance of aerospace vehicles in case of disturbing events that impair the stability of the vehicle. The system will provide a means for analyzing post bifurcation dynamics and designing recovery strategies. The work will provide a means to investigate and synthesize autonomous aerospace systems that can continue to perform under adverse operating circumstances even after failures. In addition, the tool could be further developed into a means for validating control systems before flight test.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
When equipment failures such occur in commercial aircraft, they can cause catastrophic accidents and fatal loss of life. The primary application of the proposed software system is to improve the safety and performance of these vehicles in face of failures that push them into nonlinear operating regimes. These analysis and design techniques will be applicable to a broad range of systems including other aerospace vehicles, ground and sea vehicles, power systems, hazardous chemical plants, nuclear power plant, robotic manipulators and others. The value of increased safety and performance achieved because of the tools to be developed cannot be overestimated.

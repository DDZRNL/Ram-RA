<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) proposes to develop a hybrid cooling loop and cold plate technology for space systems thermal management. The proposed technology combines the high heat flux performance of active cooling loops with the effective fluid management of passive cooling devices. The result is a simple, robust and high performance cooling technology that allows maximum degree of packaging flexibility. The principal Phase I objective is to demonstrate the basic concept of combining mechanical pumping and capillary force for improved heat flux capability and fluid management. This objective will be fulfilled through modeling/analysis and proof-of-concept testing. It is expected that the Phase I results will bring the proposed concept to the NASA defined Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4: Breadboard validation in a laboratory environment. Phase II will verify the technology?s operational robustness under transient and startup conditions and package the technology in miniaturized and lightweight configurations for compact system cooling. The follow-on Phase III will conduct flight qualification testing of the technology to address the micro gravity effects and the system integration.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA?s vision of exploring the Solar System requires revolutionary advances over the capabilities of traditional spacecraft. Highly integrated, multi-functional packages that combine sensors, control and communications are required for the delivery of distributed sensor systems over planetary surfaces, atmospheres, oceans, or sub surfaces. The proposed technology promises to deliver high heat flux performance in a highly flexible package and with high degree of operational robustness. It is particularly suited for the planned missions to Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Pluto that require high performance in compact configurations and harsh environments.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
One critical need for high heat flux devices is cooling of high-end servers. It was estimated that that within the next five years, there will be 1,000,000 high performance servers requiring the use of integrated high heat flux devices. Power electronics cooling will become increasingly critical with the advance of electric and hybrid vehicle technologies. Integrated cooling devices will provide the required packaging flexibility as more electronics are packed under hood. Another potential market is cooling of laser diodes for telecommunication. The potential market for high power diode laser is estimated to be $350,000,000 within the next ten years.

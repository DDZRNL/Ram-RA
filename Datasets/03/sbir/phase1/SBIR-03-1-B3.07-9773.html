<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The aim of this proposal is to develop a low power consuming solid polymer electrolyte based, miniaturized electrochemical CO2 sensor that can continuously, accurately and rapidly monitor CO2 concentrations in closed or nearly closed environments for monitoring and control approaches for plant-production environments, to aid in NASA?s biomass (edible food) production research. The proposed sensor will introduce a much simpler, lower cost and more accurate alternative to the existing infrared CO2 measurement technology to measure CO2 and study its effects on plant growth. During Phase I, in addition to concept feasibility demonstration, the ability of the proposed sensor to detect (0 - 10) % CO2 in a wide temperature (15 ? 45) oC, and humidity (10 ? 99) % RH will be demonstrated. The proposed sensor will be evaluated for its fast response and continuous and uninterrupted operation for 100 hours. In Phase II the sensor will be integrated into a complete instrument, which will be small, lightweight and will allow for independent operation of the sensor complete with calibration routine, adjustable applied potential settings and digital display of numeric results. The unit will be battery operated with an AC converter and battery re-charger.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed solid electrolyte electrochemical CO2 sensor would have applications in NASA?s ground and space based fundamental biology research programs to study effects of CO2 concentration on biomass (edible food) production and plant growth. The sensor could be configured for closed or nearly closed plant growth chambers or plant culture bioreactors to accurately and continuously measure and control CO2 concentrations in the range of (0 ? 10)%.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Potential Non-NASA application fields, for the proposed electrochemical CO2 sensor, include:
<br>Environmental Applications: For indoor air quality control applications, as well as, for environmental carbon cycle studies.
<br>Medical Applications: To measure the concentration of CO2 in the patient?s exhaled breath in patient breathing systems.
<br>Food Packaging Industry: For accurate measurement and control of CO2 to increase food storage and shelf life and to prevent bacterial growth. 
<br>Brewing and Carbonated Drinks Industry: For accurate measurement and control of CO2 in the brewing and carbonated drinks industry for taste enhancement

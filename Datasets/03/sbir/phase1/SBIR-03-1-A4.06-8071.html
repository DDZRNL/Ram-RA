<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A design and analysis computational tool is proposed for simulating unsteady reacting flows in combustor devices used in reusable launch vehicles.  Key aspects guiding the development are: (a) accuracy, (b) efficiency, and (c) integration of multidisciplinary techniques.  To accurately reflect the physics, the tool must include unsteady, all-speed flow modeling with real-fluid effects and be multidisciplinary, including solid-phase thermal and stress analysis.  Efficiency necessitates large-scale parallel computing.  Finally, the computational framework must allow an efficient integration of multidisciplinary physics.  The key features of the proposed tool are:  (1) a rule-based framework called LOCI which automatically handles parallel computing and multidisciplinary algorithm integration;  (2) all-speed pressure-based CFD methodology (embedded in a code called STREAM);  (3) unsteady flow solver with finite-rate chemistry on unstructured grids; (4) real-fluid modeling (RFM); (5) tightly-coupled multidisciplinary physics, including solid-phase thermal and stress analysis.  Phase I work will consist of: (a) implementing unsteady finite-rate combustion capability into LOCI-STREAM and (b) laying the foundation for implementing real-fluid models into LOCI.  Phase II will accomplish: (a) integration of real-fluid models into LOCI-STREAM; (b) integration of solid-phase heat transfer and finite element stress analysis with the fluid flow solver.  The resulting CFD tool will be called LOCI-STREAM-RFM.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The outcome of Phase I and Phase II research activities will be a powerful CFD-based design and analysis tool (called LOCI-STREAM-RFM) for combustor devices in rocket engines used in reusable launch vehicles.  The enhanced physical models (such as real-fluid and advanced turbulence models), the tightly coupled multidisciplinary physics, and the efficient unsteady simulation capability will result in a better understanding of the complex physics involved in such devices. It is anticipated that all these capabilities in a unified framework will lead to better and more cost-effective design and analysis process for NASA.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The computational tool resulting from this SBIR project will have wide-ranging commercial applications.  The reacting flow capability can be used for simulating combusting flows in various industrial applications, such as gas turbine engines, diesel engines, etc.  The real-fluid methodology can be used in a large number of industrial flow situations involving both chemically inert and reacting flows.  With future additions of other combustion and multi-phase models, the applicability of  LOCI-STREAM-RF  can be further broadened.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Micro Analysis and Design (MA&D) proposes to develop and build a tool to assist in the automated design and evaluation of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) under standard windowing environments.  GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods and Selection Rules) based techniques provide a quantitative method for evaluating alternative system designs, but are labor intensive to create.  We propose abstracting the Keystroke Level Model GOMS technique to a higher level, the user interface component level.  This abstraction will be integrated into a tool that will combine goal and task data with a model of the interface to predict the time to accomplish the goal and the user interface efficiency.   The application will also provide a framework for the future development of metrics related to the interface design, user goals, and user characteristics.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA has an interest in developing applications that are effective and efficient for their users.  In space, many applications will be used on space station or vehicle that while not cognitively complex, still require the user to interact with a traditional WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pulldowns) interface.  Testing of these applications can be expensive.  One alternative to decrease the amount of testing needed is to have a tool that will predict performance early on in the design phase.  This saves NASA money and time in evaluating potential interface designs.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The application will provide the following benefits to every software design and development project: 1) drastically cut the amount of labor required to perform KLM-GOMS evaluations, 2) allow time to perform product level evaluations and 3) allow the user interface designer to provide quantitative data to back up proposed UI changes, such as return on investment of software development resources.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposed work will develop a pump, which is based on two novel and unique design features.  The first feature is a lobed pumping mechanism which operates with orbital motion.  The second feature is the novel manner in which the orbital motion is generated.  This pump has monolithic construction, is intrinsically sealed, and mechanically balanced.  Power is provided to the pumping mechanism by electromagnetic drives, which are incorporated into the pump mechanism forming a compact, integrated unit.  The unique features and simplicity of this design promises to provide a pump, which is compact, has low mass, and has quiet, safe, and reliable operation.  This pump will be ideal for the long-term, space-based applications.  Its development will focus on cryogenic fluids pumping including liquid oxygen.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The unique features of this pump will make it ideal for many NASA applications including cryogenic fluids pumping for space-based operations.  Its initial development will focus on pumping liquid oxygen.  In addition to pumping cryogenic liquids, other space-based applications include gas compression and pumping for gas transfer and storage functions.  Gas compression for space-based refrigeration, heat pump, and cryogenic cycles are other applications which will be of great value to NASA.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A large market for this design is a compressor for industrial gases.  The key feature for this application is the design?s monolithic construction and hermetic seal.  This feature would result in increased plant safety and reliability for the handling of toxic, flammable, or otherwise hazardous gases within the chemical industry.  A related market is a pump for pumping liquid chemicals.  Again, the safety and reliability features of this design are expected to give it advantages over other designs for this application.  Very large markets include compressors for residential and commercial refrigeration cycles.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Prediction and enhancement of vehicle interior noise due to high frequency excitation, based on computer simulation, allows the application of the technology at the early stage of design process thereby improving the quality and reducing the cost. Traditionally, Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) has been used for this  purpose. Modeling of SEA is rather complex and requires high level of analyst expertise as well as occasional testing of the product's components. In this proposal, a comprehensive Energy Finite Element Analysis (EFEA) software will be developed for the evaluation of vehicle interior noise. Since the low frequency noise and vibration modeling is traditionally performed using finite element method, the development of an EFEA software will provide a unified framework for the both the low and high frequency noise and vibration analyses.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The software developed as part of the proposal will be applicable for the evaluation and improvement of aerospace interior noise at the early stage of design process. In particular, airframe and noise control treatments can be systematically evaluated for optimal performance.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Interior noise performance is important in aerospace, automotive, naval and other industries. For example, as a result of increased use of telematic devices in the interior of automobiles, the automotive industry is paying more and more attention to early stage evaluation tools that can be used to enhance the interior noise. The software developed as part of the proposal will be applicable for interior noise performance of automobiles. Similarly the software is applicable for the noise evaluation of aircrafts as well as naval vessels.

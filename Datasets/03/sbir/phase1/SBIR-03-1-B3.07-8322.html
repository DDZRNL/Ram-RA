<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Aspen systems proposes to develop an innovative and smart sensors to continuously monitor ambient air compositions by utilizing a resonating tunable micro-cavity technology.  The new device will directly measure the unique vibrational resonance of gas molecules and determine its concentration for each constituent gas species.  In Phase I, we will experimentally demonstrate the proposed concept by monitoring ambient air concentrations using the resonating tunable micro-cavity sensor.  Selectivity and sensitivity of each gas species in air will be determined.  Furthermore, we will determine linear response ranges of the proposed air monitoring system as a function of test gas compositions, including carbon dioxide and ethylene, temperatures and relative humidity.  In Phase II, we will fabricate and test a prototype system for air monitoring in biomass production environments.  
<br>
<br>Resulting smart gas sensors will be extremely compact, accurate, reliable, light weighted, low power consumption, no extra supplies required for operation and fully automated microprocessor controllable.  Furthermore, the same gas sensing and monitoring system can be used to measure relative humidity, pressures and temperatures of ambient air by using slightly modified sensor designs.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Reliable universal gas detector technology for monitoring ambient air and detecting hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) is critically needed for advanced life-support systems.  There is no universal air monitoring or chemical sensing technology currently suitable for space applications.  The universal gas detector technology can be used for both ambient air monitoring and HAPs detection.  Availability of the proposed technology will make the entire air revitalization process relatively simple and easy to synchronize with other air monitoring/utilization functions.  This technology will be welcome by all NASA personnel and contractors who are involved in advanced spacecraft life support projects.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The highly versatile, low cost, low power consumption and reliable gas detection technology will have a great commercial market potential.  These include: portable consumer products such as CO detectors and air quality monitoring/security systems at home; OEM and industrial applications such as monitoring air quality in automobile compartments, closed public places (meeting rooms and theaters); breath diagnosis for medical applications; and air pollution monitoring in industrial processes.

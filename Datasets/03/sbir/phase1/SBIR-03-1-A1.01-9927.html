<P><B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>TerraMetrics proposes an SBIR 
Phase I R/R&amp;D effort to develop a key 3D terrain-rendering technology that 
provides the basis for successful commercial deployment of flight-qualified 
Synthetic Vision (SV) systems. The proposed innovation exploits the use of an 
encoded terrain data storage format coupled with real-time, terrain-block 
processing that inherently provides true, display-limited rendering accuracy and 
deterministic frame rates, eliminates "vertex-popping" artifacts, and supports a 
spherical rendering model as well as lightweight computer and data storage 
platform requirements. Significant preceding computer graphics research has 
targeted terrain rendering, but the focus has been on non-rigorous, ground-based 
visualization/simulation (VisSim) and gaming applications. The accuracy and 
performance demands of a flight-deployable, SVS terrain-rendering environment 
have not been adequately addressed to date, due to minimal commercial demand. 
The proposed innovation provides a flight-qualifiable, SV avionics 3D 
terrain-rendering solution to NASA?s Aviation Safety Program (AvSP) and 
downstream SV commercial embodiments.

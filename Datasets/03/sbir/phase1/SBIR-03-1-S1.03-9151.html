<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) for microspacecraft is a rapidly growing technology area for the use of fiber optics and MEMS. Morgan Research Corporation proposes an innovative system called a fiber optics sensor suite (FOSS) that combines the strain/damage detection capability of fiber with the temperature, acceleration, and shock determination of MEMS. The proposed research allows for optical fiber to be used as a distributed backbone-sensing member with nodes of environmental sensors placed at strategic locations along the structure. The optical fiber is able to sense damage and external or internal loads on the structure while MEMS nodes monitor the spacecraft?s surroundings. The optical fiber acts as a communication link between the nodes and to acquire and transmit data in a format not susceptible to EMI or environmental noise.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
MORGAN will provide NASA with a much-needed method of instrumenting microspacecraft with the SHM required to ensure successful completion missions for less money per kilogram, and in a smaller volume. Whether the application is a rover or aerobot, the reconfigurable FOSS sensor platform will provide enhanced sensing capability over existing non-ruggedized options. The innovative nature of the FOSS combines a multiparameter sensor node on a chip, strung together along a sensing optical fiber. In this manner the spars of a thin film gossamer wing can be monitored for torsional loads while the tips are scrutinized for subtle changes in acceleration.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commerce and consumers continue to operate and field more complicated and expensive products. Along with this is the desire to allow the products to be monitored, managed, and instrumented in cost effective and non-obtrusive manner. Whether it is the carbon-fiber mast of a racing ship, an uninhabited stretch of railroad tracks, or the engine room a cargo ship, health monitoring is increasing in importance. A fiber optic sensor suite, which provides strain/damage detection and environmental sensing in one network is extremely valuable.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA?s program for Exploration of the Solar System requires high-resolution microwave spectrometers for the analysis of chemical composition and  physical properties of solar system atmospheres. The anticipated results of the proposed R/R&D effort (Phase I and II), if the project is successful, are to demonstrate experimentally the first digital auto-correlation spectrometer on a single chip for spaceborne microwave radiometers with the following important characteristics: (a) a bandwidth of 200 MHz, (b) 4096 spectral channels for high-resolution spectroscopy,  (c) less than 3 W power consumption, (d) a mass of less that 800 grams, and (e) a space-qualifiable design and fabrication technology. 
<br>The innovative approach proposed for achieving these  significant objectives consists of a synergistic combination of the following: (a) a unique parallel architecture that will reduce the operating clock frequency,  relative to a single-stream architecture, by a factor of 2 and consequently will lower significantly the power consumption,  (b) novel differential analog and digital circuits that will improve robustness while operating in the presence of total dose natural radiation found in the space environment, and (c) an advanced 0.13 um CMOS fabrication process  available from IBM for  manufacturing high-performance, low-power, reliable,  and robust (total dose radiation and latch-up resistant) space-qualifiable chips.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
	The space-qualifiable, digital auto-correlation spectrometer chip developed in the proposed project will be commercialized to several NASA programs such as the Exploration of the Solar System,  Earth Remote Sensing, and  space-based radio-astronomy. If the proposed project is successful, it will provide a digital spectrometer chip with such a low power consumption and small mass that it will enable space science missions that were not previously possible.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposing firm will focus on the marketing a family of state-of-the-art digital auto-correlation spectrometers.  There are several non-NASA scientific and commercial markets with a high demand for digital auto-correlation spectrometers such as radio-astronomy, atmospheric research, imaging arrays for detection of weapons and explosives, telecommunication, and medical imaging

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
CCT proposes an advanced data description exchange approach for space/spaceport systems that will provide a generic platform independent software capability for exchange of semantic control and monitoring information. This new strategy will reduce development, operations, and support costs for legacy and future systems that are part of ground and space based distributed control systems. It will also establish a space systems information exchange model that can support future highly interoperable and mobile software systems. The concept seeks to provide a solution that will ease the adoption of a common data definition and exchange standard for legacy and future systems by minimizing or eliminating the need for custom software modifications.
<br>Phase 1 of the research will determine the viability of creating common access services for the space ground systems domain based on use of emerging exchange standards for telemetry, and drive out architecture strategies for cross platform generation of monitoring (e.g. health and status) service middleware. Phase 2 will seek to expand the scope of the target domain to also include control services and create a complete usable suite of services for a broader range of heterogeneous systems.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The availability of a platform independent, low cost, advanced data description exchange services for NASA?s many space/ground systems would provide a tremendous cost savings via reduction of software development cost to migrate legacy and new systems towards more capable data exchange standards. There would be an even greater cost savings realized from the streamlining of mission preparation processes.  
<br>Advanced exchange standards for control and monitoring would also contribute to the eventual design of next generation spaceport command, control, and monitoring systems that are evolvable and capable of supporting heterogeneous vehicles and spaceport systems.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
New telemetry and command exchange standards will serve to enhance the capabilities of CCT?s existing command and control product line, allowing CCT to offer data exchange capabilities not previously available in a commercial control and monitoring product.
<br>CCT will also evaluate the potential for commercial resale of the advanced exchange middleware to other vendors of telemetry and command systems, as well as the very large community of owners of custom or semi-custom legacy ground systems.

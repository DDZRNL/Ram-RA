<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The innovation proposed in this STTR program is a high temperature membrane to increase the efficiency and power density of PEM fuel cells.  The NASA application is newly emerging electric aircraft propulsion systems.  The proposed membrane is based on novel proton conducting polymeric materials that will not require humidification or the use of leachable dopants to enhance proton transport.  Operation of fuel cells at temperatures > 150 ?C will facilitate heat and water management, increase the current density, and reduce the over-potentials for hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction.  These advantages will translate to lower power system weight for propulsion applications through reduced fuel cell system size and improved fuel economy.  The high temperature membranes will be based on new polymer materials recently discovered at the University of Michigan (UM).  In this program T/J Technologies will collaborate with UM to transfer this technology into fuel cell applications through developing blends or copolymers designed to improve fuel cell performance.  T/J Technologies will modify casting and fabrication methods for the new membrane materials.  The overall goal of phase I is to demonstrate a novel membrane that is mechanically, thermally and chemically robust at >150 ?C and attains a proton conductivity > 0.1 S/cm2.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Electric propulsion is the primary NASA application for high temperature fuel cells.  Electric aircraft propulsion will reduce noise and emissions, and may increase energy efficiency.  Hybrid fuel cell/photovoltaic systems offer the potential for very extended and high altitude flights.  This technology will enable new applications such as reconnaissance, weather forecasting, environmental monitoring, and communications relays.  Other space applications would include replacements for batteries in LEO and GEO satellites or for portable high energy density power supplies in lights, cameras, tools, and communications equipment.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Higher temperature membranes are considered an enabling technology for a wide range of commercial PEMFC applications.  High temperature operation will increase the rates of fuel cell reactions, decrease the amount of Pt catalyst in the electrodes, and dramatically decrease the system size and cost.  Advances in this technology could benefit all of the key emerging fuel cell applications, including distributed stationary generation, motor vehicle propulsion, portable power supplies for soldiers, and replacements for rechargeable batteries in consumer electronics.

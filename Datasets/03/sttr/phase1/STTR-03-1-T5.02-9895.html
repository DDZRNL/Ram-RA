<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The overarching challenge of tele-presence is to provide an environment to the human operator that is sufficiently familiar that the interface itself does not become burdensome and distract from the goals of the mission.  The ultimate achievement would be to embed the operator into a scene in such a way as to convince him or her that they are actually on site.  We propose a technology that can potentially achieve this by addressing and expanding on two specific technology needs outlined under the subtopic of human/robot interfaces: 1) Stereographic display systems that provide a large field of view, and high resolution, and 2) Techniques for capturing 360 degree video at a work site and redisplaying as a mosaiced virtual environment to the crewmembers back at the base camp.  The extension to these ideas is a technology to offer Omni-Directional (full 4p steradian) stereographic information at an appropriately high resolution.  The first innovation is the technique for acquiring the necessary information.  The second is processing it to provide a continuous, unobstructed, Omni-Directional, stereographic field of view.  A head mounted display with attitude tracking has been selected as the most appropriate display device to truly embed the users into the scene.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed system is ideally suited to control robotic systems, due to the inherent depth perception.  An obvious application is the control of robots on the surface of Mars to collect samples or build permanent structures.  Educational uses of the system can allow users to experience the spectacular views from space, or realistic tours of the space station.  It offers enhanced communication between astronauts and ground personnel and greater monitoring of the shuttle on lift-off, providing valuable safety information.  Finally, the system would allow astronauts in space the ability to exercise or relax in realistic simulations of Earth environments.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The non-NASA applications are numerous.  In addition to uses similar to those described for NASA, the system can also be used to control firefighting drones to rescue people or douse fires.  The system will enhance communication allowing unmatched teleconferencing or virtual tours of homes and vacation getaways.  It will also provide improved surveillance allowing the ability to quickly and realistic monitor a building.  Other applications include event filming, and surround TV.  But perhaps the most exciting applications are reality theme parks, allowing visitors to ride a ?virtually real? Space Mountain or to run with the bulls in Pamplona.

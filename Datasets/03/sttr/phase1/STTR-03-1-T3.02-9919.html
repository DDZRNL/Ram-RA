<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
There is a continuing need within NASA for solar cells and arrays with very high specific power densities (1000-5000 kW/kg) for generating power in a new generation of ultralight space payloads. An emerging technology with promise to meet these ambitious goals are solar cells based on very thin films of discrete layers or interpenetrating networks (IPNs) of organic donors and acceptors. It is also recognized in the field of thin film inorganic solar cells, that it is possible to stack cells tuned to the blue, green and red portions of the solar spectrum, thus harvesting photons with less degradation of their energy. Theoretical efficiencies for multijunction solar cells are ~70% compared to ~30% for single junction devices. Indeed, these multijunction solar cells hold the current record for solar conversion efficiency. In this proposed joint STTR program between EIC Laboratories and the University of Florida, we will develop multijunction organic donor-acceptor solar cells as a means to achieve higher efficiencies than can be realized with single junction devices. Phase I will demonstrate feasibility using a two junction ?blue-red? device. Phase II will develop three junction devices and scaled up devices on lightweight flexible polymer substrates.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA applications include power for microsatellites and planetary landers, and for powering adaptive optical flexible mirrors and antennas. Future needs include longterm power for deployed planetary exploration.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The cells are projected to provide power at ~$0.5/peak watt, which would strongly impact the domestic energy market as an alternative energy source. Other applications include power for battery charging, instrumentation, sensors, and remote installations.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Advanced space fission systems are being developed as safe and affordable space propulsion alternatives for long-term space exploration.  The characterization of non-nuclear test core simulators is limited by the lack of instrumentation options available for temperature and strain measurements.  Luna Innovations proposes to develop sensors based on a fiber Bragg grating system for temperature and strain measurements.  These fiber optic sensors can provide 20 to 100 times more sensing points as thermocouples on interior and exterior surfaces of the core simulator, which are expected to reach temperatures of 1000?C.  In addition, Luna Innovations will work with a university partner to develop a modeling strategy to characterize the core by comparing critical data collected during operation (power distribution, temperature, strain, etc.).  Hence, an array of sensors will map the physical responses of the core and produce a working feedback model for use in optimization studies of the system.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This technology will be specifically developed for use in the SAFE-100 non-nuclear core test bed; however, the potential applications extend to numerous applications.  For example, health monitoring of shuttle tiles, solid rocket fuel monitoring, rocket test characterization, or life support system characterization and optimization.  The use of this distributed sensing system extends to any applications requiring minimally intrusive, temperature and strain measurements in harsh-environment operations.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
	Distributed harsh-environment temperature and strain measurements will be applicable in a wide variety of industries, including aircraft structural and engine health monitoring, fuel cell operations, power and space turbine applications, automotive and military applications.  Luna has been working in each of these industries to improve operation safety and efficiencies.  This project will allow for further development of this existing technology to extend into the unique area of harsh-environment sensing.

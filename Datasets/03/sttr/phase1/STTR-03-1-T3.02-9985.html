<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Since high temperature Sm-Co based magnets were developed, a number of new applications have been introduced.  NASA?s Xe+ ion propulsion engine used in Deep Space I (DS-I) is a prime example. The magnets with coating perform well at temperatures up to 550?C.  Magnets without coating perform well in the current 10 kW Xe+ ion engines in the vacuum which exists in space and at temperatures up to 400?C. Additional challenges are expected in the missions NASA is planning.  The new missions, with higher-powered engines, include travel toward the sun, to Jupiter, and planets beyond. In these higher-powered engines (> 10 kW) temperatures are expected to reach 550?C in vacuum to ~10-5 Torr.  Technical data of the high temperature Sm-Co in the conditions of the NASA?s new mission are needed.  
<br>This program proposes to study the effects of radiation on physical and magnetic properties, and the thermal stability and its improvement, in vacuum at temperature up to 550?C, of Sm-Co high temperature magnets.  Based on the results of this work, improvements to Sm-Co magnets will be made to enhance the performance of high power Xe+ ion propulsion engines.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The applications include the high-power ion engines to be used for Ion Propulsion of NASA?s Jupiter Mission.  Consistent magnet performance is essential for the performance of the ion engine. The operating temperatures for these high-power ion engines will reach 550?C, and the operating conditions in the space will include vacuum and radiation.  Of the variety of permanent magnet materials available, the Sm-Co high temperature magnet is the only magnet suitable for use in these high power ion engines. This proposed program will obtain the necessary data to ensure the performance of NASA?s spacecrafts powered by ion engines with consistent magnetic field.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The applications include traveling wave vacuum tubes (TWT) and ultra-high vacuum ion pumps for both industrial and military applications.  TWT technology is widely used for satellite communications and military electronic warfare.  One of the examples is the TWT used for the Towed Decoy which improves survivability of military Aircraft.  TWT components with stacks of periodic Sm-Co magnets play a vital role for this task. 
<br> 
<br>Ultra-high vacuum ion pump?s manufacturing processes include degassing at high temperatures in vacuum condition.  The results of this program will help to improve the manufacturing process and enhance the performance.

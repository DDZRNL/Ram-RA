<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
NextGen Aeronautics is proposing an innovative space qualified non-destructive evaluation and health monitoring technology. The technology is built on concepts developed by PIs from the University of South Carolina (USC) and NextGen. Excitation of preferential Lamb/Rayleigh wave modes, utilization of phased array concepts, and utilization of software algorithms rather than hardware for beam forming and signal analysis, are three innovative concepts in the proposed technology. These concepts set our approach apart from most of the technologies in use or under development at present. The purpose of Phase I effort is to firmly establish the feasibility of the technology developed at USC. This will be mostly accomplished by experimental validation on realistic test articles. Stiffened, bonded and mechanically fastened metallic panels will be fabricated and tested to mitigate most of the risk going into Phase II. We will demonstrate the ability to detect cracks, corrosion and debonds. Technology, under planned development, will be applicable to various metallic, composite, plastic and ceramic materials as structural material or adhesives, sealants and coatings. This technology offers the potential for low cost and light weight damage detection capabilities to permit continuous or on-demand structural damage assessment of the entire structure.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed structural health monitoring technology can reduce the risk of failure, and maintenance costs for aerospace vehicles. It is particularly attractive for space applications because of light weight, space qualifiable attributes and reliability by virtue of simplicity. It can potentially be put on satellites, space stations, space shuttles and planetary exploration vehicles. It is complementary to many efforts underway in structural and vehicle health and usage monitoring at many NASA research and development facilities<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are many potential applications to the aerospace, civilian infrastructure, automotive and manufacturing industries. The potential applications of structural health monitoring systems and benefits of this emerging technology are well documented. The key commercialization drivers in non-NASA applications is life cycle cost, avoidance of  catastrophic failure and inspection of hard to reach places. Continuous or on-demand inspection of bridges, buildings, off-shore structures and oil drilling machinery will be among the first non-aerospace application NextGen will pursue after maturing the technology.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
MPAC and UMR are proposing development of an Acoustic Control System for high temperature gas flow in ducts.  This control system is based on a passive inorganic acoustical coating. MPAC has developed and applied for a patent on a architectural acoustical control coating with unusually high wear resistance, a noise reduction coefficient of 0.5, and  excellent low frequency damping. UMR has long experience in modeling acoustic treatment in ducts with high speed flow and has world class facilities for experimental characterization of acoustic materials and systems.  The proposal team is committed to a phase one proof of concept deliverable consisting of  passive coatings for application. This acoustic control coating, if successful, would provide a very low cost high reliability acoustical damping for hot gas structures.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The NASA applications of the technology involve use of the developed acoustical abatement system  in launch facilities and in a wide variety of test stands.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The commercial applications for this work are directed at noise reduction and employee safety in foundry facilities, commercial launch facilities, and oil drilling facilities. It should be noted that there is expected commercial in the development of  liners which for commercial jet aircraft and hanger facilities.

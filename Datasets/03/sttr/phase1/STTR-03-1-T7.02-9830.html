<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Time Reversal Acoustic (TRA) structural health monitoring with an embedded sensor array represents a new approach to in-situ nondestructive evaluation of air-space systems. The suggested approach is based on a sufficient improvement of recently developed Electro-Mechanical Impedance method and will use a similar array of embedded sensors. The application of TRA principles will significantly improve the system?s ability to detect the presence of structural faults and localize damage due to directive focusing of the ultrasonic signals radiated by many sensors. Scanning of the focus will give the necessary information for tomographic mapping of damage and degradation. During Phase I, the principles of TRA system with embedded sensors for damage detection will be developed and feasibility test will be conducted on composite and metal parts with increasing levels of damage. The developed TRA software and hardware will form a basis for the prototype that will be built in Phase II.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The suggested work will lead to a simple, cost-effective commercial sensor technology and instrumentation for the in-situ diagnosis of damage formation and accumulation in airspace systems.  This will permit early detection of damage and therefore increase efficiency and reliability of maintenance schedules. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed novel technology will have broad civilian applications for the quality control in manufacturing, assessment of structural integrity of materials prior to assembling, immediately following assembling, and during operational life. One of the most promising applications of new technique is self-diagnosis of damage in fiber-reinforced composites used in aerospace structures.

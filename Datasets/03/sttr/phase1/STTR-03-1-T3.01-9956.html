<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Propulsion systems that provide high power to weight and minimal mass are required for the planned generation of nanospacecraft and nanosatellites.  Power-MEMS can provide a low cost, highly scalable production approach to small power systems as well as distributed power systems.  However, to achieve the desired efficiencies from the MEMS operating temperatures need to exceed the structural temperature limit of silicon. In conjunction with the MIT Micro-Engine program, many of the technologicalissues for the incorporation of a refractory reinforcement, such as silicon carbide, have already been addressed.  Selective deposition of the silicon carbide is believed to address the last remaining processing issues for fabricating selectively reinforced Si/SiC hybrid wafers.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The successful incorporation of silicon carbide is an enabling technology for power-MEMS devices.  In addition to microrockets, MEMS heat engines such as microturbines can benefit from SiC incorporation.  Power-MEMS devices are predicted to be a rapidly growing field characterized by high specific power output. These devices can be utilized to power nanospacecraft and nanosatellites as well as larger systems when arrayed as a distributed power source.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Initial commercial applications would likely be for compact, low weight power sources.  However due to the high specific power efficiencies, more traditional power applications can be addressed with arrays of power-MEMS.  The selective deposition of SiC would also greatly advance the fabricability of elevated temperature MEMS sensors and controls.  Elevated temperature pressure sensors capable of operation at greater than 400C is one such market.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed work seeks to develop and optimize an electrode-less plasma propulsion system that is based on a high power helicon (HPH) that is being developed collaboratively between MSNW and the University of Washington.  The helicon is well suited for this task, as it is known for efficient production of high-density plasmas.  The proposed system takes helicon research into an entirely unexplored regime of high power, moving from the traditional kW level discharges to tens and hundreds of kW.  Preliminary results indicate that it has excellent potential for making an efficient propulsion system with an estimated thrust of about 1 N for 50 kWe.  Higher thrust levels are expected with optimization of its operational characteristics, particularly the addition of a magnetic nozzle that will facilitate conversion of thermal energy into directed flow.  Numerical modeling will be employed to understand the relevant physics, and help determine the optimal thruster configuration.  Scaling studies will determine the power levels where HPH is competitive or surpasses other systems under consideration for NASA?s higher power missions.  Based on results, a plan for the complete system design and test demonstration of the HPH to be realized in Phase II will be detailed.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Successful development of the High Power Helicon (HPH) thruster would have application to several NASA missions, in particular the NASA nuclear electric propulsion initiatives such as Project Prometheus and the Jupiter Icy Moon Orbiter (JIMO).  The HPH thruster would result in a robust, lightweight, high power, highly efficient, low cost, long-lived propulsion system that could also enable future NASA missions such as the human exploration of Mars.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are several other applications for the High Power Helicon.  With the ability to operate efficiently at high density, Helicon discharges have been developed as plasma sources for plasma processing.  The initial results for the HPH show downstream plasma distribution that is very uniform over a large area, which is ideal for plasma processing.  The range of plasma densities and gasses have yet to be fully explored.  Being electrode-less, requiring a power source ~ 100 V, and producing plasma in a highly transparent vessel, there is very likely application in the area of high intensity lighting.

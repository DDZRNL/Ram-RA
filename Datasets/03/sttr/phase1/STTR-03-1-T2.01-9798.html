<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A new multidisciplinary software environment ('MUSE') will be developed for the simulation of flight vehicles, drawing on the results of recent research on very fast algorithms, performed at Stanford University under Professor Antony Jameson's guidance.  This new technology will be merged with Intelligent Aerodynamics' finite element methology implemented in the product FASTPLANE.  This code, which uses multigrid acceleration techniques and is fully parallelized, can already perform^Msteady-state simulations of complete aircraft in less than 5 minutes on a 16 processor Beowulf cluster. The synergy resulting from the technology transfer will lead to a new level of capability for the simulation of both steady and unsteady flows, thus providing the platform needed to couple additional disciplines into an advanced multidisciplinary tool for aero-structural and thermal analysis.  It can also provide the platform for a new generation of design-optimization software using the adjoint methodology developed by Antony Jameson and his collaborators during the last decade.  Moreover, with further advances in the performance of computer hardware that can be anticipated, real time simulation of flight vehicles should in the future be feasible with this new software. This would provide a powerful new tool to support flight-testing.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Performance of Flight Vehicles
<br>The steady and unsteady simulations will be useful for NASA scientists
<br>to characterize the performance of flight vehicles and to streamline
<br>the flight testing process.
<br>
<br>Trajectory Analysis
<br>Using the unsteady multi-disciplinary simulation tool it will be
<br>possible to predict the trajectories of flight vehicles, and
<br>eventually simulate separation maneuvers.
<br>
<br>Advanced Concepts
<br>It will provide a cost effective process for the 
<br>preliminary evaluation of advanced concepts including new hypersonic
<br>vehicles and morphing configurations.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Aircraft Design
<br>An efficient multidisciplinary simulation capability for flight
<br>vehicles will enable a streamlined preliminary design process.
<br>It may also play a role in reducing
<br>the cost of certification.
<br>
<br>Turbomachinery problems
<br>The new advanced algorithms could
<br>potentially lead to drastic reductions in 
<br>computational time and costs. 
<br>
<br>Simulation of rotor-craft
<br>The new time-integration methods and finite
<br>  element methodology will allow
<br>engineers and researchers to model blade motion and vortex wake
<br>  interaction, enabling high-fidelity helicopter rotor  analysis.
<br>
<br>Other Industrial Applications
<br>Because  fluid-structure
<br>systems are so pervasive in all of  mechanical  engineering, our work
<br>will be useful in many other industries.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
In this Phase I STTR project for NASA, Concrete Solutions Inc (CSI), together with the University of Texas at Austin (UTA), will develop a detailed research plan that will provide for an acoustic liner that is capable of withstanding high exhaust temperatures up to 3,000 F over a range of sound frequencies.  
<br>
<br>Using CSI?s patented product, SoundSorb, a cementitious material that is used extensively in the transportation industry to attenuate the reflection of highway and railway noise, the CSI/UTA team will develop (1) Formulation and testing of SoundSorb, or variants thereof, that will meet the requirements of sound absorption, heat and vibration for the target application; (2) Develop an application system or process that can be used to manufacture acoustic liners of this material; and (3) Develop a scale model to validate and demonstrate that the material can meet or exceed the requirements of the liners.
<br>
<br>SoundSorb? has been tested under several ASTME testing regimes required by various governmental and transportation organizations. It has passed all these tests for acoustic behavior, durability and extreme weather conditions.  This project will show feasibility for use in this application.
<br>
<br>In Phase II, CSI/UTA will produce prototype liners for testing in actual launch conditions.
<br>

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The successful completion of Phase II of this project will create a product that can be placed in extreme environmental conditions of sound, heat and vibration, with the purpose of significantly reducing reflected sound. Also, the ability to apply this material in a retro-fit environment, where the structure is already in place, is of critical importance. This means that the material is suitable for both new construction and pre-existing structures.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The successful completion of Phase II of this project will create a product that can be retro-fitted into existing structures where sound absorption and fire retardant capabilities are needed. These include: Airport terminals, utility power plants, correctional facilities, industrial applications, museums and libraries, amusement parks, classrooms, dormitories, mechanical rooms, athletic facilities, restaurants, atriums and lobbies, hospitals, theatres, convention centers, kennels, musical instrument practice rooms, concert halls, loading docks, waste treatment plants, natatoriums and night clubs.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
SSC needs the sensors that are capable and can be operated in liquid oxygen (LOX) and or liquid hydrogen (LH2) cryogenic environment to improve SSC cryogenic testing.  In particular, the Stennis Space Center (SSC) would like to develop a sensor to monitor the quality of LOX in the delivery line during the testing of a rocket engine.  Spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) with its relative simplicity and multi-molecule analysis can be easily employed to develop a sensor for on-line, real-time measurement. The goal of the proposed effort is to develop a SRS sensor, which is able to provide sub-millisecond sampling time for detecting nitrogen percent concentration in cryogenic propellants. During Phase I, a SRS system based on photo multiplier tube detection will be designed. The experimental parameters will be evaluated to achieve optimum response time and sensitivity. A prototype will be delivered to NASA/SSC at the end of Phase I. The study from Phase I will provide the necessary information to improve the phase II prototype design to achieve sub millisecond response time and better sensitivity. In Phase II, a prototype SRS system will be developed and tested at SSC and will be delivered to NASA/SSC for on line measurement

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A Raman based sensor can provide on-line and real-time measurement  of  nitrogen concentration with millisecond  response time which is needed by NASA/SSC cryogenic testing. This sensor can be used for real-time monitoring of nitrogen concentration in LOX or LH2 feed line during the SSC engine test. This sensor can be used to shutdown the LOX feed control valve when the LN2 concentration exceed a pre-determined concentration

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
A sensor based on Raman spectroscopy developed for this proposal can also be used to monitor the chemical composition in large chemical reactor to provide the data to optimize the efficiency of the processing plant and to control the chemical processing in the plant.  When the concentration of certain element reaches above the threshold the sensor will send the warning signal for safety operation of the plant. The laser Raman sensor can be used for quality control in pharmaceutical, chemical and food processing industries. The technology can also be modified for application such as hydrate exploration in deep sea drilling.

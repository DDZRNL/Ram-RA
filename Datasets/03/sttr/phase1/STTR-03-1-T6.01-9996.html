<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
New classes of sensors are needed on spacecraft that can be interrogated remotely using RF signals and respond with the sensor's identity as well as the environmental parameter without use of batteries. Such systems are emerging in the field of RF identification (RFID), but often lack the ability to encode a separate parameter and require the RFID tags to be mounted on an insulator-type surface. The proposed innovation does not employ the conventional 'backscatter' approach now being commercialized, which would preclude mounting the RF-powered sensor devices on metal surfaces. Passive and semiactive devices may respond on the same frequency as they are interrogated, or a separate frequency, and support frequency hopping. Advances are also needed to adapt the same to harsh air and space environments and to include encoding of sensor information for hundreds of sensors, with a total reporting time of about 1 second.  Means must be incorporated to distinguish the multitude encoded responses from up to hundreds of sensors and the interrogator must not pose a health hazard to personnel.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Hundreds of temperature sensors might be mounted under the spacecraft vehicle skin, or tiles in the case of the Shuttle. Such sensors might be incorporated into the thermal protection system (TPS) of a future vehicle, located under thermal heat barriers such as foam, tiles, etc. Such sensors could also be utilized to sense water intrusion under the TPS, abnormal stresses or out of range temperatures during fueling operations. Better pressure monitoring within the tires of current and future vehicles could be facilitated with a sensor in each. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Communications nodes are going wireless in the commercial arena. The same can be expected of sensors with appropriate technological advances. Military and commercial aircraft would benefit from passive wireless sensors. Wireless home intrusion alarms would benefit from not requiring periodic battery changes. Automobiles and trucks could incorporate passive wireless sensors for tire pressure monitoring to alleviate excessive treadwear and as part of their electronic control systems.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Clear Science Corp. and Duke University propose to develop and demonstrate a new and efficient computational method of modeling nonlinear aeroelastic systems.   The method will extend the scope of multi-disciplinary computational tools like NASA Dryden's STARS by augmenting linear eigenmode stability algorithms and coupled time-marching techniques.  The objective is a low-dimensional model that accurately reflects nonlinearity in both structure and fluid and that is efficient enough to permit full exploration of parameter space.  In Phase I, our team will evaluate two types of model order reduction: proper orthogonal decomposition of the coupled-system variables and the method of harmonic balancing.  We will downselect one method based on efficiency, accuracy, and versatility, demonstrate its merit via a prototype problem, and design a comprehensive Phase II plan for model development and testing.  The proposed innovation can minimize the risk of failure and maximize flight safety in aircraft like the F-18-AAW and X-43 by accurately and efficiently predicting nonlinear dynamics over a broad range of flight conditions.  Integrating the nonlinear model with codes like STARS will augment the capability of quickly determining linear stability with the capability of efficiently analyzing nonlinear behavior like limit cycle oscillations, hysteresis, higher harmonic and sub-harmonic resonances, jump resonances, entrainment, beating, and period doubling.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovation offers new computational tools for designing next-generation aircraft like the NASA/Air Force F-18-AAW.  Concepts like the F-18-AAW?s Active Aeroelastic Wing raise significant new challenges for engineers, requiring accurate prediction of nonlinear system responses in the presence of rapidly changing flight conditions and wing configurations.  Integrating new methods of modeling nonlinear dynamics with existing NASA software can keep computational analysis capabilities apace with experimental flight testing.  Computational models that cover a wide range of conditions and system responses (linear and nonlinear) will have a significant impact on design costs by reducing the number of required certification flight tests in future air vehicles and currently deployed systems.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Nonlinear behavior in coupled fluid-structure systems is ubiquitous, and commercial interest in engineering software designed to analyze these systems is high.  Examples of nonlinear interactions between a flexible structure and surrounding flow include aircraft wings in flight, blood flow through arteries, the response of bridges and tall buildings to winds, turbine and compressor blade vibrations, the aero-response of automobile bodies (generating cabin noise), and oscillations in heat exchangers.  Corresponding markets for software tools include the aerospace contractor community and civil transport airframe manufacturers, gas turbine and HVAC manufacturers, the automotive industry, rotorcraft companies, medical equipment manufacturers, and weapon system designers.

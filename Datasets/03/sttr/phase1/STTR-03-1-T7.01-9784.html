<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
A critical barrier for GA to serve as viable and volume personal transportation is the lack of a cost-effective, yet open-growth, Lean Design and manufacturing technologies using automotive manufacturing technologies in for new personal airplanes.  Munro & Associate and Michigan SATS share a vision, ?The CAR of the FUTURE is an Airplane?. This STTR?s goal is to create an innovative, Lean Design PAV design through 21st century automotive industry technologies ? Such designs systems will serve as a vital enabler for turning NASA's PAV Vision into reality.

Potential NASA Application(s):  (Limit 100 words or 1,500 characters, whichever is less)
<br>Today?s General Aviation propellers are expensive, and cost approximately $3,000 per blade for variable pitch. The automotive technologies proposed have the potential to allow PAV propellers to be manufactured for $300 per blade. These manufacturing techniques allow new materials for improved fatigue life and corrosion resistance. In addition these enable low noise propellers using thin blade sections that reduce noise components due to blade thickness.  The proposed propeller blade section and geometry design will reduce fly over noise.  Thus the Munro & MI SATS STTR project supports both the low noise & low cost goals of PAV
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Potential Non-NASA Commercial Application(s):  
<br>Commercial applications include full scale propeller blade manufacturing for new as well as the 100,000 plus existing small airplanes in the country. In the future it will cover propulsor manufacturing for such PAVs as well.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed innovations conform precisely to the technology needs described in Subtopic T5.02, Robotics and Virtual Digital Human Technologies. ?Two potential areas for research are the ever-evolving robotics and 3-D simulation technologies providing operational robustness and intelligence.? Our proposal explicitly addresses two of the ?specific technology requirements?: the application of haptics for improved operator awareness of and reaction to robotic activity; and the introduction of stereographic display systems for optimized operator visual situational awareness. We extend our proposal?s relevance by ?offering innovation in the form of 3-D visualization and simulation capabilities of robotic systems with relation to the 3-D virtual-digital-human-in-the-loop concept.? Our VDH technology can place realistic virtual humans working collaboratively with virtual Robonauts in synthetic environments that emulate Space Station or Space Shuttle. Finally, we propose to address the application targets of ?flight and ground operations development, analyses, training and support? by incorporating gravitational force as a variable in the simulation environment, offering the design of highly realistic tests that ?improve the ability of humans and computers to seamlessly control robotic systems?.  The Phase I investigation could result in opportunities for design enhancement of the robotic devices themselves.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Phase I project targets the NASA issue that mapping human body movements to robotics is not intuitive.  It investigates the fact that rapid prototyping through combination of virtual environment (VE) and CAD-based solutions would accelerate design evolution of the Robonaut to acquire added human dexterity, precision and fluidity of movements.  This opportunity will augment Robonaut engineering and operation through VE-based tools, haptic devices and autostereoscopic displays.  Incorporating better human/ teleoperational interfaces through enhanced robotic engineering and functionality would significantly benefit the Robonaut Program.  Enhanced ISS and STS program development of training simulations and operations planning for missions would result.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercial applications would include systems integration of VDH technology with haptic, motion-capture, and autostereoscopic display functionality for both autonomous and remote-controlled robotic technology development and operation. Diverse global industries (petroleum, medical, automotive, garment, manufacturing, etc.) would benefit from higher, more precise tactile sensitivity to enhance coarse and fine-grain task performance, enhanced visual display for higher fidelity robotic command and control, and improved human motion capture data collection and portrayal. Better robotic and robot-human interactions and task simulations would positively impact robotic machine design and engineering, task analysis, improvisation, and evaluation and finally planning and scheduling individual and shared events.

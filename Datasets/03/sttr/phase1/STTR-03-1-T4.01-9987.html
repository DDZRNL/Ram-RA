<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
AdTech Photonics, in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Studies in Photonics Research (CASPR) at UMBC, is pleased to submit this proposal entitled ?Very-High Efficiency, High Power Laser Diodes? in response to NASA?s needs in the such areas as diode pumped solid state lasers and Lidar Remote Sensing. Our goal is to develop ultra-high efficiency diode laser bars that can achieve greater than 80% external quantum efficiency, even when operated at very high power, in order to enable various NASA applications. 
<br>	To demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing the laser diodes, we propose important milestones that include: a. innovative laser structures to incorporate well-designed band alignment to reduce over-flow leakage current. b. Designing, fabricating, packaging, and testing of thin film double-side heat removal designs that reduce the laser operating temperature and heating induced losses. c. Developing mass production on-wafer processing and packaging techniques that allow thin film lasers to be processed and separated into discrete laser bars. 
<br>	AdTech Photonics has many years of production experience in the high power laser area covering both military and commercial market needs since 1995. We will work out all tasks and provide NASA with small quantity fabricated samples for space qualification, and other NASA applications.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
Although a growing number of important NASA earth-science and planetary missions employ lidar sensors, their limited power, efficiency, weight, lifetime, and relibility have been major concerns. High power semiconductor lasers advantages include small size, low weight, high efficiency, and ease of use, all essential for UAV, balloon and space applications. However, the cost and reliability of these diode laser bars is far from ideal and there remains substantial room for improvement. A revolutionary approach to these lasers, improving their performance and reliability while reducing cost, allows for  more capable, less expensive and less complex space remote sensing systems <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
High power semiconductor lasers are powerful tools for pumping solid-state materials, selective soldering and desoldering, welding and heat treating, among other scientific and industrial applications. They are also very useful for various medical (and veterinary) applications including hair removal, non-invasive treatment of vascular lesions (810 nm), surgery, dermatology and dentistry. In the past 15 years, semiconductor high power lasers have become standard pumping sources, replacing other larger light sources. The advantages of semiconductor lasers are their small size, ease of control, along with the possibility of low cost if mass production methods are developed.

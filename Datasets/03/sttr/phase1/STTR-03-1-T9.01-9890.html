<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Luna Innovations is teaming with the University of Alabama, Huntsville, to develop a miniature flush-mounted fiber-optic pressure sensor that will allow accurate, high-frequency high-pressure measurement of LOx and LH2.  The Innovation of this system is that the sensor is not intrusive, will not interfere with the flow field, and is a novel adaptation of proven technology.  To insure compatibility with the LOx environment, the sensor will be constructed from metal-oxides, ceramics and other materials that are intrinsically safe.  The sensor will help engineers optimize performance of liquid fueled rocket engines for the next generation of reusable lift vehicles, and flight versions of the sensors will enable real-time monitoring and control of the engines, improving safety and enabling commercialization of space.  During the Phase I, a prototype sensor will be designed and tested to verify feasibility.  Materials and bonds will be tested to insure compatibility with LOx.  During the Phase II, optimized sensors will be constructed and extensive tests conducted to advance the technology to pre-production status.  This system meets NASA?s goals by providing LOx and LH2 pressure data while: 1) minimizing intrusion, 2) improving reliability, 3) having fast response time, and 4) being intrinsically safe.

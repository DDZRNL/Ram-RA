<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Impact Technologies LLC, in cooperation the Georgia Institute of Technology, proposes to develop and demonstrate an innovative Automated Contingency Management (ACM) concept for advanced propulsion systems that will provide a superior level of engine fault accommodation and optimized performance based on a seamless integration between the engine health management (EHM) system and the engine controller.   Utilizing a sophisticated engine simulation model with full transient capability and integrated control, a software-in-the-loop demonstration will be delivered that will be capable of realistically simulating various control sensor failures, actuator faults, and engine degradation scenarios with associated results obtained comparing the benefits of the ACM technologies implemented.  
<br>
<br>The proposed ACM software hierarchy will act from the engine subsystems level up through the air vehicle level and will implement advanced fault-accommodating control, health management, and intelligent software agents to accomplish its goal.  The core innovations of this project include: 1.) The development of advanced fault detection algorithms for sensor, actuator and component faults in different flight regimes; 2.) The development of intelligent software agents for achieving optimal dynamic performance under faulty propulsion dynamics; and 3.) The development of reconfigurable control algorithms linked to the EHM system for guaranteeing the stability of the fault-accommodating control system.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed Automated Contingency Management technologies will be directly applicable to propulsion, reusable launch vehicles, unmanned air vehicles and future generation General Aviation platforms. It will lead to benefits in the form of improving reliability, maintainability, and survivability of safety-critical aerospace systems.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The potential commercial use of the developed technologies is broad. Examples of key customers that could benefit through use of the developed technologies include: unmanned combat air vehicles, future combat systems, commercial airlines, land and marine propulsion systems, industrial actuation systems, and robotic applications.  The aero propulsion domain alone has thousands of potential systems to address with this technology.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Commercially available software suites such as the Automate Structural Optimization System (ASTROS) and MSC/NASTRAN represent the current industry standard in multidisciplinary design and optimization (MDO) tools. The primary capabilities of these products have remained largely unchanged since their initial release. In the analysis and design of modern aerospace vehicles, the deficiencies of these legacy tools are becoming increasingly clear. The linear aerodynamic methods employed by these tools are not appropriate when transonic flight regimes are considered or when other nonlinearities are present, particularly when these techniques are used to predict flight vehicle performance. Although advances in computational power and numerical techniques present an opportunity to employ higher fidelity methods, the development of new software is proceeding slowly. The effort described in this Phase I proposal describes a means by which nonlinear analytic and experimental data can be used to improve the accuracy of flight vehicle performance predictions by utilizing existing analysis tools. A procedure is presented to integrate a finite element based analysis and design tool with a nonlinear aerodynamic solver and graphical visualization system to provide improved correlation of simulated results with flight test data.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
The development of a multidisciplinary analysis technique which utilizes nonlinear aerodynamics will immediately benefit many NASA research and development efforts, particularly at NASA Langley, Ames, and Dryden Research Centers where simulations are used to predict wind tunnel or flight test results. The method presented will yield a much higher correlation between predicted results and those obtained by experiment. NASA Dryden flight test efforts, such as the Active Aeroelastic Wing program, will benefit as more accurate predictions, such as maneuver performance and hinge moments can be made prior to the entry into flight tests.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)</B><BR>
There are many potential benefits to the aerospace industry. With increased prediction accuracy through coupling of nonlinear aerodynamics with preliminary design tools, significant cost savings may be achieved. Increased confidence in simulated results could reduce the need for extensive and costly flight test programs. With more accurate design tools at their disposal, engineers can design vehicles with a higher likelihood of performing as they were intended at a reduced risk of encountering unforeseen design issues late in the development process. Furthermore, since a general design tool will eventually be developed, these benefits are applicable across a broad range of products.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
For space-born energy storage systems, the energy to weight ratio, reliability and a long life are extremely important. For most commercial applications on the Earth, the last two factors plus design simplicity and low cost are critical. We propose a design that offers a combination of properties advantageous for both space and Earth-based applications. It features a composite rim, aluminum hub, Null-E magnetic bearings, axial flux ironless motor/generator, and PCB windings. Most of the kinetic energy is stored in the composite rim of the flywheel due to its large radii. The aluminum hub provides interface between the composite rim and other members of the flywheel assembly and also serves as a part of a magnetic bearing. High strength of the modern composite materials combined with low densities of both the composites and the aluminum result in high energy densities. Our preliminary performance estimates are 28Wh/kg (not including the housing and power electronics) and >158,000 cycles to failure. More detailed design and analysis will likely result in even better performance. Using Null-E magnetic bearings result in dramatic design simplification, cost reduction and improved reliability compared to active magnetic bearings while preserving the performance level.

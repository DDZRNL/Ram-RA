<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Extra-vehicular activities (EVA) on the Moon and Mars will require suits with sophisticated thermal control systems allowing astronauts to work for extended periods of time. Use of consumables such as water that cannot be easily replaced should be of particular concern. In this aspect the EVA suits for Moon/Mars environments need to be different from the current Space Shuttle Extra Vehicular Mobility Units (EMU) that require water sublimation into space for removing heat. Moreover, both the Moon and Martian environments are quite different from what conventional EMUs are exposed to. These variations call for careful analysis and innovative engineering for design and fabrication of an appropriate thermal control system.  Rini Technologies, Inc. (RTI) proposes a novel and No/Low consumable approach to this problem.  With the feasibility of the RTI Miniature Vapor Compression Cycle (MVCC) design demonstrated in Phase I, this proposal explores the development of a novel MVCC system suitable for these rigorous environmental requirements.  In Phase II, RTI will build a compact prototype MVCC system capable of providing 250W of cooling while using 75W of electrical power.  Furthermore, the system will achieve TRL 4 prior to the completion of the research activity

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
The MVCC System proposed by RTI is applicable to a number of NASA systems.  Aside from the obvious fit with the EVA suit development, the MVCC system will work well as a compact refrigeration cycle for experimental control.  Furthermore, the system and its components have direct applicability to distributed electronics cooling and climate control<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
The MVCC system is far reaching in the possible non NASA applications.  Specifically, in military and Homeland Security applications, the system can be implemented as a personal cooling device for use with highly insulative garments such as Chem-Bio suits.  In medical applications, the system may be applied to individuals with Chronic Metabolic disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis where thermal regulatory capabilities are diminished.  In electronics applications the System can be applied for active thermal management of the environment as well as high heat point source devices.

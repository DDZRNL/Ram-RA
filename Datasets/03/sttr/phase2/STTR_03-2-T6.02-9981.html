<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Phase I demonstrated experimentally a very high temperature acoustically absorbing coating for ducted acoustics applications. High temperature survivability at 3500 deg F was demonstrated in the MSFC Plasma Jet Facility. Normal incidence acoustic absorption coefficient of 25 % was demonstrated in a standing wave test facility. Phase I work confirmed the possibility of production of acoustic coatings for application in ducted flows near the exhaust of a large rocket engine. The screening process for Phase I was unique in its emphasis on the practical development of a deliverable coating, as opposed to untested theoretical work or screening at unrealistic environmental conditions. In addition, work done late in Phase I produced a coating with an absorption coefficient of 47 % which has yet to be screened for high temperature survivability.
<br>Phase two has one objective and one deliverable:  To produce and experimentally validate a fully working high temperature acoustical absorption duct lining material.  Production involves optimizing the material through iterative reformulation, experimental validation involves acoustic and survival testing at conditions (specifically temperatures and sound intensities) relevant to the use environment. Additionally finite element modeling will be used to validate/refine the data collection apparatus as no such facility or testing has been done previously.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
The NASA specific application for this work is in high temperature exhaust ducting. The work is directly relevant to test stands and test facilities. NASA applications of the technology involve use of the developed acoustical abatement system  in launch facilities and in a wide variety of test stands.  Government wide this includes Air Force and Navy test facilities as well as the expected NASA facilities. <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
The principal commercial application planned for this material is as an acoustical barrier which possesses a Class A fire rating.  Given the required operational environment we believe that an economical product for concert halls, auditoriums, airports, and schools may be derivative products with no substantial market competition. Other commercial applications for this work are directed at noise reduction and employee safety in foundry facilities, commercial launch facilities, and oil drilling facilities. It should be noted that there is expected commercial in the development of  liners which for commercial jet aircraft and hanger facilities.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The goal of this proposal is to develop a new method to create Non-Rotationally Symmetric (NRS) surfaces that overcomes the limitations of the current techniques and is fast, accurate and inexpensive.  Diamond turning (DT) has revolutionized the fabrication of lightweight optical surfaces for defense and science applications such as forward-looking infrared radar and infrared spectrometers.  It has made this impact not only because it can accurately and rapidly fabricate diffractive, refractive and reflective optical surfaces, but because it can create reference features tied to the optical surfaces to guarantee optical alignment.  An emerging trend in optical design is the use of NRS surfaces that reduce complexity, bulk and weight.  To create these surfaces, DT machines have been modified with a low-amplitude Fast Tool Servo, a third axis or a fly-cutter.  The problem with the FTS is its limited range and the other techniques are plagued by thermal drift during long fabrication times.  The proposed Live Axis Turning (LAT) process combines evolving technologies of air bearings, linear motors, high-resolution encoders and high-speed control systems into a moving lightweight toolpost on a conventional DT machine.  The result is a more flexible machine that can increase production and reduce cost for NRS components.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
There is a growing need for breakthrough instrument designs that will reduce the volume and mass of science packages while improving performance.  A recent example is IRMOS, the Infrared Multi-Object Spectrograph, that introduced a number of significant advances in space-based optical instrument design for astronomy including a digital micromirror array and an off-axis biconic ellipsoid.  The proposed program addresses the fabrication issues related to these novel optical shapes and promises to reduce the cost of fabrication.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
Lightweight, compact and affordable optical systems also have many applications outside space exploration.  The most obvious applications would be in defense for infrared and visible light sensing.  A pivotal part of a new defense strategy is for more rapid deployment forces and flexible systems.  Examples of devices that will benefit from free-form optics are expendable, compact UAV's, heads-up displays and lightweight night vision gear.  In the commercial sector, lightweight wearable displays, improved vision correction and medical vision devices will be key applications.

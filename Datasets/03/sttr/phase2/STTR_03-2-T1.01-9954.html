<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Automated Contingency Management (ACM), or the ability to confidently and autonomously adapt to fault conditions with the goal of still achieving mission objectives, can be considered the ultimate technological goal of a health management system.  In an innovative Phase I STTR program, Impact Technologies and Georgia Institute of Technology developed a prototype Test Bench software for developing and validating ACM systems.  With the Phase II support of Boeing/Rocketdyne, the primary goal of this project is to further develop and demonstrate a design and development tool for ACM technologies called the Propulsion ACM Test Bench, and to develop specific ACM solutions within this environment for Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). The commercial-grade software to be delivered at the conclusion of Phase II will utilize technologies based on open-systems, modular software architectures suitable for 3rd party system integration.  Two such modules of note for the Test Bench include an Integration Toolkit for Livingstone2<SUP>TM</SUP> as a Reasoner and a Validation and Verification Toolkit for health management algorithms and the ACM system design.  This technology is expected to provide immediate benefit to the SSME program and a comprehensive, SSME software demonstration is planned at the conclusion of the 2 year effort.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Propulsion Automated Contingency Management (PACM) Test Bench is expected to provide real value back to Boeing/Rocketdyne and the SSME program at the conclusion of the two year period of performance and possibly sooner.  However, the adaptable nature of the PACM Test Bench will allow it act as a design and development for a wide variety of NASA applications including complementing Stennis Space Center's ISHM system.  Finally, the PACM Test Bench provides a clear commercialization opportunity for the Livingstone2 software developed by NASA Ames because the Matlab/Simulink integration toolkit will increase ease of use and market exposure of the software.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
The immediate potential commercial opportunities of the PACM Test Bench include Boeing/Rocketdyne and Pratt & Whitney who have both expressed interest in this technology.  The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Rolls-Royce have specific requirements on health management performance for which the PACM Test Bench can provide value.  Finally, the OEMs of Unmanned Air Vehicles including Northrop Grumman and Boeing are highly motivated to develop advanced Automated Contingency Management for these vehicles to improve survivability.  Impact has existing contracts with all these potential customers and has an excellent commercialization record.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Industry is driven by the cost of man-power and time to market, and is still awaiting a versatile and reliable multi-disciplinary analysis code. The proposed JFLO software suite addresses many aspects that are still not totally resolved in current state-of- the-art  CFD. It will enable optimal designs as well as the multi-disciplinary application of CFD for digital flight. The key elements of JFLO are : ease of use; broad analysis capability for 3D steady and unsteady applications for the entire range of speeds for low Mach to supersonic, high-resolution mesh-blind solution algorithms and CAD-blind surface reconstruction, mesh-and user-independent results via CAD-respecting mesh adaptation, fast solutions via advanced convergence acceleration techniques, and above all reliability and high accuracy. It weaves together technologies that have been recognized in their individual right: optimal control design, coupled CFD and CSD and automatic mesh optimization. Here they are brought together in a single package for the first time.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
The potential applications are very broad at NASA. The JFLO suite is anticipated to become an important tool in NASA's arsenal for analysing a wide range of existing aerodynamic devices, designing new flight vehicles and generating flight simulation data bases. Applications range from missiles, rockets, military aircraft, rotorcraft and tiltrotors such as the V22 to  space vehicles and all categories of UAVs.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
The JFLO suite represents a technological leap as it combines many yet unavailable features in a single product. Its optimum design capabilities enable the rapid and inexpensive design of new flight vehicles. Users are anticipated to be from all branches of the Aerospace Industry, including manufacturers of commercial aircraft ranging from business jets to super jumbos, helicopters, tiltrotors and jet engines,  and  also the rapidly mushrooming UAV community.

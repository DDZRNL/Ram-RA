<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Luna Innovations has teamed with the University of Alabama, Huntsville, to develop a miniature flush-mounted fiber-optic pressure sensor that will allow accurate, high-frequency high-pressure measurement of LOx and LH2.  The Innovation of this proposed development is that the miniature flush-mounted fiber-optic pressure sensor is not intrusive, is intrinsically safe, and is a novel adaptation of proven technology.  To insure compatibility with the LOx environment, the sensor has been constructed from metal-oxides, ceramics and other materials that are intrinsically safe.  The sensor will help engineers optimize performance of liquid fueled rocket engines for the next generation of reusable lift vehicles, and flight versions of the sensors will enable real-time monitoring and control of the engines, improving safety and enabling commercialization of space.  During the Phase I, prototype sensors were demonstrated in Liquid Oxygen (LOx) at temperatures of -196<SUP>o</SUP>C.  The sensor was able to measure pressures over 1000 psi and transients exceeding 4500 psi/sec rates of change without failure.  During the Phase II, optimized thermally compensated sensors will be constructed and extensive tests conducted to advance the technology to pre-production status.  This system meets NASA's goals by providing LOx and LH2 pressure data while: 1) minimizing intrusion, 2) improving reliability, 3) having fast response time, and 4) being intrinsically safe.

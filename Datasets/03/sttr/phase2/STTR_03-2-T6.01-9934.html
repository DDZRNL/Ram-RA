<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
This proposal describes the continued development of passive, orthogonal frequency coded (OFC) surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors and multi-sensor systems, an enabling technology for remote wireless sensing of temperature, pressure, and a range of other measurands, for application to space explorations' demanding environments.  Phase I demonstrated the technical feasibility of the OFC approach to produce passive solid-state SAW sensors that can be interrogated remotely using RF signals, and that respond with a signal that encodes both the sensor's identity and temperature measurements.  OFC SAW temperature sensors similar to those demonstrated in Phase I are capable of operating over temperature ranges not possible with silicon, from cryogenic to 1,000oC.  The spread-spectrum nature of the system proposed herein, which consists of multiple passive OFC SAW sensors interrogated remotely using chirped RF signals, provides increased processing gain and greater communication security.  The proposed Phase II effort will develop and characterize prototype OFC SAW temperature sensors targeted to selected NASA and commercial applications, and demonstrate pressure sensors.  The transceiver design will be optimized given the SAW operating parameters, conventional and innovative wafer-level packaging approaches (for devices capable of withstanding extreme environments) will be developed, and a complete breadboard wireless multi-sensor system will be demonstrated.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
The proposed sensor system will provide a flexible platform for remote wireless monitoring of a variety of possible measurands.  These small, lightweight passive sensors, initially designed to measure temperature and pressure, could potentially be applied to liquid viscosity and chemical sensing applications.  Near-term NASA applications include temperature sensing (from cryogenic to 1000oC), monitoring the temperature and pressure distributions on the surface of a vehicle, robotic platform, or space suit in extreme environments for space exploration, data collection for enhancement of IVHM, and wireless tire pressure monitoring.  Future applications could include liquid level measurement, chemical vapor and H2 leak detection.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
One very promising near-term commercial application for the proposed wireless temperature sensor system is concrete maturity monitoring.  OFC SAW sensor technology has distinct advantages over current wired technologies, and the potential market is substantial.  Since modified SAW OFC sensors can also detect changes in surface mass loading and viscosity, the OFC SAW sensor system platform can be extended for use in chemical sensing.  This opens up a plethora of additional potential applications, including in-situ continuous emissions monitoring of mercury for smokestacks, chemical agent detection, and H2 leak detection.  Shipping container and inventory thermal monitoring may be significant for homeland security.

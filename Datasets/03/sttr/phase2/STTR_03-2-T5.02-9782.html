<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
As expected, the STTR Phase I investigation confirmed that the Digital Virtual Human (DVH) and Robonaut technologies can be merged, and that haptic and autostereoscopic technologies can be integrated in the robotic control systems, effectively and productively.  This feasibility study verified and validated interactions of Robonaut with the DVH in operator response to and performance with haptic devices and autostereoscopic displays.  
<br>
<br>Phase II will focus on developing two significant components from the Phase I effort for marketing and distribution in Phase III.  The Collaborative-Virtual Environment Software Toolkit (C-VEST) will provide software developers a potent development toolkit with which to build and maintain 3D/VR applications and simulations.  As a result of Phase II, the C-VEST product will be able to interface with immersive simulation (motion capture, manipulation, navigational, and advanced display) hardware not easily implemented in current commercial or academic 3D/VR software.  The second product emanating from this Phase II project will be the OpticFlex full-body fiber-optic-based motion-capture system.  This system will comprise a significant part of the Phase II and subsequently Phase III commercialization preparation effort.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
The Phase II PI candidate proposes this project effort will help in remote robotic missions as part of space exploration initiatives from NASA and JSC.  The following applications can be targeted through the technological merger of the Robonautic system, C-VEST simulation capability and space exploration mission requirements:
<br>1>  Assembly of Space Station truss sections
<br>2>  Inspection, analysis/planning, and maintenance/repair of Space Shuttle tile and other protective systems
<br>3>  Exploration, remote mission operation, and data/sample collection sample from other planet by Robonaut
<br>4>  Extravehicular missions (space walk, truss repair, solar array correction, etc.) assisted by Robonautic systems
<br><P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
This Phase II project, through the implantation of C-VEST and OpticFlex, could offer DVH and robotic technology integration complete with haptic, motion-capture, and autostereoscopic display functionality for both autonomous and remotely controlled robotic technology development and operation.  The results benefiting diverse global industries would be 
<br>&#9642;	Higher, more precise tactile sensitivity to enhance coarse and fine-grain task performance
<br>&#9642;	Enhanced visual display for higher fidelity robotic command and control
<br>&#9642;	Robotic, robot-human interactions, and task simulation capabilities to positively impact:
<br>&#9642;	Robotic machine design and engineering
<br>&#9642;	Task analysis, improvisation, and evaluation
<br>&#9642;	Planning and scheduling individual and shared events

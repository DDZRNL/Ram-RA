<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
ORBITEC will investigate new nanocoating and other engineered surfaces and apply them to passive control of humidity within confined spaces while minimizing power, size and mass requirements. The innovations include: (1) the ability to scale the devices for early Exploration applications including existing environmental control systems, space suits, CEVs, Rovers, Small/Transit/Large Habitats, (2) the use of multiple nanocoatings and capillary channels, and (3) unique Cold Plasma Processes. The primary goals are to further develop capillary channels, hydrophilic and biocidal nanocoatings, and Cold Plasma Nanocoating Process Technology into a new, advanced Condensing Heat Exchanger with no moving parts or particulate coatings. Anticipated results include: (1) requirements and applications for the Exploration Mission, (2) testing of additional substrate materials for plasma deposition of hydrophilic and biocidal nanocoatings applicable to the many controlled environments required for the Exploration Mission, (3) evaluation and testing of new and existing methods for creating capillary channels in various substrate materials, (4) long duration testing and evaluation of nanocoatings on various substrates, (5) design and test of modular, scaleable condensing heat exchangers, and (6) development of a high fidelity Distributed Humidity Control System (DHCS) prototype.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
Low temperature hydrophilic and antimicrobial plasma coatings have many applications in humidity control systems and in the medical and food processing industries. Most immediately is the potential for a single part, solid state humidity control system sold to equipment manufacturers for scientific controlled environment chambers, electronics packaging, residential and commercial HVAC systems utilizing heat exchangers, and small, liquid cooled engines for lawn tractors, watercraft, and the automotive industry. Additional commercial applications include the manufacture and marketing of Cold Plasma Nanocoating equipment that could be included in OEM processing equipment, and the marketing of Cold Plasma Nanocoating services.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
ost near-term applications of engineered surfaces are for existing life support and environmental control components and systems such as the Common Cabin Air Assembly (CCAA). Potential NASA applications for these technologies include single part, modular, solid state condensing heat exchangers for use in a scaleable, distributed manner to dehumidify confined spaces in Exploration applications including space suits, CEVs, Rovers, Small, Transit, and Large Habitats. DHCS consisting of surfaces with capillary channels and hydrophilic and biocidal nanocoatings in combination with a porous ceramic plate would divide the condensing and phase separation functionality, increase the thermally conductive surface area over a porous plate alone and increase condensing ability at the same or lower power input. The addition of biocidal nanocoatings provides protection against undesirable bacteria buildup and biofilm formation on the multifunction surfaces and porous plate. In addition, biocidal nanocoatings have application in NASA systems involving moisture or water distribution and storage.

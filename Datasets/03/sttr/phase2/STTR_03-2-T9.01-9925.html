<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Technical Abstract
<br>The Stennis Space Center (SSC) needs the sensors that are capable and can be operated in liquid oxygen (LOX) and or liquid hydrogen (LH2) cryogenic environment to improve SSC cryogenic testing.  In particular, SSC would like to develop a sensor to monitor the quality of LOX in the delivery line during the testing of a rocket engine.  Spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) with its relative simplicity and multi-molecule analysis can be easily employed to develop a sensor for on-line, real-time measurement. In Phase I we have designed an initial &#61474;- prototype system for gas mixture and LN2.measurement. This proposed Phase II research is to design an integrated Raman system that will improve the sensor performance to satisfy NASA's need for LOX quality control. A calibration technique for the gas phase sensor will be developed. An optical access interface unit for the LN2/LOX mixture system will be designed. The performance of the integrated Raman system with LN2/LOX mixtures will be evaluated and the final prototype Raman system will be delivered to NASA/SSC.

Potential NASA Commercial Applications
<br>A sensor designed for real-time non-intrusive detection of liquid nitrogen in liquid oxygen at high pressure and high flow can be used to monitor the quality of LOX used during the testing of the rocket engine.  This sensor can also be used to control LOX feed valve. When the impurity of LN2 exceeds certain predetermined levels detected, the flow of LOX into the test engine will be automatically shut down.  This sensor can facilitate the testing of the small and large rocket engine with the same large full size LOX tank.  The measurement of LN2 impurity in LOX feed line at various LOX tank conditions will provide the information about mixing of the N2 gas at the surface of LOX in the tank.  It can also be used to study the boiling or turbulence at the surface of LOX.

Potential Non-NASA Commercial Applications
<br>The sensor based on Raman spectroscopy developed for this proposal can be used to monitor the chemical composition in large chemical reactors to provide data to optimize the efficiency of the processing plant and to control the chemical process in the plant.  For example, when the concentrations of certain molecules are above a threshold, the sensor will send a warning signal for process adjustment. The sensor technology can also be modified for other applications, such as hydrate exploration in deep sea drilling.

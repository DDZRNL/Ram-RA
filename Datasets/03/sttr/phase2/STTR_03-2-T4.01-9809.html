<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The following proposal summarizes the process by which Trex will utilize out patented CVC (Chemical Vapor Composite) SiC process to fabricate near net shape lightweight SiC mirrors with high as-deposited optical surface quality.  In the first task of this program, Trex will continue our development program to optimize the as-deposited surface quality of our CVC SiC.  We have selected several different mandrel materials and surface preparations for these trials.  The as-deposited surface figure and roughness will be optimized for each of the selected systems.  The current CVC SiC process replicates the standard mandrel surface precisely.  Trex will be looking to retain this capability using higher quality surface mandrels.  In addition, Trex will also work with our STTR partners at the University of Arizona to design, fabricate, and test an as-deposited CVC SiC x-ray mirror for a specific program.  Included within this effort will be the mounting structure design and fabrication.  Using the proposed developments within this program, all post-deposition machining processing will be minimized.  The potential savings in both time and cost offered by this technical development program would directly affect nearly all high performance optical applications.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
The NASA applications that would benefit from this development program would include nearly all upcoming missions that require lightweight, stiff, thermally stable mirrors, especially at cryogenic temperatures.  The designs actually fabricated within this program would be the Constellation X program.  Other NASA programs areas that directly benefit from the technology include all air, space, and land based optical systems involved with the study of the earth, the solar systems and deep space.  In addition, the technology also applies to robotic and manned space exploration within the star tracker and navigation systems.  <P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
Markets that directly impacted by the technology developed within this program include air and space based telescopes, surveillance satellites, and navigation & control systems.  The Department of Defense is interested in this technology to support a range of programs including the ATL, ABL, and ARMS high energy laser programs, STSS and other surveillance systems, and tactical programs such as the EKV, MKV, and KEI.  There is also a significant market in large aperture terrestrial telescopes, with several programs currently being designed, including the TMT and Euro 50.  The NRO also has several programs with interest in this technology.

<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
The main goal of this proposal is to develop high speed magnetostrictive and MEMS actuators for rapidly deflecting or deforming mirrors. High speed, light-weight, beam deflectors are required for many NASA applications including rapid laser tuning, airborne lidar transmitters and receivers, image correctors, scanners, target acquisition and countermeasures. Current electro-mechanical, electro and acousto-optical technologies suffer from many problems: low speed, high voltage requirement, limited life, hysteresis, high cost and bulky connections.  Magentostrictive materials have the potential for achieving large displacements (>100?m) at high frequencies (~ 40kHz) with compact and rugged devices. In Phase I we have built several magnetostrictive devices and demonstrated feasibility of compact high speed actuators.  Rod actuators built from composite materials showed effective high frequency operation to 10kHz. Thin magnetostrictive films deposited on silicon wafer cantilever substrates have demonstrated good high frequency operation up to 20kHz. Further optimization of the magnetic field generators and thin films will allow 40kHz operation. Also an innovative high speed laser wavelength tuner technique was developed using a surrogate deflector.  In Phase II we will build prototype high speed mirror systems using magnetostrictive composite rod and thin film cantilever beam actuators.  They will be incorporated into tunable laser and lidar receiver systems and tested.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
NASA Applications include: High speed mirrors for wavelength tuning of lasers that are required for differential absorption lidars for measuring ozone, water vapor, methane, carbon dioxide. High speed mirror deflectors for blocking initial pulse in lidar receiver systems. High speed scanners, Deformable mirrors for atmospheric correction in beams.

<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
A number of non-NASA applications are also foreseen. These include light mirror reflectors for compact print heads, Laser light shows, Image Scanners, Beam scanners, Laboratory instruments. DoD applications for high speed beam deflectors are for high energy laser beam delivery systems, lidars, target acquisition and countermeasures.

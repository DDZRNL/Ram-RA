<B>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)</B><BR>
Encouraged by Phase I accomplishments, the proposed Phase II program will significantly mature and align the development of a Space Qualified Non-Destructive Evaluation & Health Monitoring system with the needs of NASA. We are systematically working to improve the TRL to 5 at the end of Phase II and formulate commercialization and product development strategy beyond Phase II.
<br>
<br>The proposed health monitoring system features three innovative technologies: excitation of preferential Lamb/Rayleigh wave modes; utilization of phased array concepts; and utilization of software algorithms rather than hardware for beam forming and signal analysis. The ability to detect cracks, corrosion, disbonds, and cracks under bolts for a stiffened panel was demonstrated in Phase I. The detection methods used were pitch-catch, pulse-echo, phased array, and electromechanical impedance.
<br>
<br>To efficiently and cost-effectively achieve Phase II objectives, NextGen has teamed with Lockheed Martin Space Systems - Michoud Operations to test the proposed system in realistic environment. A cryogenic, composite LOX tank, built by Lockheed Martin for the X-34, is currently in a test fixture at NASA Marshall and will be used for evaluating our system. Additional tests will be performed to validate the durability and survivability of the system for space certification.

<B>POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
Some NASA health monitoring applications of the proposed system include X-37 demonstrator, space shuttle, international space station, and the orbital space plane programs. When attached to fuel tanks or other critical structure, this system would provide a lightweight, inexpensive VHM system that would reduce launch turn-around time, increase probability of launch success, minimize life cycle costs, and increase the crew return mission success.<P>
<B>POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)</B><BR>
Some non-NASA commercial applications of NextGen's health monitoring system include long-term monitoring of nuclear waste storage, pressure vessels, storage tanks, and piping, automated inspection of nuclear power plants, Navy surface ships and submarines, critical engineering structures.

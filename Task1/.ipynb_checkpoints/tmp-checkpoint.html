Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </p>\n<p>In this project, a lightweight membrane mirror device will be integrated into an \nadaptive control system, capable of correcting static and dynamic primary-mirror \nshape errors in a space-based telescope. The core innovation will be the use of \na multi-zone, deformable mirror fabricated by thin-film surface micromachining. \nContour shape of the mirror membrane will be controlled by an array of \nelectrostatic actuators, each of which can deform a local subaperture. \nElectrostatic actuation holds considerable promise for membrane mirror shape \ncontrol because it offers nearly reversible (i.e. low power) actuation, no \nhysteresis, and nanometer-scale precision and repeatability. Prototype \nmicromachined deformable mirror (\xb5DM) devices show promise: they are one hundred \ntimes faster, one hundred times smaller, and consume ten thousand times less \npower than the commercially available macroscopic DMs. The project team has \nproduced the first continuous membrane zone-controlled \xb5DMs: a critically \nimportant step in the development of large-aperture, space-based, lightweight \nmirror systems. Core research areas to be addressed in this project include \ndevelopment of optical thin-film reflective coatings for \xb5DM membranes, \ndemonstration of feasibility of a \xb5DMs in a closed loop adaptive optical system, \nand design improvements to \xb5DMs to allow more actuators, larger apertures, and \ncurved substrates. </p>\n\n\n<p>7. Potential Commercial Application(s)(Limit 200 words) </p>\n<p>Micromachined deformable mirrors (\xb5DMs) promise to alter the field of adaptive \noptics by providing a low power, compact, high performance, economical \nalternative to existing systems. The emergence of \xb5DMs is likely to extend the \nfield of adaptive optics from its roots in astronomical imaging systems to the \ncommercially important, emerging areas such as laser based communications, \nbiomedical imaging, laser welding, and terrestrial imaging. Also, because of \ntheir compactness and low power, such devices may find significant applications \nin space-based optical imaging systems that require dynamic or static \ncompensation of flexible or segmented primary mirrors. A low-cost, low-power, \nmodular deformable mirror system is likely also to find considerable market in \nthe emerging area of image enhancement and beam formation.\n\n\n</p>\n\n\n</font>\n\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n

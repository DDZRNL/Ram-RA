One of these key technologies is the detection of in-flight hazards, such as wake vortices generated by other aircraft, wind-shear, clear-air turbulence (CAT), and volcanic ash.  All of these hazards can be detected by a laser radar (lidar) located on the aircraft, but such a system needs to be light, small, and inexpensive, and also needs to be sufficiently rugged that it will continue functioning with minimal maintenance.  This mandates that the lidar be simple because such systems 1)cost less because they have fewer components and are easier to assemble and align 2)are more rugged and reliable because they have fewer components that can individually fail and 3)are less susceptible to environmental factors such as vibration, temperature variations, and pressure changes.  We propose to develop an intrinsically simple, innovative, low-cost coherent lidar that would be suitable for deployment in large numbers on commercial airliners. The Phase I effort will also include a modeling task to explore how a single lidar could be used to detect all of the hazards listed above.  We will evaluate potential modifications in light of our desire to keep the system as simple as possible.  We will also compare the benefits of using a coherent lidar to detect volcanic ash, in contrast to a more conventional incoherent system.","NASA applications relating to flight safety include detecting wake vortices, clear-air turbulence, wind-shear, and volcanic ash from aircraft.  Other aircraft-based applications include optical air data systems (OADS) and use of a Doppler lidar to measure the wind-speed above and below the current flight path to allow flight optimization for fuel efficiency.","Non-NASA applications include coupling with differential absorption lidar (DIAL) to measure pollution fluxes instead of simply concentrations, wind mapping for potential wind-energy sites and active control of wind turbines.",Air Transportation & Safety; Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Transport/Traffic Control

Icing on engine components, rotors, and wings creates substantial problems during in-flight operation.  To address the issues of both in-flight icing measurement and mitigation, NanoSonic will build on its demonstrated HybridSil™ Erosion protective, anti-icing appliqu?s/tapes designed for rotorblades to realize a lightweight nanocomposite with appropriate functionality to enable multifunctional icing measurement and mitigation on next generation aircraft.  NanoSonic's current HybridSil™ Erosion has been measured to provide high levels of particle and rain erosion protection; samples have been tested up to 7 hrs rain erosion and 100 g/cm2 mass loading angular sand, both tested at 500 mph, with sample survival following exposure.  Additionally, the nanocomposite materials have been demonstrated to prevent dynamic ice accretion at temperatures as low as 19?F (-7?C) in their current tape format.  Application has been demonstrated thus far with excellent adhesion and performance on 6Al4V Ti, 2024 T0 Al, and glass fiber/epoxy composites. A prime that provides de-icing systems to a broad range of commercial and defense platforms is currently working with NanoSonic for baseline performance evaluation of its HybridSil™ Erosion/Icephobic materials, and has discussed with NanoSonic methodologies to integrate multifunctionality, such as developing icing measurement concepts, for a broad range of existing and future aircraft.  This prime has expressed significant interest and support of NanoSonic's materials development, and will work with NanoSonic through a subcontract on this effort to integrate design suggestions and perform rigorous measurements required for transition to NASA platforms.","As the proposed technology is matured and qualified throughout the proposed effort, multiple manufacturers and customers will integrate this technology within their designs to help enable all-weather operation of existing and next generation aircraft.  The proposed materials are technology enablers for next generation airframe structures and engine components where lightweight, durable materials and low power requirements mandate innovative approaches to not only mitigate ice formation, but to enable measurement of icing conditions that promote unwanted ice formation and to concurrently provide erosion protection. In addition to aircraft, the proposed nanocomposites will be useful for a broad range of commercial rotorcraft and jet engine applications.  NanoSonic will work with its Phase I prime partner to identify multiple potential commercial and defense outlets for the technology developed within this effort.","The proposed multifunctional nanocomposites integrate high durability and hydrophobic functionality, which is marketable to an extremely broad range of applications outside of aircraft. Water repellency provides anti-icing functionality useful in nearly any vehicle or structure for missions where icing or the risk of ice formation inhibits progress. Water repellency also suggests minimized water ingress, which is a significant problem in nearly all applications where composites are used for metal replacement. For metallic materials, the proposed materials will reduce corrosion, reducing maintenance and concerns of potential structural integrity damage resulting from corrosion. Similar hydrophobic nanocomposites can also significantly reduce frictional drag, enhancing performance. Commercial applications are nearly limitless for higher performance, cost and energy saving commercial aircraft and automobiles.

From these individual particle characteristics the total liquid water content (LWC) and the total water content (TWC) of the flow may be found. This non-intrusive, laser-based, point measurement diagnostic will operate in an off-axis, back scatter configuration at a range of working distances appropriate to characterize laboratory-scale experiments, icing tunnel flows, free jet test facilities, or flight conditions at altitude.The proposed instrument will apply phase-Doppler interferometry, polarization ratio phase discrimination, droplet rainbow thermometry, and cross-polarization imaging to each particle measured (see Part 4 for details on these techniques). This will provide joint measures of liquid/solid phase, velocity, diameter or particle size, and droplet temperature. Furthermore, there is redundancy built into the measurements. For instance, the droplet diameter can be measured both by phase-Doppler interferometry and by rainbow thermometry and all four measurement techniques can discriminate solid ice from liquid droplets. While no single instrument can measure all possible cloud droplets, the proposed instrument can be configured to measure droplets from as small as 3 μm to larger than 3 mm in diameter.","NASA's research into flight safety and aircraft propulsion would benefit from the successful commercialization of this instrument. Other governmental, academic, and industrial research groups in the areas of aircraft and flight safety, air-breathing and rocket propulsion, transportation, spray, drying, and other industrial processes would all stand to benefit from a diagnostic capable of exceptional phase discrimination and/or remote droplet temperature measurement.There are several possible paths to commercialization of this work either as improvements on our current commercial products or as entirely new products. The present SBIR Phase 1 will lead to a fully-developed instrument capable of simultaneously and redundantly measuring multiple physical properties of droplets and ice crystals. However, we do not believe that an instrument as described herein would be economically viable on its own. There are only a handful of ground-based icing research facilities that would be willing to invest the capital required to purchase such an instrument – several of which are already in possession of a PDI for droplet characterization. However, the proposed instrument is intentionally overcomplicated for the proof-of-concept phase.","Within the meteorology and icing research markets there is potential to create two separate product lines. Some researchers will prefer an in situ device that can be placed in a large wind tunnel flow or mounted to an aircraft exterior. Others may prefer an ex situ instrument that can be placed outside of the flow – the solicitation specifically mentions the profiling across the span of an engine duct. The proposed diagnostic methods are all suitable for both styles of measurement. Furthermore, since the proposed layout involves the use of backscatter collection, such an instrument could be deployed from within an aircraft's fuselage and pointed out a window with no impact on the flow or external mounting requirements. Such an instrument configuration could move beyond a research tool and be used as a real-time flight safety instrument to characterize the icing threat to the airframe.Moreover, there are a wide range of food processing applications using spray drying. The capabilities of measuring mixed phase particles and droplet temperature will be attractive to the R&D and process control in these environments.  Efficient energy utilization and product quality are key concerns in these applications.","Air Transportation & Safety; Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Detectors (see also Sensors); Image Analysis; Image Capture (Stills/Motion); Image Processing; Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Lenses; Mirrors"

This need is particularly evident for built-up aerospace components that contain multiple features such as stiffeners, ribs, cut-out and fasteners, all of which complicate existing inspection methods.  Application of ultrasonic guided waves holds promise because even in such complex structures these waves have been shown to travel long distances and remain sensitive to damage.  A sparse, or spatially distributed, array of simple sensors is perhaps the most effective implementation of such waves, both in terms of cost and capabilities, but the primary problem is the complexity of received signals.  This complexity is caused by the unavoidable presence of reverberant, multi-path echoes that are difficult to interpret, but that also contain much more information about the structure than the simpler echoes present for a structure with few features.  The proposed research will leverage the additional information contained in the multi-path signals to not only enable in situ inspection and monitoring of complex structures but also simultaneously improve the ability of a sparse array to detect and characterize damage with fewer sensors.  This will be accomplished by performing a one-time measurement of the multi-path wavefield generated by each transducer in the sparse array, using this wavefield to estimate Green's functions for waves propagating from source to scatterer location to receiver, and constructing high-fidelity images by combining scattered array signals with computed Green's functions.  This work is high risk but has a high payoff for NASA, the aerospace community in particular, and generally to many other applications that include civil, nuclear and petrochemical infrastructure.  Successful completion could enable commercial implementation of guided wave systems for large area inspection.","The ability to perform rapid inspection of large area, complex, plate-like structures is directly applicable to the long-term in-vehicle health monitoring (IVHM) of both manned and unmanned spacecraft and structures.The envisioned end-product will be capable of automated inspection of complex plate-like structures (such as pressure hulls or casings, etc.) using lightweight, permanently attached sensor arrays with on-station or remote data analysis.","The techniques proposed here can be used for the large-area inspection and monitoring of: - Metallic and composite aircraft components - Civil infrastructure built up from trusses, beams, and plates - Marine vessel hulls - Nuclear infrastructure - Petrochemical infrastructure such as vessels and complex piping","Acoustic/Vibration; Air Transportation & Safety; Characterization; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Contact/Mechanical; Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Data Processing; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Image Processing; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Prototyping; Simulation & Modeling; Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems); Structures; Verification/Validation Tools"

To improve aviation safety, it is critical to monitor and predict hazardous cognitive states of crew members in a non-intrusive manner for designing mitigation strategies. In Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) flight deck, emerging technologies will enable a transition from ground based navigation infrastructure to satellite based navigation and some control relating to separation of traffic will be delegated to the cockpit from Air Traffic Control (ATC). While the NextGen system will bring tremendous advantages in operational efficiency, the responsibilities of the pilot are expected to dramatically increase, which makes the hazardous cognitive state assessment even more critical. To address the above challenges, Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI), along with the Operator Performance Lab (OPL) in University of Iowa and Old Dominion University, proposes a real-time hazardous pilot Cognitive State Assessment system, called CSA-Deep, in all phases of flight for Integrated Crew-System Interaction (ICSI). The key innovation of the proposed research is the modeling and adaptive updating of hazardous cognitive states using a large amount of unlabeled data through semi-supervised deep learning.","We anticipate that by the end of our Phase II effort we will have matured our CSA-Deep assessment system sufficiently and we will be able to demonstrate the proposed approach to evaluate hazardous cognitive states and crew coordination in a flight simulation environment.  We will work closely with NASA to ensure that technology developed in this effort can be integrated with the NASA's systems, reducing risk associated with technology transition.

However, recent high-profile incidents, including Colgan Air Flight 3407 and Air France Flight 447, have underscored the importance of mitigating the LOC-I risk. In both of these incidents, it is clear that improper energy management was one of the precipitating factors that led to eventual loss of controlled flight. In order to reduce the potentially devastating effects of a mismanaged energy condition, Barron Associates has teamed with SA technologies to design and demonstrate an energy state protection system. The system pairs Barron Associates' proven optimization and control technologies with SA Technologies' situation-awareness-driven interfaces. Although built upon innovative ideas and algorithms, the proposed system focuses on the cardinal duty of ""aviate"" through pilot interaction and automated energy management.  The energy state protection system: (1) models the dynamic evolution of the energy state and the energy requirements of the aircraft with flight phase, (2) determines an effective allocation of available flight controls to correct an off-nominal energy state and maintain safe operating margin, and (3) ensures that the crew is brought back into the ""aviate"" loop through effective alerting thus minimizing adverse pilot interactions with the automated components.

This proposal is focused on the detection and prediction of more common flight errors or conditions which are necessary for aviation incidents.  However, data sets containing safety information are (1) large, (2) distributed, and (3) heterogeneous, making analysis difficult.  In order to address these challenges, we propose Causal Models for Safety and Assurance Technologies (CM-SAT).  CM-SAT will mine large, distributed, heterogeneous data systems for causal relationships about flight safety.  The system will identify causal schema within the data that characterize conditions related to the aircraft and environment that are predictive of failures.  CM-SAT will detect causal relationships at varying levels of granularity (e.g. relationships which are unique to a particular flight, to a particular aircraft model, or to a particular fleet).  It will leverage state-of-the-art distributed meta-reasoning, which will direct the causal schema learning algorithms to detect and validate causal relationships in different parts of the distributed data sets.","CM-SAT addresses a relevant, high priority issue – Aviation Safety.  The causal relationships learned in this project are directly applicable to the mitigation of aircraft aging, analysis and prediction of crew performance, anomaly detection, and the Verification and Validation of flight control systems.

However it also indirectly addresses issues in the Vehicle Safety Systems Technologies (VSST) project and Atmospheric Environment Safety Technologies (AEST) by providing general knowledge of the causal relationships on aircraft which lead to hazardous conditions.","CM-SAT analyzes large data repositories for causal relationships that can increase aviation safety, and thus it will be targeted for use by public agencies and private companies interested in aviation safety.  The FAA Safety Management System (SMS) would also benefit from actionable safety information, a need which CM-SAT addresses.  CM-SAT may be used by military agencies as well, including the Air Force. More broadly, CM-SAT is usable by any agency with large amounts of data that lends itself to causal analysis.

This system will mirror the human nervous system, having sensing capabilities distributed throughout systems and subsystems measuring characteristics that predict the conditional response of the aerospace vehicle. The vehicle 'nervous system' of embedded distributed sensors and reasoning agents will generate real-time information on vehicle condition. Like a nervous system, each subsystem will communicate with a higher-level system-reasoning agent. The central reasoning agent will manage mission control systems to perform adaptive maneuvers informed by this network of sensors.This program will concentrate on the composite airframe structure as the system of interest and will encompass the following areas:1. Assignment of airframe capability figures to maneuvering limits (i.e. various maneuvers that load the airframe, coupled with the capability of the airframe to take that loading).2. Analysis of available inputs including the environment (temperature, altitude, humidity), the structural state (damage type, size and location), and the loading (inertia, pressure profiles). 3. Creation of an algorithm to determine the capability of the airframe, and potentially return the viability of performing different maneuvers. A safety factor may also be returned, which could be used to determine alternate safe maneuvers.4. Mission decisions based on whether the airframe can safely perform the required maneuvers, and if not, what maneuvers can be performed that would still enable it to satisfy the mission.","Prognosis of failures and faults and contingency management methods on composite airframe structures allow for the extension of vehicle health management onto the structure, which typically represents the majority weight and a large cost of both maintenance and replacement. Prognostics would allow for condition-based maintenance of airframe structures which reduces maintenance costs associated with an air vehicle. Reducing maintenance overheads and enhancing safety will be driving factors for all new aircraft concepts, including the NASA Environmentally Responsive Aviation (ERA) project, the Subsonic Fixed Wing (SFW) project, and airframes for hypersonic and supersonic flight. Additionally, current research aircraft such as NASA's WB-57F would benefit from the prognostics developed here to extend the life of the airframe or improve mission capability based on RUL and airframe condition assessment. Finally, space applications such as launch vehicles and payload and pressurized modules, including the ISS laboratories, would benefit from prognostic applications of composite structures in order to assess the structural capability and any damage or degradation that might endanger crew or payload. The overall commercial fitness of this prognostic algorithm is very high due to the large field of structures for which it enables condition-based maintenance and enhances design life and safety.","This program will provide a contingency management system that dynamically performs decision-making based on both sensed and predictive information to carry out adaptive missions and maintenance. Targeted at composite airframes, the market opportunity for such a system is very significant for the UAV industry, as it is clear that UAVs cannot be made in the same manner as conventional, manned aircraft. Their cost of construction must be much lower, i.e., cheaper materials, less labor and fewer parts. In addition, the ability to make small, custom runs will be commercially very attractive – the lead times for conventional aircraft are many years. These commercial imperatives will drive the adoption of low-cost, composite airframes constructed largely automatically. Rotorcraft such as the Sikorsky CH-53E and the upcoming CH-53K, as well as commercial aircraft such as the Boeing 777 and 787 all incorporate various levels of vehicle health management to monitor subsystems for faults and failures. Prognosis of failures and faults and contingency management on composite airframe structures allow for the extension of vehicle health management onto the structure, which typically represents the majority weight and a large cost of both maintenance and replacement. Aircraft such as Aurora's Orion long endurance aircraft would benefit from airframe prognostics, and we would push for its application both on our own platforms as well as other OEM air vehicle providers.",Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Composites; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Data Fusion

BDDs are a data structure that satisfies some simple restrictions, resulting in a unique representation of a Boolean function regardless of its actual implementation. This property of BDDs allows the efficient solution of many problems. The proposed tool will exploit multi-core CPUs and the thousands of stream cores in the latest graphics processors (GPUs) , which were made accessible to programmers through specialized software development kits. These large numbers of stream cores in GPUs, and the possibility to execute non-graphics computations on them, open unprecedented levels of parallelism at a very low cost. In the last 8 years, GPUs had an increasing performance advantage of an order of magnitude relative to x86 CPUs. Furthermore, this performance advantage will continue to increase in the next 20 years because of the scalability of the chip manufacturing processes. The technical objectives will be to efficiently exploit the GPU parallelism in order to accelerate the execution of a BDD package, and to explore hybrid approaches that will combine this GPU-based BDD package with our GPU-based parallel SAT solver that we are currently developing in a NASA SBIR Phase II project. The goal will be to achieve increased speed, as well as scalability for much larger state spaces when formally verifying complex software for space applications.

Proposals are sought that address specific design and development challenges associated with airframe and propulsion systems. These proposals should be linked to improvements in aircraft performance indicators such as vehicle weight, fuel consumption, noise, lift, drag, durability, and emissions.""  The technologies of interest to NASA cover five themes. The technology proposed herein falls under the first theme, Fundamental Materials Development, Processing, and Characterization (Topic: A2.01 / Lead Center: GLC). More specifically, the herein proposed work addresses the need for ""new high strength fibers, in particular low density, high strength and stiffness carbon fibers"" that may be utilized in high strength-to-weight ratio composite materials to reduce vehicle weight without compromise to or likely to increase durability. Carbon nanotubes (CNT) have been studied extensively over the past two decades, resulting in a large quantity of fundamental research that has been performed in the areas of synthesis, purification, separation, functionalization, applications development, etc. Their unique properties are expected to bring about a new age of structural and electrical materials. However, one of the primary problems associated with CNT applications development is that all current synthesis techniques produce only short strands of CNT's, typically 10's to 100's of microns long. Therefore, current applications are limited to those that can effectively utilize short CNT strands.  The technology proposed herein has the potential to produce continuous, long strands of pure CNT material.","Applications for pure, long and short, carbon nanotubes are seemingly endless and include high strength-to-weight ratio fibers and tethers, low loss conduction pathways for photovoltaic cells, composite materials (polymer-CNT and metal-CNT composites), quantum dot interconnects, functionalized catalysts, adsorbents, SPM tips, and a wide variety of nanoelectronic devices and materials.  Of the applications mentioned thus far, large volumes of high purity carbon nanotubes will find rapid application as additives in polymeric and metallic composite materials.  A significant amount of research has revealed that the physical properties of common polymeric materials are greatly improved after addition of relatively small percentages of carbon nanotube materials. For example, at low carbon nanotube concentrations in polymer composites, a reduction in surface resistivity from more than 1012 ?/square to less than 100 ?/square results. Similarly, for polystyrene composites containing 2.5% – 25% MWNT's by volume, Young's modulus increases from 1.9 to 4.5 GPa, with increases pronounced beyond 10%.",Non-NASA application are analogous to NASA applications mentioned above.

For example, thermal / environmental barrier coatings (T/EBCs) are envisioned to protect the surface of Si-based ceramics against moisture-assisted, oxidation-induced ceramic recession. Current T/EBC systems have been demonstrated in long time exposures at ~2400?F. However, their use at elevated temperatures is limited by the low temperature stability and high diffusion activity of current T/EBC materials. One approach to enhance the temperature capability of these systems is the incorporation of multi-layered T/EBC designs to provide multi-functional protection.  In this Phase I effort, novel processing techniques will be developed to enable the affordable, high performance  manufacture of such systems using a physical vapor deposition based processing approach which enables enhanced coating adhesion and advanced coating architectural, compositional and microstructural control. Processing developments will then be used to created novel multi-layered coatings. These coating layers will then be incorporated into advanced high temperature capable T/EBC systems in Phase. This work will lead to the incorporation of Si-based ceramic components into enhanced efficiency gas turbine engines to reduce weight and increase operating temperatures. A TRL 4 will be achieved at the end of Phase I and TRL 6 at the end of Phase II.","This research is anticipated to result in environmental barrier coating systems that provides higher temperature capability, improved durability and better CMAS resistance than current EBCs. These advancements will help enable the use of Si-based ceramics in a range of high temperature applications such a gas turbine engines, combustion liners, exhaust components and heat exchangers. These advances will potentially benefit all gas turbine engines requiring greater performance and efficiency.  In addition, this research specifically supports the goals of NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) which seeks to expand the boundaries of aeronautical knowledge for the benefit of the Nation and the broad aeronautics community and in particular NASA ARMD's Subsonic Fixed Wing Project which has a goal of conducting long term research in technologies which promote, among other things, higher performance and higher efficiency gas turbine engines.","The development of high temperature T/EBC systems using DVTI's advanced coatings processing techniques will enable not only new T/EBC systems for use in future military and commercial aircraft platforms, but also new deposition processes to enable affordable coating application onto engines components.  DVD coaters are envisioned to be small with low capital costs and tailorable volumes so that small volumes of parts can be deposited at low cost. The soft vacuum required and the high deposition rates also have the potential to facilitate assembly line like part coating for some geometries. The non line-of-sight capabilities of this approach enable coatings to be applied onto complex components thus expanding their use. The compositional and morphological flexibility of this approach would also enable other advanced functional coating systems to be applied such as thermal barrier coatings, wear and corrosion resistant coatings, thin film batteries and damping coatings.",Ceramics; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Composites; Processing Methods; Smart/Multifunctional Materials

Resulting aircraft designs such as blended-wing bodies with distributed propulsion can provide the large reductions in emissions, fuel burn, and noise required to make air transportation growth projections sustainable.  The power density requirements for these electric machines can only be achieved with superconductors, which in turn require lightweight, high-capacity cryocoolers.

We will focus on the critical component for mass reduction—the recuperative heat exchanger—and perform risk reduction activities to demonstrate the feasibility of our concept for this component.  In Phase II, we will design, build, and test a compact, lightweight, high-performance recuperator for the Cryoflight cryocooler.  This development effort will provide an enabling technology for the superconducting systems needed for hybrid turbo-electric aircraft to be feasible.","The proposed Cryoflight cryocooler development effort will support NASA's long-term goal to increase aircraft efficiency and reduce aircraft emissions and noise.  By providing a cryocooler optimized to meet the aggressive power density target required for aircraft systems, we will remove a key obstacle hindering the development of superconducting aircraft.  While such aircraft are still two or three decades from production, supporting technology development needs to begin now if such aircraft are to become a viable alternative to the aircraft configurations in production today.

The breakthroughs that created UCDS have provided a solid analytical foundation upon which tools can be developed and applied.  One of these is the UCDS nonlinear tool, which GTL has been applying with much success in the investigations of the dynamics of solid rockets, liquid rockets and turbojets.  In the proposed effort, GTL shall enhance this tool in preparation for its application to scramjets and ramjets by incorporating mean flow effects in the acoustic models used in the nonlinear algorithms. Since the Nonlinear Data Analysis Tool (NDAT) shares the same nonlinear algorithm with the UCDS nonlinear tool, this enhancement shall also improve the ability of NDAT to transform nonlinear test data into linear parameters.  Taking this to the next step, GTL shall increase the functionality of NDAT by implementing changes to the algorithm that allow it to utilize the data from multiple pressure transducers in the data analysis rather than restricting the tool to the current single data channel.  This will be accomplished by developing algorithm routines that use the relative location of the pressure transducers and the intervening acoustic environment to account for the temporal and phase relationships between the data streams.  When implemented, these changes will allow NDAT to automatically identify the orientation of the oscillating modes and reduce the nonlinear pressure oscillation data into a clear and concise set of linear parameters.

The Nonlinear Data Analysis Tool (NDAT) being developed in this effort will find immediate application in the evaluation of engine test data for rockets, turbojets and scramjets, as well as laboratory experiments.  By transforming the nonlinear pressure oscillation data into concise linear parameters, researchers and developers will have the means to directly relate the dynamic behavior to design and operational parameters.  This clarity should greatly enhance the ability to mitigate oscillations encountered during testing and open the door to designs with increased performance.","Other potential customers for UCDS services and tools include government agencies, such as the Air Force, Army, Navy, MDA, and DARPA, and propulsion system developers, such as ATK, Aerojet, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce, and many others.

Such ""drag on demand"" enables operational benefits such as slower, steeper, and/or aeroacoustically cleaner flight on approach, addressing NASA's need for active and passive control of aeroacoustic noise sources for conventional and advanced aircraft configurations. The proposing team recently completed a Phase I/II SBIR program on the development of an EAB for quiet drag applications. This program began with design of aerodynamic concepts and progressed to fabrication and testing of several prototypes in NASA Glenn's Aero Acoustic Propulsion Laboratory.  Results suggested that an appropriately designed EAB could enable a fixed-speed, steep approach trajectory from a baseline 3.2 to 4.4 degree glideslope for a 737-800-class aircraft, with 3.1 dB peak tone-corrected perceived noise (PNLT) reduction and 1.8 dB effective perceived noise level (EPNL) reduction. The previous effort culminated in a conceptual design of a bypass nozzle mechanism that stows in an aerodynamically ""invisible"" manner in the nozzle casing during conventional operation and introduces deployable vanes in a drag management maneuver. Current technology readiness level (TRL) is 3 to 4, and the proposed SBIR program aims to advance TRL to 5 to 6 by demonstrating a prototype that switches between stowed and deployed mode during operation. The technical objectives are to: (1) evaluate and select a candidate nozzle or engine as a demonstrator, (2) develop a preliminary aerodynamic and mechanical design of an integrated mechanism, and (3) define a validation plan that can be executed in Phase II. The final deliverable will be a written report to NASA presenting the findings and designs and defining the path forward for Phase II activities.","The most immediate opportunity for this system is to assist NASA in the development of next generation quiet aircraft, including conventioanl tube and wing (current generation ""N""+1), unconventional integrated airframe-propulsion system configurations (N+2), and advanced aircraft concepts (N+3). These aircraft are likely to have noise levels from the engine and airframe that are comparable. A deployable, quiet air-brake device will allow noise reduction by creating drag without the associated unsteady flow structures of devices such as flaps, slats, and undercarriage. In addition, these devices will enable steep approaches, thereby locating the noise source further from the affected communities. Finally, pairs of engine air-brakes operating in concert on multi-engine aircraft may be used for aircraft control and special maneuvering applications by performing, for example, an aircraft rudder function.An additional application for swirling exhaust flows is in the area of wake vortex avoidance and induced drag management. For example, deployable swirling outflow devices placed on wing tips could be used to counter- or co-swirl relative to the bound vortex that is shed by a finite wing, resulting in potential induced drag reduction or increase (possibly of value in a quiet drag sense). This could prove to have some applicability in designing more fuel-efficient and quiet aircraft in the future.","Two complementary potential commercial markets exist for the proposed technology: (1) implementation in retrofit kits on older aircraft engines, and (2) implementation in future jet engines as an integral part of the design; i.e., modifying traditional engine exit guide vanes or bypass nozzles with a variable geometry mechanism that generates a swirling outflow in drag management mode. The first market has immediate potential (within 5 years), while the second market, although potentially much larger from a quantity standpoint, is a longer-term endeavor (likely 7 to 10 years to implementation). The retrofit market provides a simpler and faster opportunity to implement and demonstrate the technology before upselling it or its derivatives to the large engine Original Equipment Manufacturers.As part of this SBIR program, ATA will partner with small engine manufacturer Williams International to understand how the design may be incorporated into one or more of their engines. As the world leader in the development, manufacture, and support of small gas turbine engines, Williams International provides a more direct route to market for the technology than could be achieved with the large aircraft engine manufacturers where the financial and technical risks of new technologies grow exponentially. Demonstration on a real-world, small jet engine can provide a stepping stone to wider acceptance of the technology in the gas turbine engine community.",Aerodynamics; Atmospheric Propulsion; Deployment

The scheme will initially be developed and tested for ideal gases and will then be extended to encompass mixtures of thermally perfect/calorically imperfect gases.  This approach will use the current remeshing algorithm in Loci/CHEM which utilizes nonstandard general polyhedral elements.  The main objective is to provide a robust mesh adaptation scheme that will improve simulation accuracy while reducing overall computational costs.  The principal incentive to NASA is to make large-scale, complex flow simulations more accurate and affordable so that their benefits can be fully realized within the design cycle.  During Phase I we will perform mesh adaptations for a number of geometries and flow conditions of interest to NASA.  We will use these simulations to evaluate the robustness and effectiveness of the new adaptation scheme to improve accuracy, and reduce overall computational cost.During Phase II we will implement a full adjoint scheme into Loci/CHEM.  This is a natural extension of Phase I, and will not only allow for complete output-based mesh refinement capability, but will also allow Loci/CHEM to be used for uncertainty estimation and as a shape/geometry optimization tool.  The combination of solution adaptive mesh refinement, shape optimization, and uncertainty estimation will provide NASA with a high-confidence, predictive tool for development and assessment of innovative aerodynamic concepts over a wide range of flight regimes.","NASA applications for the Loci/CHEM CFD solver that utilizes the proposed Adjoint methodology span all centers and all programs that incorporate Computational Fluid Dynamics in the design process for space and land vehicles. The highly efficient and accurate solver requires minimal additional computational expense and allows for higher fidelity aerodynamic (force and moment) internal and external predictions for launch vehicles through all ranges of the flight trajectory. The increased accuracy translates to a significant reduction in expensive wind tunnel testing that has traditionally been used for very complex flow scenarios.  Examples include plume modeling for jet interaction problems, base heating, plume proximity effects, and modeling of tumble, deceleration, ullage and roll control motors.  Another major advantage that this technology offers to NASA is the use of shape optimization features to determine aerodynamic protuberances, nose cones, frustums, control fins, and even optimize nozzle shapes for maximum thrust.  Specific applications include NASA's Aircraft Technology Program, Airspace Systems Program, and Subsonic Fixed Wing (SWF) project.","Department of Defense:The Adjoint methodology will aid all Department of Defense (DoD) Project offices that utilize Computational Fluid Dynamics in their design process.

In order to widen the capabilities of the DBD plasma actuators and make them applicable to a number of NASA missions, including Supersonic and Subsonic Projects, it is necessary to develop a predictive methodology to optimize DBD systems based on complex understanding of plasma-flow interaction.

Significant rotorcraft problems such as dynamic stall, rotor blade loads in forward flight, and blade-vortex interaction all have significant unsteady pressure oscillations that must be resolved in order to understand the underlying physics. Installation of pressure transducers is difficult and expensive on rotorcraft models, and the resulting data has limited spatial resolution. Application of a fast-responding pressure-sensitive paint should provide unsteady surface pressure distributed over the blade surface. Recently, fast PSP measurements have been demonstrated at NASA Langley on a 2-meter rotor model in hover and in forward flight by the ISSI/OSU team. This system interrogated the instantaneous pressure on the rotating blade at two azimuthal positions, an advancing and a retreating blade.

Shorter door-to-door trip times require an increased usage of rotary wing and runway independent V/STOL technology.  One of the limiting factors to the increased adoption of this technology for providing feeder service to major hubs is the limited understanding of high-volume terminal area operations.Several important issues are associated with rotary wing and runway independent V/STOL aircraft, including severe aerodynamic interactions during take-off, transition and landing. There is also the possibility that the aero-acoustic environment generated in the terminal area may cause damage to buildings, unsafe working conditions for ground personnel, or unacceptable noise levels to surrounding communities.The success of commercial V/STOL transportation is predicated on being able to establish technical feasibility, societal acceptance and economic viability. The proposed aero-acoustic tool for terminal area operations offers a simulation capability to design engineers to make informed decisions based on technical (operations and handling near a terminal), societal (acoustic footprint) and economic considerations (performance) that includes the interactional aerodynamics between the aircraft and its surroundings. The designers and operators of rotary wing and V/STOL aircrafts will use the tool to evaluate, enhance and implement more efficient and safe terminal area operation guidelines.Phase I will develop the proof-of-concept of the simulation tool and use a tilt-rotor and a candidate terminal under different wind conditions to demonstrate its usefulness.  In Phase II, the tool will be extended to maneuvering rotary wing and V/STOL aircrafts.  In addition, it will be integrated with a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.","The simulation module developed under this initiative will find wide usage in the NASA subsonic rotary wing and runway independent technology programs.  This proposal offers a simulation tool that will lay the foundation for maneuvering aero-acoustic and interactional aerodynamic V/STOL aircraft simulations during operations near a terminal, leading to more efficient and safe terminal area operation guidelines.","The tools developed under this initiative can be used by the rotorcraft industry to help design future V/STOL and rotary wing civilian and military vehicles, and for developing operating guidelines.  This utility will also be useful to the transportation industry to assist in determining safe operational limits.

This has led to important research at NASA exploring flight dynamics and handling qualities associated with these aircraft in terminal area operations.  A critical gap in current research tools is a flight simulation capability to properly evaluate and minimize wake hazards associated with operating large, tiltrotors in the terminal area.  These wake hazards will impact flight safety of both the large tiltrotors and any rotary wing or fixed wing aircraft operating in their vicinity.  A research effort is proposed to develop and deliver a high-fidelity, physics-based model of these wake hazards within flight simulation evaluation software.  Phase I will see the development and validation of prototype software including a new set of metrics for rating handling qualities of comparative LCTR configurations when operating in the wakes of nearby aircraft.   Phase II will see the development and delivery of a fully-functional desktop analysis and plug-in module that will provide a capability to feel multiple aircraft wake interactions when flying the LCTR and other aircraft within NASA's Vertical Motion Simulator.","The proposed effort directly responds to NASA's SBIR solicitation goal of developing validated physics-based multidisciplinary computational tools applicable for the design, analysis and optimization of rotorcraft.  The proposed technology also directly responds to NASA's Subsonic Rotary Wing Program objective to radically improve the capabilities and civilian benefits of rotary-wing vehicles.  The research would directly support NASA's work evaluating and developing the LCTR concept for increasing airport capacity, as well as identifying appropriate air traffic patterns for simultaneous non-interfering operations of general combinations of fixed wing and rotary-wing aircraft.  NASA could use the technology in the design and evaluation of new operational procedures, providing a means for assessing pilot workload during terminal area operations where wake interactions may occur.  Finally, the ability to model multiple aircraft wake interactions will be installed into NASA's Vertical Motion Simulator providing an invaluable new capability for all future NASA research in that facility.","The proposed tool will be of great use to the FAA and U.S. airports as well as NASA, as new air traffic patterns and operation procedures are evaluated in terms of safety and increased capacity upon the introduction of large civil tiltrotors into the National Airspace System (NAS).  Coupling of a real-time version of the analysis into the Air Traffic Management (ATM) system could lead to improved predictions and display of wake hazard conditions.  The tool would also be useful to aircraft manufacturers in assessing the wake hazard issues associated with future rotary-wing aircraft concepts.  The tool would be helpful to contractors designing upgraded wake safety crew advisory systems.  The research effort would also apply directly to U.S. Navy concerns over wake hazard issues related to V-22 aircraft formation flight and operations in the vicinity of personnel and other aircraft both near the ground and at sea.","Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

With the use of EASMP integrated components, by semi-actively altering the interior panels or gearbox isolators' frequency response, it will be possible to better target and control particularly irritating tones related to the aircraft's flight mode. CRG proposes to advance EASMP maturity which is applicable across many other application areas and has the benefit of alternative stimuli boasting ultra-low power requirements and more potential for faster switching times.

ARCUTS will combine wireless technologies with specific sensing capabilities which may be targeted towards any aspect of the drive or engine systems. For Phase I, IEM will focus on a unique and innovative wireless torque monitoring approach for drive shafts which combines capabilities of two of IEM?s patented and patent-pending inventions into a single powerful system for measuring and tracking torque at high sample rates (to detect even short transient strains) and high accuracy (to less than 1%) to permit accurate and reliable CBM of shafts and immediately dependent components. Torque measurement is proposed because accurate, high-speed torque measurement has strong implications  not only for CBM applications but also for proper control and power usage applications on rotorcraft and in other settings as well. IEM will also show how ARCUTS provides its adaptability by demonstrating that the same core technology can be used to track the condition of other components of the drive train and engine. IEM will be supported in this work by the Boeing Corporation, premier designers and manufacturers of military and civilian rotorcraft as well as fixed-wing aircraft and one of NASA?s partners in the development of the LCTR-2.","The initial target application for ARCUTS will be for use in NASA development and testing of rotorcraft, including the Large Civil Tiltrotor-2. The LCTR-2, like other tiltrotors such as the V-22, relies on torque transfer through shafts that are not only immediately attached to an individual engine but also stretch across the entire aircraft. It is vital that this capability remain intact in the event of a single engine failure, since such a connection provides the only means for the aircraft to continue flying with one functioning engine. The core smart adaptable wireless sensor (SAWS) technology will be applicable to many other NASA test and monitoring requirements besides torque monitoring.","ARCUTS specific technology applies to any rotorcraft with primary or secondary shafts with section lengths over one foot or so. As such, multiple applications will be found in military rotorcraft (V-22, CH-47, CH-53 series, and others) and in civilian rotorcraft as well.The core wireless sensor technology can be applied to many other sensors and sensor packages, such as temperature, pressure, and strain sensors which are very applicable to PHM/CBM maintenance for fixed wing aircraft, rotorcraft, and even other transportation systems.

There is a need to develop mid-level CFD models for the interaction of turbulence and chemical reactions that give superior results to the simple models (e.g., Magnussen's Eddy Dissipation Concept), but which do not require the large computational expense of the very complex models (e.g., PDF evolution methods or the Linear Eddy Method).  This SBIR program proposes to develop this capability by extending the Eddy Dissipation Concept of Magnussen (EDC) to allow for improved modeling of reacting flows—especially diffusion flames where the flow contains significant regions of mixing prior to combustion.  In Phase I, the proposed approach will be demonstrated using a Magnussen model with a global one-step reaction mechanism.  The effect of the modified model on the predicted combustion relative to the original Magnussen EDC will be demonstrated on a test case.","The proposed tool can be implemented into production CFD codes such as Wind-US, Fluent, OpenFOAM, Vulcan, etc., which are used widely by a large population for various applications.  Today, these CFD software are heavily relied upon for the design and analysis of systems such as combustion engines, jet engines, augmenters, gas turbines, scramjets, reactors, power plants and many others.  The proposed capability (extended EDC model) will be applicable to majority of cases where the classic EDC model is presently used in modeling combustion systems.  The advantage of achieving higher computational efficiency with detailed chemistry capabilities will enhance the use of such CFD codes for combustion related problems. The proposed extended-EDC model will improve the turbulence-chemistry modeling capabilities of CFD software that NASA is using for the design, analysis, and optimization of advanced propulsion-airframe integrated systems for future subsonic, supersonic and hypersonic applications.

Passive flow control devices such as micro-vortex generators and micro-ramps have been proposed to improve vehicle performance. The ability to measure surface quantities such as skin friction and unsteady pressure on the inlet model would provide insight into the complex flow characteristics that govern inlet performance. Unfortunately, nonintrusive sensors require optical access that has been difficult to obtain. Optical sensors for measurements of pressure (Fast Pressure-Sensitive Paint) and skin friction (Surface Stress Sensitive Films) offer non-intrusive measurements on surfaces, exactly the capability that is needed. To date, the size of the hardware such as camera and illumination devices have precluded application of these technologies in regions like an internal duct. During the past several years, camera and LED technology has advanced resulting in small packages for both imaging and illumination. Combining this new hardware with state-of-the-art optical technology such as fast responding PSP and S3F will result in a pair of sensors that can be miniaturized and utilized for non-intrusive measurements in traditionally inaccessible regions of the model. These measurements include continuous distributions of skin friction and unsteady pressure.","Surface Stress Sensitive Films are being investigation for a variety of applications in aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and biomedical research. Skin friction is a quantity of interest in many aerodynamics applications such as validation of CFD, and investigation of supersonic/hypersonic inlets. Biomedical applications include ongoing research with the Cleveland Clinic for identification and correlation of shear on the foot of diabetics. The formation of bed sores is believed to be related to shear stress, and therefore this would be a similar application of the technology. Other biomedical applications include shear stress on surfaces of artificial implants such as stints, hearts, valves, and assist pumps.

Deterministic traffic flow management (TFM) algorithms are often unable to perform efficiently in these conditions, motivating the development of probabilistic TFM algorithms. It has been shown that these algorithms result in a Stochastic Linear Program (SLP), whose structure is relatively simple due to elegant theory, but which can be hard to solve in realistic time frames due to computational complexity. This proposal has three objectives. The primary objective is to translate the volcanic ash phenomenon into airspace capacity uncertainty distributions. The second objective is to design probabilistic TFM algorithms using an SLP solver on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to tame the computational complexity of the problem. The third objective addresses the fact that current probabilistic TFM formulations leave the variance in the system unchanged. Consequently, the system may exhibit unintended variance, causing delays and congestion in the NAS. Variance in delays and the mean delay cannot be minimized together because the exact tradeoff is not known a priori. Concepts from Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) are introduced, that can formulate and solve a multi-objective optimization problem in the mean as well as variance of the system delay. Using MPT and SLP, risk-hedged strategies for aircraft scheduling are obtained to mitigate the effects of atmospheric hazards.In Phase I, volcanic ash models will be researched, and a framework for obtaining capacity uncertainty distributions due to volcanic activity will be developed. The SLP solver will be implemented on the GPU. Finally, a portfolio-theoretic approach to risk-hedged trajectories will be researched. Phase II work will extend results to a large scale NAS simulation, with more advanced volcanic ash and atmospheric disruption models.","This R&D effort will develop a Stochastic Air Traffic Flow Management Rerouting Problem implementation on Graphics Processing Units. The primary application of this implementation will be for solving the nationwide TFM problem, while managing uncertainties associated with large-scale climate disruptions such as such as volcanic ash, other natural disaster phenomena and convective weather avoidance. The GPU implementation will exploit the Bender's decomposition for speeding up the solution. Bender's decomposition has been used by researchers to solve sequencing &scheduling problems in the terminal & transition airspaces, under NASA's Airspace Super Density Operations research focus area. The parallel Bender's decomposition implementation developed under this R&D effort can be used to speed up solutions to the terminal area sequencing and scheduling problems.","The Stochastic TFM formulation implemented on high- performance Graphics Processing Units can serve as an operational tool at FAA's Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) for managing air traffic in the NAS.

As such, this work is highly relevant to NASA and directly contributes to NASA's Airspace Systems Program objectives.  While NASA's current SORM work focuses on more near-term goals, this work will provide a foundation for continuing SORM research to also be relevant to longer-term, NextGen environments.  In Phase 3, we would continue to collaborate with NASA on future SORM research.  This work might involve software maintenance, software and algorithm enhancements, studying alternative algorithmic or conceptual approaches, testing for other airports and off-nominal situations, support for NASA integrated simulations, and support for NASA's technology transfer to the FAA.","Beyond NASA, the primary potential application for this work is with the FAA.  Ultimately, the technology studied and developed in this project is intended to be used by the FAA within the air traffic management system.  The most likely Phase 3 activities involve supporting the FAA's study and prototype deployment and testing of the technology.  Mosaic ATM has previously conducted technology transfer to the FAA, simulation experiments, and field trials for NASA-developed automation tools and concepts and is well-qualified to complete these Phase 3 objectives with minimal risk.  During Phase 2, we will consider whether the algorithmic and software techniques we have developed might have application in decision support tools for the flight operators, such as in coordinating planning of flights and ground services to increase overall efficiency.",Air Transportation & Safety; Sequencing & Scheduling

Existing approaches for studying air traffic management concepts have explored methods for understanding airspace complexity based on flight path geometries, airspace architectures, and pilot/controller workloads. These approaches have been largely based on phenomenological and heuristic studies that provide important, but limited, understanding of causal factors and minimum predictive power over long look-ahead times.  The recent development of dynamic trajectory algorithms by NextGen AeroSciences, LLC (NextAero) provides the ability to compute the phase states of the airspace in future time, based on principles from traffic physics, phase transitions, and the science of Complex Adaptive Systems.  In a Phase I project, NextAero proposes to establish the feasibility of phase state analysis as a tool for assessing the benefits of NextGen concepts in the densest airspace. If shown to be feasible, this computational tool will provide a viable means of computing, predicting, and managing airspace phase states from satisfiable (uncongested) to unsatisfiable (congested) conditions, as affected by various NextGen concepts.","NextGen research applications by NASA, including trajectory-based operational airspace studies, dynamic airspace design concept evaluations, NextGen airspace procedures concept evaluations in modeling, simulation, and flight demonstrations","Airline and Fractional/Business/Air Taxi applications, including use in Airline Operations or Operational Command Centers (AOCs, OCCs), for real-time fleet optimization and disruption recovery managementFlight Management Computers (FMC) applications, including airborne capabilities for 5DT optimization as an adjunct to ANSP and AOC/OOC solutions).ANSP (U.S., EU, and others) operations, including incorporation of 5DT trajectory optimization capabilities in en route and terminal airspace controller tool sets.","Air Transportation & Safety; Analytical Methods; Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Man-Machine Interaction; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Transport/Traffic Control"

Before they can be integrated into the National Airspace System (NAS) for evaluation in the field, they typically have to undergo extensive human-in-the-loop (HITL) testing in a controlled laboratory environment to identify and work out the issues. Depending on the particular concept/technology, the HITL experiments may involve subject matter experts (SMEs) including air traffic controllers (ATC) and pilots. The laboratory environment would include realistic operational equipment such as appropriate ATC stations and flight-deck equipment. One important system in this environment is a realistic communication system for simulating radio communications among the controllers and pilots. In current-day operations, controllers and pilots communicate by voice over VHF radio. In the laboratory environment, this communications capability is typically provided by a dedicated communication system, which represents a cost liability in addition to the controller stations and flight-deck equipment. In addition to the acquisition cost, there is life-cycle cost associated with maintenance of the hardware as well as space requirements for the special hardware. The proposed research considers the development of two technologies to ease the cost of providing the necessary communications capability as well as the cost and inconvenience in hiring secondary SMEs to support the experiments: (i) a software-based networked communications system based on Voice-over-IP (VoIP) technology that obviates the need of special hardware, and (ii) an automated speech agent that can take the place of the secondary SMEs in communicating with the primary SMEs and interacting with the operational environment.","The proposed Networked Communications and Speech System (NCSS) has been conceived for implementation in simulation facilities within NASA for human-in-the-loop (HITL) assessment of airspace system concepts and technologies. A list of such facilities at Ames Research Center and Langley Research Center has been identified jointly by the FAA and NASA in a recently released NextGen Human Factors Research Coordinate Plan. The software-based system is expected to reduce acquisition and life-cycle costs associated with the communications equipment, and to provide additional flexibility and cost savings in performing HITL experiments.","The Networked Communications and Speech System (NCSS) can be adapted for other human factors simulation facilities within the FAA, as identified in the joint FAA/NASA NextGen Human Factors Research Coordinate Plan.

It is essential to obtain an accurate atmospheric temperature profile in the lower troposphere for a better prediction and understanding of aircraft wake vortex. In this NASA SBIR project, we propose to build a lidar instrument that is capable of measuring both the daytime and nighttime atmospheric temperature profile in the lower troposphere.  Atmospheric temperature measurement using Raman Lidar technique is well established and has been implemented by a lot of research groups.  The major innovation of our approach is to use a low-power, high-repetitive-rate laser, instead of the high-power, low-repetitive-rate flash-lamp-pumped laser systems commonly used for such instruments.  This will allow us to achieve the goals of building an eye-safe, compact, robust, reliable, relatively inexpensive and low maintenance instrument.  The proposed lidar will be able to achieve 1K accuracy, good range resolution (~100m) with a range up to 3 km at both daytime and nighttime with under 10 minutes of averaging.  We will build a breadboard system for Phase I and perform a proof of concept temperature measurement.  We will bring the development to preliminary design so that Phase II may begin with the final system design and begin construction as early as possible.  Phase II will provide for delivery of a prototype and culminate in a series of validation field trials, comparing our measured profiles with other measurement techniques.","The proposed instrument can be used on helping wake vortex avoidance, which is a primary constraint on the national Airspace System (NAS).  More than 30 Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) operational improvements (OIs) and SESAR lines of change (LoC) could be impacted by wake considerations.  NextGen concept required significant reductions in separations of aircraft wake vortex to achieve capacity goals.  When successfully developed, the proposed system can be applied for many other atmospheric trace gas measurements and environmental monitoring and will have numerous markets.  Raman Lidar techniques have been demonstrated which provide most valuable descriptions of the evolution of air pollution events.  With different optical configuration of the lidar system, the Raman technique provides a robust tool that can be employed to measure a wide range of meteorological and environmental properties, such as the simultaneous profiles of meteorological data, ozone, water vapor optical extinction and measurements of airborne particulate matter.","Temperature is a basic parameter which describe the atmospheric state of many important meteorological phenomena occur in the troposphere, the accurate measurement of temperature in the lower troposphere is of considerable importance for studies in the atmospheric sciences, particularly for research on conditions for atmospheric stability and for circulation models.  Since the instrument can be used to measure elastic and other Raman channels, there are numerous non-NASA applications in the market to measure a wide range of meteorological and environmental properties.  Potential customers include the NOAA or EPA for environmental monitoring.  In addition, with the small size, high rep rate laser instead of using the flash pump laser, the proposed instrument can be easily transported and can be implemented for use at National Weather Service instrument stations.

While this yields an estimate for the average skin friction, the distribution of the skin friction cannot be determined from such measurements. The distribution of skin friction and pressure is available from computational fluids models, however, these models must be validated using experimental data. An experimental tool for distributed measurements of skin friction and pressure would be useful for both aerodynamic configuration development and numerical code validation. We propose the development of an image-based sensor for simultaneous measurements of skin friction and pressure that is based on combining Pressure-Sensitive Paint with a new image-based measurement technique for skin friction, Surface Stress Sensitive Films (S3F). The basis of the S3F technique is an elastic film that distorts under the action of the applied forces. Skin friction is determined by monitoring these distortions and applying a finite element model to the film. The S3F technique can operate over a range of temperatures from cryogenic (160 K) to well above ambient (470 K), thus there is a potential to deploy this system in a variety of wind tunnels. Quantitative measurements of skin friction using S3F have been demonstrated from 10-m/s to Mach 5 and the accuracy of the S3F sensor has been validated to be better than 5% full scale in a fully developed channel and high Reynolds number boundary layer. Several experimental demonstrations of a combined PSP/S3F sensor have been performed in small wind tunnels and bench-top experiments, thus demonstrating that this approach is possible. The key innovations in this proposal are to develop a multi-color data acquisition system that can acquire both pressure and skin friction data simultaneously, and validate the accuracy and stability of the combined sensor.","Surface Stress Sensitive Films are being investigation for a variety of applications in aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and biomedical research. Skin friction is a quantity of interest in many aerodynamics applications such as validation of CFD, and investigation of supersonic/hypersonic inlets. Biomedical applications include ongoing research with the Cleveland Clinic for identification and correlation of shear on the foot of diabetics. The formation of bed sores is believed to be related to shear stress, and therefore this would be a similar application of the technology. Other biomedical applications include shear stress on surfaces of artificial implants such as stints, hearts, valves, and assist pumps. Finally, ISSI has recently begun investigating S3F as a tactile sensor for artificial limbs and robotic touch sensors. This technology may be of interests for unmanned planetary probes.","Surface Stress Sensitive Films, is under investigation for a variety of applications in aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and biomedical research. Traditional interest exists in skin friction for CFD validation and drag reduction on supersonic/hypersonic air vehicles and hydrodynamic drag reduction.

Intensity is independent of the monitored space;  Source intensity of a generator is the same value in both free space and in hard, reverberant enclosure environments.  Measured absolute intensities are transferable to other physical locations.  In other words, experimental data is transportable and is directly applicable to any other real-world system or structures.

Video is an invaluable tool for flight-testing, allowing the collection of a wealth of information; however, collected long-range imagery typically suffers from scintillation, blurring, poor spatial resolution and low contrast.For decades, astronomers have developed effective image processing solutions to the problem of imaging through long stretches of atmosphere. One such image processing technique, Bispectrum Averaging Speckle Imaging, has been proven to compensate for heavy atmospheric effects at both visible and IR wavelengths. The computational requirements, however, made field deployment of a real time solution difficult.In 2007, we accelerated the Speckle algorithm for NASA using a Field Programmable Gate Array. This work demonstrated that the real-time implementation of a complex algorithm such as this one is possible with a hardware platform. Although this implementation could improve imagery under many scenarios, large power requirements due to hardware use limited the scenarios in which the platform could be deployed. Lastly, this work does not contain many of the enhancements that we, in partnership with Lawrence Livermore National Labs have made to the software algorithm since that date.We propose to evolve the previous hardware design by taking advantage of the improvements to manufacturing that have come to industry over the past 3 years. By coupling newer, less-expensive hardware with enhancements and simplifications to the Speckle algorithm, we will also be able to offer a solution that is significantly lower cost and lower power. A new design will vastly increase the capability and feasibility of deployed atmospheric correcting technologies, which will in turn benefit NASA by making flight-testing more safe.","NASA collects massive amounts of long-range imagery, whether for range safety pre-launch, tracking objects after launch, or observing objects in space.  All these applications require imaging through the atmosphere at great distances.  This causes all the imagery collected to be blurred and often detail is lost.By viewing enhanced imagery, NASA officials will have access to additional information for a variety of key decisions.  During launch, added level of detail provides the ability to make more informed ""go"" or ""no go"" decisions.  When tracking rockets or the shuttle, enhanced imagery allows for more detail on pieces that may fall from the craft during flight.  Accounting for atmospheric effects will also improve the quality of all imagery taken of space-based objects from Earth.","Non-NASA commercial applications can be broadly divided into government applications and private-sector applicationsGovernment applications include use of this technology in high-precision laser designator/locators, which require a handheld device for enhancing long-range images to allow for location and designation of targets from great distance;  long-range cameras for border monitoring, as the US southern border is very difficult to monitor without significant manpower and consists of potentially difficult terrain and climate; and airborne laser applications, which use a telescope to acquire and track targets and can be significantly limited by atmospheric turbulence.Private-sector application will involve coupling our solver into existing camera and processing hardware.  In many cases, this will simply involve complying with pre-defined interfaces to attach the necessary components.  Success in these markets will depend on cooperation with camera vendors and makers of image processing systems, not end users.  The advantage will be that manufactures will then be able to directly integrate our technology into their product lines, significantly reducing NRE cost by volume.  We see this approach being particularly valuable in applications that have strict power and size requirements and for systems that will be portable either on the ground, in the air, or in space.","Adaptive Optics; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Image Processing; Infrared; Telescope Arrays; Visible"

The PTERA is an extremely versatile and high-quality, yet inexpensive flight research testbed that serves as a bridge between wind tunnel and manned flight testing by enabling the low-cost, low-risk flight-based evaluation of a wide array of high-risk technologies. For this work, the team proposes a flight test evaluation of the PTERA platform to assess its effectiveness as a research test bed aircraft within NASA's Aeronautical Test Program (ATP). The PTERA stands to enhance the already capable ATP by enabling the low-cost, low-risk flight-based evaluation of everything from advanced aerodynamic treatments to sensor payloads. Several core capabilities that the PTERA would bring to the ATP: 1) A low-cost, low-risk flight test facility that can be used to expand ATP's role in the testing and validation of NASA's physics-based multi-disciplinary analysis and optimization (MDAO) tools2) The ability to flight test advanced aerodynamic treatments, health management and control systems, and to perform experiments in structures and aeroelasticity for a fraction of the cost of a manned flight test program3) The ability to flight test cutting-edge and complex systems whose cost and risk are too high for manned flights4) A testbed with modular airframe, enabling the evaluation of multiple technologies with the same airframe5) A testbed with a large payload capacity that facilitates the inexpensive and risk-mitigating flight test evaluation of a wide array of sensors and payloads as well as the evaluation of flight-test measurement systems before they transition to manned programs6) The ability to perform unmanned, autonomous, flight experiments relating to the burgeoning field of autonomous unmanned aircraft, including experiments supporting UAS integration in to the NAS, sense and avoid, etc.","The PTERA will enable NASA to more effectively develop and evaluate the performance of innovative solutions and advanced technologies that improve current and future air transportation by extending the NASA research portfolio to include a low-cost, low-risk flight experiment testbed. Virtually every program within the NASA ARMD can directly or indirectly benefit from the PTERA as it provides the following:-A low-cost, low-risk high quality flight test facility.-A platform that enables testing and evaluations of new technologies that, due to cost and risk, would typically be reserved for wind tunnel tests only.-A platform to investigate the flight performance of technologies such as laminar flow enablers, aeroelastic tailoring, morphing control surfaces/wings, and active flow control.

The PTERA flight test facility offers several distinct advantages to NASA, and non-NASA customers.  The physical configuration is representative of most commercial/transport aircraft, therefore test data will be considered relevant.  The PTERA structure is solid, well designed and stable therefore the test data will be free of unwanted variables that may contaminate the data and the airframe was designed from the bottom up to be modular and general purpose which will meet the ""common benefit"" need that a lab asset must generally satisfy.

Using functional descriptions of aircraft performance and computationally efficient sampling techniques, UAS model parameters are estimated, and aircraft maneuvers that best improve these estimates are determined.  Numerica's approach has two important advantages.  First it is agnostic to the specific structure of the aircraft performance model and can be used with a range of parameterized modeling techniques ranging from simplified ""table look-up"" models to physics-based kinetic models.  This permits faster integration with current ATM systems since it leverages (rather than replaces) existing trajectory prediction techniques and databases.  Second, the functional descriptions do not require that the models for propulsion or aerodynamic forces to adhere to a specific analytical form.  This allows tremendous modeling flexibility and permits the inclusion of complicated atmospheric factors that may be relevant for trajectory prediction but are difficult to capture with simple closed-form expressions.  Since the approach has solid theoretical foundations, the algorithms can be also used in an offline context to help establish bounds on the ""best-possible"" model estimation performance given the accuracy and character of available surveillance data.  This capability could help in determining requirements on ATC sensors to enable reliable trajectory predictions for UAS that lack detailed performance models.","As NASA and the FAA continue development of the NextGen Airspace program through 2025, the need to safely integrate UASs into the NAS will only grow.  As such, NASA's Airspace Systems Program could be a key customer of the proposed technology.  One possible application would be integrating the technology into a NASA simulation environment such as the Future ATM Concept Evaluation Tool (FACET).  The developed techniques use functional models and are thus are agnostic to specific trajectory predictions techniques.  Thus they could assist traffic controllers in assessing potential conflicts in the strategic collision avoidance timeline.","Ultra ElectronicsUltra-Electronics Advanced Tactical Systems offers the Advanced Fusion and Tracking System (AFTS).

It will allow the UAS GCS to communicate with ATC as well as other manned aircraft through the use of a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) based intercom system. In addition to voice communications, a text-based chat system may also be utilized for communication among the different operators. Information regarding position and altitude for all aircraft will be available to the UAS GCS, ATC, as well as manned aircraft.

RAMPS will include an in-flight dynamic contingency management capability that assesses ATC-requested re-routing and threats posed by weather to determine feasibility of modifications to the UAS flight trajectory.  RAMPS can operate as a recommender system, providing operators with a narrow list of best options to help facilitate timely decision-making.  RAMPS capabilities will provide UAS Operators with valuable time saving examination of a proposed route and possible contingency operations along that route – automating what has been an exceptionally tedious and lengthy manual process during mission planning.

It defines architecture enabling interoperability of Software Defined Radio (SDR) components. Future proof, power conscious architectures of STRS compliant re-configurable SDR transceivers are needed for implementation of envisioned space communication systems.Pacific Microchip Corp. proposes to develop a highly integrated, low-power, multifunctional 56GS/s Direct Digital Modulation/Demodulation (DDM) SDR transceiver using 45nm SOI CMOS technology. The resulting STRS compliant integrated solution will be radiation tolerant by technology and design. The direct conversion based transceiver utilizes novel 56GS/s D/A and A/D converters and features arbitrary waveform generation (AWG) mode. The availability of AWG and DDM modes removes limitations on the synthesized waveform shapes up to 28GHz. Pacific Microchip Corp. proposes all-digital implementation of frequency up- and down-conversion, I/Q modulation and demodulation. Since digital power is mostly dynamic, digital processing will enable power consumption scaling linearly with the operating frequency.Phase I work will provide a complete definition and in-silico validation of the proposed device. The Phase II program will produce a fieldable product. In order to facilitate the commercialization efforts in Phase III, a commercial radiation-tolerant CMOS SOI technology will be used.","The low power re-configurable SDR transmitters and receivers featuring power optimization capability depending on the required BER, high modulation frequencies have great potential in current and future NASA missions.  Besides targeted application for CONNECT experiment installed on ISS, proposed all-digital SDR transceiver is directly applicable to a systems seeking autonomous operation such as deep space communication radios. NASA missions using Ku band, such as OIB (airborne program for precise sea and ice elevation monitoring) will also benefit from proposed SDR architecture which will increase their accuracy.","In addition to its primary application in space communication systems, the proposed wideband SDR transceiver and its building blocks will be targeting other commercial and military related markets which require high speed capture, digitization, and synthesis of wideband signals. Commercial applications include wireless (WiMAX, 3G, 4G) and fiber optic communication (40G and 100G Ethernet). The projected ramp-up of 100G Ethernet technologies will raise industry demand for capable test equipment. The direct conversion architecture of the proposed transceiver provides the flexibility needed for testing equipment. Therefore, it has great commercialization potential in this market segment.

Existing Maryland Aerospace (MAI) ADACS technologies are well-capable of autonomously providing complete attitude determination and control to satellites weighing up to 20kg. It is essential for these ADACS technologies to be fully compliant with a Plug-and-Play standard that allows them to integrate seamlessly into rapid spacecraft development. One solution for Plug-and-Play is the Space Plug-and-play Architecture (SPA) bus developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), which is currently being adopted by many spacecraft developers for its low-cost, low-power, and simple design. A program for development of the electronics and firmware is outlined to create SPA compatibility technologies for CubeSat and NanoSat ADACS. This technology is significant because not only does it extend the capability of current low cost spacecraft to tactical imaging, space environment monitoring, and other missions requiring precision fine pointing, it provides a tremendous amount of flexibility in spacecraft mission design. Future NASA spacecraft development will no longer have to expend time and energy to develop an attitude solution.","One of the most dynamic changes for the spacecraft industry in the past ten years is the Educational Launch of NanoSatellites (ELaNa) program that has been created by NASA.   This program has allowed tens of educational spacecraft to be able to reach orbit and bring in critically needed data to scientists.   During the recent CubeSat workshop, NASA announced that for the first time, there were more launch opportunities than available spacecraft.   In the same presentation, they announced the next round of ELaNa launch opportunities for CubeSats. These satellites are designed to meet the standard California Polytechnic State University PPOD launcher specifications. Another major boost of excitement was the announcement that ELaNa was now going to begin accepting 6U CubeSat proposals.   There is a great deal of belief that the addition of these larger 6U (10 cm * 20 cm * 30 cm) spacecraft will radically change missions that CubeSats can perform. These new missions are the cornerstone of educational institutions being able to perform much of the needed research for current and future NASA missions. The way to truly advance this activity is to provide satellite technologies that can be easily integrated into different satellites in a truly Plug-and-Play fashion. SPA-compatible attitude determination and control solutions will put NASA well on its way in fulfilling its commitment to space exploration.","Many satellite subsystem providers are looking for components that allow the buyer to rapidly assemble a spacecraft to carry a payload. The recent trends in spacecraft development are towards components that are low-cost, low-power, and also ones that require the least amount of work in communications interfacing. As a technology that meets all of these needs, the Space-Plug-and-play Architecture (SPA) is the future. MAI ADACS technologies are distributed all across the world by MAI partners, some of which include ISIS, ATI-Space, Pumpkin Inc., and others. It is highly likely that most of these subsystem providers will soon gravitate towards SPA as the communications interface protocol of their choice. Spacecraft developers who are interested in reducing development and interfacing time by orders of magnitude will therefore benefit immensely from ADACS technologies.","Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Navigation & Guidance; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation)"

In the absence of manned craft, the payoff for a given mission rests in its ability to gather data and transmit it back to Earth.  While sensors and metrology instrumentation are continually being improved with emergent subsystems, the bottleneck to mapping the solar system rests not with the ability to gather data, but rather to transmit it back to Earth.Current deep-space missions rely on radio communications, while optical communications utilize laser transmitters with carrier frequencies around 200 THz for the most mature 1550-nm band.  Although the optical bandwidth is substantially larger than radio communications, the required energy at the receivers currently limit the data rates to 300 Mbps, similar to that achievable with radio communications systems.  However, the true value of optical communications lies in the directionality of the laser beam - the radiated energy is not wasted into a large portion of the hemisphere but transported to the intended receiver.While many companies currently offer telecommunications-band amplifiers, none meet the exacting needs of NASA's space-com mission such as high efficiency, power, and dedicated (low) data rates. In this proposal, we propose the development of a qualitatively novel approach to high-power, low-bit-rate laser transmitters compatible with deep-space missions.  Specifically, we propose to develop a master-oscillator/power amplifier (MOPA) system using two innovative and unique amplifier modules.  The new transmitter device possesses both high efficiency (> 20% electrical-to-optical) and low SWaP footprint.  The new transmitter can operate at 20W average power at arbitrary data rates and generate any symbol format, enabling both local (Martian-like) and deep-space (interplanetary) communications missions.","The NASA commercial application is in deep-space communications.  Specifically, we propose a laser transmitter capable of arbitrary data rate and pulse-position modulation formats.  The system includes a novel contrast-enhancing devices to provide inter-symbol contrast in excess of 60 dB, with 20W SBS-free average power levels.","PPM laser transmitters are of significant interest to deep-space optical communications.  However, a multitude of other photon-starved applications required PPM transmitters, such as deep-sea sensing, aircraft-to-submarine communications, long-range LIDAR, secure long-range optical links, and optical wireless.  Additionally, both amplifier modules have strong practical potential beyond the primary and specialized application of interest in this document.","Amplifiers/Repeaters/Translators; Fiber (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Photonics); Lasers (Communication); Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Waveguides/Optical Fiber (see also Optics)"

To reach these higher speed data rates, increases to the overall system gain of the communication link will be required.  A deterministic method to increase system gain of a RF communication link is to provide higher transmitted RF power.  However, with this higher RF output power also comes the challenge of maximizing power efficiency and reducing the size weight and power (SWAP) of the power amplifier (PA) for long-range space missions.  The innovation will be to develop a Solid-State Power Amplifier (SSPA) that produces  50 W of linear RF at X-Band (8.4 GHz) with high DC-to-RF-efficiency (> 60%) and low mass. The significance will be the utilization of wide band-gap RF semiconductors to efficiently create high RF power that is robust to the high radiation environments of space. A wide band-gap compound semiconductor material such as Gallium Nitride (GaN) will provide this required innovation.GaN-based Field Effect Transistors (FETs) have the potential to operate at power densities of up to 10 times that of conventional RF semiconductor technologies, which will enable compact PAs with higher RF output power to be implemented. The proposed GaN PA design is estimated to be >50% smaller in both size and weight compared to other solid state solutions and almost 20% lower in power consumption for typical designs used in long-range space RF Telecommunications.   In summary, Applying novel GaN semiconductor materials in innovative PA designs are required for long-range space RF communication systems to fully reach their performance potential and to reduce their SWAP.","By developing a reliable GaN based SSPA with linear 50W RF output power and >60% efficiency at frequencies between 8 to 9 GHz, the SWAP of future long-range communication equipment will be significantly decreased.   Also the data rates of long–range X-Band communication links will be increased by >30% relative to the technology utilized today.  Thus, a robust GaN based MMIC design is the primary focus for this project and can commercially be leveraged by NASA for other long-range space RF communication systems.Additionally, at the completion of Phase II of this proposed project it is anticipated to have experimental data on the radiation hardness of Nitronex GaN RF devices.

Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) has been the material of choice for high-power microwave systems at these frequencies for decades. Until only recently, GaAs was unchallenged at Ka band for solid-state amplification. Unfortunately, the low power density of GaAs requires extensive combining networks contributing to large amplifier size and low efficiency; neither is acceptable in next-generation high-performance systems.Auriga will use a 0.15 ?m Gallium Nitride (GaN) High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMT) to meet the frequency band and power level required. GaN HEMTs are high-voltage and high power density devices, resulting in smaller, more efficient power amplifiers (PAs). Competing GaAs pHEMT technology is more mature and readily available, but cannot compete with GaN's electrical and thermal performance. As GaN transitions from leading-edge to industry standard, its usage is expanding and the cost of entry is diminishing.

Emergent Space Technologies proposes to develop an STRS-compliant software-defined GPS receiver that can be flown on CoNNeCT that is based on a proven terrestrial commercial technology which shares heritage with the JPL Blackjack receiver.  The proposed system is called the Radio Navigation Waveform Experiment (RANE) and utilizes a codeless signal processing technique, called Spectral Compression Positioning (SCP), to estimate position, navigation, and timing (PNT) solutions.  RANE will have a small electronic footprint, be multi-frequency capable, and require less power than traditional code-correlator GPS receivers.  On CoNNeCT, RANE will demonstrate the portability and use of SCP for PNT solutions for NASA.","RANE will be a highly portable GPS SDR that can be used in various orbits ranging from near-Earth to geosynchronous orbit.  The versatility of RANE to detect and track signals in a weak signal environment or highly accelerating one has been shown in simulation and testing.  This is particularly useful for a geosynchronous vehicle like GOES-R.  This technology has significant promise for nearly any spaceborne GPS application.  Due to its low electronic footprint and power, RANE could be used on cubesats and can also coexist on a shared hardware platform, such as communications.  RANE can track multiple frequencies simultaneously and thus has significant potential for space weather.  And in an STRS compliant form factor, it will be portable to various platforms.  RANE can track the encrypted L1 P(Y) chipping code phase.  Pairing this capability with real-time GPS differential corrections can potentially enable geodetic quality PNT solutions.","The current terrestrial implementation of RANE requires little power and has a small electronic footprint.  It can be added to another set of hardware to increase capabilities without adding weight.  RANE can also be flown on cubesats where SWaP is limited for use as a PNT sensor or space weather sensor.  The Air Force has shown interest in the codeless technology and its versatility for Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) missions.  Since RANE can be configured to detect any broadband signal with the appropriate RF front end, it could navigate in GPS-denied environments.  This would be especially useful in various military applications.  It can function in various orbit types without little-to-no changes to the waveform.","Navigation & Guidance; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Space Transportation & Safety"

Interorbital modular rockets core element is the Common Propulsion Module (CPM).The CPM is a liquid rocket engine, propellant and pressurization section and aerodynamic faring integrated into a self-contained module. The liquid rocket engine is ablatively cooled and operates in a blowdown pressurization mode using low-cost, storable hypergolic propellants. Interorbital has successfully static test fired a 4,500lb thrust CPM main engine demonstrating combustion stability and throttling capability. Interorbital modular rocket systems were developed under the Minimum Cost Design paradigm and will deliver breakthrough cost reductions in space access. Cost reductions in propulsion are achieved by elimination of complex pressurization, ignition components, cooling, and propellant infrastructure normally associated with typical liquid rocket technology. Further cost reductions in the space launch value chain are attained by utilizing commercially available components and developing simplified manufacturing and operations minimizing need for capital intensive infrastructure and highly skilled labor. These unprecedented reductions in space access costs do not sacrifice performance or reliabiliy.CPM technology is scalable and readily configurable to suit numerous suborbital or orbital mission profiles. CPMs may be arrayed as launch vehicle first stage boosters or as unitary elements for sustainer and upper stages. Interorbital modular rockets are uniquely suited to support the emerging nanosatellite market while offering an American alternative for existing public and private sector space access requirements.","Interorbital believes its modular rocket technology is a low-cost, reliable and flexible suborbital and orbital workhorse for various NASA programs. A single CPM adapted as a rocket, such as the flight-ready Interorbital CPMTV, can be used as an ultra low-cost entry level rocket vehicle for educational programs. The Interorbital SR145 rocket under development offers order of magnitude cost reduction for sounding rockets missions while providing a benign operating environment for payloads solid rocket motor vehicles cannot provide. The logical scaling of Interorbital CPM technology to its nine module space launch vehicle under development will expand space access opportunities for NASA programs such as Small Satellite Subsystems Technology Program (SSST), Edison Small Satellite Demonstrations Missions Program or Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa).","Interorbital has sold out the inaugural co-manifest (32 picosatellites and 4 CubeSats) of its NEPTUNE rocket from sales of its TubeSat Kit plus Launch Package and CubeSat projects.

Key components include rocket engine nozzles and nozzle extensions for boost and upper stages. Options for such nozzles include actively cooled alloys, ablatives, and radiation-cooled composites and metals, each of which has known limitations. Actively cooled structures are complex and costly. Ablatives are heavy and limit performance due to shape instability. Radiation-cooled composites are costly, have a limited production base, and are size-limited. Radiation-cooled metals face low temperature limits, require significant machining for acceptable weight, and require protective coatings. These limitations are highlighted by the J-2X nozzle extension, which uses a highly machined metallic structure to minimize weight and requires an emissivity coating to maintain safe operating temperature. Carbon/carbon (C/C) provides an attractive alternative, but has joining ability, oxidation resistance, and manufacturability limitations. Ultramet previously developed and demonstrated carbon fiber-reinforced refractory ceramic matrix composites (CMC) for liquid propellant applications up to 4300?F. Ultramet has also demonstrated the integration of lightweight C/C with CMCs in a unique system comprising a C/C primary structure with an integral CMC liner or jacket. This system bridges the weight and performance gap between C/C and CMCs. The CMC provides enhanced mechanical properties and environmental resistance while the C/C provides a lightweight and cost-effective structure. In this project, the feasibility and benefits of applying this integrated material system for large liquid rocket engine nozzles will be validated. Subsequent work will address scaleup and will include a C/C producer. The fully developed system will combine the low weight and cost-effectiveness of C/C with the strength and durability of CMCs to support a range of potential NASA missions.","The proposed project directly targets future launch and exploration vehicle propulsion systems as potential end-use applications. Of particular interest are large boost-scale nozzles and upper stage nozzle extensions, similar in scale to the J-2X nozzle extension or to the niobium alloy nozzles used on the SpaceX Merlin engine.  More generally, the versatility of this concept makes it relevant to a variety of hot structures including combustion chambers, leading edges, thermal protection systems, airframe structures, and other propulsion components.","The proposed integrated ceramic matrix composite and carbon/carbon material system would be directly applicable to a wide range of aerospace and defense applications that require low-cost material possessing, ultrahigh temperature oxidation stability, high strength, acceptable joinability, and low mass. These applications include propulsion components such as combustion chambers, rocket nozzles, hot gas generators, and hot gas valves, using both liquid and solid propellants. Defense applications include uses in the high temperature combustion environment of advanced gun barrels, where the use of C/C is desirable if survivability and joining issues can be solved. Non-defense-related uses may include components related to energy generation in which use temperature, environmental reactivity, and economy are increasingly demanding.","Ceramics; Composites; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Launch Engine/Booster; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Processing Methods; Simulation & Modeling; Spacecraft Main Engine"

Our innovation is based on five major technology and operational elements including: 1) Tridyne Pressurant, 2) Distributed Storage and Control, 3) Cold Gas Storage / Warm Gas Delivery, 4) Bang-Bang Pressure Control, and 5) End-of-burn Tank Pressure Decay. Pump-fed launch vehicles will benefit from our innovative concept but the most significant benefits are achieved in cost-optimized pressure-fed systems such as KT Engineering's Radially Segmented Launch Vehicle (RSLV). We propose a six month Phase I program to refine the designs of the critical ground and airborne elements of this distributed pressurization system. We intend to demonstrate feasibility and more accurately quantify the benefits of our approach through analytical modeling, preliminary design, and high-flow, high-pressure testing of a prototype Tridyne catalytic reactor. The product of this effort will be engineering analysis and models, presentation materials from major reviews, a comprehensive final report, and our Phase II proposal. Under Phase II we will proposed to demonstrate design and operation of the ground and airborne elements of our pressurization system through prototype hardware fabrication and testing in the NASA KSC Launch Equipment Test Facility (LETF).","The proposed low cost, high efficiency, pressurization system will facilitate NASA vehicle launch operations and increase turnaround times by reducing the complexity of the ground-based processing system used to prepare the vehicle-based pressurization system for launch.

Future NASA missions are expected to use COPVs in spaceflight propellant tanks to store fuels, oxidizers, and other liquids for launch and space exploration vehicles. However, reliability and reusability of the COPVs are of concern, especially in cryogenic temperature applications; this limits adoption of COPVs in future reusable vehicle designs. The major problem with composites is the inherent brittleness of the epoxy matrix, which is prone to microcrack formation, either from exposure to cryogenic conditions or from impact from different sources. If not prevented, the microcracks can grow into larger cracks, leading to catastrophic failure and loss of function of the composite. In addition, the presence of microcracks increases gas permeation and leakage, which is undesirable in a COPV. Accordingly, materials innovations are needed to mitigate microcrack formation in composite cryotanks. In Phase I we propose to demonstrate microcrack prevention and mitigation in COPVs through the use of a novel nanocomposite matrix containing engineered nanoscale materials which will also enable self-healing of microcracks. Phase II will build upon the Phase I program to enable a TRL 5-6 working proof of concept and prototype for NASA testing, capable of long term use with high cycle performance at cryogenic temperatures.","Future NASA missions will rely on the use of composite structures as main structural members of space vehicles and composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) for spaceflight propellant tanks to store fuels, oxidizers, and other liquids for launch and space exploration vehicles.  These COPVs must be able to operate at the cryogenic conditions imposed by typical propellants, liquid oxygen (90?K) and liquid methane (110?K).  NASA applications for the research proposed herein include: earth-based and space-based cryogenic storage vessels (e.g. cryogenic fuel storage for first stage and upper stage launch vehicles including Crew Exploration Vehicles); long system life cryogenic storage that is both reliable and safe and would perform well beyond the current vessel design life (e.g. orbiting space fuel depots); and space-based habitat structures that are manufactured using fiber-reinforced composite materials.","The aerospace and the commercial communities have shown significant interest in using COPVs for cryogenic and non-cryogenic applications.  Non-NASA commercial applications for the research proposed include the following: Liquid hydrogen fuel cells in terms of increased safety and reliability; vehicular cryo-compressed gas storage of hydrogen and natural gas which dramatically increases the fuel storage density thus increasing the amount of fuel that can be stored in a vehicle; environmentally-friendly and safer earth-based cryogenic fluid storage where the composite structures will not need painting, stripping, and repainting in order to prevent corrosion as does current metal/steel construction and are also easier to transport due to their light-weight nature; and interest in the marine transport of propane via tanker ships where very large (5300 m3) COPVs will be needed.",Composites; Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Propulsion; Fuels/Propellants; Launch Engine/Booster; Nanomaterials; Polymers; Spacecraft Main Engine; Structures

For example, NASA is aiming to create a new generation of heavy-lift launch vehicles to support both human spaceflight and space exploration missions.  To ensure these vehicles can support all of the NASA needs, the mass of the propellant tanks must be significantly reduced, primarily through the use of composite materials.  However, two primary challenges must be overcome to enable the use of composite tanks for these new classes of heavy launchers.  One is to develop novel, microcrack-resistant, polymer matrix composite materials that will enable construction of 5 to 10 meter diameter composite tanks, and the second is to develop out-of-autoclave manufacturing methods that will enable the cost of these tanks to be 20-25% less than that of metal tanks.  In the proposed program CTD plans to develop and evaluate new materials that will provide a strain to initiate microcracking that is 50% higher than that of the current materials.  At the same time the materials will be optimized for out-of-autoclave processing of composite tanks.  Of particular interest are low void content, long out-life, good tack properties, and out-of autoclave cure characteristics. The Phase I material development effort will explore several polymer chemistries including toughened epoxies, Polybenzoxazines and a hybridized version of the Polybenzoxazines and toughened epoxies.  At the end of Phase I, CTD will fabricate and test a 15-cm-diameter by 18-cm-long, 1.9L cylindrical subscale tank to demonstrate the processing feasibility and performance of the new material.","The linerless composite cryogenic tank technology that is proposed herein can provide enabling capabilities for several near-term and longer-term NASA mission goals including those intended for future heavy launch vehicles, planetary and asteroid decent and accent vehicles, in-orbit spacecraft re-fueling as well as for long term storage in deep space on one planetary surfaces such as the moon. Indeed, the development of lightweight, linerless composite tanks for these applications will help to reduce mass, which is a critical need for these systems. Lightweight composite tanks can also be used for storage of hydrogen in fuel cell driven high altitude long duration aircraft as well as other unmanned air vehicles with varying mission objectives. In addition to storage tanks, the manufacturing technology being developed here can be used for composite cryogenic piping and other aircraft parts.","The linerless composite cryogenic tank technology that is proposed can provide enabling capabilities for a variety of other government, industrial, and commercial uses.

Currently the majority of monitoring and recording of data is performed by the ISS crew. These tasks, albeit relatively passive, often consume large blocks of a crew member??Ωs time. In the future, it would be desirable to offload much of this observational work onto experts and technicians on the ground, enabling the ISS crew members to focus on setup, control, and other tasks requiring greater dexterity.  In addition, as recent events have shown, there exists a possibility that the ISS will be uncrewed for a period of time. Flight controllers will want to have views of the ISS in cases when there are no crew.  Such a remote monitoring system must be capable of providing a wide variety of camera perspectives, covering the majority of ISS's interior.

Since these waves when focused by an Fresnel Annular Sector Actuator (FASA) have a very high level of lateral ultrasonic thrust, the coupling of them into a well causes a lateral mixing vortex. Banks of these transducers are contained in a multi-station, robotic, compact instrument. The instrument utilizes a centrifuge to produce a gravity vector into tubes containing samples which are ultrasonically coupled to the FASA transducer. The electrical energy is inductively coupled into the transducer which generate BLU energy for fluid processing in the sample tube. Samples placed into the instrument will be directed to the proper transducer set (correct BLU power), for 1) cell/tissue lysis, 2) cell fractionation, 3) Sample mixing and compound solubilization  4) DNA shearing for microbiological applications, e.g., PCR, micro array analysis, other analysis (TBD).","Sample Preparation for DNA Sequencing – Initially, this application can be accomplished in the micro-gravity/zero gravity environment on the ISS. Eventually, the product can be utilized to identify the basic elements of DNA on non-terrestrial surfaces. DNA sample preparation is required every time DNA is to be sequenced. There are multiple steps involved in the preparation of DNA for sequencing. These steps are typically completed by different instruments from different companies. However, there are a few key basic processes that are necessary, namely lysing, shearing, mixing and heating, all of which can be executed using Microsonics technology. Obviously, the compact requirements of the ISS make the flexibility and dynamic nature of this potential instrument ideal.More specific applications: Sample prep for chemical analysis, protein synthesis & protein crystallography, DNA Fragmentation, Cell Lysis, Mixing and Resolubilization of compounds in solutions and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Simulation of different gravitational environments - Through the modification of the centrifugal forces, all of the sample preparation steps mentioned above can be accomplished while simulating different gravitation environments such as the moon, Mars, Jupiter, etc.Sonoporation - The device should be able to sonically modify the permeability of the cell plasma membrane. The goal would be to allow the uptake of large particles, such as DNA, into the cell.","As the target of the Micro-Gravity Sample Preparation System is to provide the research scientists working on the ISS the same capabilities that they would have in a terrestrial laboratory, many of the Non-NASA commercial applications are the same as the NASA applications. While it is clear that when placing the instrument in a terrestrial lab, the same gravitational constraints would not exist, the universal nature of the centrifugal process lends the product to being similarly utilized.","Acoustic/Vibration; Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Biological Signature (i.e., Signs Of Life); Biophysical Utilization; Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and smaller; Nanomaterials; Organics/Biomaterials/Hybrids; Polymers"

The Light Microscopy Module (LMM), which was developed and is being managed by the NASA Glen Research Center (GRC), is currently operating on the ISS and has supported many high profile research experiments. LMM could yield many more astonishing results if auxiliary subsystems were available to complement its capabilities. For example, Techshot is currently developing the LMM-Dynamic Stage (LMM-DS), which will satisfy a host of new experiments proposed for LMM. However, GRC has many more researchers awaiting the essential auxiliary subsystems to efficiently conduct colloid science experiments in the LMM, which could lead to new advanced materials with exciting commercial potential. Capitalizing on Techshot's rapid progress with the LMM-DS, as well as the company's vast array of separations technologies and extensive experience with microfluidic systems, a series of Colloid Homogenization Modules (CHM) will be developed by Techshot for use in the LMM-DS. These innovative low-volume mixing devices will enable uniform particle density and remotely controlled repetition of LMM colloids experiments. In addition CHM will minimize crew time, as well as avert the need for multiple, costly colloid samples that are expended after only one examination. The CHM subsystems are an extremely important analytical microgravity research technology that will greatly enhance the capability of the LMM, thereby enabling ISS to become even more effective as a national laboratory.","The proposed CHM devices offer important new technology needed for on-orbit analysis, as well as the chance to leverage existing ISS facilities for new scientific payloads. This is expected to lead to many new potential NASA commercial applications and opportunities. In particular, Techshot expects to commercialize the CHM by incorporating it into the company's spaceflight service program that it offers to NASA mission programs, as well as to other Government agencies, including investigators funded by the National Institute of Health's Biomed-ISS program. The CHM family of devices provides unique opportunities to remotely control and facilitate colloids experiments and other similar fluidic experiments on the ISS LMM. By further automating the experiment process, CHM allows more colloid samples to be processed in a shorter period of time, while at the same time minimizing the need for crew member involvement. The improved capability afforded by CHM will enable more colloids experiments to be conducted and lead to far more efficient and productive use of the LMM. Overall, the science research community will be better served with increased capacity of processing experiments on the LMM, and NASA can more fully realize its goal of utilizing ISS as a national laboratory.","Techshot serves as an Implementation Partner to NASA for enabling space flight experimentation on ISS. Building on its heritage of developing and integrating space flight hardware, as well as conducting scientific research in space, Techshot offers flight experiment services to non-NASA customers, such as researchers from universities and the private sector. Techshot's successful space flight experiments with processing facilities like the Avian Development Facility (ADF) and the ADvanced Space Experiment Processor (ADSEP) position the company as a leader in offering these unique services. Soon, the Light Microscopy Module – Dynamic Stage (LMM-DS), coupled with the innovative capabilities of CHM, which can facilitate more efficient LMM fluidic experiments, are expected to give Techshot an even greater competitive advantage in attracting microgravity research customers. Furthermore, with the ability of commercial launch vehicles (e.g. SpaceX, Orbital Science) to get more experiment samples into orbit, once these vehicles begin routine visits to the ISS, the economics of transporting and processing materials in microgravity should become far more compelling. Eventually, given sufficient economical commercial launch vehicle transporting capacity, when coupled with Techshot's cadre of space processing equipment, CHM could become an important element for processing larger quantities of high-value materials in the unique microgravity environment of space.",Adaptive Optics; Analytical Methods; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Biophysical Utilization; Fluids; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Process Monitoring & Control

We propose a novel unpowered wireless ultrasound generation and sensing system for SHM. Since ultrasonic signals generally have a frequency of a few tens of kilohertz to a few megahertz, they cannot be easily transmitted using a wireless means because of high sampling and high bandwidth requirements. Our system uses a frequency mixer to up-convert the ultrasonic signal to microwave frequency so that it can be transmitted wirelessly using a small antenna and down-convert the ultrasonic signal back to its original frequency once the wireless signal is received. Because the mixing of the ultrasound and the microwave signal is performed using a passive microwave component, i.e. a frequency mixer, the wireless sensor nodes do not need any local power. For ultrasound generation, an ultrasound-modulated signal is transmitted to a remote ultrasound generator, the generator recovers the ultrasound excitation signal using down conversion and supply it to a piezoelectric actuator. Since the sensing and generating nodes have the same configuration, each node can either act as a generator or a sensor. Sensor array can also be implemented. Compared to SAW sensor, our approach requires smaller antenna and achieves longer distance between interrogation unit and the sensor. Another key difference is that SAW sensor requires special piezoelectric substrate whereas our approach can use any piezoelectric sensor. Finally, the proposed approach is compatible with previous works on ultrasound-based technology. Previously developed knowledge on data processing and feature extraction can be easily adopted.","The proposed wireless ultrasound generation and sensing system can be used in monitoring critical NASA structures in International Space Station, Crew Exploration Vehicle, and other ground structures.","Many structures such as pipes, metallic, and non-metallic structures are aging and need more timely inspection.

The device will be suited for self-guided ordinance and unmanned aerial vehicles, where traditional high sensitivity optical INS systems are too large to use.

To address this need, Emergent Space Technologies will develop a low SWaP codeless GPS receiver that will be capable of precise and real-time orbit determination. Currently, precise orbital determination is performed on the ground since real-time GPS differential corrections won't be available on orbit until they are broadcast by the TDRSS Augmentation Satellite System (TASS). The proposed innovation will combine the capability to receive TASS messages with SCP and the Goddard Enhanced Orbital Navigation System (GEONS) to provide precise PNT capabilities.  SCP can track the L1 P(Y) chipping code-phase without an encryption module since it is codeless.  Combining this capability with the ability to receive TASS messages in GEONS, on a suitable hardware platform will enable kinematic GPS capable of decimeter-level positioning in real-time.  This effort determines how to best integrate these technologies, and to find a suitable host","The proposed system can be utilized for any NASA mission in which GPS tracking is desired, and is especially useful for small satellites where SWaP concerns are critical.  Because the system proposed integrates real time correction messages with a highly accurate codeless GPS navigation system which shares a heritage with JPL Blackjack technology, and utilizes GEONS as a Kalman Filter Navigation engine, deci-meter level positioning accuracies are possible.  This high accuracy real time positioning enables future missions in which these are desirable goals. Due to the abilities of the unique receiver design proposed, it is possible to extend the sensor for scientific missions such as ionosphere profiling, and to extend navigation ability to degraded GPS or complex orbits such as those higher than GPS.","The proposed receiver system has significant applicability to DOD needs for positioning in orbits where conventional GPS is difficult, and can be extended to operate in cases where GPS is denied.  The ability to produce highly accurate positions in a low cost, low swap, form factor, and in a software defined radio implementation has applications for operationally responsive space, in which a satellite must be assembled and launched quickly.  Commercial applications include any application in which highly accurate positioning is required, in any orbital regime.  This would include missions in which multiple satellites are required to operate in close proximity at known separations, and in systems in which the location of the satellite must be known to tag the data acquired.","Navigation & Guidance; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)"

The proposed advanced star tracker provides onboard deep space orbit self determination capabilities through the use of specialized reference stars that have exoplanet companions.  The motion of exoplanets around a reference star's barycenter provides a stable, highly predictable natural signal pattern.  An advanced exoplanet star tracker enhances mission capabilities for future manned and unmanned space vehicles as well as reducing Deep Space Network (DSN) tracking requirements and resources.","The proposed Exoplanet Star Tracker hardware would improve future navigation systems for NASA manned or unmanned space platforms.  Primary autonomous navigation could be incorporated into spacecraft designed for geostationary, elliptical or deep space orbits including missions to the Moon, comets, asteroids, Libration points and Mars.  Resource demands on DSN would be decreased.  Secondary navigation in low and medium Earth orbits would be available when primary GPS navigation is lost.","The proposed Exoplanet Star Tracker hardware would improve future navigation systems for non-NASA users such as the military, non-profit research institutions, universities and commercial satellite builders.

This Gamma-ray source Localization-Induced Navigation and Timing, or ""GLINT"", concept provides deep-space vehicles the capability for self-navigation based upon measurements from observations of these source signals. In the past, gamma-ray sources have been coarsely localized on the sky. The Swift mission now provides high-precision source localizations, allowing the potential inversion of the differential timing problem to independently constrain the positions of spacecraft with gamma-ray detection equipment. A comprehensive study is proposed of the necessary characteristics for navigation of the high-energy (Ephoton > 20 keV) celestial sources and the associated detectors used to collect their signal, detailed development of the algorithms and filters used to process the source signals and vehicle trajectory data, architecture design of an operational system, and an assessment of the potential performance and benefits directly for future deep-space exploration missions. Both on-board self-navigation techniques and post-processed techniques will be studied. Extensive simulation incorporating existing source observational data and orbit trajectory programs, including publicly available NASA software tools will provide a basis for our analysis and performance assessment.","NASA applications primarily involve deep-space self-navigation of interplanetary vehicles. Additionally, improved space weather detection can be achieved, as GLINT detectors on multiple spacecraft would provide a solar system-wide early warning system for solar storms and intense celestial gamma-ray bursts. Detection of such events provides notification for safe harboring of personnel and hardware, monitoring of EVA high-energy radiation dosages, or post-burst analysis of data from sensitive instruments. Advanced GLINT detectors with fast timing electronics and high sensitivity would be directly applicable to future exploration mission instruments. Components designed for navigation would be future extensions to the Inter-Planetary Network of cosmic gamma-ray burst detection, as there is a widespread need for gamma-ray instrumentation on both astrophysics and planetary-science missions. Adding GLINT to these future missions would likely incur marginal increases in cost and complexity, while gaining a new channel of navigation information, whether processed on-board or on the ground.","Non-NASA applications include future DoD and commercial missions that will venture into deep-space. Since GLINT can provide navigation above and beyond Earth orbit, military assets that rise above the GPS constellation gain added utility. Covert operation is secure by allowing vehicles to self-navigate to their destination, since no two-way transmissions are required during an orbit injection phase. For commercial ventures out of low-Earth orbit, even into interplanetary, missions, these new cost-efficient sensors contribute to assisting with the overall success on such missions. These include commercial communication vehicles in geosynchronous or supersynchronous orbits, ventures to the Moon or asteroids, or on interplanetary solar sails. GLINT capabilities include reduced operations cost, as well as reduced reliance on the NASA DSN system. The high-energy detection capabilities would help monitor general space weather for commercial and military EVA crewmembers. GLINT high-energy detectors also contribute to advanced medical and diagnostic imaging capabilities on Earth.","Analytical Methods; Attitude Determination & Control; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Electromagnetic; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Navigation & Guidance; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Ranging/Tracking; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); X-rays/Gamma Rays"

This study will leverage NVIDIA Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and multi-core CPUs that are quickly becoming commonly available for engineering communities. Parallelization of the Unscented Kalman filter and the bootstrap particle filter with applications in INS/GPS integration and the orbital determination problem will be the focus of the phase I research. This research will contribute to upgrading the current fleet of NASA navigation software which heavily rely on Kalman filters and EKF and are quickly becoming outdated. Over the last couple of decades, great advancement has been made in improving filter accuracy in nonlinear applications with non-Gaussian noise models. One of the advanced techniques is particle filters which, if properly applied, are more accurate than the EKF for nonlinear and non-Gaussian applications. One drawback of the particle filters is the excessive computational burden if implemented on a serial computer. However, since the majority of the computation can be carried out simultaneously, the particle filters inherently are well suited for parallel computing. The objective of the Phase I effort is to leverage GPUs and multi-core CPUs to exploit such parallelism. With the performance of these devices improving at a rapid pace, it is anticipated that they will quickly find their way to onboard avionics, and this research paves the way for implementing particle filters in real-time applications. This will bring unprecedented accuracy and applicability of particle filters to aircraft and spacecraft navigation analyses for NASA and a wide range of non-NASA applications.","Expected NASA applications are in the areas of spacecraft and aircraft navigation analyses. The intended modular nature allows for a wide variety of applications, including ground or onboard facilities to process navigational data from multiple sensor sources, and analysis and testing of flight software and onboard data processing algorithms. Existing NASA software packages such as GPS-Enhanced Onboard Navigation Software (GEONS), General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT), as well as Orbital Determination Tool Box (ODTBX) may benefit from these advanced filtering techniques without sacrificing computation time by interchanging the native navigation processor with one chosen from the proposed parallelized modules.","The proposed parallelized filter modules have applications in a wide range of industries besides NASA, including aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, atmospheric data assimilation and economic modeling, etc., where sensors are commonly used to collect a large quantity of raw data which need to be processed with filtering techniques. Specific examples of non-NASA applications may include marine vessel navigation, commercial airliner navigation, seismic data acquisition and analysis, atmospheric observation data collection and processing, and so on. Existing tools can also be enhanced by incorporating the advanced filtering modules.

In addressing these challenges, DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation seeks to advance the capabilities of NASA's open source General Mission Analysis Tool to integrate the latest advances in trajectory path planning and estimation. This includes the development of an Advanced Path Planning (APP) plugin that leverages concepts from dynamical systems theory, multi-phase targeting, and visualization for trajectory design in regions where multi-body effects are significant, such as near the libration points. Parallel to that is the development of an Advanced Estimation (AE) plugin, which leverages the results of past studies done at DECISIVE analytics for the Missile Defense Agency and the US Air Force. The proposed AE plugin will be designed around a Hybrid Dynamic Bayesian Network framework, pioneered by DECISIVE ANALYTICS, which will enable advanced estimation capabilities including Unscented Kalman Filters and Gaussian Mixture Models. These two techniques, particularly Gaussian Mixture Models, offer enhanced predictive capabilities for the determination of the true probability density when nonlinearities significantly influence the estimation process. Phase 1 will focus on the software development, integration, testing, and validation of initial prototypes for both plugins.","The Advanced Path Planning and Estimation plugins, proposed for integration into NASA's open source General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT), will offer end-users enhanced mission design capabilities for analysis in libration point regimes, or in regions where multi-body effects become significant. This includes missions that explore the vicinity of small celestial bodies, such as asteroids. Parallel to this development, the Advanced Estimation plugin, also proposed for integration into GMAT, will offer end-users the ability to incorporate, into their analyses, techniques that adequately characterize the effects of nonlinearities in the true posterior probability density during the estimation process. GMAT's current capabilities are limited to simpler extended Kalman filter implementations, which represent the probability density in terms of the first two statistical moments. In contrast, the AE plugin will allow users to consider multi-modal probability density functions, which incorporates Unscented Kalman Filters and Gaussian Mixture Models, among others.","The capabilities provided by the Advanced Path Planning (APP) and Advanced Estimation (AE) plugins are generally applicable outside of NASA's mission. The underlying generalized multi-phase targeting framework within the APP plugin, for instance, is generally independent of the dynamical  regime. Thus, the APP binary plugin can be transitioned into other applications related, for instance, to autonomous vehicle guidance.  In fact, the initial motivation for the latest theoretical advancements in this framework originate in autonomous vehicle guidance.  Furthermore, the AE plugin is built around the Guide and Adapt tools developed by DECISIVE ANALTYICS. These packages, previously developed under various contracts with the Missile Defense Agency and the US Air Force, offer generalized estimation capabilities that are also independent of the dynamical regime. Because we already have customers for the underlying tools, any enhanced capabilities developed under this contract will enable us to provide additional services to them as well.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); Navigation & Guidance; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

Silicon avalanche photodiodes have very low responsivity for wavelength longer than 1.1 um; and while InP-based APDs have high responsivity in the SWIR region, they exhibit high noise equivalent powers (NEPs) due to the relatively high excess noise of bulk InP multiplication regions.  We propose to develop low-noise analog APDs operating in the SWIR region by incorporating impact ionization engineered structures coupled with an epitaxial negative feedback gain quenching mechanism into the multiplication region of linear mode APDs. The goal is to develop large-area (>250 um diameter), low-noise SWIR detectors with high quantum efficiency (>75%), high bandwidth (~100 MHz), and very low NEP approaching NASA targets of 20 fW/rt(Hz).  In addition to discrete device characterization, these devices will be incorporated into prototype LIDAR receivers for performance assessment.","The major impact on NASA applications will be to dramatically advance the lidar technology in the SWIR region, where Si-based detectors lose their sensitivity. The I2E-NF LmAPDs developed in this program will greatly improve the NEP and the highest stable gain that can be achieved with linear mode APDs. This will be beneficial for the measurement of atmospheric constituents, such as NASA's Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS) program. It is also beneficial for the measurement of more general atmospheric properties such as wind and weather patterns, and will benefit NASA's Doppler Wind Lidar program. Lidar vibrometry identifies remote objects based on their distinct vibration signatures, and will benefit from the increased performance of APDs. As a result of this, the I2E-NF LmAPDs will benefit NASA's Aerosols-Clouds-Ecosystems (ACE) program. With improved sensitivity in SWIR region, the I2E-NF LmAPDs will have important application in free-space optical communications as well.","The I2E-NF LmAPDs developed in this program will benefit a host of non-NASA commercial applications, including a variety of range-finding, lidar, and ladar applications; optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR); and free-space optical communications. For range-finding and ladar applications, the current military imperative to shift these applications to eye-safer wavelengths provides a strong driver for improved APD performance at ~ 1.5 um. For OTDR applications, the use of OTDR at 1.5 um is critical for the characterization of optical fiber links as part of network deployment and maintenance. Large-area linear mode APDs with improved sensitivity will allow for more accurate characterization of longer links as well as improved discrimination between faults situated in close physical proximity. Commercial free-space optical communications systems will also be able to leverage improvements realized from the development of large area SWIR linear mode APDs which can operate in both 1.06 and 1.55 um wavelengths.",Detectors (see also Sensors); Infrared; Optical; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Ranging/Tracking; Transmitters/Receivers

The design target is 16 phase shifters and supporting functionality, including low noise amplifiers, combiners, downconverters, and digital beamformer control logic integrated onto a single RFIC.

The reduction of size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) of the radio frequency (RF) components required for a particular mission area allows the instrumentation package to be made more compact. In meeting the SWaP-C objectives, RF components will be required to be smaller and more power efficient. To meet the needs of NASA's Earth Science Division, RF components must lead to greater performance than provided by the current state-of-the-art.NuWaves proposes a High Efficiency Switching Power amplifier for Earth Radar Observation Systems (HESPEROS). Several innovative techniques have been identified to increase the efficiency and operational bandwidth of RF power amplifiers (PAs) targeted for radar applications. The amplifier design also incorporates fast turn on and turn off circuits to achieve switching times of less than one microsecond (us). The benefit of such amplifiers in radar applications is the fact that they can be switched off during the receive period to prevent self-generated noise from corrupting the received signal. Also, high-power transmit and receive (T/R) switches at the antenna feed can be eliminated.The advantages of a wideband PA are numerous. A wideband PA enables the design of a multi-band radar, reducing the number of components needed for operation in the P, L, and X bands. A high efficiency PA is also key to reducing battery size and cooling requirements in spaceborne applications. The switching amplifier topology presented in this proposal addresses all the above requirements.","NASA's Earth Science Division will find immediate use for the HESPEROS amplifier in earth observation sensor systems. This design enables operation over multiple radar bands with a single RF PA.Ultimately, other applications for this proposed high efficient PA for radar based applications include other primary mission critical communication functions like telemetry, telecommand, navigation and guidance control, flight termination, craft-to-craft communications, and TDRSS reply and relay.","The proposed high efficiency RF PA for radar applications may be adapted to other areas requiring high power transmitters.

In addition, satellite communication is moving to V-Band, and the proposed effort would have application at these lower frequencies.  The dual-polarized microfabricated copper-based antenna apertures with integrated MMICs present enabling capabilities for each of these applications and others using this frequency range.","There are several applications for active mm-wave antenna arrays outside of NASA.

The proposed novel ASIC required by NASA's PATH mission will have a greatly reduced power consumption compared to a FPGA based or a classic ASIC based implementations, increased radiation hardness and extended operating temperature range. The proposed cross-correlation unit consists of cross-correlation cells which are based on novel architecture. The logic primitives are arranged to ""work when must"" rather than to ""work when need"" in these novel cross-correlation cells. The high speed interfaces the proposed ASIC will incorporate can minimize the power consumption and increase the reliability. Termination resistors, amplifiers, analog-to-digital-converters realized inside the ASIC will save power due to shorter interconnects compared to interconnects that are used in FPGAs. Moreover, the high-speed receivers-deserializers could further save the power due to reduced number of termination resistors compared to the high-speed interface with analog-to-digital converters. The deep submicron SOI CMOS technology selected for the ASIC's fabrication will increase its tolerance to total ionizing dose (TID) and reduce the probability of radiation induced latch-up. The ASIC will be designed following the design for testability (DFT) methods that will simplify characterization and testing of the fabricated ASIC thus will reduce the risk and lower the cost of the product.Phase I of the project will provide a complete definition of the proposed ASIC, its design and in silico validation of critical circuits.

A total of three ASICs will be employed to implement the complete cross-correlation function required for the instrument. Novel cross-correlator's architecture will permit to process these signals at greatly reduced power consumption compared to FPGAs or specialized cross-correlator ASICs. The proposed cross-correlator ASIC can also find application in signal processing required for radio telescopes such as the SKA that may employ more than 2000 receivers. The cross-correlators installed on such telescopes are projected to consume tens of kilowatts of power. The ASIC proposed by us offers the reduction of power consumption by at least an order.

Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are conventionally chosen as detectors for standard laser rangefinder systems. However, the performance of currently used APDs degrades significantly after exposure to high levels of radiation. Integrated Micro Sensors Inc (IMS, Houston, TX)) proposes novel intrinsically radiation-tolerant III nitrides based high-speed APDs superior for use in space-based laser-altimeter systems. The Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN) alloy has the potential of forming photovoltaic devices covering a range of 0.7 eV (InN) to 3.4 eV (GaN). This energy range allows for providing a perfect match to the 1.06 um wavelength (~1.17 eV) of the lasers used in the time-of-flight range finders. The III-Nitrides exhibit inherent chemical and thermal ruggedness, which makes them suitable for several space and military applications. It has recently been determined that these Nitride materials can offer exceptional radiation tolerance that is well beyond what can be achieved with conventional materials that are currently flown into space. The InGaN APDs to be developed in this project will be targeted for operating conditions up to 250 oC, and up to 2 MeV proton irradiation, which are substantially higher than those for the standard currently used materials, such as Si or GaAs. IMS envisions that devices developed in this project would be especially beneficial to Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) that requires high performance sensors and detectors that can operate with low noise under the severe radiation environment.The ultimate goal of this project is to develop high-speed, radiation-tolerant visible-blind APDs responding to laser beams of 1.06 um wavelength for rangefinder applications.","The latest improvements in high-performance APDs have enabled impressive applications in aerospace technology. Avalanche photodiodes have gained acceptance in the aerospace industry because of their very high sensitivity in detecting very low light levels, even down to a single photon. Low noise levels and high signal-to-noise ratio properties also provide benefits in aerospace applications. Common applications include laser rangefinders that incorporate APD detectors for more sensitive measurements. Avalanche photodiodes used in these applications can operate with lower light levels and shorter laser pulses, resulting in more eye-safe range finders. High-performance APDs can be tailored to meet these applications and have proven to be valuable tools in aerospace technology. Selecting the proper photodetector and amplifier circuitry to optimize gain for particular applications has played a major role in evaluating overall system performance.","Avalanche photodiodes have a built-in gain characteristic that provides a significant advantage in detecting lower light signals. The significance of single-photon detection becomes more apparent when applied to an event, such as measuring atmospheric conditions. To examine cloud formations, for instance, a laser beam is transmitted to the cloud and a return signal provides important distance and spectral information. The reflection contains very low light levels and is severely scattered. The few photons of light that actually reflect back can still be detected by the device to accumulate the data necessary for accurate measurement. Fast receiver modules, confocal microscopy, and particle detection are other common uses for APDs. A silicon APD can detect alpha particles, electrons with energies as high as 150 KeV, and other forms of radiation. Avalanche photodiodes also can be used for light detection and ranging (LIDAR) to measure distance, speed, rotation, and composition of a remote target that can be a clearly defined object, such as a vehicle, or a diffuse object, such as a smoke plume or clouds. Current avalanche photodiodes for communications applications are of much higher cost components than conventional p-i-n photodiodes. The results of the devices developed in this project will enhance the state-of the- art in reliable low-cost avalanche photodiodes for fiber optic communications","Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Detectors (see also Sensors); Infrared; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Navigation & Guidance; Optical; Ranging/Tracking; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)"

This InAs/GaSb superlattice material system is capable of infrared detection in MWIR/LWIR spectral range, depending on layer thickness of each superlattice period. The goal of this program is to develop high performance type II SL based FPA for 6-14 um detection. Photo detector arrays using this material are of great interest to the NASA for various applications including, in particular, imaging and optical detection, and object discrimination when tracking targets in space or performing astronomical observations. These LWIR photo detectors can also find application to infrared-based chemical identification systems and terrestrial mapping. Applying the dark current suppression and cutoff wavelength extension process to the type II superlattice detectors should result in higher operating temperature, extended cutoff wavelength, and improved quantum efficiency, all important factors that should significantly enhance FPA operation.  We intend to characterize the positive effects of proposed techniques in Phase I.  In Phase II we will refine the techniques to realize passive-cooled high-performance LWIR FPAs with quantum efficiency larger than 50%.","Commercial applications applicable to NASA include remote chemical sensing and IR imaging arrays for deployment on remote vehicles.  The LWIR data is valuable for object discrimination when tracking targets in space or performing astronomical observations.  The Type-II superlattice developed here operates at ambient temperatures or under passive cooling, allowing for the possible replacement of extrinsic Si-based photodetectors which require more cumbersome cryogenic cooling. This in turn reduces the weight and volume overhead required for supporting systems on space-based or portable platforms.  Chemical plumes could be analyzed and identified based on their infrared absorption signatures.  Thermal imagers can be applied to geologic and atmospheric studies, for either earth based or extraterrestrial projects.   Data on weather patterns or geothermal activity could then be collected.  At these long wavelengths objects can also be spotted through fog or dust, which would normally obscure visible light wavelengths.","Non-NASA Commercial Applications includes pollution monitoring, nondestructive testing, medical diagnostics, and target tacking. For civilian medical use thermal imaging can be applied to diagnosing certain cancers based on temperature anomalies at the skin surface.  Search and rescue operations are also aided with this technology in that the ability to detect heat sources provides a great and immediate visual contrast when viewing vast areas of land or seascape.  Similarly military and defense can also benefit from this technology.  Standard night-vision systems rely on image intensifiers which merely amplify the available visible light for the user.  Camouflaging can still fool these types of vision systems.  However, thermal imaging that LWIR arrays can provide adds a higher level of capabilities.  Potential enemies can more easily be spotted by the heat signature that is emitted by their bodies or recently discharged weapons.  Lingering heat patterns can also reveal if a room or vehicle has been recently occupied.",Detectors (see also Sensors); Infrared; Thermal; Thermal Imaging (see also Testing & Evaluation)

In order to reducing wavefront mismatches between the beam's combination in the interferometer and preserving the spatial information of the incident beam, a spatial filter array (SFA) will be crucial for such a interferometer. The SFA, which has to be uniform of intensity and phase to meet the request of telescope imaging for the planet, can reduce the starlight to request level to observe the image of the planet. The high performance and fill factor as well as light weight GI lens array can be used in the beam steering systems for NASA's laser space measurements and communication.","The GI lens array has great advantages over present micro-lens arrays in high accuracy and uniformity, high resolution and low cost for commercial applications as FPA imager, remote sensing, wide angle, fast beam steering applications, scientific and engineering instruments. For example, a GI lens array used with a CCD array can constitute the core of a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor. If the wavefront is distorted, the light imaged on the CCD sensor consists of displaced spots and missing spots. This information can be used to calculate the shape of the wavefront that was incident on the microlens array. Another application is in 3D imaging and displays. The use of a GI lens array can define the viewing directions for a pair of interlaced images and hence enable the observer to see a 3D stereoscopic image. And the GI lens array can be used to DWDM module, WSS in fiber optical communications.","Fiber (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Photonics); Filtering; Optical"

Germanium offers very low noise and proven performance in the 50-140?m range.2- The array will use four SB349 CTIA readout multiplexers which are manufactured using advanced cryo-CMOS process.

This is because solar illuminated backgrounds are orders of magnitude greater than the ultraviolet radiation of interest (solar blocking filters exhibit low UV transmission and scattered light).  This program will develop monolithic imaging arrays made of 4H-Silicon Carbide, whose band gap is 3.25 eV versus 1.12 eV for silicon.  This results in high UV sensitivity image sensor arrays with very low response in the visible/infrared along with negligible dark current without the need for cooling.  Monolithic integration of each individual Schottky detector pixel with its own CMOS readout circuitry eliminates reliability concerns common to bump bonding of thin visible-blind semiconductor materials (GaN etc) with silicon readout integrated circuits (ROICs).  In addition, Silicon Carbide is a more mature, defect free, material than Gallium Nitride.  Finally, the wide band gap of 4H-SiC results in a higher level of radiation tolerance as compared to Silicon.","NASA has been employing single SiC detectors in solar missions, and would be very interested in arrays of such solar-blind detectors for UV space astronomy missions if available.  As exemplified in the Hubble telescope instruments, long wavelength blocking filters exact a high price due to their limited life and low transmission in the ultraviolet.","There is an existing and continuing need for solar blind image sensors that do not employ vacuum tubes, improving reliability and reducing the cost of sensors that improve the ability to detect missile threats against the daytime sky background.  There is a need for ultraviolet spectrometers employed in research to minimize sensitivity to scattered light at longer wavelengths.  Solar blind UV imaging is needed in bio-chemistry to detect unique target signatures in detection of chemical surface residues and biological agents.

In particular, bulk cobalt-rich amorphous materials will provide increased permeability, tunable Curie temperature, highly controlled coercivity and saturation inductance, all without the introduction of magnetostrictive-based excess noise.  The bulk nature of the material will provide an unprecedented degree of freedom in core geometry design over existing ribbon-form amorphous alloys, allowing for near-net shapes of densified compacts.  The combined effect of these enhcancements will be to increase fluxgate sensitivity, decrease offset and noise, and allow for new, smaller geometries in fluxgate magnetometers.","Accurate, direct measurement of the constituent components of weak, DC magnetic fields is of utmost importance in the quest to better understand the dynamics of our planet, the origin and destiny of our solar system, and even the very operation of our universe itself.  NASA has employed fluxgate magnetometers in nearly every mission to date.  Increased sensitivity and decreased noise can allow for lower mass, lower volume devices that provide comparable, or improved, measurement capablities over current Mo-Permalloy core fluxgates.  Additionally, high permeability materials can provide new options for reactive impedance mitigation, EMI/magnetic shielding, and magnetic flux concentration.","The ability to accurately quantify magnetic field strength is an enabling technology for many areas of scientific research and commercial applications.  Both scalar field strength magnetometers and single- and multi-axis vector magnetometers have been used extensively in commercial applications such as global positioning systems, automotive anti-locking brake systems, medical diagnostic imaging, feedback sensors in active shielding systems.  Gradiometric multi-axis vector magnetometers in particular have been used extensively for magnetic anomaly detection and geophysical surveying.  Enhanced sensitivity and reduced noise coupled with the geometrical freedom provided by combustion drive compaction of amorphous cobalt alloys will allow for reliable, accurate ultra-miniature fluxgate devices for use a wide variety of commercial applications.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Cables/Fittings; Detectors (see also Sensors); Electromagnetic; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); GPS/Radiometric (see also Sensors); Isolation/Protection/Radiation Shielding (see also Mechanical Systems); Materials & Structures (including Optoelectronics); Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Metallics; Navigation & Guidance; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Processing Methods; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Superconductance/Magnetics; Telemetry (see also Control & Monitoring); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)"

Major geomagnetic storms arise when CMEs carry large amounts of magnetic flux as they propagate in the solar wind.   If these magnetic fields have a southward orientation (oppositely directed to the magnetic field at the Earth's magnetopause), they can cause a geomagnetic storm.  Predicting in advance whether observed CMEs will carry geoeffective magnetic fields is a long-term priority for the CCMC at NASA GFSC and other groups within NASA as well.  We propose to combine the existing CORHEL (Corona-Heliosphere) model of the solar corona and solar wind with a robust technique for generating simulated CMEs.  When successfully completed, the new tool, CORHEL-CG, will allow routine simulation of CMEs and represent a leap forward in physics-based space weather prediction models.","The CCMC, located at NASA GSFC, is presently running the WSA-Enlil model in real time, and is testing the inclusion of cone model CMEs.  While this model represents important advance in that physics-based models are now being used to forecast CMEs, it cannot predict the nature of the magnetic fields embedded in the CME.  When successfully completed, CORHEL-CG will be able to overcome this limitation and  may provide significantly better descriptions of CME in interplanetary space.  This should not only be useful to the CCMC, but to other groups at NASA as well.","CMEs are of concern not only to NASA, but to many government and commercial entities dependent on satellites and aircraft.  For example, NOAA SWPC is transitioning the WSA-Enlil-Cone model to operations to provide warnings of CME impacts.The Air Force is also interested in predicting and mitigating the impacts of geoeffective CMEs.

This has a major effect on the available power to the satellite or instrument, making power more precious.

Each stage of the ADR will use a low temperature superconducting magnet, which will periodically be energized via high temperature superconducting (HTS) leads. The present design of leads contributes a large fraction of the total heat load on the cryogenics system and so we propose to fabricate Yttria Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO) lead assemblies with a predicted heat load of about one order of magnitude lower than the established design that uses brittle filaments supported on a glass-fiber tube. Our suggested approach is to fabricate inherently tough and flexible leads in the 2A to 10A range from commercially available YBCO tape rated to over 200A. The substrates of such tapes are tough, strong low thermal conductivity metals which can be cut longitudinally into thin strips approximately 300 micrometers in width using a precision dicing saw. In principle, leads of any length or width can be made this way and tailored to a variety of specifications. In the region of the thermal gradient, the protective silver coating is removed and replaced by a non-conducting encapsulant; the as-manufactured silver coating is left at the ends to make electrical joints. This is a process which should lend itself well to small-scale manufacture. The strength and toughness of the leads means that they can be incorporated into a loom supported by taught Kevlar threads, which is a very low heat-leak method used extensively in space cryogenics. We expect that the overall result of this project will be to reduce significantly the size, weight and power requirement of the satellite-borne cryosystem and at the same time produce a lighter more robust lead structure.",The current leads proposed are of direct use to NASA X-ray telescopes; in particular the XRS-type cryostat.

HTS leads are of potential benefit in reduction of helium consumption in all these applications. Helium is becoming an increasingly scarce commodity, and the financial benefits of saving helium boil-off are increasing for many commercial users of these superconducting magnet technologies. Superconducting electronics is being proposed as the foundation of energy-efficient supercomputers operating at 4 degrees Kelvin.

Moreover, the SBIR instrument will be capable of both terrestrial and airborne deployments (e.g. DC-8, WB-57, ER-2, Alpha Jet...) to provide data in the troposphere, tropopause, and stratosphere.  The resulting system will allow researchers in NASA's Earth Science Division to acquire data that complements satellite observations made from several missions in the Earth Observing System (EOS).  The in-situ data will provide higher spatial resolution and vertical profiling near highly inhomogeneous OCS and CO2 sources, helping to better understand stratospheric aerosol loading and gross CO2 flux between plants and the atmosphere, both critical needs for improved climate modeling.","The primary objective of the NASA Earth Science Division is to determine how the global environment is changing, what drives these changes, and the potential consequences for human civilization.  In order to better research atmospheric properties, NASA requires instrumentation that is capable of measuring several key gaseous species, including OCS, CO2, CO, and H2O.  Carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is currently monitored by both remote sensing and extractive sampling.  As a complement to and validation of these remote systems, NASA has conducted several airborne campaigns to obtain higher resolution OCS measurements.  For example, both the INTEX-NA and Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific (TRACE-P) campaigns acquired canisters of ambient air samples at frequent intervals (e.g. 1 – 5 minutes) for off-line laboratory analysis.  As researchers become more aware of the role of OCS in stratospheric aerosol formation and its potential as a carbon cycle tracer for photosynthesis, NASA requires new technologies that make stand-alone, in-situ measurements of OCS with faster time response (e.g. 1 Hz) and comparable accuracy aboard both airborne and terrestrial platforms.  Additional measurements of CO2, CO, and H2O are also necessary to provide information on carbon dioxide respiration (e.g. OCS/CO2 ratio), combustion emissions (e.g. CO), and dry-mole fractions (e.g. correction for water vapor).","Besides its importance to NASA, the development of a highly sensitive, mid-infrared trace gas analyzer has several commercial applications.

The methodology of using the large current tuning range of VCSELs to access isotopic lines of nearly identical ground state energies can be investigated and applied to various other isotopic species of interest to NASA.","Besides NASA, there are widespread needs in the public research sector for atmospheric species monitoring.  With global warming at the forefront of environmental concerns, both academic and research institutions need reliable and affordable δ13CO2 instrumentation to use in support of or as the basis of their research.Like NASA, the atmospheric research communities have interest in other isotopic measurement instrumentation to measure δ18O for O2, CO2 and N2O as well as δ13C measurements on methane.

Millions of passengers were stranded for over a week and the shutdowns cost the airlines $200 million per day. Jet airliner encounters with volcanic ash plumes have resulted in 90 known incidents of damage to engines and airframes over the past 30 years.  Research aircraft measurements from the Mt. St. Helens eruption in 1980 showed that particles with diameters < 0.1 micron were found in concentrations similar to those measured in ambient air, but concentrations with diameters from 0.1 to 30 microns were up to 100 times greater than in ambient air. A safe and cost-effective alternative to flying conventional research aircraft into volcanic ash plumes is to instrument a small Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) that uses electric motor propulsion.  In Phase I we propose to design and laboratory test a novel, standalone sensor system that can measure the particle size distribution from 0.09 micron to hundreds of microns, record high-resolution digital images, and collect samples for post-analysis of the composition of volcanic ash.  In Phase II we will install the sensor package on a tethered balloon and a small electric-powered UAS supplied by Vanilla Aircraft LLC.  In concert with experts from the University of Alaska and the University of Cost Rica, we will perform a pilot field project measuring ash size distribution, recording high-resolution digital images, and analyzing ash composition in the plume of an active volcano in Costa Rica.","NASA will deploy several small UAS with these novel sensors near and also far downwind of active volcanoes to document the size distributions and content of the ash.  This information can be used to improve satellite retrievals and in numerical models to simulate the dispersion of volcanic ash after an eruption, resulting in a better definition of boundary conditions for safe air travel.  When installed on a small UAS, the new miniature sensor also has potential for exploring several different types of atmospheric conditions of interest to NASA.  Burning biomass creates extensive plumes of ash and aerosols that affect the earth's radiation budget and hydrological cycles; both of these disciplines have been the subject of intense field campaigns conducted by NASA.   Small UAS with the new sensor package will also be very valuable for investigating cloud microphysics in inaccessible locations, such as ice fog in Polar Regions in the winter, both in the Arctic and in Antarctica.","Analysis of data collected in volcanic ash plumes with small UAS will be used by airline companies to determine a risk management matrix that will define parameters for safe air travel.  After an actual volcanic eruption, UAS with sensors will be deployed to measure size distributions and composition to determine where jet airliners can safely operate.  Eventually it is anticipated that these in situ measurements will improve satellite retrievals and numerical models to the extent that routine UAS flights will not be required.  Jet engine manufacturers will use data collected with the new sensor in volcanic ash plumes to determine appropriate levels of ash to inject into jet engines in test cells.  Analysis of the effects of the volcanic ash on engine performance will be used to improve engine resistance to damage and to guide pilots on how to better manage damaged engines.  The new miniature sensor will also find new applications in the measurement of ash plumes from forest fires and biomass burning.","Aerodynamics; Air Transportation & Safety; Attitude Determination & Control; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); GPS/Radiometric (see also Sensors); Image Analysis; Image Capture (Stills/Motion); Image Processing; Inertial (see also Sensors); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Materials & Structures (including Optoelectronics); Navigation & Guidance; Prototyping"

The technology will first be demonstrated using the relatively simple analytical approach for measuring nitride.  In a subsequent phase we will adapt the instrument to measure ammonium and phosphate.  Our device will be designed to be inexpensive and will operate autonomously on oceanographic platforms, such as moored buoys, underwater gliders, autonomous vehicles, or underway sampling devices on ships.  It will be designed to monitor range of concentrations (nanomolar to micromolar), and will operate unattended for weeks.  It will be extremely robust, use very low volumes of reagents and power consumption will be minimized.  Monolithic in nature, fabrication costs will be low, permitting global deployment of numerous field units and enhancing NASA?s Earth science research capabilities.   The key advancement is the integration of two analytical chambers in a single glass monolith, with each chamber optimized for a given concentration range. One of the chambers will have a very long pathlength to enable the development of autonomous wet chemistry analyzers for open ocean applications using a variety of platforms and vehicles.","The NASA Earth science program needs nutrient monitoring sensors (Topic S1.08).We will develop a submersible, inexpensive microfluidic inorganic nutrient analyzer for coastal and oceanic waters.  The low fabrication cost of the proposed robust optical analyzer will allow for its global deployment, thus enhancing NASA?s research capabilities.  Our nutrient analyzer will be designed to be deployed from a variety of stationary or mobile oceanographic platforms.The key advancements of our design are its extreme mechanical and optical robustness, and its ability to detect low (nanomolar) concentrations of analytes using colorimetric approaches.  The robustness will be obtained by integrating all key elements in a glass monolith; and the sensibility will be reached by increasing the flowcell absorption pathlength, making it several orders of magnitude longer than that found on standard microfluidic devices.  These advancements will enable the development of autonomous wet chemistry analyzers for open ocean applications using a variety of platforms and vehicles. We will initially monitor nitrites. Later on this will be extended to other nutrients such as ammonium and phosphate.","The concentration of inorganic nutrients in aquatic environments is a fundamental water quality parameter needed for environmental assessment, ecological sciences, and ecosystem stewardship activities.  There are growing needs for field-deployable nutrient analyzers designed to monitor nitrogen or phosphorus without the need for manual sample collection or manual attention to the instrument during operation.  These needs are poorly addressed by the available commercial instruments owing to their complexity, large physical size, high power consumption and excessive reagent usage.  Translume anticipates our nutrient analyzers will be of interest to two groups: (a) Researchers in organizations needing robust nutrient analyzers for oceanographic/ life science / and seawater research.  NOAA, the Navy, watershed monitoring agencies and the makers of research gliders are potential users.  There are also major opportunities associated with developments to pursue the use of algae as a biofuel source.  This emerging industry will need a means to optimize algae growth, which could be served by a variant of our nutrient analyzers. (b) Regulatory agencies and regulated industries.

A better understanding on the distribution of ozone and its influences on cloud droplet formation is needed in order to better predict the radiation balance of the Earth in climate modeling studies.  New instrumentation to provide sensitive, high throughput airborne measurement of ozone and other aerosol precursor gases is required to provide the necessary inputs in developing and refining accurate models of climate change.In this program, a resonant cavity optical sensor, using readily available components, will provide a significant advance in the development of  high sensitivity instrumentation for airborne measurement of ozone or other gases important in climate change, where high throughput is critical for spatial resolution. Incoherent broad band cavity enhanced spectroscopy will be employed using UV LEDs to directly detect ozone.  This configuration will allow for high sensitivity, a small foot print and high throughput, unlike conventional ozone monitors which use a long single pass absorption cell and filtered mercury lamps.","NASA benefits include the availability of rugged, low cost, airborne compatible instruments for the rapid and precise measurements of important gases such as ozone that will improve our knowledge for predicting and modeling atmospheric dynamics and climate change.

To produce ultracold-atom-based devices (e.g. inertial sensors, magnetometers, clocks, etc.) that can compete with existing technologies, higher fluxes and/or faster production rates will be needed over current state-of-the-art techniques. In this Phase I work effort, ColdQuanta will address this need for greater fluxes by investigating two approaches toward developing high-flux compact BEC-producing systems. The first approach targets systems that utilize ColdQuanta's RuBECi vacuum cell and its proven success at the heart of the world's smallest, fastest-producing, ultracold atom systems. Using numerical optimization, we will improve the speed and efficiency (i.e. reduce atom loss) of several key production steps, including faster trap loading from a cold-atom source and more efficient atom transfer between magnetic traps.In the second, higher payoff approach, we will investigate implementation of assembly-line production of BECs using vacuum cell construction that allows each stage of production to occur simultaneously throughout a series of interconnected vacuum chambers. The resulting system would create ultracold atoms quasi-continuously and increase production rates by virtually eliminating dead time between sequential operating cycles.","The ultracold matter system developed in this work has the potential to dramatically enhance NASA's capabilities in numerous areas. These include:Inertial Sensing – compared to their light-based counterparts (e.g. fiber-optic and ring-laser gyros), ultracold-atom gyroscopes offer a phenomenal eleven orders of magnitude greater sensitivity to rotation, for equal geometries and particle fluxes.  Similar improvements in accelerometry and gravimetry are also possible.Timekeeping – freezing the motion of atoms significantly improves accuracy, so much so that the next generation of state-of-the-art atomic clocks (with accuracies approaching 1 part in 1018) will rely on ultracold trapped atoms.Field Sensing – cold and ultracold atoms offer greater sensitivities for magnetic-field sensing compared to SQUIDs and other technologies.","In addition to applications relevant to NASA, the ultracold matter system developed in this work has other commercial applications. These include:Quantum Emulating – trapped, ultracold atoms form a pristine, defect-free system that is ideal for studying condensed matter systems, simulating multibody quantum systems, and implementing quantum computers and quantum information algorithms.Atomtronics – Precise control of ultracold atoms allows them to be engineered into useful devices that rely on the flow of coherent particles (as opposed to incoherent particles, as is the case in electricity).","Electromagnetic; Inertial (see also Sensors); Interferometric (see also Analysis); Navigation & Guidance; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z)"

Such a ""swarm of femto-satellites"" can complete complex tasks that are difficult or impossible for large single satellites to achieve. Swarm state estimation can be achieved using the available GPS measurements, and local range and bearing measurements between the satellites. Due to the large size of the swarms and processing constraints on-board each femto-satellite, distributed estimation algorithms are necessary for successful implementation of estimation algorithms.  However, measurements of range and bearing are nonlinear and couple the states of neighboring satellites, hence requiring nonlinear filtering algorithms that complicate the process of decentralizing the estimator. The objective of this project is to determine efficient estimator architectures and algorithms for distributed state estimation of femtosat swarms in LEO. SSCI has designed estimators and performed trade studies for unbounded swarms in deep-space as part of a DARPA study at NASA JPL. The proposed Phase-I project extends our previous works to state estimation for bounded swarms in LEO where swarm dynamics are nonlinear.","Swarms of femto-satellites in LEO and GEO have many potentials for NASA applications. Swarms of femto-satellites could provide global real-time space weather monitoring in a way that is presently not possible from a single satellite. A swarm of satellites in orbit can provide a survey of the geomagnetic field and its temporal evolution, and gain new insights into improving our knowledge of the Earth's interior and climate. This will be a great improvement on the current method of extrapolation based on statistics and ground observations. Other applications of femto-sat swarms could be on-orbit visual inspection of larger spacecraft to provide rapid feedback capability for decision making, and protection of large satellites of critical importance.","Due to having lower costs of development and launch, commercial applications of femto-sat swarms such as remote sensing, on-orbit service, and sparse aperture imaging are viable.

The GSFC team noted that nanotube arrays have the ""potential to provide order-of-magnitude improvement over current surface treatments and a resulting factor of 10,000 reduction in stray light when applied to an entire optical train."" While excellent performers, NanoLab recognizes that the nuances of the array structure, such as angular alignment, diameter, length, and top-surface roughness of the array play a major role in their optical properties, and these need to be characterized if we wish to control and tailor these materials for specific applications.  Further, the arrays grown to date are often poorly adhered to their substrates, which are typically silicon.

Space-based telescopes have become indispensible in advancing the frontiers of astrophysics. Over the past decade NASA has pioneered coronagraphic instrument concepts and test beds to provide a foundation for exploring feasibility of new approaches to high-contrast imaging and spectroscopy. From this work, NASA has identified a current technology need for compact, ultra-precise, multi-thousand actuator DM devices. Boston Micromachines Corporation has developed microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) DMs that represents the state-of-the-art for scalable, small-stroke high-precision wavefront control.

These DMs can be currently produced with uncorrectable shape errors as small as 10nm root mean square (rms). These residual shape errors on the DM are mostly periodic and act essentially as a grating, producing diffraction spikes in the image plane. In the proposed project, we will develop processes and manufacturing innovations that collectively reduce or eliminate these shape errors through improved chemo-mechanical polishing, stress compensation film deposition, and elimination of etch access holes, resulting in a MEMS DM with unprecedented surface quality.","There are many applications relative to NASA where there is a need for deformable mirrors with improved surface finish and quality over the current state-of-the-art.

The nanofiber based ripstop reinforcement will enhance membrane tear resistance providing protection against membrane damage during deployment or after micro-meteorite impact.  Earlier ripstop research work performed under the NASA CETDP yielded a 50X increase in CP-1 membrane tear resistance and a mass increase of less than 5% for a 0.3 mil film.  This low mass technology will provide these tear resistance gains while packaged into the existing launch volume or enable thinner films to be substituted with lower mass and equivalent tear resistance.  A 2 mil thick Kapton film used for JWST can be replaced by a 0.3 mil ripstop reinforced CP-1 film and provide 2X improved tear resistance, but at only 15% of the 2 mil Kapton weight and volume.  PSI is teamed with NeXolve Corporation to develop pilot scale (0.5 meter width) ripstop reinforcement equipment, basic Finite Element Models of the thermal, dynamic and structural influences of ripstop reinforcement, and confirm these models with fabricated and characterized reinforced CP-1 films.  PSI will mature the ripstop technology so that it can be used to fabricate 5 meter sunshields during a Phase II program and provide a path to 16 m class or greater, lightweight, ambient or cryogenic flight-qualified observatory systems.

In addition, PSI has demonstrated the use of patterned electrospinning to correct optical aberrations for inflatable membrane optics.  Other space applications include reinforcement for membrane systems including nanofiber filters, barrier membranes and gas diffusion electrodes.  We are working with NeXolve, manufacturers of space durable films, on the proposed program.  The electrospinning reinforcement could be incorporated into NeXolve's film casting line.  NeXolve's may provide a customer for the electrospinning process as a value added technology for their space film business.","Many non-commercial uses of membrane technology could benefit from the nanofiber reinforcement provided by the electropun ripstop process.  Separator membranes for batteries could be made thinner, while maintaining robustness and resistance to electrode shorting using electrospun reinforcement.  Filters made of nanofibers, such as HEPA filters, would have high mechanical strength and lower pressure drop through the use of nanofiber ripstop.  Other applications for electropsun reinforcement may include barrier membranes for chemical agents, enhanced robustness for gas separation membranes, and improved thermal film insulation.

The UFF removes residual grinding sub-surface damage, mid spatial frequency errors, and provides the mechanism required for surface corrections. OptiPro's technologically advanced optical manufacturing capabilities along with a support partnership with the University of Rochester Mechanical Engineering Department and the Penn State EOC, gives us a very strong team and a clear path towards solving the difficult problems associated with, grinding, polishing and metrology of large complex optical surfaces.The UFF, with its 5 axis of motion provides a platform to polish traditional flats and spheres as well as aspheres and freeform shapes.

This makes the UFF suitable for polishing a wide variety of materials for other segmented types of telescope systems such as the Advanced Technology Large Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST).  The wide variety of loose and bound abrasives allows the UltraForm platform to finish hard ceramics, Silicon and SiC.  With these hard to process materials, the UFF has shown promise for grinding as well as polishing optical surfaces, on a small scale.","Since 1989 OptiPro has developed and refined conceptual technologies into robust deterministic machines and processes for the optical fabrication industry.  Non-NASA commercial applications include the fabrication of flats, spheres, aspheres, and complex conformal shapes such as aerodynamic ogive domes. Commercialization of these technologies has driven very cost effective solutions.  The UFF polishing tools' ability to polish a variety of materials from the ground state, removing grinding marks and subsurface damage, makes it especially attractive for applications where mid-spatial-frequency surface errors are an issue such as EUV lithography. Another application is for laser amplifiers, such as the Inertial Confinement Fusion National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the Laboratory for Laser Energetics, at the University of Rochester. For these types of applications, laser damage threshold and irradiance distribution are critical and therefore mid-spatial frequency errors need to be minimized after the polishing stage.",Adaptive Optics; Ceramics; Composites; In Situ Manufacturing; Lenses; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Metallics; Mirrors; Optical; Processing Methods

We plan to fully integrate a Laser Radar scanning head inside a thermal-vacuum chamber for operation in cryogenic and high vacuum conditions. Once a scanning head can function in this environment, the next development is a multi-headed scanning system inside a chamber controlled by one Laser Radar body outside the chamber. This system can potentially obtain better than five micron uncertainties with these innovations. Other instruments will also be targeted for facility integration; thermal imaging instruments, optical performance instrumentation and other alignment/metrology instruments that complement the Laser Radar.This innovation provides NASA and the Aerospace Community increased capabilities for the alignment and performance verification of telescope optical surfaces and telescope optical assemblies.  A key feature is that the metrology system is integrated inside the chamber providing micron-level uncertainties across large distances and of complex shapes. With the metrology system inside the chamber, the environment will be considerably easier to control and Flight Hardware can be verified in a more accurate setting (cold, vacuum, dark) than a chamber with windows and other environment-compromising heat and light leaks.","NASA Commercial applications include next-generation Cryogenic Telescopes (JWST, WFIRST) and future Lunar and deep space Missions. There will be many lander, rover, and, eventually manned missions to explore the ices at the Lunar poles in the coming decades. Technology must be developed to build and test these complex, dynamic systems that must comfortably operate as low as 25K (Hermite Crater on the Moon). We believe that these techniques will be a critical enabling technology for these challenging and exciting missions.  This innovation will also open the door for smaller, low-budget projects to take advantage of this risk-reducing metrology system. The modularity of the system will allow entire small and nano-satellites to be completely surveyed for alignment verification purposes throughout the integration process.","Measuring the large scale setup and configuration of manufacturing systems at the micron level at a distance without interfering with the system will be a very valuable capability. The analytical and engineering techniques developed in Phase one and two of this proposal will allow measuring devices to peer into harsh or toxic environments such as hermetically-sealed beryllium machining centers. There are also many harsh and toxic environments in nuclear facilities, aerospace manufacturing and electronics manufacturing processes that require the precise, non-contact measurement and control of large scale systems.","3D Imaging; Actuators & Motors; Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Image Analysis; Interferometric (see also Analysis); Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation)"

A particular example is the X-ray telescope where primary and secondary mirrors have nearly cylindrical surfaces. Computer Generated Holograms (CGH), in combination with commercial interferometers, provide high resolution and high accuracy measurements of aspheric optical surfaces. The current state of the art CGHs are made on 6"" square substrates such as those for testing the primary segments of James Webb Space Telescope. However, larger CGHs are always desired. A larger CGH enables testing of correspondingly larger convex and nearly cylindrical concave surfaces in one shot; studies have shown that larger CGHs also offer better imaging of the surface under test, which improves the CGH null test system's Instrument Transfer Function, an equivalent metric to an imaging system's Modulation Transfer Function. Furthermore, pursuit of improving CGH test accuracy never ends. The fundamental limiting factor is quality of the substrate. The current state of the art technology is still unable to fabricate general CGHs of arbitrary symmetry on high quality custom substrates.Arizona Optical Metrology LLC (AOM) proposes to address these problems. We propose to work with our collaborators at the ebeam facility of Jet Propulsion Laboratory of NASA to write large CGHs on high quality substrates. We anticipate the writing has reasonable yet non-negligible errors which cause errors in the aspheric wavefront the CGH produces. The wavefront error must be calibrated in order to meet the demanding accuracy requirement of precision aspheric surface metrology. We propose to develop a technology that enables accurate calibration of the writing error, such that the CGH still measures an aspheric surface to an excellent accuracy of a couple of nm rms. The goal of phase 1 is to develop the software tools for calibrating the CGH writing error, and fabricate a couple of 9 inch diameter CGHs to experimentally validate the technology.","All large aspheric optical surfaces to be launched into space can benefit from accurate metrology with large CGHs. In particular, the thin shell mirrors for the X-ray telescopes, fabricated with a slumping process, can be measured with large CGHs to high accuracy, so can the mandrels for making these mirrors. The JWST primary segments, already measured with 6"" CGHs, could be better tested with larger CGHs as well.","Large aspheric surfaces used in ground based telescopes, the lithographic lenses, the Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) lithography systems, as well as the large format aerial photography cameras will be better tested with large CGHs.",Gratings; Lenses; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Mirrors; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics)

The low cost, high performance customization of the structured ASIC portion of the chip is made possible by the 1-D 45 nm Mask-Lite process technology. The chip architecture is optimized for sensor data handling applications in space and the design process provides for a short development schedule. The architecture provides a hard macro microcontroller core with via-ROM program memory, SRAM data memory, CPU support logic, an appropriate set of analog functions, and a structured ASIC section for application specific functionality. A rad-hard by design logic cell library is provided for the structured ASIC area of the die along with a number of pre-compiled macro functions such as timers and serial I/O to reduce development time. The 1-D Mask-Lite process provides a dramatic reduction in the mask cost, allowing lower volume designs to gain access to 45 nm technology, and provides performance improvement over conventional via mask structured ASIC technologies by eliminating metal layer stubs. Standard logic design, verification and layout EDA tools are used to complete a chip design. The fixed microcontroller platform portion of the chip is implemented with optimized standard cells rather than the structured ASIC logic cells, resulting in standard ASIC performance levels for the core logic.","Implemented with 45 nm 1-D Mask Lite radiation hardened standard cells, the proposed chip architecture is optimized for sensor data handling and actuator control applications in space or near-space environments. The hard macro analog and processor functions of the chip provide high performace processing comparable to a custom ASIC at a fraction of the cost, thereby supporting low volume designs which are processor based but need a significant level of custom logic to meet the mission needs. Built in analog and digital functions will provide for A/D conversion of analog inputs, standard serial interfaces to compatible sensors, SpaceWire interface to the intra-satellite network and actuator control support such as a multi-channel Pulse Width Modulation Timer. Exampe sensors would be velocity or position monitors, environmental sensors and imaging sensors. Actuator control is supported by circuits such as a multi-channel Pulse Width Modulated output Timer. Data processing is supported by a CPU with via ROM program memory for application specific code as well as the user customized structured ASIC logic which is ideal for implementing digital filters.","The proposed architecture implemented with non rad-hard standard cell libraries is optimal for low to medium volume processor based designs which require some custom logic and need the performance achievable in a 45 nm technology but do not have the volumes to justify the cost of a full custom ASIC. Verifying prototype or first generation designs before committing to a custom ASIC for high volume production is one market segment for this chip architecture and technology. Another is low to medium volume applications for sensor data processing and/or actuator control such as in industrial control and monitoring, medical equipment, and communication systems.

Arrays of these ELO solar cells are first interconnected and then laminated to a flexible Tedlar backsheet.  Thin coverglass protecting the cell from space environments is then applied onto the top of each cell and secured with space-grade encapsulants.  High volume pick and place tooling from the semiconductor wafer industry can be applied to this assembly process to realize substantial cost reduction in the assembly of these solar cell modules.  The resulting modular high efficiency photovoltaic blankets can readily be used as a drop-in replacement for current solar cells mounted on solar panels.  Since the photovoltaic blanket is composed of several solar cells pre-assembled into an array format, the assembly process is streamlined where arrays of multiple cells are now placed down during panel assembly.  Since MicroLink's IMM ELO solar cells are flexible, the resulting solar array module is also flexible and can be readily applied and conformed to flat and curved surfaces on a spacecraft.  With this flexible module approach, large solar array concepts having high specific powers and improved stowage capabilities can be achieved.

In Phase I, we will design the thruster, focusing on achieving a magnetic field that shields the discharge channel from ion induced erosion.  Our goal is to achieve a propellant throughput of at least 100 kg per kW of input power and a system specific mass of 6 kg per kW.  Numerical modeling will play an important role in the thruster design to achieve these lifetime targets.  Erosion predictions will be validated by comparing model results to measurements taken in a nominal 600 W thruster during an accelerated lifetime test scheduled take place in 2011 at NASA GRC under separate funding.  In Phase II, we build and test a laboratory model thruster capturing the essential magnetic field criteria.  The performance, lifetime, and plume properties of the thruster will then be evaluated, and the design will be optimized.  Our goal is to reach TRL 5 by the end of Phase II.The complete flight system built in Phase III will include a high power thruster, a hollow cathode, and a propellant feed system.  However, the focus of this program will be the thruster.","The proposed system has many applications both as a stand-alone system and as part of a much larger (higher power) cluster.On its own, the thruster will be well suited for orbit raising and interplanetary transfers, supporting exploration and science missions.  The demonstrated throttling ability is important for a singular thruster that might be called upon to propel a spacecraft from Earth to Mars or Venus.  Mars orbits at 1.52 AU, which reduces the solar constant to 43% of the value at Earth.  Venus orbits at 0.72 AU, which increases the solar constant to 190% of the value at Earth.  As a result the output power of a nominal 600 W array varies between 260 W and 1.15 kW as a spacecraft travels between these planets. The ability to throttle efficiently is even more important for missions beyond Mars. The thruster may also be used for orbit raising and circularization (including GTO to GEO transfers) and inclination changes.  In GEO, the thruster may be used for station-keeping and repositioning.On its own, the thruster is well sized for primary propulsion on ESPA-sized spacecraft (~180 kg).  Clustered, the thruster will support larger, higher power spacecraft and systems, such as a small electric upper stage.","Commercial applications for the proposed system include orbit raising, circularization, inclination changes, repositioning, and station-keeping.

The technology to be developed can be used in virtually any NASA flight mission because the igniters can be used with hydrazine or higher performance advanced monopropellants (e.g. ADN and AF-315E). Using AF-315E monopropellant can increase specific impulse relative to hydrazine and deliver higher performance, reduce cost, and increase flexibility beyond that of NTO/MMH.","The proposed ignition system can be used in attitude control and apogee engines for commercial and government satellites and divert and attitude control system engines for kinetic kill vehicles. The use of toxic propellants such as hydrazine will be eliminated in gas generators on military aircraft and fuel pressurization systems for tactical missiles. Potential military space applications for the foam igniter system are orbit transfer, maneuvering, station keeping, and attitude control for satellites. Any agency with satellites employing hydrazine propulsion will benefit. Promising near-term defense applications are divert and attitude control systems for kinetic energy interceptors, gas generators for auxiliary power units and tank pressurization systems, and liquid gun propellant systems.",Ceramics; Composites; Exciters/Igniters; Fuels/Propellants; Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Metallics; Processing Methods; Spacecraft Main Engine

A serious limitation of existing catalysts in the ignition of advanced monopropellants is limited thermal stability.  The recent emphasis on improved performance of  monopropellant technology (e.g., with AF M315E and LGP 1846), has led to the need for advanced materials possessing exceptional properties.  Increased specific impulse monopropellants will require ignition catalysts possessing exceptional thermal stability and ruggedness: Existing alumina supported iridium catalysts do not possess these characteristics.  This proposed SBIR Phase I will be addressed to the further development of thermally stable high temperature ignition catalysts, optimization of their mechanical strength and erosion resistance, and employment in small propulsion devices.  Eltron previously identified a catalyst which displayed activity comparable to alumina supported iridium (Shell 405) but which tolerates temperatures in excess of at least 1900 degrees C, is markedly less dense, is precious metals-free, and is much less expensive.  Phase II will optimize the catalyst, demonstrate activity and ruggedness with a number of monopropellant systems, scale up catalyst preparation, and conduct test firings with the catalyst system.","Phase I will result in the identification of rugged and thermally stable catalysts and catalyst operating and use specifications for the ignition of advanced monopropellants.  The technology developed will find use in the ignition of advanced monopropellants in high specific impulse applications. Use in reaction control systems is expected.  Additional uses in liquid gas generators, auxiliary power units (APUs), emergency power units (EPUs), and refractory linings can be envisioned.","Applications in military and commercial monopropellant systems are anticipated.  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL, )Northrop-Grumman, and Aerojet have previously  expressed strong interest in catalysts under development.  In addition, applications are expected in combustion and incineration; catalytic coatings in gas turbines, ovens, furnaces, gasifiers, reformers, and other platforms; thermal barrier coatings; catalytic NOx traps; and  coatings on heating and incandescent elements.  Companies involved in manufacturing catalysts and propulsion systems as well as those concerned with catalytic combustion or incineration, explosives, ceramic coatings, and emissions control would find interest in the materials being developed.",Fuels/Propellants; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices

Both of these applications require advanced controls to react to unpredictable circumstances when human intervention is not possible or practical. The Phase I effort will focus on model development, model verification and validation, and applying model reduction and/or averaging and advanced simulation techniques to achieve a real-time system simulation. This will set the stage for the development of advanced power management and distribution controls. In particular, the possibility of embedding a real-time simulation into a control infrastructure, providing contingency analysis and look-ahead prediction of the results of control actions, could be investigated.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)Model-based design of power management and distribution controls is specifically targeted at deep space autonomous systems (such as Radioisotope Power Systems) in this proposal.

One of the several advances it introduces is to eliminate the number one problem of electronics failure in space environment – ""latch-up"".  The new technology would entirely eliminate all sources of 'latch-up"" events, thereby drastically reducing space electronics risk.  The new technology of 'solid-state ceramic' voltage level shifters further integrates wideband gap power switches as part of a radical new design approach that improves electronics performance over a wide operational (thermal, loads) with drastically improved radiation tolerance over what is presently available.  The emphasis will be on a whole new form of space electronics PMAD that enable very (extremely) high levels temperature/radiation tolerance for a wide range of missions including Heliophysic Solar Terrestrial Probe (STP), Europa, Venus missions and future Small Explorer (SMEX) missions  that are previously unobtainable.  Its unique capabilities of voiding need for digital processors combined with its immense immunity from EMI/RFI make this technology an ideal space power electronics solution for Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) Missions.  Because of its unique nature of complete elimination of any form of control, filtering and measurement subsystems the new technology substantially reduce system risk and increase autonomy. Its unique design, materials and operation eliminate need of any processors, core magnetics and software; thereby eliminating almost all the causes of system failure in high radiation exposure environments.  Because it is based on ceramics and has no processor or core magnetic components, the new technology can be designed to safely operate from cryogenic to very high temperature ambient conditions.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)There is obvious application needs in several key Heliophysic and deep space missions that will encounter high thermal/radiation conditions.  In addition to mission spacecraft the new technology will be directly applicable in a number of science applications payloads – both deployed and released.  The power electronic subsystems are critical to both spacecraft and payload operations n these environments.  Scaled down, these devices can be applied to SmallSat requirements and on space platform equipment such as particle measurement, solar observation, etc. Our commercial strategy is to initially develop for NASA needs in Heliosphere exploration and deep space missions and use this as a baseline to address a range of other mission needs. NASA specific needs include future science payload development initiatives for which this technology could be applied include and improve chances of selection include: Io Observer New Frontiers Mission; Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO) flagship mission; Venus surface missions; and exploration of the dark lunar polar craters.

This unprecedented improvement in star tracker accuracy is achieved by tracking a single, bright guide star in the deep ultraviolet to soft x-ray bands (1 eV to 10 keV) using a differential measurement of guide star offset angle.  The overall field-of-view of the Milli-arcsecond X-ray Star Tracker (MXST) will be limited to a fraction of a degree square with the highest accuracies achieved when the guide star is aligned with the star tracker boresight.  This allows a simple, differential measurement to be made of the guide star location relative to the spacecraft coordinate system.  By observing guide stars at high energy (short wavelength), the compact star tracker can achieve diffraction limited performance of one milli-arcsecond in a small, compact package.","The MXST will provide an unprecedented precision attitude reference for new NASA missions.  This novel instrument will enable new missions by providing milli-arcsecond level attitude knowledge for applications such as:? Missions using clusters of spacecraft to create long baseline, sparse array apertures for probing the universe with increasingly high spatial resolution.  The spacecraft in these clusters will require extremely accurate pointing control to the target of interest.? Planetary missions using laser communications where precise pointing of the laser beam over long distances is necessary? Extra-solar planet finder missions where ultra-precise position knowledge and stability are required, particularly where a coronograph is employed.? Space Weather Missions?

Laser Communication (Laser Com) terminals are necessary to handle the demand. Additionally, nano class satellites have emerged as desirable platforms due to their low cost, shorter build, and multitude of available launch configurations.Honeybee Robotics Spacecraft Mechanisms Corp. proposes to develop a LaserCom terminal for a small satellite. We will focus the effort within the constraints of a 6U CubeSat. The Phase 1 effort will define a lasercom system architecture which satisfies the challenging packaging and resource constraints evident with nanosatellites. We will leverage our nano-sat based attitude control actuator technology (TORC) to ameliorate packaging challenges for the pointing mechanisms. Analysis and simulation of the optical subsystem will enable design and down-selection of components to a system which can provide the necessary line-of-sight stability and link margin to maintain a 2Gb/sec link with less than 10-6 BER. A prototype fine pointing mechanism will be built and tested to demonstrate proof-of-concept of a miniaturized pointing subsystem. Ultimately a lasercom system will be defined to be built in Phase II to arrive at a minimum TRL6 during the Phase 2 effort.","Over the next decade and half, NASA bandwidth needs are expected to rise dramatically due to high data volume missions such as hyperspectral and SAR Earth and Mars observation missions, multiple coordinated complex robotic missions to Mars, NEO's and possibly the Moon, Mars Sample Return and Outer Planets flagship mission, Earth Sensor Web, etc.High data rate communication with inexpensive spacecraft offers enhanced data collection and information exchange within a constellation of small satellites as well as reduced size, weight, and power for deep space science platforms. Smaller, cheaper spacecraft will enable NASA to meet the agency's science goals even with austere budgets. A small satellite capable of transmitting data at Gb/sec rates offers the science community an opportunity to launch smaller, cheaper spacecraft more often. A constellation of cross-linked satellites could monitor weather, ocean temperatures & salinity, and the polar ice caps. Deep space missions would no longer be $500M+ missions. Small satellites capable of collecting and returning large amounts of data could be deployed to Near Earth Objects, Mars, and even the outer planets and their moons. Imagers and remote sensing instruments are actively being miniaturized in response to the Nanosat revolution. The opportunities for a small satellite lasercom terminal within NASA are vast.","The commercial in-flight broadband market is undergoing a remarkable increase with an increase of plane deployments from 25 units in 2008 to 2000 units in 2010 as reported by www.marketresearch.com. This sector is expected to grow well beyond $1 billion annually by 2012.Worldwide, military organizations are in the process of transforming into network-centric, information-based forces. New requirements are re-defining the need and use of communications. Innovations are shaped by new operational concepts and weapon and sensor trends. In the new paradigm, communication is not only an enabler but is directly affecting the outcomes of wars. Tactical use of MILSATCOM play a pivotal role in providing the interoperable, robust, ""network-centric"" communications needed for future operations.Based on historical data and market projections, Honeybee conservatively estimates that the combined commercial and military market for optical communication enabled nano, micro, and small satellites is worth on the order of $250-400 million over the next 10 years.

The proposed effort will result in a navigational technique that can precisely determine the positions of nanosatellite sensor nodes in the array. The proposed innovation enables higher performance and low cost sensor array development, while fitting within the size constraints, limited communication ability, and operational duty cycles of nanosatellites.The technique presented depends on echo time measurement between a satellite and its neighbors. That is, the satellite generates a RF signal that is received by its neighbors and echoed back. Differential measurements are taken to subtract out delays introduced by the propagating hardware. The distances between pairs of neighboring satellites can then be combined with bearing and orientation information to precisely map the spatial arrangement of the satellite array. Combined with bearing and orientation measurements, this technique solves the precise position determination (PPD) problem using nanosatellites; that is, position determination within the sensor array with accuracy suitable for synthetic aperture formation.",Synthetic apertures as used in radio astronomy and magnetometry are of interest to the scientific community.

This new spacecraft, called Hummingbird, is based on an all-composite, unibody structure in which the propellant tank is the structure.  The first payload would be the 2.9 kg, 9.25-inch aperture diffraction-limited telescope built by ITT.  Space-qualified 1-lbf thrusters from AeroJet weighing 8.7 gm each provide both orbit control and very rapid attitude maneuvers.  The current NanoEye spacecraft has over 2.5 km/sec of delta-V, although delta-V can be increased considerably.  The wet mass of the spacecraft is about 80 kg in its present configuration.  The spacecraft uses CubeSat components, which are evolving rapidly to become more robust and capable.  Multiple Hummingbirds can work together as a system and also provide robustness against system failures.  Updates with new equipment can be introduced 3 to 10 times quicker than with traditional space systems, allowing responsive mission implementation at a cost and time scale not possible with traditional space missions.","By both dramatically reducing spacecraft cost and size, along with development schedule, the proposed Hummingbird spacecraft provides the opportunity to meet multiple Earth science and solar system exploration mission needs. Missions being considered for the Hummingbird spacecraft, constellations, or clusters include GPS Radio Occultation (GPSRO), Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS), Global Atmospheric Composition Mission (GACM), Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE-II), Comet Surface Sample Return (CSSR), Trojan Tour and Rendezvous (TTR), and Lunar Geophysical Network (LGN). All of these missions could benefit by having constellations of satellites, satellites able to orbit at much lower altitudes, or a combination of the two. For example, the GPSRO mission could significantly increase the number of satellites in the constellation from the 6 currently being planned and still end up with an overall mission cost much less than the planned $150M. The CSSR, TTR, and LGN missions all would benefit from the very large delta-V capability that is inherent in the current NanoEye spacecraft that can be modified to accommodate the different needs of these 3 missions, which is especially easy relative to adding delta-V capability at low non-recurring cost.","The principal non-NASA Hummingbird application is for military missions, with additional applications for weather monitoring, disaster monitoring and news photography, that provides rapid revisit opportunities and real-time or near real time viewing of the Earth's surface through the use of Hummingbird constellations, in particular. Weather monitoring represents a major application area that could benefit greatly from the low cost aspect of Hummingbird that would allow large constellations of spacecraft focused on data collection of selected latitude ranges of interest.  Approximately 30 satellites would provide repeat coverage of selected regions approximately every 10 minutes 24 hours per day, seven days per week, and both during the day and at night. In addition, even when not over a specific area of interest, weather data could still be collected for use by others.","Actuators & Motors; Aerobraking/Aerocapture; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Attitude Determination & Control; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Composites; Deployment; Fuels/Propellants; GPS/Radiometric (see also Sensors); Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Image Capture (Stills/Motion); Image Processing; Inertial (see also Sensors); Infrared; Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Mirrors; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Navigation & Guidance; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Project Management; Prototyping; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Simulation & Modeling; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Structures; Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Telescope Arrays; Visible"

This will be accomplished by comparing the range, range-rate or angle measurements predicted by GPS-based navigation solutions to the actual measurements obtained from the communication system. By monitoring these parity equations and the innovations of the GPS filters, FDIR can be significantly improved. These parity relations between redundant range measurements create a more sensitive residual than filter-based residuals because most filters naturally mask the faults. Recovery to GPS failure can be accomplished by relying on the comm measurements themselves to maintain relative state observability. Attempted recovery of GPS or other strategies can then be implemented without requiring the cluster to disperse. By building off of Carrier-phase Differential GPS (CDGPS) navigation filters and cluster flight simulations currently being built by Emergent under its DARPA System F6 contract, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of this FDIR technique in simulation.","As GPS/CDGPS is the state of the art in absolute and relative navigation, it is anticipated that many missions involving cooperative rendezvous or docking will implement it. The proposed FDIR system has the potential to significantly improve the robustness and survivability of these spacecraft in the face of GPS failure or interruption.  Thus the proposed FDIR method would benefit missions as basic as commercial manned spacecraft docking with ISS or commercial space stations or as advanced as missions where small spacecraft work collaboratively to create sparse arrays, synthetic apertures, or other distributed sensors networks.  Other applications include spacecraft that are used to assemble large space structures, such as a manned mission where the Orion MPCV docks with another Orion MPCV or other spacecraft like the Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle or Deep Space Habitat. Finally, the technology stands to benefit cooperative satellite servicing missions.","The technologies developed in this project will be integrated into our work for DARPA's System F6 project.  This work is focused on the guidance, navigation and control software necessary to support cluster flight.  Many of the wireless communication systems being proposed for F6 produce range and range-rate measurements, and the navigation system will likely be GPS based, making it an ideal platform the proposed FDIR system.  It can also be used to support other DoD or commercial multi-satellite missions that involve cluster flight, orbital rendezvous or even docking. It is anticipated that in a few years commercial manned spacecraft will dock with the ISS or other commercial space stations.  Commercial systems are especially sensitive to size, weight, power, and cost and will benefit from the proposed FDIR enhancements when building rendezvous capable vehicles at any scale.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Navigation & Guidance; Recovery (see also Vehicle Health Management); Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)"

It is possible to have better tool control if the robotic arm could report loads experienced by the tooling.ATI Industrial Automation proposes to develop and prove technologies to be used in a low weight, low outgassing multi-axis force and torque transducer that can be used at cryogenic temperatures. The transducer will require strain gage excitation electrical power and output strain gage level voltage signals. These signals can be digitized and then mathematically transformed into values that represent the transducer's loads as forces in the X, Y, and Z axes and torques about the X, Y, and Z axes.The primary goal of this phase I proposal is to develop, produce, and characterize a proof of concept strain-sensing beam that can survive the harsh environments expected to be encountered on a Mars lander mission.

Further, these ""small solar system bodies"" are thought to have served as the mechanisms that brought water to the Earth and, possibly, the organic molecules that served as the building blocks of life.  To help uncover the secrets these bodies hold, NASA has prioritized exploration missions to study the surfaces of near earth objects.  However, the small mass of asteroids and comets provide only a fraction of the gravitational force produced on earth.  Consequently, robotic mobility technologies currently employed are fundamentally incompatible with these missions.  An innovative concept for an active foot that allows a walking robot to anchor itself to the surface with each step is proposed.  By combining an omni-directional microspine gripper with an actively actuated ankle, the system will provide the dexterity necessary to conform to variable surface topography, engage and disengage the gripper from the surface, quantify the quality of attachment, and insulate the gripper from the disruptive motions of the robot as it moves.

Square One has collaborated with Raytheon Space, ATK Mission Research, and Boeing Phantom Works in the past, and will actively solicit input from these companies during Phase II.  Although initial versions of the Active Ankle will be dimensioned for integration with smaller robots, this design can be scaled-up to interface with a variety of other robotic platforms.","Although space exploration represents a potent and enduring market for the Active Ankle, robots are also being solicited to inspect America's aging concrete infrastructure.

The results have been thruster technologies plagued by high costs and low manufacturability.  This approach of ""performance at all cost"" is no longer tenable, particularly for robotic exploration/science missions like Mars Sample Return.Therefore, we seek a different approach.  We believe we can achieve state of the art (perhaps better) levels of performance, with significant reductions in cost.  The focus of our innovation is on the development of a refractory matrix composite material that uses cheap, commercially available materials and then use fast, affordable manufacturing techniques to make a low cost, high performance thruster.  Our starting materials are two order of magnitude cheaper than Ir/Re systems!Our proposed manufacturing process is likewise low cost, further contributing to the overall low cost thruster.  The basic Phase I project includes small scale fabrication experiments to identify the manufacturing parameters needed to achieve a fully-dense composite.  Then, we will fabricate sample coupons of various composition and measure hardness (as a relative indicator of tensile strength), to determine the range of composite parameters that will give the highest specific strength.",Mars Ascent Vehicle main engineSpacecraft and satellite attitude control thrustersSpace Launch System (SLS) attitude control thrusterAir-breathing and hypersonic engine thermal controlSolid rocket motor throat inserts,Spacecraft and satellite attitude control thrusters Solid rocket motor throat insertsAir-breathing and hypersonic engine thermal controlHypersonic vehicle leading edge materialNuclear power plan high temperature material,Characterization; Composites; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Metallics; Processing Methods; Spacecraft Main Engine; Surface Propulsion

Vendors have shown few signs of plans to provide OpenCL libraries, and were they to do so they would likely be incompatible with one another, much as NVIDIA's BLAS (CUDA) is presently not interchangeable with Intel's BLAS (MKL). The unified language and environment of OpenCL allows the community to ensure that the spirit of the language — its interchangeability — is reflected in its library and tools ecosystem. EM Photonics is well positioned to lead this effort; we have strong ties to several hardware manufacturers, to application developers, and we maintain a world-class LAPACK library for NVIDIA GPUs. To begin this process, EM Photonics proposes the development of a set of OpenCL BLAS routines and the framework necessary to allow researchers, developers, and hardware manufactures to integrate platform optimized versions of BLAS libraries. This software will be made open source to encourage community involvement and allow it to continue to evolve with the with future hardware technology.  Upon completion of this project, EM Photonics will have developed a complete set of OpenCL BLAS routines.  In addition, we will have the framework necessary for their efficient execution that also allows new routines to be added by either EM Photonics or third parties. This package will be released under an open source license to encourage community participation and allow for widespread adoption, and EM Photonics will be its ongoing steward.  The commercial success of our CULA product has both opened doors for partnership opportunities and provided us commercialization opportunities that can be further leveraged once this project is complete. Based on this combination of technology, experience, partnerships, and commercial momentum, we are convinced this project will successfully meet our SBIR objectives and continue to flourish beyond.","Virtually all software requiring extensive numerical processing could benefit from the solvers developed in this project.  There are numerous software packages that are already built on BLAS or higher-level libraries such as LAPACK that require BLAS.  Using the technology developed in this project, such software would therefore not need to be modified to take advantage of the emerging class of hardware accelerators from companies such as NVIDIA, Intel, AMD, and others.  This can have an immediate impact on numerous NASA applications such as vibration analysis for a number of multi-body spacecraft configurations such as the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), the Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV), and rotorcraft and computational fluid dynamics for spacecraft flight through the atmosphere and rocket design.  Other application areas of interest to NASA include weather and climate modeling, mechanical and stress modeling, heat transfer analysis, and signal/image processing.  These libraries are fundamental to high-performance computing and will be required for the next generation of hardware being released.","These solvers could be integrated into everything from specialized computational engines to general purpose tools such as MATLAB.  MATLAB currently integrates BLAS compliant routines to solve computationally intense problems.  Some versions of MATLAB even ship multiple implementations of this interface and allow the user to select between them.  The solvers developed here could simply become another option for users to select, thereby offloading processing to an accelerator device such as a GPU.  Specific application areas include automotive design, civil and mechanical engineering analysis, electromagnetic simulations, computational fluid dynamics, acoustics, signal/image processing, and financial modeling.  There are many companies now taking advantage of GPUs to accelerate their software.  Unfortunately, because of the tools available, they are mostly only compatible with NVIDIA GPUs.  By using the OpenCL-based libraries we develop here, developers will be able to take advantage of all the available and emerging hardware devices such as GPUs from NVIDIA and AMD/ATI, x86 and ARM-based microprocessors, and other accelerator platforms such as the soon-to-be-released Knights Ferry from Intel.","Computer System Architectures; Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Data Processing; Development Environments; Image Analysis; Image Processing; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Programming Languages; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Tools/EVA Tools"

Ongoing developments are focused on highly parallel processing, global simulations of increasing resolutions, and increased coupling of the earth system's process models. While model computation scales very well with number of available processors, a major constraining factor on the efficiency of these simulations is the input processing of Terabyte-size source data files used by the gridded component models. Our objective in this research is to increase the efficient use of CPU time associated with these simulations by paralleling I/O processing operations using an 'I/O Staging Server' which captures and makes available the required source data asynchronously with the simulation run. More efficient I/O for reading model restarts and boundary conditions, and writing model output and checkpoint files will free up processing resources that are currently idling during I/O. As a result, we will realize a significant increase both the number of models that can be involved in the simulation and the achievable resolutions of the grid components. It is estimated that currently up to 25% of a forecast run is consumed by I/O, a factor we think can be reduced by at least 50% or more through the use of State-of-the-art I/O processing approaches and supporting software infrastructure.","The results of this research, if successful, will have direct applicability to the Global Modeling and Assimilation office at the Goddard Space Flight Center. When validated and integrated as a part of the Earth System Modeling Framework/MAPL software application, it will have a significant impact on the CPU processing time required of the NCCS during climate and weather simulation runs of GEOS-5, and of GEOS-6 when that modeling environment evolution becomes available. As the NCCS user base increases, the results of this research will increase the efficiency of GMAO's climate/weather simulation process, thus freeing up resources for others' use and/or increasing the resolution potential of GMAO's gridded components.","The potential applications of this technology and approach include all High Performance Computing production environments working with extremely large input/results files, and multiprocessor tasking and utilization issues. Beyond Phase 2 we will make the technology available to all government agencies, will license to commercial entities, will provide consulting service to all on taking advantage of the newly developed technology.

Software for parallel RN generation (RNG) should be based on RNGs that are good serial generators, but also are suitable for concurrent execution, i.e. RNs produced by different concurrent processes must be statistically independent of one another.  With dependence, the work done on one concurrent process will be partially redone on another process, thus reducing the efficiency of the concurrent computation and defeating the purpose of concurrency.  Although parallel RNGs exist for older parallel computing paradigms such as clusters, modern advances in computer architecture, specifically the hardware support for multithreading via multicore and other architectures, and widely available computational coprocessor technologies, such as the General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) have created the need for high-quality RNG software to support these new architectural features.  Thus, this Phase I research project addresses these new architectures from a mathematically rigorous stand-point of preventing statistical dependence and allowing for reproducibility in modeling and simulation as well as other applications.  In addition, it investigates applications to small memory technologies such as embedded systems and radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips.","The main beneficiary of the proposed tool is NASA Ames Research Center's Advanced Supercomputing Division (http://www.nas.nasa.gov/) which provides tools and resources for supercomputing at NASA. Random number generation is important in any project with a stochastic component and the advantage of a GPGPU approach is a major saving in money for computational power.  A number of other NASA centers rely on detailed simulations of stochastic processes on supercomputers. The NASA Center for Climate Simulation (http://www.nccs.nasa.gov/) provides climate simulation tools and high-performance computing resources for NASA projects. Such simulations would benefit from GPGPU random number generation tools. NASA is a key participant in the federal High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) Program (http://www.hq.nasa.gov/hpcc/mission.htm) to extend U.S. technological leadership in high-performance computing and communications for the benefit of NASA stakeholders: the U.S. aeronautics, Earth and space sciences, and spaceborne research communities. The projects NASA HPCC supports would also benefit from the proposed tools.","The market for parallel random number generators is large and expanding.  Virtually all scientific computing applications have a stochastic component requiring random numbers and any parallelization requires a parallel RNG to avoid coherence.  The three largest RNG-consuming applications are (1) discrete-event simulation including war gaming, many systems-level simulation tools, and video games (e.g., Army training simulations); (2) particle Monte Carlo for simulating nuclear weapons and other large nuclear processes (astrophysics) and for planning treatments for radiology; and (3) finance where MC based computations are mandated in many nations under the Basel II accord for banking supervision; insurance companies, hedge funds, and investment firms rely on MC to price derivative products.

Conventional ISAC is applicable only to imagers with wavelengths larger than 1 micro-meter and hence it is not applicable to HyspIRI imager which has a wavelength range of 0.38 to 2.5 micro-meters. Our algorithm is simple to implement and does not require any dark pixels in the images. Second, after images are atmospherically compensated for, we propose a novel change detection algorithm known as MRCD (multiple reference change detection) using multiple images collected in the past. Our algorithm can handle misregistration and parallax issues and hence the change detection results will be more accurate. Third, we propose high performance algorithms to determine the content of the changes. For example, what materials are in the changes and where these materials are distributed. We will also determine if there are any new and unseen materials in the changes. To determine known materials with known signatures in the changes, we propose a fast matched signature identification algorithm called Adaptive Subspace Detector (ASD). We compared ASD with several other tools and found that ASD outperformed other methods. To determine any anomalies, we propose a high performance anomaly detection tool called clustered kernel Reed-Xiaoli (CKRX) algorithm.  This tool was recently developed by us, is fast, and can achieve very high anomaly detection rate in hyperspectral images from the Air Force.

The envisioned SW tool from the proposed effort primarily satisfies the design-time FM goals. But their analytic capabilities can be used in the operation-phases as well. Thus the technologies can be applied for design updating of existing systems and towards improving their health management systems. The improvements can be made in the areas of utilization of monitored information or analytic outputs, health condition assessment and forecasting, and dissemination of information in efficient manners such that those can be used for updating design and/or operation-related aspects.","The industries interested in fault-tolerant high-availability systems will be the beneficiary of the outcome of this project. They can utilize the SW tool for ensuring robust fault-tolerance and fast and economic maintenance – via using the failure containment support (in design) and fault detection, identification and diagnosis with 'no' or 'very low' level of ambiguity. The space system industries (e.g., satellite manufactures and operators), aircraft manufacturers and their customers, and maritime industry are the industrial sectors of interest and will be targeted as part of the commercialization effort. Mission planning and execution processes that utilize diagnostic and prognostic information related to aircraft and spacecraft systems are also of interest. In addition, sectors that are looking towards introducing automation in their product design and development phases,   (such as automotive industry as well as semiconductor fabrication and other large industrial automation units) will also be targeted for commercialization of this product.",Diagnostics/Prognostics

The Phase I effort involves establishing an FM approach and architecture and designing a tool that supports them.  It will also include a feasibility prototype of the tool.  The primary source of information for the approach and architecture is the NASA FM Handbook, which represents a collaboration of ideas from a number of NASA and non-NASA centers.  SKA also intends to consider risk management, including Risk Informed Decision Making (RIDM) and Continuous Risk Management (CRM).  Risk management concepts could help to support the cost-effective allocation of resources to FM options.  They should also help with the balancing of costs from development, operations, and adverse outcomes from system failures.  A detailed data model will help to ensure that engineers develop a complete description of FM.  Specialized views of the FM information will ensure that analyses and questions can be effectively addressed during the course of FM development.  SKA intends to build on its success with a risk management system it is currently building for the Human Research Project.","As pressure increases for system autonomy, so does the need for good, cost-effective fault management (FM).  FM engineers and project engineers need assistance in building effective FM that is specified completely enough to make costs more predictable during testing and verification phases.  The detailed data model at the core of the Fault Management Assistant (FMA) should help to achieve this goal by encouraging more complete FM descriptions from engineers. Developers need assistance in selecting cost effective FM options for each failure.  The data model combined with specialized views should provide that assistance. Finally, they need assistance in prioritizing failures to guide FM resource allocation. The detailed data model coupled with specialized views should help with this goal as well.  Consequently, this tool should provide valuable assistance to a large number of NASA projects.","The number of non-NASA applications that could benefit from the Fault Management Assistant is almost limitless.  Nearly everyone deals with faults and failures and could use assistance in thinking clearly about these issues and managing them effectively and efficiently.  Initially, SKA intends to focus on FM objects (system functions, faults, failures, response options, etc.) and the relationships among them.  This is where we expect to gain the greatest advantage to a large number of potential customers.  Later, SKA intends to explore the direct export and import of data between the Fault Management Assistant and other system engineering tools.  Finally, SKA will explore ways to support effective interaction among large numbers of engineers, a capability that can be valuable for very large projects.  Everyone who builds complex systems should benefit from using this tool.  This includes all branches of the military plus private industries like aeronautics and automotive industries.","Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Recovery (see also Autonomous Systems); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

Our approach initially aims to make a compact reactive/separator that can operate continuously with minimum energy requirements for both ISRU process streams in particular the martian atmosphere. The success of this approach demonstrated in a compact and lightweight unit for NASA will allow us to deploy it in the near term for a number of terrestrial-based applications including CO2 sequestration and mitigation.","The proposed technology has application in ISRU processing. In particular, the Martian atmosphere is about 95% CO2, which can potentially be separated and processed to produce oxygen or methane gas. Another important application for CO2 separation technologies involve air revitalization where excess carbon dioxide must be removed from the cabin of spacecraft and spacesuits.","In addition to NASA, this technology will have significant terrestrial-based applications and thereby a significant customer base. The market for separating carbon dioxide from other gases is expected to grow with continued interest and emphasis on reducing CO2 emissions. Sequestering CO2 or reducing CO2 to oxygen on earth may find interest by organizations that need to reduce their CO2 emissions. Successful cost effective technologies that can sequester CO2 clearly have a world-wide market appeal. A compact  reactor that efficiently separates and concentrates CO2 can be used in sequestration scenario, alternative fuels production, as well at mitigating CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants.","In Situ Manufacturing; Processing Methods; Resource Extraction; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable)"

The solution to these problems is an integrated mobile mining and water extraction system that uses an auger based excavation approach and an integrated water-ice extraction plant – hence, if the water-ice does sublime, it will sublime straight into the extraction system. The proposed system is an auger with a reactor and the weak link, the transfer system, is eliminated altogether.The system, called the Mobile In-Situ Mars Water Extractor (MISME), consists of the Icy-Soil Acquisition and Delivery System (ISADS), and the Volatiles Extraction and Capture System (VECS). The ISADS is a deep fluted auger that drills into the ice or icy-soils and retains material on its flutes. Upon material acquisition, the ISADS is retracted into VECS and sealed. The VECS consists of a cylindrical heat exchanger and volatiles transfer system (a reactor).  This Phase I effort will focus on developing the water extraction reactor: Volatile Extraction and Capture System (VECS).","NASA applications would satisfy goals of ESMD and SMD. In particular, this water-vapor extraction could be a reconnaissance tool to map the ice distribution around the area. It also could be used (as designed) as a water-vapor production system to support human habitats. Increasing the production could be done by deploying more than one of these rovers (and hence the system would have redundancy through numbers).","This particular vapor extraction process is not limited to water, but also other volatiles.

Currently envisioned ISRU plants include production of oxygen from hydrogen reduction of lunar regolith and extraction of water from Martian regolith or asteroid material.  These ISRU processes require heating of the regolith to high reaction temperatures.  To support ISRU activities, NASA requires the development of  a compact, lightweight gas chromatograph – mass spectrometer (GC-MS) instrument that can quantify volatile gases released by sample heating below atomic number 70. The instrument must also be designed to withstand exposure to the release of HF, HCl, or Hg that may result from heating regolith samples to high temperatures.  Creare proposes to design, build, and test a compact, lightweight gas chromatograph - mass spectrometer (GC-MS) system, capable of detecting, identifying, and quantifying ppm to 100%-level concentrations of relevant compounds having mass less than 100 amu.  Our GC-MS design is based on components that have been previously or can easily be space-qualified using techniques proven on numerous past space hardware development projects.  During the Phase I project, we will prove our design with benchtop testing, and in Phase II, we plan to build engineering model versions of our GC-MS.","The main initial application area for the proposed gas chromatograph mass spectrometer for ISRU plants will be in NASA's future missions to Mars and the Moon, as well as other bodies such as Near Earth objects (NEOs).  Long-duration missions to the Moon will need substantial amounts of resources for life support and energy.  Martian sample return missions and manned missions to Mars may be prohibitively expensive, technically exigent, and unacceptably risky unless resources can be produced on Mars.  An ISRU propellant production plant on Mars may be needed for the sample return mission that NASA is envisioning in the 2020s.","The primary private sector applications for the proposed gas chromatograph mass spectrometer system is for use in performing portable chemical analysis, particularly when looking for harmful gases.  The sensitive and specific sensor that we propose to develop will not only help ensure the timely generation of data for hazardous gas detection, but will also provide this capability to commercial organizations wishing to perform chemical analysis in the field.  For example, the proposed system would be invaluable for supporting first responder personnel who need to determine the safety of areas during cleaning and securing activities for interval testing in different areas.  On the commercial front, inexpensive portable mass spectrometers would revolutionize pollution monitoring, process control, and the response to incidents by emergency personnel.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors)"

The Sabatier reaction will greatly benefit from inherently superior microreactor heat and mass transfer characteristics compared to conventional reactor designs.  Significantly, multiple microreactors can readily be configured in series or parallel arrangements that improve reaction outcomes, and process scale up is easily achieved by numbering up mass produced microreactors.  High conversion rates will require the deposition of highly active, supported catalyst layers onto microchannel walls that enhance surface area, adsorption characteristics, and catalyst effectiveness factor.  Another research focus area will be a MSRS design that optimizes residence time, thermal recovery, and the achievement of equilibrium at low temperature.  Successful completion of the Phase I project will provide microreactor performance data required to design and assemble a first generation MSRS.  The Phase II research will result in the development of a prototype MSRS incorporating integrated sequential microreactors and heat exchange with the capability of processing 1 kg hr-1 of CO2.  The prototype MSRS will clearly demonstrate the efficacy of this in situ resource utilization approach.","The NASA application for this technology will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future, long duration exploration missions to Mars or other Near Earth Objects (NEOs) where reclamation of in situ resources and reduction of the logistics burden will be highly valued.  The Microchannel Sabatier Reactor System (MSRS) will efficiently reclaim oxygen (as water) and produce a propellant (methane) from atmospheric or frozen deposits of carbon dioxide on Mars or other NEOs using only hydrogen.  The MSRS provides a fundamental starting point for planetary habitats where precursor robotic missions can prepare the road for subsequent human exploration by reducing the logistics burden.","The primary non-governmental application of this technology is the recycling of sequestered carbon dioxide to form a fuel gas.  Efforts to reduce CO2 emissions are becoming more commonplace as many nations begin implementation of CO2 emissions limits.  The costs associated with exceeding the proposed regulatory limits will begin to offset the costs related to CO2 removal and recycling. Microchannel Sabatier Reactor System (MSRS) technology is particularly suited to on-site processing of CO2 captured from industrial effluent gas streams due to its inherent scalability.  A MSRS would enable cost-effective deployment over a broad process scale.  Utilization of H2 generated by renewable resources, e.g. solar or wind powered electrolysis of H2O, further enhances the environmental benefits of Sabatier technology.  Half of the H2 required for the reduction reaction can be recovered directly from the H2O product, just as it would be in a space application.  An additional benefit to this ecologically friendly application can be obtained by thermal recovery from flue gases to heat the MSRS.","Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Resource Extraction"

The same designs can also be utilized in lunar or Martian applications with only minor modifications. Design of the light-weight flexible conveyor ducts will utilize recently verified regolith simulation software to assure that the concepts are viable under microgravity conditions, and prototypes will be tested under vacuum conditions in Phase-1 (and under micro-gravity during Phase-2). Depending on the drill-head/feeder design selected, these flexible transfer ducts could be used in extraction of material from depths of a meter or more below the surface. Under Martian conditions a 1-cm-diameter conveying duct could deliver 5 kg/hr of material to a processing station for extraction/processing of volatiles. Trade-off studies during Phase-1 will determine potential power saving (if any) in larger diameter conveying ducts (e.g., 1.5 or 2cm dia) and/or the power requirements in a smaller diameter conveying duct (e.g. 0.5 cm dia) under Martian conditions. Unlike conventional screw conveyors, these flexible transfer ducts would be robust to oversize material up to a size of one-half the transfer duct radius. Coupled with an oversize-rejection inlet feeder, the system could provide high reliability transfer of loose regolith with one or two major moving parts. Modular designs are possible, as is the incorporation of energy-efficient ultrasonic (or percussion) drill heads, or sensors near a sub-surface inlet.","Modular flexible conveyor ducts can transport regolith horizontally, on inclines, or vertically, and can be designed to operate at any gravity level. Conveying efficiency improves as gravity is reduced . Each module is comprised of a thin outer duct, containing a novel light-weight flexible conveyor core. Transport is totally enclosed and dust-free. The design is robust and tolerant of occasional oversize particles. Minimal maintenance is required, and distances of many 10's of meters could be traversed with no back-and-forth driving of rovers, no dust generation, and consistent steady delivery of material.  Beneficiation modules with screen-wire sieves are also possible. For larger operations or longer distances, multiple units could be daisy chained together. Various (ultrasonic or percussion) cutter-drill-heads or feeders could be employed to allow efficient extraction of material at depth.  With additional development of drill-head feeder designs, extraction from depths of multiple meters could be achieved.","The light-weight flexible nature of the novel conveying-core designs proposed for these regolith transport ducts may be suitable for many conventional bulk material transport operations.  The light-weight duct-walls for space applications may need to be replaced with heavier, more robust tube walls for long duration continuous-use terrestrial applications.  Also the overall distances for screw-conveyor transport that make economic sense under terrestrial gravity, are shorter than would be the case under reduced gravity.  Since the mode of flow in these proposed flexible-ducts is significantly different than that used in most conventional screw conveyors, the range of potential applications may cover a wider variety of configurations than are used by conventional rigid screw conveyors.  Many terrestrial solids transfer applications where pneumatic transport is currently the best option, may be candidates for the mechanically fluidized flow in the proposed flexible duct conveyors.",In Situ Manufacturing; Processing Methods; Resource Extraction

In the proposed system, an electromagnetic flowmeter for insulating fluids (EMFIF) will be able to provide real-time liquid velocity information under single- and two-phase flow conditions, and an X-ray void fraction sensor will provide phase concentration and interfacial velocity information.  The X-ray sensor will also be able to detect bubble existence in cryogenic propellant flow.  The whole proposed system will be a useful instrument to measure propellant flowrate in rocket engine feed lines.During the Phase I project, a test model of the proposal measurement technique will be designed and built.

Dynamic Structures and Materials (DSM) proposes to focus the Phase I innovation on the development of a hammer drive actuation mechanism that will take the EM oscillatory power and produce continuous linear motion for operation at cryogenic and extreme environments.  DSM has already demonstrated operation of its high force linear motor actuators at temperatures down to 77 K.  The proposed actuator should operate from approximately 4 K to 400 K and should provide very low or no outgassing as well as operational capabilities in hard vacuum. The technology is proposed for applications in the cryo fluid management, pressure and flow control, and driving operational equipment and instruments. This proposal addresses DSM's approach to the development of flight-scalable demonstration components for the EM hammer drive technology.","DSM has received interest from NASA regarding actuators for cryogenic applications and for others that do not require low temperature capability.  Many non-cryogenic uses require a wider temperature range than laboratory environment, so some of the proposed work would be useful for these purposes, as well.  Many inquiries are related to the regulation of fluid flow or pressure.  Thruster valves used in highly miniaturized satellites have received significant attention.  Flow and pressure control of cryogenic propellants such as LOX for propulsion is also an area of interest.  As the technology is more fully developed, it will be practical to pursue applications requiring more force.  Interest has been expressed in an actuator for a 1-inch and 2 inch cryo-isolation valve that will require over 150 pounds of output force.  There are many cryo and non-cryo valve applications that can potentially be addressed by this technology.","The most direct applications outside NASA are other aerospace projects that require actuators to operate valves for cryogenic fluid handling.  ESA and major US defense contractors have previously tested systems that used piezoelectric actuators from DSM.  It is reasonable to assume that once the new technology reaches a readiness level that is acceptable for NASA, other aerospace entities will have similar interest in using it for their programs.

We propose to develop a system to aid forecasters in the prediction of such events, and in the identification of ``all clear'' time periods when there is a low probability of such events occurring.  The system combines empirical assessments with physics-based models by leveraging three recently developed technologies:  a tool for forecasting solar eruptions from line-of-sight magnetograms (University of Alabama at Huntsville), physics-based models of the solar corona and inner heliosphere with embedded solar eruptions (Predictive Science, Inc., or PSI), and empirical/physics-based assessments of energetic particle fluxes using the Earth-Moon-Mars Radiation Environment Module (EMMREM, University of New Hampshire).  When completed, the proposed SPE Threat Assessment Tool, or STAT,  will represent a significant step forward in our ability to assess the possible impact of SPE events.","NASA's Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG) is charged with the difficult responsibility of ensuring that the radiation exposure received by astronauts remains below established safety limits. This requires identifying periods with a high probability of no SPEs, as well as recognizing the imminent threat of an SPE.  The proposed SPE Threat Assessment Tool (STAT) will aid SRAG in this endeavor by providing probabilities of a major flare or coronal mass ejection (CME) from full disk magnetograms.  When an active region on the Sun is deemed to show a significant threat, STAT can estimate particle fluxes and dose rates for possible eruption times over the next several hours and days. This capability will allow SRAG to place upper limits on the severity of an upcoming event, and possibly extend all clear times even when a significant active region is visible.","SPEs are of concern not only to NASA, but to many government and commercial entities dependent on satellites and aircraft.  For example, NOAA SWPC provides space weather information to a range of customers, for many of whom the forecasting of SPEs is a top priority.  The Air Force is also interested in mitigation strategies for SPEs.  The fledgling private manned launch services industry may wish to develop their own forecasting capabilities, as opposed to solely relying on government services.  Once we have successfully developed STAT for NASA applications, we can adapt STAT to address the needs of these customers as well.",Analytical Methods; Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation)

The proposed device uses a closed loop control system to maintain the predetermined load throughout the range of motion by controlling an electric motor. The force applied during the eccentric phase is independent of the force applied during the concentric phase; the force applied during the eccentric phase (return stroke) can even exceed the force applied during the pull stroke (concentric phase). The PFG uses regenerative braking to store the braking energy harvested during the pull stroke and applies this energy to provide the motive force during the return stroke. The PFG can be integrated with both the hardware and the software of existing exercise equipment such as the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED). Since the application of force can be automatically controlled during the entire range of motion, the PFG eliminates the need for the user to adjust the equipment to their specific range of motion; this significantly increases the fraction of time that can be spent exercising relative to the time spent configuring equipment.","The Programmable Force Generator can be incorporated into existing microgravity exercise equipment such as the Advance Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) or in future exercise equipment to generate resistive forces. The PFG increases the flexibility of exercise equipment because the force can be controlled independently throughout the exercise motion. The PFG will increase the time that is spent exercising relative to the time spent configuring equipment because the generated force can be adjusted automatically throughout the range of motion. The PFG uses minimum power through the application of a regenerative braking system that harvests power during the pull stroke and applies that power to generate the motive force during the return stroke.NASA has made significant investments into the development of the Advance Resistance Exercise Device which has proven to be an excellent countermeasure for astronauts' health. During Phase I we will work together with NASA to develop the required interfaces to incorporate the PFG into the ARED. Incorporation of the PFG will improve the effectiveness of the ARED and decrease the amount of time that is spent configuring the equipment relative to the time spent exercising. We will develop both the mechanical interfaces and the interfaces with the control software that is currently part of ARED. By utilizing this approach, NASA will achieve tangible benefits from the proposed research in a short timeframe.","The exercise equipment market is a multi-billion market that is receptive to innovative changes. Electronic interfaces are becoming more prevalent in all aspects of life and cardiovascular training equipment has followed this trend. Strength training, however, still relies mainly on weights. The PFG can advance strength training equipment to the modern age.Another potential application is for physical therapy. Rehabilitation patients are susceptible to additional injury and therefore great care must be taken during the exercise programs. For this reason, there are specific exercise methods to aid in the recovery from specific injuries. With the implementation of the Programmable Force Generator into rehabilitation equipment, precise load profiles can be programmed to increase speed of recovery from an injury. Another application of the PFG is to reduce the loads on a patient's legs during rehabilitation. Currently, underwater treadmills are used to decrease the load on the legs and hips during rehabilitation. An alternative approach is to place a harness on the user and attach them to a cable from a PFG which is attached overhead. The load of the PFG can then be set to a fraction of the bodyweight of the patient to reduce the stress on the leg and hip muscles. In this manner the patient still has full mobility and can move freely, but the loads on the legs and hips are decreased.",Physiological/Psychological Countermeasures

The sensor design allows for normal forces to be measured in compression, while both lateral and longitudinal forces can be measured in shear. The normal and shear sensitivity can be customized for different specifications, and even stacked for graded sensitivity, if desired. The result can be placed in an array and integrated into a shoe without affecting user operation.","The proposed Exercise Load Measurement Insole (ELMI) system is composed of individual sensing elements that are capable of measuring both normal and shear forces simultaneously.

In this proposal, Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) will build upon expertise in lateral flow test strip (LFTS) assays by integrating an LFTS with a cell phone for the quantitative measurement of blood-based biomarkers. Our innovative and extremely cost-effective multi-analyte LFTS approach is imminently suited for space travel. All ""microfluidics"" (sample transport, reagent storage, mixing, etc.) take place via capillary action with no moving parts, no flow channels, and in a 5 mm x 5 mm x 30 mm space. Taking advantage of the built-in flash and high resolution camera, we will modify a commercially available cell phone with optical filters, lenses, a UV LED excitation source and a cassette holder for LFTS image capture. Quantum dots (QD) will be incorporated as labels with high quantum yield, resulting in higher sensitivity and narrow emission peaks in a multiplexed assay. In Phase I, we will develop and optimize a cell phone-based LFTS platform with the ability to quantitatively detect multiple biomarkers within clinically relevant ranges. The images of the LFTS will be captured on the cell phone and analyzed on a computer by the end of the Phase I. In Phase II, we will develop cell phone-based software for on-cell phone detection and data processing with expanded panels of biomarkers; advancing the TRL from 5 to 7.","Future space missions will require prolonged stays of crew members onboard space stations, and on other spacecraft during journeys to other planets. Increasingly complex space missions will also require the health status of astronauts to be monitored, preferably in a simple point-of-care apparatus that is compact and simple. The IOS system will enable NASA to monitor the health status of crew members by means of simple blood-based biomarker detection. A lateral flow test strip will be integrated with a cell phone into a simple and compact blood biomarker detection platform. This platform will gather diagnostic information in the absence of medically trained personnel, and can also monitor the health of aircraft pilots, cabin crews, passengers, and others in aeronautics-related occupations.","A cell phone-based serum biomarker detection platform will be cost-effective and compact not only for space exploration; it will also benefit the overall healthcare industry. Cell phones are becoming increasingly prevalent all over the world, with approximately 5 billion subscribers worldwide, and in the U.S. approximately one in three adults owns a smart phone. The ability to integrate a simple LFTS assay with a cell phone will enable healthcare providers to perform blood tests for many diseases on a wide population, including populations in remote areas where healthcare facilities are sparse. Such a platform can have a major impact in developing countries where a simple cell phone can be converted into a blood marker detection platform, avoiding the cost of acquiring dedicated medical equipment; furthermore, this point-of-care device improves the probability of early detection, yielding additional savings in overall cost of healthcare.

These advantages will reduce the size, weight and cost of the sample cartridge.  Fluorescence emission from the sensors will be directly measured by the built-in phone camera and data processing can occur on the phone itself.

Although the idea of a non-contact electrode is not new and has been previously investigated by other research groups, a successful design has yet to be achieved due to unresolved issues relating to noise, artifacts and complexity.The Cognionics technology is based in part on a novel custom integrated amplifier developed by the PI and licensed from the University of California, San Diego. The patent-pending amplifier is specifically optimized for high-impedance biopotential sensing and is able to achieve significantly better performance in terms of input impedance and noise than the discrete off-the-shelf components used in previous research efforts. In contrast to older designs, the Cognionics sensor requires no manual adjustments (neutralization), consumes a minimum of power (a few uWs) and is virtually insensitive to variations in the body-electrode coupling strength. The new amplifier combined with several Cognionics developed proprietary techniques has already yielded a non-contact sensor with significant improvements in signal quality even on fully ambulatory subjects.The Phase I proposal will further develop the sensor to demonstrate full compliance with AAMI ECG specifications through both bench and live testing. In Phase I, a single lead non-contact chest strap will be produced to serve as an evaluation platform for delivery to NASA. A successful Phase I project will demonstrate that the core Cognionics non-contact sensor can fully meet NASA's signal quality requirements. The Phase II project will develop a full diagnostic ECG device for use in space environments and integrate the sensor within existing and future NASA systems (e.g., spacesuits).","The use of ECG monitoring has been an integral part of space flights for decades. Non-contact electrodes, which can be comfortably worn and never need replacement parts, represent the ideal tool for both continuous crew health monitoring as well as specific health experiments (e.g. exercise stress tests). The technology in this proposal, if successful, is a natural candidate for inclusion in all future NASA missions that require ECG recordings. The Cognionics non-contact ECG sensor in conjunction with either Cognionics-developed data acquisition systems, COTS ECG Holter monitors, or proprietary NASA body sensor systems, has the potential to significantly improve the usage (time, effort, comfort) of astronaut cardiac monitoring.Additionally, the Cognionics sensor technology has application to EEG - a high-quality non-contact, comfortable and gel-less sensor can enable practical EEG applications to assess neurological function in space. Currently, EEG based systems are too cumbersome for the constraints of space environments. A high-quality, dry and through-hair EEG system could potentially lead to astronaut neurological monitoring (e.g., alertness/fatigue, sleep) systems.","Dry electrodes have been extensively studied for medical applications. Despite the current advancements in mobile and wireless technologies, a better sensor technology is still critically needed to enable future medical devices. Achieving a successful, high-quality non-contact sensor will significantly improve the way outpatient ECG monitoring is performed. Current outpatient monitoring devices (e.g., Holter, event monitors) would no longer need adhesive electrodes or skin contact, greatly improving patient comfort and compliance. It may also enable new techniques, including:a) practical high-resolution, surface voltage mapping (BSPM) which has demonstrated promising results towards non-invasive arrhythmia diagnosis but currently requires time consuming and expensive application of large numbers of sensors,b) high-quality, patient-friendly, non-contact electrodes may lead to routine ECG monitoring (e.g. ECG as a part of every doctor office visit),c) non-contact ECG will be especially useful for sensitive subjects (e.g., neonates, burn victims). d) and high-quality non-contact biopotential electrodes have, in the long-term, significant clinical implications in neurology (e.g. sleep, epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases) by enabling a comfortable, wearable and mobile EEG device.",Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Medical

The first stage of the framework is a scenario generation tool that can be used directly by SMEs from various social and psychological domains to design situation and training materials without requiring any programming or artistic knowledge. The output from the scenario generation tool is directly imported into a 3D virtual team training engine that allows multiple players to engage in the exercise from a variety of platforms, including standalone applications, web and mobile devices. After the players have completed the scenario, an After Action Review tool generates on-the-fly, relevant, SCORM-based training material to further educate each player on areas that warrant improvement. The final piece to the framework is a clear process for evaluating the value of the training in terms of short and long term impact on behavior. This proposal acknowledges the need for a system that NASA can use long-term for creating mission relevant training situations as well as to distribute to SMEs in various disciplines for constantly new and improved training.","The framework created under this proposal is initially targeted at creating a behavioral impact in the domains listed in the SBIR topic (e.g., cross-cultural interactions, leadership, psychological support, etc.) in the context of complex mission tasks. However, the training scenarios created for the system could be expanded to other domains within NASA.  For example, it may be desirable to use the system for pure virtual training of various tasks without any social or psychological training. Additionally, outside the scope of training, the system could be used as a diagnostic tool to determine the attitudes of players. In this mode, the player?s results could be monitored to determine the social or psychological appropriateness of his or her role in a mission.","Outside of NASA, the framework could be used by the military or emergency responders to augment their existing training systems. Given the openness of the system, it would be straightforward to create training scenarios that are relevant to those domains and to execute the evaluation process to ensure it is having a measurable behavioral impact. In the field of social and psychological academic research, the framework could be used for various studies, without requiring users in those fields to obtain assistance from software engineers and 3D modelers.

Understanding task performance and crew behavioral health is crucial to mission success and the optimal design, development and operation of next generation space craft. Onboard resources, such as a single conventional video camera, can capture crew motion and interaction. There is a critical need for a software tool which achieves unobtrusive, non-invasive, automatic analysis of crew activity from video footage.Many video-based human motion analysis tools assume a stationary camera and employ segmentation techniques like temporal differencing or background segmentation to detect people. However, these approaches are vulnerable to camera motion and subtle changes in the background. In addition, many existing commercial solutions use simple blob-based video analysis where the entire body is tracked as a single object. Employing such a coarse human body model is appropriate for surveillance applications concerned with motion detection and person counting; however, it is insufficient for understanding precise human actions or gestures. Therefore, a system which is able to detect human body pose automatically, regardless of camera setup, is necessary for addressing these issues.Vecna proposes a video analysis software tool that automatically processes and analyzes complex human motions in conventional 2D video without the use of specialized markers. Unlike many video analytics solutions, Vecna's solution goes beyond simple blob-based video analysis by tracking the geometric configuration of human body parts like the trunk, head, and limbs. This enables our human motion understanding algorithms to model and recognize complex human actions and interactions. The resulting system will represent a substantial breakthrough providing benefits to an array of applications in video surveillance, human-computer interaction, human factors engineering, and robotics.","Vecna expects the full-scope software system to have immediate and tangible benefit for NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD). ESMD focuses on the human element of exploration by conducting research to ensure astronaut explorers are safe, healthy and can perform their work during long-duration space exploration. Task performance and crew behavioral health are key concerns in the design, development, and operation of next generation space vehicles. Operations in confined, isolated, and resource-constrained environments can lead to suboptimal human performance.  As such, there is a critical need for Vecna's proposed software tool that automatically processes and analyzes crew motion and interaction from video footage captured by a single conventional 2D video camera. Such a diagnostic tool will enable unobtrusive and non-invasive measurement of task performance and crew behavioral health.","The proposed technology is applicable to a wide range of Department of Defense and intelligence community areas including force protection, counter-terrorism, target recognition, human activity monitoring, and surveillance and tracking. We see significant potential for application of this tool to support a range of tactical and strategic systems, including shipboard Navy CIC centers, Army field C3I centers, or USAF theater airborne command posts. A number of programs sponsored by the Department of Defense (e.g. FCS, HumanID, CTS, Mind's Eye, Rail Security Pilot) employ video-based monitoring systems and would benefit from the proposed system.In addition, Vecna will investigate commercialization opportunities in a variety of sectors, including mobile robotics and visual surveillance. Initial analysis of these market segments reveal both unaddressed needs as well as vast potential for rapid adoption and growth.As robotic systems become more commonplace in today's society, robust, intelligent interaction between humans and robots is essential. Interaction with humans in a lifelike manner requires that robot infer physical intentions by interpreting visual cues.  The proposed technology could potentially revolutionize human-robot interaction.In the surveillance market, an immediate application is automated screening of passengers and personnel at busy transportation hubs such as airline terminals and ports, and 24/7 automation of border monitoring and control.",Image Analysis; Image Processing

These video logs contain immeasurable amounts of useful data on crew social interactions, crew task performance, and crew-vehicle interaction.  Currently, these videos must be searched and indexed by hand.  This is a long process that involves many man hours of labor.Automated video processing techniques can integrated into a comprehensive toolbox that drastically reduces the time to search and analyze videos.  This would allow specific regions in a video stream to be isolated for monitoring, which can provide quick indexing for human viewing of all motion-based activity in the area of a vehicle. It could also allow the user to query for specific activities or events that occurred in this region.  These could be automatically detected by software and presented directly to the user.In support of NASA's needs, we propose to design a system that detects and tracks humans, human activity, human-station interaction, and team interactions using existing cameras and videos.  Our overall objectives can be achieved by developing a suite of algorithms that can handle several key sub-challenges: 1) Robustly handling unconstrained video content and capture conditions; 2) Extracting functional descriptions of complex human events; 3) Handling ad hoc event queries effectively; 4) Operating efficiently, so the system can keep up with the flood of videos being added to current databases and provide effective interactive search over such databases.","Our immediate NASA application is to find key events in video logs from space station and from ground testing.

It could be used to analyze individual patterns in crew members and highlight unusual behaviors.  It could also be used to monitor crew interaction issues, both with each other and with specific hardware on station.  Our system is also applicable for vehicle/habitat design issues, by analyzing video of how environments are used by crew members.","The military is a major consumer of video analysis software.  We believe that the innovations in this project will enable a general-purpose multimedia interpretation system that will dramatically improve the productivity of intelligence community analysts working at such places as National Media Exploitation Center within the Defense Intelligence Agency.

By allowing users to make adhoc queries using selected processing components on specific regions of video, human expert knowledge that has yet to be automated can be leveraged to detect novel events.We expect to market our software to military customers. Additional non-NASA applications include activity recognition and configurable video monitoring for airport security, large factories and plants, oil exploration operations, and hospitals. The educational arena is also a potential consumer, as students and classrooms can be monitored at universities, which improves facility maintenance and potentially instructor performance.

The unique technology and expertise of CL scientists will result in an innovative, reliable, compact and low-cost method of collecting and preserving dried biological specimens at room temperature. The unique portable design of the BioSAP does not require any power source and it is utilizable during flight and mission. In Phase I, CL will demonstrate the feasibility of the BioSAP device by fabricating a prototype device capable of capturing and stabilizing a subset of target analytes through a rapid drying process. In Phase II, CL plans to validate, refine and optimize the design of the BioSAP to allow for future integration with post-mission analysis methodologies.","NASA will have a versatile, compact, lightweight blood and urine preservation device does not require refrigeration that can be used for long-term studies into the effects of the microgravity environment on the physiology of astronauts.  The small sized inexpensive material based system is designed to weigh as little as possible and be able to be tightly packed; it does not require any additional processing equipment nor consume any power. The versatility of the BioSAP device will allow its range of use to be expanded to encompass storage of other biological fluids with very little modification. No commercial system offers the capability of BioSAP in room temperature biological preservation during space missions.","The BioSAP device will lead to a new generation of biological specimen preservation devices for use in remote, challenging conditions where scientific equipment and infrastructure are not readily available. The BioSAP device can also be incorporated, for example, into the standardized tool or method that are currently used for quick diagnostic at limited resource settings. Development of this device will have immediate applications in medicine in third world countries, forensic data collection and environmental monitoring.

The vehicle, its payload, and facilities must be designed to withstand these loads to ensure mission safety and success. Accurately accounting for the acoustic environment early in the design phase of a new launch vehicle is a high priority. Governments and aerospace entities expend significant resources investigating launch acoustics using a combination of predictive models, full-scale and subscale tests, and test flights. Sensors that acquire acoustic data are deployed over a limited geometry and do not sample the full three-dimensional volume exposed to the acoustic field. Launch imagery samples that three-dimensional volume. Under appropriate conditions, rapidly varying condensation features are generated by the lift-off acoustic field. A software tool will be developed to determine the three-dimensional structure of the field from imagery of these acoustically-induced features.  This unique data will be compared to model predictions and will serve to either validate those models or inspire modifications to those models. Improving predictive models contributes to a more reliable and efficient design process for new launch vehicle propulsion systems, and thus reduces associated design costs.

Two-dimensional (2D) C-C components are typically less expensive and potentially lower weight than C-C parts fabricated using 3D woven preforms.  One typical 2D C-C fabrication method uses a tape-wrapping technique in which a bias-ply C/Ph tape is wrapped over a mandrel, cured, carbonized, and graphitized to form a carbon-carbon part.  Tape-wrapping has been applied successfully to the development of erosion-resistant carbon-carbon exit cones.  An alternative fabrication technique is to replace the flat 2D lay-ups with an involute construction.  The involute plies spiral from the inner to outer diameter of the carbon-carbon part providing through-thickness reinforcement to reduce the potential for delaminations.  In addition, each ply extends from the forward to the aft end of the part, increasing its axial strength considerably.  The overall objective of this program is to design and demonstrate an alternative fabrication technique of nozzle extensions and exit cones on Earth-to-Orbit (ETO) propulsion systems.  The Phase I program will be performed by a team of MR&D and ATK Aerospace Systems.  The MR&D team is uniquely suited to perform the proposed effort because of previous experience on developing alternative fabrication methods of high-temperature C-C components such as exit cones and aeroshells.  MR&D will manage the program, develop the processing and operational models, and design the C-C subcomponents to be fabricated.  ATK Aerospace Systems will provide guidance and information as well as fabricate the C-C subcomponents.","The Phase I program will lead to improved C-C nozzle extension components for ETO propulsion systems via alternate fabrication methods coupled with proven design and analysis tools.  The models developed here will allow various material candidates and involute configurations to be auditioned prior to fabrication and testing, reducing the cost of developing these higher-performance materials considerably.The technology developed here will also have a direct impact on the design and manufacturing of alternative C-C fabrication methods, and metal-to-composite nozzle joints for all future propulsion system designs by offering a domestically available alternative to the non-domestic state-of-the-art, such as the nozzle extension designed for RL 10B-2.  Benefits include increased performance, and weight and cost savings, together with a larger supplier base for the fabrication of refractory composite nozzles and nozzle extensions for future heavy-lift launch propulsion systems.","MR&D's core business is to provide design services to the aerospace materials community, so the methods developed here can be used to support other SBIR awardees, or transferred to other propulsion system designers.

An RC suppressor will allow for increased suction performance and for improved turbopump reliability by reducing loads on the rotor support system.  This technology has applications for any rocket engine turbopump or commercial pump.  FTT's approach will mature the conceptual design for the Slotted Annular Cavitation Suppressor (SACS), compare results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of a baseline inducer with and without the SACS, create a test plan, and generate a conceptual design of a test article to test the SACS.

Incorporation of ORBITEC's innovative lattice structures in the fabrication of thrust chambers for expander cycle engine systems will maximize the heat transfer into the coolant fluid, expand design options, enable substantial cost savings, and reduce lead times for component fabrication.  Using rapid prototyping technology, the LRCM hybrid fabrication approach allows for the rapid casting of near-net shape metallic thrust chamber components.  The lattice passages allow for turbulent flows through the cooling jacket which induces mixing in the coolant.  During Phase I, monolithic chamber wall sections incorporating the LRCM lattice structure will be fabricated and tested in a hot-fire test conditions in ORBITEC's propulsion testing facilities.","The primary focus of this activity is to develop innovative cooling approaches for rocket combustion devices that will expand the performance envelope and reduce the manufacturing cost of future high thrust in-space propulsion systems for NASA.   LRCM components and subassemblies will be developed for implementation in an operational engine system during the Phase III program.  The same high performance cooling approaches could be used in a wide range of propulsion applications including large-scale booster engines, RCS thrusters, and other in-space propulsion systems.","The LRCM high performance cooling approaches could be used in a wide range of Air Force, DoD, or commercial applications including large-scale booster engines, RCS thrusters, and other in-space propulsion systems.

This technology offers NASA the ability to reduce development effort of new high power Hall thrusters, and reduce system complexity and increase system lifetime and durability. Historically, efforts to model Hall thrusters utilized either hybrid/fluid approach which reduce computational overhead but rely on analytical fits, or required prohibitive computational resources to model thrusters self-consistently. Even with the use of large supercomputers, the self-consistent approach was limited to small, low power thrusters. We propose a new approach in which electron transport along magnetic field lines is computed self-consistently using a kinetic code for electrons, but global cross-field properties are computed using a 2D hybrid code. This approach combines the benefits of fully kinetic self-consistent modeling with the performance gain of hybrid models. The model will be able to analyze Hall thruster discharges without requiring any user-specified mobility fits. The model will also require only computational resources available in a standard desktop workstation. In addition, ions exiting the thruster will be sampled to generate a discretized source model for use with subsequent thruster plume modeling. Plume modeling is necessary to optimize thruster spacecraft coupling, and reduce possible instrument and spacecraft component contamination effects. These three components, magnetic field line, thruster discharge, and the spacecraft environment, form the three scales of our multiscale approach. In this effort we will concentrate on extending the capability of modeling thruster discharges by developing a new light-weight hybrid code with built in support for kinetic mobility modeling.","The product that will be developed under this proposal will directly benefit NASA by providing it with a tool capable of analyzing the influence of various system variables during the design process of new high power Hall thrusters. Possible uses include selection of wall materials to reduce electron energy losses, selection of wall materials to improve thruster lifetime, optimization of magnetic circuit to take advantage of effects such as the magnetic mirror and magnetic lens, optimization of thruster geometry by utilizing non-conventional designs such as cylindrical or multi-channel configuration, and optimizing the electron currents produced by the cathode to reduce plume divergence and thus reduce plume divergence. Predictive thruster model will in addition serve as a source model for plume modeling of the thruster integrated on a spacecraft. This will allow the mission designer to optimize the placement of the thruster on the spacecraft to reduce secondary interaction of plume particles with sensitive spacecraft sensors and components.","The need to simplify the design and analysis, and reduce the inherent complexity of Hall thrusters is not limited to NASA. Other government entities, including the Air Force, have an existing need for such programs. Our effort will be applicable to both the high power Hall thrusters proposed by NASA, as well as low power thrusters being investigated by other government entities and commercial partners for near-Earth operations such as station keeping and orbit rising. The simulation tool that will be developed under this effort can thus also serve private industry, companies such as Aerojet, Busek that are developing Hall thrusters and will be able to use this predictive tool in the design process. In addition, we plan to leverage the lessons learned in this effort to further enhance multiscale modeling capability for rarefied gas applications. One such topic includes modeling of space environment interactions. The spacecraft community in large is in need of codes that can predict potential contamination and charging events, and their effect on spacecraft operation. Of interest is the wall interaction of plasma particles. The domains of interest (spacecraft system) are of size too large to allow direct modeling of wall interaction details. Multiscale modeling of the system is thus required.","Ceramics; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Main Engine"

Inc. proposes to develop a high power (high thrust) electric propulsion system featuring an iodine fueled Hall Effect Thruster (HET).  The system to be developed will include a thruster, hollow cathode, and condensable propellant feed system.  The nominal power level of the thruster developed in this program will be 20 to 50 kW.  The thruster can be clustered to support ~200 kW class missions to the moon, Mars, and beyond.  In a future program, the technology can be scaled to ~100 kW per thruster to support MW-class missions.  The available specific impulse can be throttled between 1500s to will be as high as 3000 to 4000 s.  The use of iodine propellant enables significant mass and cost savings for lunar and Mars cargo missions, including Earth escape and near-Earth space maneuvers.  High purity iodine is readily available commercially in large quantities at a fraction of the cost of xenon.  Iodine stores at a density that is 3 times greater than xenon and at less than one thousandth of the pressure.  Thus, iodine may be stored in low volume, low mass, low cost propellant tanks instead of the relatively large, high pressure, high cost COPV tanks required for xenon Hall thruster systems.  Busek has already demonstrated a low power (several hundred watts) iodine thruster system based upon its flight qualified BHT-200 thruster.  At most points, the efficiency are the same or nearly the same given experimental uncertainty.  However, iodine may have a significant performance advantage at high power:  Iodine yielded significantly higher specific impulse and thrust to power at higher input power.  This effect will be investigated with the proposed high power system.","The proposed 20 to 50 kW thruster system has many applications both as a stand-alone system and as part of a much larger (higher power) cluster.  The thruster will be well suited for orbit raising and interplanetary transfers, supporting exploration and science missions.  The demonstrated throttling ability is important for a singular thruster that might be called upon to propel a spacecraft from Earth to Mars or Venus.  Mars orbits at 1.52 AU, which reduces the solar constant to 43% of the value at Earth.  Venus orbits at 0.72 AU, which increases the solar constant to 190% of the value at Earth.  As a result the output power of a nominal 10 kW array varies between 4.3 and 19.1 kW as a spacecraft travels between these planets.  The ability to throttle efficiently is even more important for missions beyond Mars.","For DoD missions, including orbit raising for high power satellites and upper stages, the customer is the Air Force, via other defense contractors. A decade ago, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) initiated a program to cluster HETs as a means to reach the 100 kW to 150 kW power range desired for orbit transfer vehicles, space tugs, and re-supply vessels. Busek is working on the design an upper stage based upon the ESPA ring.  A high power iodine Hall thruster system will would enable a high throughput (propellant mass >1200 kg), high delta-V orbit transfer stage based upon the ESPA ring.  To carry more than ~450 kg of propellant, the system would have to be fitted with additional Xe propellant tanks that hang on the outside of the ring.  With iodine, the ring could easily contain over 1200 kg of propellant.For truly commercial activities, such as GTO to GEO transfers, the customers are commercial satellite vendors and operators.  Other potential customers are the emerging satellite servicing ventures such as MacDonald Dettwiler SIS and Vivisat.",Conversion; Fuels/Propellants; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices

Direct Discharge Power Processing Units (DDUs) have been proposed as an alternative due to their simplicity and low mass, but the achievable operating range of thrust and ISP is significantly limited because power regulation for DDUs is only achieved through gas flow control, array offpointing or shunting. This proposal presents a compromise between PPUs and DDUs called a Hybrid Direct Drive Power Processing Unit (HDDU) that provides a wider operating range than DDUs while reducing the mass and increasing the efficiency compared to conventional PPUs.  An HDDU provides filtering like a DDU, but it can additionally raise or lower the discharge voltage over a limited range. An HDDU only processes the power necessary to raise or lower the discharge voltage.  Several different converter circuits can be used in an HDDU. One approach uses an isolated high-efficiency resonant DC-DC converter with connections that can be configured through a set of electromechanical relays.  Another approach uses a novel soft-switching non-inverting buck-boost circuit that requires no relays, but is a little less efficient than resonant circuits. Straight-through direct drive operation is possible with either type of converter. The proposed HDDU would operate from an input voltage of 150 V to 300 V, and would provide 10 kW output power over a limited range such as from 150 V to 500 V. The HDDU approach is readily scalable by connecting modules in parallel because both proposed circuits naturally share output currents. The modular approach and enhanced operating range increase design re-use and reduce life-cycle costs.  A Phase II project could include making a more flight-like discharge supply and adding heater, keeper and magnet supplies.","Hybrid Direct Drive Power Processing Units are well-suited for both manned and unmanned Electric Path missions, and can be readily scaled to hundreds of kilowatts through parallel-connected modules.  With presently-available semiconductors, the optimum power level per module is probably around 10 kW, but higher-power semiconductors are expected to become available in the near future.  The power converters used in the HDDUs could be re-purposed for a variety of power conversion applications such as fuel-cell output converters and solar array simulators. The primary market for this technology is for high-power low-cost electric propulsion systems where Hall thrusters are likely to be used.  It is anticipated that the CPE HDDU will have a lower cost than state-of-the-art PPU designs.  Additionally, the high specific mass and high efficiency will reduce the overall system cost. The enhanced operating range capabilities compared to a pure direct drive can help enable missions where shifts between high thrust for short-term maneuvers and high ISP for long-term operation are desirable.  The wide-range capabilities and a modular design also enable one HDDU design to be used in a variety of different applications.","Hybrid Direct Drive Power Processing Units could be used for commercial and military satellites, both for station keeping and orbit lifting. The advantages outlined for NASA applications also apply here. One specific non-NASA application is for Aerojet thrusters that are being developed for geosynchronous satellite use. Commercial non-flight applications include laboratory bench power supplies. A path to high volume sales may be achieved by using the converters refined in this SBIR for general purpose scientific equipment.  The power converters used in the HDDUs could be re-purposed for a variety of power conversion applications such as fuel-cell output converters, solar array simulators and hybrid vehicles.",Airship/Lighter-than-Air Craft; Conversion; Distribution/Management; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Manufacturing Methods; Spacecraft Main Engine

To this end, the proposed fecal waste incinerator may be utilized to completely mineralize feces to harmless inorganic substances such as CO2 and water.  These products may then be rerouted to the ECLSS processes for hydrogen CO2 reduction to form water and water electrolysis to yield oxygen and hydrogen.  Fecal oxidation takes place in two coupled reactors utilizing advanced heat exchanger technology, one to incinerate the feces and the second to oxidize incineration products.  Little energy input is required due to the use of fecal matter heat of combustion in combination with efficient heat exchange.  Feces are incinerated immediately after collection, eliminating the need for waste stabilization that would otherwise be required to eliminate offensive odors and control microbial growth.  All evolved gases including incompletely oxidized volatile organics are passed through a catalytic reactor, ensuring complete combustion to avoid loading the Trace Contaminant Control System.  This innovative system is light, compact, simple, energy efficient, contains few moving parts, is virtually maintenance free, and requires little astronaut time.","The NASA application of this technology will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future long duration manned missions. The primary application will be for eliminating fecal waste produced during manned space operations, although this technology may also be applied toward incineration of other solid wastes such as non-edible, plant mass produced by agricultural cultivation in space habitats.  In addition, concentrated organic vapors produced by other solid waste treatment processes may be efficiently oxidized by utilizing this novel approach.","Non-NASA applications of this technology include the efficient incineration of medical wastes to insure sterilization and prevent the spread of pathogenic microorganisms.  Another attractive application of this technology will be the incineration of toilet wastes at remote locations, on board ships, or in third world countries where in particular pathogens are commonly transmitted via fecal waste.","Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Remediation/Purification; Waste Storage/Treatment"

Umpqua Research Company previously developed a complete microgravity compatible Single Phase Laundry System (SPLS).  Single-phase operation during the wash cycle facilitated microgravity compatible fluidics and eliminated problems associated with foams.  Pulsed water jets were utilized to agitate the clothing.  Drying was achieved with microwave assisted vacuum drying followed by a tumble cycle that greatly enhanced softness in the previously vacuum pressed clothing.  Tumbling was achieved by an array of three air jets, two to generate a cyclonic effect and a third to induce tumbling by blowing perpendicular to the plane of rotation.  This concept was successfully demonstrated during a KC-135 microgravity simulation flight.  The proposed AMCIL concept will build on the SPLS technology and incorporate key design improvements to reduced water requirements and lower power consumption.  Specific advancements include a redesigned wash cycle that consumes less water and reduces power demand.  The Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of the microgravity compatible liquid / liquid vapor, two-phase washing concept in a laboratory scale system.  A complete, automated prototype unit that incorporates the system parameters established during the Phase I tests will be designed, fabricated, and tested during the Phase II program.","The NASA application for the AMCIL system will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of long duration human missions beyond low Earth orbit where reductions in replacement clothing will lower the ESM for crew accommodations.  The AMCIL system is suitable for use in any long term space mission where resupply logistics preclude routine delivery of fresh crew clothing and removal of disposable clothing articles.  While the proposed laundry system is microgravity compatible, the system will be completely functional in reduced gravity environments.  Specifically, the proposed laundry technology will be suited to deployment on the Lunar and Mars surfaces, at Lagrange points, and onboard long range transit vehicles.","AMCIL has potential utility in any application where long term habitation is coupled with limited access.  Some obvious examples include isolated military outposts, research stations, naval vessels, research vessels, and commercial ships.  Each of these installations feature similar restrictions on available clean water, energy, and waste storage.  The ability to wash and reuse clothing with equipment that consumes small amounts of these valuable resources will reduce resupply requirements and improve quality of life.",Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Remediation/Purification; Waste Storage/Treatment

This project will use the novel high-flux and high-rejection FO membrane developed by Porifera, scaling up the membrane area, and incorporating it into a membrane module.  The project will benchmark the membrane performance in the module, and deliver a module to NASA for further testing in NASA-specific applications.","FO-based treatment processes have direct relevance to NASA's efforts to create technologies for long-term sustainability in space missions, specifically for treating grey water and even black water generated by the crew during space flight.  Moreover, NASA's Sustainability Base program incorporates the forward-osmosis based greywater recycling effort (run by Dr. M. Flynn at ARC) that would benefit directly and immediately from the results of this project.","FO-based water treatment could have important applications in the marketplace.  Currently, there is an enormous unfilled need (more than 2 Billion gallons/year) in the produced water market from oil and gas drilling, and FO could fill that niche with a simple, economical, and sustainable solution.

The Rapid Coliform Detector (RCD) amplifies the genetic material in a liquid sample to allow near real-time identification of specific genetic sequences, in this case, that of E. coli. This easy-to-use device incorporates a patented polymerase enzyme that enables rapid RNA amplification by reagents with superior long-term shelf life and thermal stability. A color change indicator will show the presence or absence of coliform bacteria in the water within 30 minutes. The results of the Phase 1 will be test data from prototype test kits and chemical reagents for rapid coliform detection which brings the RCD to TRL 4. The anticipated results of the Phase 2 are a flight-like prototype of the complete test kit and reaction chamber, performance test results at 1g, and reduced gravity operational test results, which bring the technology to TRL 6.","The RCD provides indication of the presence of E. coli within 30 minutes of sampling, with minimal consumable hardware. The RCD reduces crew time by eliminating the need to unstow, check, and restow a test kit after 2 days, and again after 5 days. Unlike the Water Microbiology Kit (WMK), there is no need for a syringe of growth media, and the RCD microbial capture device is smaller and lighter than that of the WMK. Another advantage of the rapid test is that if an E. coli infection is suspected in space, potential sources can be tested, and results determined quickly, so additional infections can be avoided. This technology can be used on the ISS and on future long-duration spaceflight missions.","The combined goals of this proposal will have a significant impact on terrestrial water quality management and on current diagnostic capability for detection of waterborne disease outbreaks, especially in areas that are currently not well served. Enhanced access to in-the-field diagnosis of locally relevant diseases will improve sanitation among populations in resource-limited settings. The technology will also promote better understanding of the epidemiology of emerging zoonotic and pandemic pathogens in real-time, will significantly reduce the response time to serious outbreaks, and could help combat any potential future biological threats.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Medical"

Regenerative CO2 removal systems are attractive for these missions because they do not use consumable CO2 absorbers.  However, these systems also absorb water and vent it to space along with the carbon dioxide.  This water loss can be prohibitively costly for long-duration missions.  Conventional condensing heat exchangers for water conservation are not attractive, since they would add a significant load to a spacecraft's thermal control system.  We propose to develop an innovative water recovery system that minimizes water lost from regenerative CO2 control systems without additional demands on the thermal control system.  This approach addresses the need for water recovery systems in long-duration missions, reduces the need for consumables by enabling use of state-of-the-art regenerative CO2 removal systems, and minimizes demands on the spacecraft thermal control system.

The unit is compact, typically weighs less than one day's worth of water loss, and adds negligible air pressure drop to the cabin ventilation circuit.  Combined with Creare's nonventing radiator technology, a similar system could be used in future EVA suits to prevent water from being vented along with carbon dioxide.","Creare's water recovery system can be used in terrestrial fuel cell power systems, where water management is a critical balance of plant function.

This novel technology would lead to ultra-compact, low-power, light weight, and high resolution hemispherical camera for EVAs.  The unique Neo360 optics offers advantages over any existing technologies. The HDC camera can: (1) Produce unwrapped hemispherical images optically without using any external computational hardware and software, greatly reducing size, weight and power (SWaP) of the HDC.(2) Capture real-time video of seamless hemispherical surrounding scene using no moving components; (3) Unwrap the hemispherical image optically and the outputs images/video is directly viewable for human interpretation; (4) Preserve image quality via optical unwrapping - no digital re-sampling artifacts that deteriorate image;(5) Acquire hemispherical scene with full pixel resolution of imaging sensor (conventional 360 optics acquires circular images, making 42% active pixels of sensor useless);(6) Eliminate time delay caused by digital processing - Hemispherical video can be transmitted directly;(7) Improve the image transmission efficiency by 70% for EVA video relay.","Future EVAs need to support high resolution imagery with ultra compact, low-power, high definition (HD) cameras and low loss compressed digital data output for radio frequency (RF) transmissions or IP networks. Hemispherical and dynamic cameras are desired for EVAs, where the hemispherical cameras take 360-degrees video of a crewmember, distorting (wrapping) the views through optics and then undistorting (unwrapping) those views via software on the ground to pan /zoom for total situational awareness.  The proposed novel optical unwrapping technology would lead to ultra-compact, low-power, light weight, and high resolution hemispherical dynamic camera (HDC) for EVAs.

What most of the inflatable concepts are lacking is the ability for integrated structural members that do not require permanent inflation pressure.  Any structure requiring inflation pressure for structural stability becomes hazardous in case of puncture due to micrometeorite impact or crew activity; it's hard enough to fix the puncture without the whole structure collapsing around the operator like a tent.  Additionally the structural supports should allow for the integration of hard points or other modular functionalities.Adherent Technologies, Inc. has been actively developing stabilization concepts for space inflatables for years.  Applications ranged from inflatable shelters, with or without self-healing capabilities, antenna structures, inflatable wing concepts, and structural repair tape.  The technology is known as Rigidization on Command™ (ROC), and is accepted as the best solution to preserve inflatable structures in the absence of inflation pressure.  The materials have been shown to store in minimal volume using both z-fold and rolling approaches, without damage to the core fiber structures.  ATI is now proposing to extend the approach to structural elements to add strength to these structures, and provide building blocks for structurally challenging substructures like floors or roof supports for regolith-covered radiation resistant shelters.  Resin impregnated fiberglass, carbon fiber and other advanced reinforcing materials will be used to obtain optimal mechanical properties at minimum weight.  As a proof of concept, the Phase I program will concentrate on the basic unit of most modular structural construction, the I-beam.  Goal of the program is a 3m demonstration beam.","Structural, load-bearing elements for a future extraterrestrial installation are nearly impossible to launch once they exceed a certain length.  Beams can be assembled from shorter pieces, but suffer an excessive weight penalty in the form of fasteners.  The rigidizable inflatable beams designed in this project will require minimal storage volume and can be produced to nearly any length and size while still fitting in projected launch vehicles.  As such they will be an enabling technology for large living spaces on future long-duration flight missions.",The primary commercial market for inflatable rigidizable structures is in emergency or semi-permanent installations for military and relief operations.  The ability to strengthen these structures with rapidly erectable structural members will greatly enhance wind resistance and the ability to carry overhead loads.  With the emergence of inflatable bridge structures the use of rigidizables will be an important step forward to make such structures permanent.,In Situ Manufacturing; Polymers; Space Transportation & Safety

Our proposed approach utilizes a benzoxazine resin formulation including a small main-chain oligomer in combination with a high performance monomer.  This novel approach will provide for low resin viscosity to allow easier infiltration of the resin mixture into fibrous reinforcements, while maintaining superior mechanical properties, particularly temperature resistance.  This technology will allow utilization of well-known manufacturing techniques capable of preparing large scale structures having affordable, reliable, predictable performance with reduced costs.  The processing characteristics will be targeted to molding methods including resin transfer molding, vacuum assisted resin transfer molding, autoclave molding, and similar methods.  To achieve these processability improvements we propose using a benzoxazine resin mixture of small main-chain oligomers based on bisphenol-F isomers and oxydianiline in combination with a high performance monomer.  The high performance monomer is specifically designed to enhance the rate of polymerization through the near-neighbor approach.  The polybenzoxazine matrix will be reinforced with carbon fibers.  This work will extend previously demonstrated lightweight polybenzoxazine polymer achievements by utilizing enhanced modern chemistry to extend the processing window.  The result will be a superior lightweight material with superior processability compared to other polymer matrix composites.",The proposal is specifically targeted to the NASA applications highlighted in the X5.02 solicitation.  The proposed lightweight polybenzoxazine composites are potentially relevant to the following NASA applications: Space transportation vehicles; International Space Station Modules; Micrometeoroid and Orbital Debris Shielding; and Thermal protection structures.,"The developed composites can be applied to broad commercial aerospace use due to ease of processing and advantageous property profiles.  Very recently, Airbus has qualified use of benzoxazine-based composites for interior and exterior applications using the first generation benzoxazine chemistry.  The benzoxazine chemistry proposed in this SBIR proposal is a further advanced system that may be termed as the second and third generation benzoxazines.  Thus, the benzoxazine technology that has already been accepted in the demanding aerospace arena can further be advanced.

Reinforcing specific critical areas in PMCs is most advantageous for structural durability. Since carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have exceptionally high tensile strength, they can be used as a functional additive to enhance the mechanical properties of PMCs in these critical areas. However, there are known issues with dispersing and aligning CNTs in the polymer matrix, thus limiting their strength-bearing properties. The proposed Phase I program aims to demonstrate a novel means of incorporating aligned CNTs specifically, and only, where they are needed during fabrication of a PMC component structure, thus limiting their use to specific areas where they are wanted. The key innovation uses a commercially-viable nanofiber technology to both disperse and to align the CNTs. The continuous nanofibers will be formed into Nanofiber-Reinforcing Mats (NRMs) which will be used during layup of the carbon PMC structure and placed only where added reinforcement is needed. For demonstration of feasibility in Phase I, prepregs will be used, but the concept is adaptable to other forms of PMC manufacturing such a filament winding. In Phase II we will scale-up the technology and fabricate large test samples, which will involve working with a prepreg manufacturer and fabricator of PMC component parts, in order to meet NASA specifications.","The specific NASA applications for the technologies we propose to develop are for light weight structures such as would be used for in-space applications and launch vehicles. In addition, the developed technologies would find use in NASA aerospace applications such as rockets, aircraft, aircraft/spacecraft propulsion systems, and supporting facilities. The reinforcing aspect of the developed technology will allow for more efficient joining of fiber composite parts, thus offering additional weight-savings. More robust structures capable of withstanding micrometeoroid and space debris impacts will be possible with the enhanced mechanical properties imparted by the aligned CNTs incorporated into the fiber composite structure, as well as the potential for improved electrical and thermal properties.","Commercial applications of the proposed technology are many, especially as fiber composites have made their way into various markets. It will be especially useful in applications where added reinforcement is needed in specific critical areas and where weight savings may be crucial. PMC components and parts are used in commercial aircraft (e.g., cargo floor panel, nose strake, air conditioning duct)  and sporting goods (e.g., tennis rackets, ski equipment, fishing rods and golf clubs). The automotive industry has increasingly used PMCs – the average automobile today has about 250 lbs of plastics and composites. Another application of these materials is in bridge ""rehabilitation"".

Resolving anomalies in real-time and preventing their future occurrence can be difficult.  Operations personnel must capture the conditions leading up to the anomaly from voluminous telemetry logs; the development of a workaround is a trial and error process; users must also determine if the anomaly affects a piece of equipment or a class of equipment; and the reconfiguration of the equipment under the conditions of the anomaly may preclude certain other operations.  Using software from previous research, we propose to design and develop an automation framework that provides 1) the ability to capture the system configuration at the time of the anomaly, using processed telemetry and execution states from both plan and procedure execution; 2) a workaround authoring capability to produce first flight notes and eventually full workaround procedures, derived from the original procedures; 3) the ability to efficiently modify the preconditions and the effects of the workaround as well as the configuration of the underlying models and the affected operational constraints; and 4) an interactive ability to generate operations plans that use the workaround procedures to test the workarounds, new operational constraints and other affected procedures.","Mission planning and execution is at the core of all space missions in order to efficiently employ high cost space assets such as astronauts, equipment, vehicles and communication links.

Because this development will have been done in concert with MCC flight controllers, we believe its use will resonate with program managers in the mission operations directorate.

Rather than being used as scarce, specialized resources, these entities will be relied upon to play an integral role on the future battlefield.  As the military begins to move from teleoperations to semi-autonomous and autonomous operations, it will be plagued with the same anomaly resolution problems as NASA.  Our technology will again serve as a unifying framework to streamline and reduce errors in problem resolution related to integrated human and robotic systems. A mirror of NASA space operations are operations in refineries, chemical plants, nuclear and other power plants and any installation that has established standard operating procedures that must be carefully followed under often stressful situations.

This requires electronics that can operate reliably over a wide range of temperatures and in the presence of radiation. The range of functions needed at various points across a given platform require use of digital, analog and high-voltage circuits, partitioned either independently or in combinations on the same chips.  Currently, there is no ""common denominator"" integrated circuit process that can effectively support all applications; extreme-environment systems must include the best-in-class technologies.  Circuit design techniques which can produce hardened circuits across a number of technology nodes are essential to producing IP that can be ported and applied to the best technology for the task at hand.   Delay-insensitive (DI) asynchronous digital logic, such as NULL Convention Logic (NCL) is one such technique that can be applied to produce radiation-hardened wide-temperature electronics across many process nodes.  DI logic can produce circuits with wide-temperature, threshold-independent operation and has shown tremendous potential for radiation-hardness through use of its dual-rail encoding scheme.   DI logic has been successfully demonstrated in digital and mixed-signal applications down to 130nm in bulk silicon and SiGe processes over a wide range of temperature.  An opportunity thus exists to apply the asynchronous DI approach to other space-applicable technologies where reliable digital processing needed, including SOI for high-voltage processes for power processing and conditioning.  Proposed is the design of a wide-temperature wide-voltage range RS-485 interface suitable for power and actuator control applications built using DI-NCL gates and wide-temperature design techniques in a high-power radiation-hard process.","A proven and characterized DI cell library in high-power wide-temperature SOI technology completes a bridge for a reliable digital design technique between silicon, SiGe mixed-signal circuits and high-power applications. Further, as state-of-the-art RS-485 chips have limited voltage and temperature ranges for space applications (min. -55o C), producing a wide-temperature (cryogenic rated) radiation-hardened RS-485 interface has immediate usefulness to NASA and clearly advances the state of the art with the opportunities for integration it provides.

Due to the uniqueness of emission signatures, they can be related directly to specific components within the monitored system. In this Phase I effort, representative avionics components will be artificially aged to the point of failure as they are monitored using Nokomis' AELED based Electronic Health Monitoring (EHM) system.

In addition to the IVHM program and applications in commercial aircraft, the ESMD seeks better tools and methods to ensure safe launch, flight, and mission operation of the many components of the overall Constellation and Exploration architecture. Of interest for these applications are new technologies that can provide better monitoring and diagnosis capabilities while minimizing sensor mass and volume requirements such as those provided by the proposed system.","In addition to NASA applications, Nokomis has identified customers in the commercial market for aeronautics health management. Because safety and system health is an important issue for vital electronics used in aerospace across the board, the system proposed in this effort has the ability to meet the needs of an ever-growing commercial market space.  Commercial space systems companies developing sensor systems and launch systems will benefit from this technology in order to improve the reliability of and protect expensive systems from catastrophic failure. Compared to current market health management solutions, Nokomis is prepared to increase cost-savings, performance standards and system safety. Because of these immense advantages, Nokomis is well positioned to address the market needs of the commercial aeronautics industry.","Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Characterization; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Electromagnetic; Quality/Reliability; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation)"

These include ultra-high reliability, safety, sustainability and affordability of launch vehicles and spacecraft.  These requirements, in turn, are allocated among critical subsystems, such as engines, propellants, structures, software systems, thermal protection, power, avionics, life support, guidance, communication and navigation.  In this vein, novel integrated system health management (ISHM) technologies that evolve with the system life-cycle, viz., concept-> design-> development-> production-> operations and training, are essential for meeting the requirements of safe and ultra-reliable, sustainable and affordable launch vehicles and spacecraft.   NASA has been employing a number of reliability tools and methods, FMECA, FTA and PRA, for designing reliable and safe systems. However, the current methods are ad hoc, prone to errors and do not evolve with the system life-cycle.  In response to these challenges, Qualtech Systems, Inc. (QSI) propose to develop an integrated system health management (ISHM) tool and a concomitant process for new heavy lift launch systems and exploration precursor robotic missions. The new risk and design analysis tool, when coupled with QSI's diagnostic and prognostic tools (QSI's Testability Engineering and Maintenance System (TEAMS) toolset) will simplify early-stage design of health management functionality during the development of space systems (e.g., safety and mission assurance analysis, failure modes, effects and criticality analysis, hazards analysis, functional models, fault propagation models, testability analysis, design for serviceability, sustainability and affordability). The TEAMS SW suite already hosts a number of these desired capabilities. Consequently, QSI proposes to introduce additional modeling and analytic capabilities to TEAMS and enhance the existing, so as to make it an enhanced support tool for ISHM.","NASA's current vision to enhance the level of autonomy for vehicle health management and mission planning makes the proposed effort worthy of funding from several branches within it. Clearly, establishing the technology and the software so that it readily operates as part of NASA's next generation Mission Control Technology allows NASA to utilize the continuous health assessment and mission satisfiability information from our tool for improved mission execution and reconfiguration while improving safety, mission success probability and reducing flight controller and crew workload.","Among the other agencies, DoD and Air-force and Navy are the most potential customer for the resulting technologies. Large scale military systems (systems of systems) such as NORAD, Space Command ground segments, the Joint Strike Fighter fleet, the Navy shipboard platforms, Submarine Commands and ballistic missile defense (BMD) systems can be potential areas to field the proposed technology. In addition, UAVs, UMGs and other unmanned submersible vehicle markets could also be potential target for the proposed technology. The product is also expected to be of commercial value to the manufacturers of DoD and military's remotely guided weapons and reconnaissance systems.",Diagnostics/Prognostics

ABATRODs accommodate fast changes in environment while actively shaping the response to muscle actuation to that anticipated by the operator, allowing the operator to maintain focus on task objectives.  The ABATROD architecture uses principles of L1 adaptive control to decouple the task of adaptation and environmental uncertainty from the operator perceived response, thereby enabling the design of a range of apparently nonintrusive augmenting and telerobotic device technologies. The L1 paradigm significantly widens the domain of safe operation within which operator-induced instability can be eliminated without tuning. This effort makes innovative contributions to NASA-relevant space exploration tasks: (i) sustained and accurate manipulation of physical control interfaces on machinery and vehicles by an operator on a shaking space vehicle or rover, (ii) the stable and coordinated handling of scientific or photographic hardware by an astronaut during ambulation across uneven terrain, and (iii) the precise and reliable control of telerobotic devices for robotic-EVAs in unpredictable conditions.","This effort makes innovative contributions to NASA-relevant space exploration tasks: (i) sustained and accurate manipulation of physical control interfaces on machinery and vehicles by an operator on a shaking space vehicle or rover, (ii) the stable and coordinated handling of scientific or photographic hardware by an astronaut during ambulation across uneven terrain, and (iii) the precise and reliable control of telerobotic devices for robotic-EVAs in unpredictable conditions.

Bioassistive device technology may be used to augment normal function, to prevent injury to function, and/or to rehabilitate injured function. Exoskeletal devices for augmenting normal function enable increased load-carrying capabilities and sustain robust gait characteristics in adverse terrain. In telerobotic applications, normal function is augmented through the transformation of human motor activity to different scales of motion and force.  Further, exoskeletal devices for preventing injury to function alleviate the occurrence of repetitive stress disorders through compensatory action, enable heavy lifts, and support added loads, say a back pack on a child's back to prevent developmental damage.  Finally, exoskeletal devices may be used for rehabilitating injured function to assist locomotion-impaired or otherwise disabled individuals, prevent circulatory problems in extremities, and enable the resumption of every-day activities involving sustained balance and support.

The thin film fuel cell is comprised of a micro-thin electrolyte (thickness ~ 1??m) that is grown on a foil nickel substrate.  The nickel substrate is then made into a porous anode by lithographic patterning and etching of the foil. The SOFC structure is completed by the deposition of a thin-film mixed ionic-electronic conducting oxide cathode on the electrolyte.  Preliminary data has shoen the thin film fuel cell to have an output of ~ 100mA/cm2 at temperatures as low as 500C – more than 400C lower than for typical bulk SOFC's. A single cell has a total thickness of 15-20 micron, and the integration of interconnects to the cells to form a stack is projected to result in a cell power density of > 5W/cm3 – more than 20x greater than typical SOFC's.","The unique projected performance parameters of the thin film solid oxide fuel cell promise promise to deliver to NASA a high power density, low mass fuel cell that at the nominal 30 W stack projected for the Phase II program will form the basic module for larger power output fuel cells at the 1kW level and beyond.  Such an electrical power source will supply NASA needs for compact, high power density energy sources for various lander, robotic vehicle, astronaut, habitat, and other distributed planetary surface energy needs in space.  It is projected that many multiple kW of fuel cell power capacity will be required by NASA (and other space faring nations) for the lunar, Mars and beyond Mars environments, especillay those places where the atmosphere and or the body has water present from which hydrogen and oxygen can be extracted to yield fuel and oxidizer for fuel cells.

Consumers are focusing on these qualities more so with time, and this 'clean' aspect of the fuel cell will add significantly to market pull.   Discussions have been initiated with a firm interested in the fuel cells for application to distributed and 'clean' power.

The PEMFC generally consists of an MEA supported on two sides by gas diffusion media.  The gas diffusion media of choice is generally carbon-based in the form of a carbon fiber paper, or carbon cloth material.  In the standard operating environment of a H2/O2 fuel cell the anode and cathode potentials are near 0 and 0.7-1.0, respectively.  Carbon is generally stable in this potential range.  Due to flooding, or during shut-down and start-up, oxygen may permeate the membrane and consume all of the hydrogen at the anode.  If this occurs localized voltages above 1.6 V are possible, well above the carbon corrosion potential.  For this reason GES proposes to replace the carbon fiber paper based gas diffusion media with an equivalent metallic fiber paper.  GES has already demonstrated the electrochemical suitability of these materials by operating them in an electrolyzer for > 3500 hours above 1.7 V.  The major challenge is to wet-proof the metallic media to avoid flooding from fuel cell product water.","NASA has a strong need to replace carbon as the diffusion media material in H2/O2 fuel cells to avoid corrosion during start/stop cycling.  The use of H2/O2 fuel cells is critical in both lunar, satellite, and manned space travel applications.  Historically, the use of metallic sinters and screen packs required the use of a thick membrane as the sinters and screens had large pore sizes and could not properly support a thin membrane.   This leads to high resistances, and prevents NASA from taking advantage of membrane innovations such as Gore's Primea™ membrane, or GES's own thin Dimensionally Stable Membrane™.  The thinner pore size and tighter tolerances of the proposed metallic papers will allow NASA to realize the performance and efficiency gains of these materials.  Additionally, GES's own unique knowledge of wet-proofing metallic media will allow the elimination of carbon, making the fuel cell more durable and easing the requirement at start/stop.","GES already has two developed commercial electrolyzer products, analytical hydrogen and life support oxygen; as well as a third in development industrial hydrogen, and this material could prove beneficial in all three applications.  In the analytical hydrogen application this material could supplant a multi-pieced screen-pack currently in use at the oxygen electrode, greatly reducing manufacturing labor.  In GES's naval electrolyzers for life-support oxygen, this material could potentially replace a gas diffusion electrode support structure that consists of over three dozen parts.  Finally in an emerging market, that GES is aggressively pursuing, that of water electrolysis for industrial hydrogen; this material may allow for the use of thinner membrane materials, thereby improving efficiency and giving GES a competitive advantage.","Coatings/Surface Treatments; Conversion; Metallics; Polymers; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Storage"

The MSPS will employ innovative fabrication and/or laser welding processes for reliable liquid metal pumped loop compatibility with a next-generation heater head designed for nuclear system integration. Phase I will culminate in a concept definition and design as a foundation for analysis, detailed design, fabrication, and testing in Phase II.Development of the MSPS concept opens many avenues of application for commercial and government markets. Within NASA, the system will provide mission support for future space transportation and surface power with a very reliable, high-efficiency Stirling converter for the conversion of reactor heat into electricity.","The Modular Stirling Power System (MSPS) is ideally suited for use with Space Nuclear Power Systems (SNPS) and/or Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) systems. The proposed system will in no way be constrained by the availability of special isotopes, as is the case for small space power systems and can be easily interfaced with liquid metal cooling loops like those under development for future space transportation and surface power applications. Modular in nature, the MSPS enables varying power levels (12kW multiples with existing pre-commercial convertors or higher with redesigned systems) depending on mission power requirements with each module made up of a power conversion system, heat rejection system, and associated controls that can be interfaced with a reactor to meet specific mission applications.","ITC expects the MSPS interface to adapt core 3 kW Stirling engine technology for numerous additional synergistic commercial products and markets where the attributes of low noise, high efficiency, low emissions, and maintenance-free operation are valued. Higher power levels offered by the MSPS through the joining of multiple pre-commercial convertor technology into a single heater head exchanger coupled with the lower temperature deltas from source to sink, open many markets.

Recent advances in manufacturing of Inverted Metamorphic Multi-junction (IMM) solar cells have opened new opportunities to greatly improve the specific power of the devices by means of removal of the epitaxial substrate. To date, flexible high efficiency IMMs have been fabricated and demonstrated in the framework of a space cell with IMMs released from the epitaxial substrate onto traditional coverglass. An increasing larger body of research is aimed at populating large area ""blankets"" with IMMs and this has led to a number of approaches that includes removal of rigid epitaxy growth substrates and adherence to lightweight flexible webs or polymer films.

The proposed effort will include development of a novel sacrificial intermediate layer on which high efficiency IMM photovoltaics are epitaxially deposited.","Nanohmics has targeted a method for generating hybrid inorganic cell/polymeric films using a low-cost continuous web process that will impact solar cell markets by providing a compelling advantage for increasing the specific power of the devices (W/kg) and the much lower production cost per unit area ($/W/m2). Specific power is a key figure of merit for applications such as spaceborne and high altitude power devices that have extremely tight total mass budgets (~ $10,000/ launched lb.) Coupled with the proposed low-cost, continuous-web method, both spaceflight and terrestrial-based markets will expand with the proposed novel technology","In the global solar cell industry, the formation of efficient IMM cells with power conversion efficiencies greater than ~ 25% will enable cost-effective wide spread adoption of alternative solar power photovoltaics.

The large volume of solar cells required for individual missions (hundreds of kilowatts to megawatts) also presents significant manufacturing challenges. MicroLink Devices' multijunction solar cells based on epitaxial lift off (ELO) provide the unique combination of high efficiency, high specific power, and low cost by enabling reuse of the GaAs substrate after lift off. The use of GaAs substrates leverages a platform well-established by the GaAs IC industry at 6-inch diameter, which is also a significant enabler for cost reduction and volume production. Larger substrates not only reduce epitaxial growth and fabrication costs, but improve wafer utilization when fabricating large-area solar cells. MicroLink Devices' ELO solar cells are also highly flexible, which enables new approaches for panel fabrication and deployment. In this SBIR program we will demonstrate the capability for high-volume epitaxial lift off using 6-inch GaAs material. Our previous development efforts at MicroLink Devices have focused primarily on 4-inch wafers. We will fabricate the first large-area (20 cm2) multijunction ELO solar cells on 6-inch GaAs and compare performance with 4-inch ELO material. To support the fabrication of hundreds of kilowatts of solar cells for very large arrays, it is essential that the ELO substrate removal process is capable of supporting very high volumes of wafers on the scale of hundreds to thousands of wafers per day.  We will demonstrate a 6-inch ELO process based on well-established semiconductor industry volume production tool sets and batch processing to achieve high throughput.

UltraFlex is a high-TRL solar array technology that spans the initial range of power levels with as-yet unmatched performance in specific power, stiffness, and strength. This technology has been to Mars, and is under development for the NASA Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) and the Cygnus ISS supply vehicle by Orbital Sciences.MegaFlex is UltraFlex technology, with two enhancements to allow a 2-wing configuration to provide power levels up to 350 kW with near-term cell efficiencies. This technology meets SEP development needs for true scalability and allows for complete ground test and validation of the entire wing in existing facilities. Given the compaction capabilities, MegaFlex is an enabling technology for any mission where the power needed is more than the stowage volume allows with standard technologies.  MegaFlex technology would also benefit lower power missions where higher compaction would allow use of a smaller, and less expensive, launch vehicle.MegaFlex achieves similar performance characteristics as UltraFlex with specific power up to 200 W/kg (versus 30-70 W/kg) and also higher stiffness (>3x) and strength (>5x) than conventional arrays.","MegaFlex achieves power levels up to 175kW per wing and is enabling technology for NASA SEP missions.  Two wings can provide up to 350kW for a SEP tug and more wings can be added to a spacecraft to further increase available power.  Beyond SEP, MegaFlex can support any mission with large power requirements using currently available technology, launch vehicles and test facilities.In addition to enabling high power missions, MegaFlex technology also allows higher compaction for smaller arrays.  This enables better array packaging and could potentially reduce spacecrafts sizes for a given power need, thus fitting into smaller launch vehicles for cost savings.","The same benefits that apply to NASA also apply to commercial applications.  MegaFlex enables the greatest power in the largest existing launch vehicles and ground test facilities for high power missions and also enables increased stowed compaction for lower power missions.  These benefits immediately apply to vehicles such as Lockheed Martin's Orion and Orbital's Cygnus and will apply in the future to commercial missions that require greater total power, higher compaction, greater specific power, higher stiffness or higher strength than can be achieved with conventional array technology.","Conversion; Generation; Simulation & Modeling; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation)"

This leads to uncertainty in the predictions of the magnitude and rate of TPS ablation.  Because in-flight monitoring is difficult, the uncertainty in actual boundary conditions and models must be considered when designing a TPS.  To reduce risk, designers must resort to trade-offs which often involve increasing heat shield mass.  Direct ablator temperature, heat flux and recession measurements would allow engineers to reduce design uncertainty and improve modeling.  These improvements will lead to decreased heat shield mass, enabling missions that are not otherwise feasible and directly increasing science payload and returns.Ultrasonic methods for real-time monitoring of ablator conditions including internal temperature distribution, heat flux and recession will be developed in this program. Internal localization methods of ultrasonic thermometry will be used to accurately measure temperature distribution to within close proximity of surface charring.  Temperature compensation will be applied to ultrasonic thickness gauging techniques to estimate surface recession in real time.  Heat flux can be extracted from the measured temperature distribution.  Combined together, these ultrasonic techniques will form a sensor system capable of sensing and relating real-world ablator performance to computational models as well as qualifying ablator materials.  When developed to maturation, such a sensor system even has applications for in-flight health monitoring.","Mass and heat dissipation performance are critical to thermal protection systems for many NASA objectives both in spaceflight and hypersonic flight.  Low-density carbon phenolics perform well in both of these critical parameters.

This particular material is of active interest to NASA, with its use in the upcoming Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) and the possibility of its selection for multiple future missions.  Real-time recession and heat flux measurements will support continued development of this class of ablators as well as mission specific implementation.  Ablator performance models can be enhanced with higher fidelity temperature data and used for faster development with decreasing cost.  Future programs are also in need of PICA and PICA class ablators.  Two of the New Frontiers Program proposals incorporate PICA for sample return missions including MoonRise, a Lunar South Pole-Aitken Basin Sample Return Mission which would place a lander in a broad basin near the moon's south pole and return approximately two pounds of lunar materials for study and Osiris-Rex which would rendezvous and orbit a primitive asteroid, returning more than two ounces of material from the asteroid's surface.","PICA and materials of its class are currently under development worldwide, including a Carbon-Resin by the European Space Agency (ESA).  The largest current scheduled user of PICA-class ablators is SpaceX which utilizes a PICA-X variant in the Dragon spacecraft for earth re-entry.  This environment is toward the lower end of heat fluxes and ablation to be encountered during a re-entry procedure.

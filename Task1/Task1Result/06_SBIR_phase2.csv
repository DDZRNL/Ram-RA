Before these algorithms can be used in civil aviation, progress is needed to (a) ensure that these innovative and frequently non-deterministic algorithms will always perform as expected and (b) address challenges associated with integrating these algorithms into an overall avionics system.  The authors addressed the second challenge by developing an integration approach called Operational Envelope Safety Assurance (OESA).  In Phase I, the authors showed that OESA can integrate control, path planning, diagnostics, and structural health monitoring algorithms in a way that ensures the subsystems will never issue commands that put the aircraft outside its safe-operating envelope.  In Phase II, the authors will formalize the approach, develop a general set of OESA subsystem specifications, and demonstrate safe integration of algorithms developed by other researchers under related research efforts.  Phase II will culminate in real-time high-fidelity demonstrations of an integrated controller for a NASA testbed (either the Langley AirSTAR GTM or the Dryden A-53 F-18 testbed) and will set the stage for Phase III flight tests.","The immediate Non-NASA application is algorithms, software, and tools for the civil aviation industry.  Additionally, the technology is well suited for high-level autonomous operations of unmanned vehicles (air and otherwise).  The proposer has an excellent track record transitioning algorithms of this nature for industry for use in commercial and defense-related applications.","The technology directly addresses Level 3 IRAC elements of the NASA Aviation Safety Program, and touches on Levels 1 and 2.  Additionally, by integrating structural health monitoring with inner- and outer-loop control, the approaches developed here would also be suitable for life extending control (i.e., using effector redundancy to minimize wear on key structural elements).  Finally, the technology is directly applicable to NASA's space exploration mission in that it provides trajectory generation and control algorithms that are capable of compensating for unforeseen failures or massive uncertainties in atmospheric conditions.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control; On-Board Computing and Data Management"

The Phase II development will provide a significant improvement in functionality of the system and put strong emphasis on process automation. NextGen is pursuing teaming arrangement with Boeing and Northrop Grumman to test the proposed system in realistic environment. During Phase I, the NextGen team established feasibility of the proposed system by evaluating it on a honeycomb plate, a common construction used in many secondary structures of aircraft. NextGen has chosen an outstanding team that has considerable prior experience, an in-depth understanding of damage modes in advanced composite structures, and comprehensive knowledge of damage detection techniques.

This dual use system will be capable of both imaging targets in low visibility scenarios, such as smoke, fog, haze, light rain, and low light levels, and providing an early warning of in-flight hazards, primarily icing conditions in clouds.  The polarization discriminating optical system and accompanying image processing software are capable of differentiating highly depolarizing surfaces from those that contribute little to depolarization.  Examples of this type of differentiation include water and ice phases in clouds and hard-target surfaces surrounded by an aerosol particulate media.  The NIR Lidar system is designed to operate around 1.5 m for maximum eye-safety, even when used from the ground.  Major components of the Lidar unit include a laser transmitter, a fast gated detector, and polarization switching components.  The performance of this type of system has been demonstrated in the Phase I project in laboratory experiments using custom built rain and fog generating chambers.  Both image enhancement of a hard target and detection differing depolarization ratios were demonstrated.  Backscattered noise from obscurants is greatly reduced by the fast-gated camera system, and a narrowband optical filter provides additional noise rejection.  The NIR Lidar system can be easily integrated with a database of common object types for identification of hard targets, such as obstacles on a runway.  Illuminated NIR imagery is ideal for providing images of hard targets, as object detail is very near that seen with a visible camera, unlike FLIR (forward-looking infrared) imagery, and the performance is equivalent in day or night conditions.","Visualization through common obscurants such as fog, rain, smoke, and haze represents a difficulty for many industries as well as the military.  As a result, the ability to add or enhance such visualization would have significant applications in commercial aviation, transportation and shipping, military surveillance and targeting systems, as well as law-enforcement and other related industries.  These potential applications have already been studied, and the current visualization issues that they are facing are being identified, so that continued development of the current RL Associates program may address these issues.  Key potential non-NASA customers/programs therefore appear to be commercial and military aircraft manufacturers (Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop Grumman), shipping builders (Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, Kaverner, etc), shipping lines, cruise ship companies, automobile manufacturers, and the Department of Defense (DOD). Several branches of the DOD have systems which stand to benefit from this proposed hazard detection technology.  Parties this technology targets include the Missile Defense Agency, for missile guidance systems, NavAir, for both airborne reconnaissance LIDAR applications and targeting systems, and Homeland Security, for in-port or aerial surveillance systems.","Successful development of the NIR Lidar technology will fill NASA needs in programs requiring atmospheric hazard detection, surveillance, hazard assessment and imaging through obscurants.  While system parameters of the planned prototype would make incorporation somewhat limited at this time, within the next 20 years, the FAA expects air traffic operations to increase by 150-250%.  To meet the demands of this high traffic environment, the Next Generation of Aviation Transportation Systems (NGATS/""NexGen"") will require significantly improved hazard mitigation systems both for ground-level and in-flight hazards.  NexGen systems will constitute perhaps the largest and most important NASA application. The NexGen vision calls for new capabilities that would substantially increase the capacity, with safety and efficiency, of the National Air-Space System (NAS).  Specific capabilities that are viewed as critical to the success of NexGen are Equivalent Vision Operations, which will allow the system to maintain visual flight rule capacities in instrument flight conditions, and Broad-Area Precision Navigation, which allows precise navigation anywhere in the airspace, including precision landing at any airport.  The RL Associates Hazard Mitigating Lidar System addresses both of these capabilities by placing a high priority on rapid and accurate hazard detection.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Optical; Photonics; Pilot Support Systems"

The specific focus of the research effort is adaptive diagnostic and prognostic algorithms for systems with slowly-varying dynamics.  Model-based machinery diagnostic and prognostic techniques depend upon high-quality mathematical models of the plant.  Modeling uncertainties and errors decrease system sensitivity to faults and decrease the accuracy of failure prognoses.  However, the behavior of many physical systems changes slowly over time as the system ages.  These changes may be perfectly normal and not indicative of impending failures; however, if a static model is used, modeling errors may increase over time, which can adversely affect health monitoring system performance.  Clearly, one method to address this problem is to employ a model that adapts to system changes over time.  The risk in using data-driven models that learn online to support model-based diagnostics is that the models may ""adapt"" to a system failure, thus rendering it undetectable by the diagnostic algorithms.  An inherent trade-off exists between accurately tracking normal variations in system dynamics and potentially obscuring slow-onset failures by adapting to failure precursors that would be evident using static models.   The proposed ADAPT will feature an innovative new parameter estimation algorithm and new adaptive observer / Kalman filter techniques designed specifically for health monitoring.  The research team of Barron Associates, Inc., the University of Virginia, and Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company will demonstrate ADAPT using a high-fidelity electro-hydrostatic actuator simulation.","The tool developed in this SBIR addresses an area of theoretical and practical importance to facilitate widespread application model-based health monitoring systems and model-based fault tolerant adaptive control systems. Non-NASA adaptive health monitoring applications will target significant advances for numerous aerospace and land-based systems, including military fixed-wing aircraft, unmanned air vehicles, military and civilian land-based vehicles, shipboard systems, and commercial and general aviation aircraft. The vast array of corporations and federally-funded entities currently engaged in prognostics and health management research and development creates the potential for a large contract R&D market. Furthermore, the proposed ADAPT technology provides a natural complement to other advanced intelligent vehicle control products already under development at Barron Associates.","This research effort clearly offers the potential for a significant leap in vehicle performance, operation, safety, and capability.  The technology will require a demonstration in an actual-flight environment to fully characterize and validate the performance that is predicted in simulation. The research is particularly relevant to NASA's Intelligent Flight Control System (IFCS), which has the objective of enabling a pilot to land an aircraft that has suffered a major systems failure or combat damage, and also to the Single Aircraft Accident Prevention thrust of the Aviation Safety Program in which Barron Associates has participated for a number of years.

The innovative 2-dimensional (2D) fastener design facilitates joining load-bearing hot structural assemblies and can be produced at a cost much lower than other competing designs and methods. Functional SiCf/SiCm composite fasteners having two (2) fiber reinforcement orientations of 0/90-degrees (cross-ply) and ±45-degrees (bias-ply) were fabricated for characterization. Testing of the respective fasteners included both axial tension and single-lap shear. The cross-ply reinforced SiCf/SiCm fasteners exhibited axial tensile and single-lap shear strengths of 38.0 and 33.1 ksi, respectively. The bias-ply fasteners exhibited axial tensile and single-lap shear strengths of 31.3 and 29.8 ksi, respectively. Using a generalized analytical method for determining the distribution of forces and stresses in the 2D mechanical fastener developed in Phase I, optimized configurations will be designed and produced in Phase II for evaluation. The metallic subcomponents used for Phase I demonstration will be produced using a high temperature-capable material (e.g., ceramic, superalloy). Aerodynamically smooth Cf/SiCm and SiCf/SiCm composite structural lap joints will be assembled using the optimized composite fastener system for characterization. Testing of the lap joint assemblies will performed to determine the flexibility and structural efficiency of the joint as a function of off-axis loading relative to the principal axis of the fasteners. Elevated temperature testing will be performed to establish the effects of temperature on the mechanical properties of the joint.","Advanced materials that are capable of surviving sustained extreme environmental conditions, and improved fabrication methods that provide low-cost, robust solutions are needed to achieve specific vehicle platform performance and mission goals. Near-term applications for ceramic composites include expendable chemical rocket thrusters for orbital insertion, on-orbit attitude control system and/or divert thrust chamber components for commercial and military communication spacecraft and/or various ballistic missile defense KE intercept weapons. Applications for ceramic composites in advanced airbreathing and rocket propulsion systems and control surfaces for reusable hypervelocity aerospace vehicles are currently being addressed, however the issues of durability, survivability and maintainability are concerns. Programs are in place for evaluating reinforced ceramics for land-based turbine components, heat exchangers and radiant burners, which represent opportunities in energy and pollution abatement technologies that may mature over the next 10 or so years. Most of these stated applications require joining and attachment to some extent their integration with other components and assemblies.","Hot structures fabricated from ceramic composite materials are an attractive design option for components of future high-speed aircraft, re-entry vehicles and propulsion systems to reduce weight and increase performance. One important detail in the design of such structures is that of joining and attachment. Large-area hot structures will likely be fabricated by joining smaller component sub-assemblies, since the technology to manufacture complex, co-processed integrated assemblies is immature, and hence of very high risk and cost. Conventional metallic fasteners and fastening techniques do not provide structurally tight joints over a wide temperature range due to the large differences in thermal expansion between the metal fasteners and the mating composite joint members. A metallic fastener, which is snug at room temperature, will loosen at elevated temperature. Excessive assembly preloading at room temperature to maintain a tight joint at elevated temperature may be detrimental to the structural integrity of the joint. Due to the inherent thermo-elastic and elevated temperature strength limitations of metallic fastener materials, ceramic composites on the other hand show real promise to enhance the high temperature performance of mechanically fastened joints in hot composite structures.",Ablatives; Aircraft Engines; Airframe; Ceramics; Composites; Launch and Flight Vehicle; Reuseable

Desktop Aeronautics will also develop a set of optimization tools well-suited to use with the geometry engine and aerodynamic analysis. This set of tools will permit aerodynamic shape optimization and multidisciplinary design at earlier stages in the vehicle development process.","For the same reasons listed in the above section, the proposed new tool would be useful to virtually all aerospace companies that perform aerodynamic design. Cart3D is used extensively in many large companies such as Boeing, Raytheon, and TRW. Smaller companies such as Aerion and Andrews Space also make use of the tool. Adding a viscous model would greatly enhance the accuracy of a code that is already used throughout the aerospace industry. The new analysis method would be especially appealing to smaller companies who cannot afford vast computer resources to perform aerodynamic optimization with Navier-Stokes codes. Euler+IBL with automation allows the smaller company to also perform viscous optimization, perhaps even at the preliminary design phase. The transition prediction capability significantly extends the design space into the realm of natural laminar flow designs.","Aerodynamic shape optimization with an Euler solver and integrated boundary layer method is used by all major aircraft manufacturers and certainly at NASA centers. The advantage of the proposed application is the time required to complete a design problem. Because the Cartesian Euler solver is virtually automatic, extremely robust, and time-efficient, and because the integrated boundary layer method allows the Euler solver to be useful in many flight regimes, this application could be used on virtually all aerospace vehicles. The addition of a transition model provides a new and unique capability to design aircraft that exploit natural laminar flow.",Aircraft Engines; Airframe

When drawn and processed in wire form, the shape change is an aggressive contraction, with useable lifetimes of millions of cycles. Despite this fact, SMAs have largely been a scientific curiosity, finding very little commercial use as actuators since their discovery over 30 years ago. The apparent lack of practical application may be attributable to their low recoverable strain (~4% of total wire length). MIGA Motor Company has numerous international patents covering Displacement Multiplication (DM) techniques that allow us to package large strokes in highly compact, lightweight packages. Our current commercially available electric linear actuators provide 1/2"" of stroke with 4.5 pounds of output force. We propose to develop several high force variants of our DM designs, allowing up to 32 lbf (high cycle count) or 48 lbf (hundreds of cycles) in a device weighing less than 2 ounces. The manufacturing techniques that we have developed in manufacturing the DM actuators have paved the way to expansion into the high force realm: high reliability wire attachment methods, use of high temperature thermoplastics, protected or over-molded precision chemically-etched stainless-steel stages, and various load-sharing techniques have enabled these powerful actuators to finally become a reality.","The medical industry represents the most urgent need for modern, high force, lightweight, linear electric actuators. The miniaturization of electronic components has fueled the desire for more portable equipment, and much of the diagnostic equipment in the medical industry today relies on motors, solenoids, or pneumatic actuators to move, latch, squeeze, etc, samples and subjects -in ever diminishing package sizes. There is a huge pent-up demand for assisted medical devices: those which require a human input, but also demand higher forces than can be applied by a single technician, or for long periods of time. The defense industry is another important market, requesting efficient electric actuators that can open and close weather-station doors in harsh environments across the world, for instance. Security is becoming an increasingly important business sector, and there are numerous demands for integrated security solutions, including electronic latching, dead-bolting, assisted entry systems, and use as redundant mechanisms in biometric security systems. Each of these applications requires higher forces than the current MIGA actuators can provide.","There are numerous applications for high-force linear electric actuators in the aerospace industry including latch-release devices, telescope and instrument door and aperture mechanisms, thermal management louver and thruster control actuators, aircraft control surface actuators, and remotely operated vehicle end-effectors or grippers. Robotic manipulators, rovers, and other exploration technologies can benefit significantly from these lightweight, high-force actuators with an extremely high force/weight ratio (over 350:1). MIGA actuators are compatible with ultra-high vacuum: made entirely out of high-temperature thermoplastics, Nickel-Titanium, and stainless steel (or titanium). No lubricants are required. The total part count is very low, enhancing reliability on orbit or in any other application. Also owing to their extremely low weight, they are nearly immune to high-g loads, and can be placed on the ends of lightweight structures to provide high force actuation.","Aircraft Engines; Attitude Determination and Control; Biomedical and Life Support; Cooling; Electromagnetic Thrusters; Electrostatic Thrusters; Erectable; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Human-Robotic Interfaces; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Kinematic-Deployable; Manipulation; Mobility; Multifunctional/Smart Materials; Perception/Sensing; Pilot Support Systems; Portable Life Support; Substrate Transfer Technology; Teleoperation; Tools"

The entire process can take a fraction of a second. This will provide electronic global access to airborne vehicles from any place.","Satellite transceivers can be extremely useful in many applications.

Programs such as the GRC Space Transceiver Radio System (STRS) seek to abstract the radio waveform from the hardware platform itself; this is meant to improve flexibility and promote component and subsystem reuse. In this Phase II effort Toyon proposes to perform work that will advance the state of the art in reconfigurable wireless transceivers in order to help realize the vision of STRS. Specifically, we propose to develop a modular, but highly integrated, digital and analog signal processing platform along with a standards-compliant waveform. The space-ready reconfigurable radio will serve a range of NASA missions and can be easily modified or enhanced for future needs. The RF front-end will be direct conversion with high integration of the frequency translation subsystems. For digital processing, we will pursue a system-on-a-chip (SoC) design with both reconfigurable logic and a soft-core processor implemented in a radiation-hardened Xilinx FPGA and PROM. The entire system architecture will leverage an EXP board-to-board connector design developed in Phase I. This system concept was validated in Phase I through Toyon's demonstration of a fully-functional packet-based 500 kbps waveform. In Phase II Toyon will pursue development of a waveform that is standards-based in order to further promote reuse and interoperability. Specifically, Toyon will develop a baseline implementation of the IEEE 802.16a standard. In addition to physical layer connectivity, such a waveform is well suited to IP-based networking, easing integration and increasing portability.","As a space-ready wireless transceiver is a relatively niche market, the potential non-NASA applications for the complete Phase II system outside NASA are limited. Potential transition customers could include the Air Force, DARPA, or MDA; these organizations work with systems that require operation in a wide temperature range and have radiation tolerance. Another market could be a wireless camera or other high-rate data links at nuclear power facilities. However, with the abstraction of hardware and software that Toyon is pursuing in this effort, it is very feasible that subsystems could be readily reused for a wide range of non-radiation hardened applications. Particularly as we are developing a solution around the IEEE 802.16 waveform, there are a host of potential end-user and business-to-business markets that Toyon could pursue. One option would be to license design services or intellectual property developed in the Phase II effort. This could be for both the RF and digital designs themselves as well as the hardware and software cores that will reside in the FPGA and SoC processors.","A wide range of technologies will need to be further developed in order to fulfill the needs of future manned and unmanned space exploration. While there are a range of NASA mission needs Toyon's reconfigurable wireless transceiver could target, one of the most promising is high-speed data links for surface exploration. For instance, with lunar missions there will be new needs, and associated challenges, with regard to data communications to and from vehicles, persons, and command centers. In one configuration, Toyon's software defined radio (SDR) could be paired with a high definition imager and associated codec in order to transport high-rate image data among several nodes in a multi-hop, ad hoc network. Such links could be used for general situational awareness, remote piloting of vehicles, airlock guidance, in addition to a range of scientific and marketing applications.","Architectures and Networks; Highly-Reconfigurable; RF; Radiation-Hard/Resistant Electronics; Telemetry, Tracking and Control"

The filters are a key enabler for this highly reconfigurable, fault tolerant, cell-phone sized EVA radio.  For UHF and S-band, HDI will employ its proprietary contour-mode aluminum nitride MEMS piezoelectric resonator technology.  Processed on silicon substrates, the resonators have their natural frequency defined by the lateral, in-plane dimensions of the structure.  This feature enables the definition of different frequencies directly at the CAD layout level.  Thus, the low insertion loss UHF and S-band filters can be monolithically integrated into a single chip.  For the Ka-band, HDI will employ coaxial 3D MEMS interdigital filters that exhibit low insertion and ripple in a miniaturized form factor.  Several US companies have expressed a keen interest in HDI's technology.In Phase I, HDI successfully proved the feasibility of employing the proposed UHF, S-band, and Ka-band filters in NASA's software defined EVA radio through simulation and microfabrication pilot studies.  The filters can be monolithically integrated onto the same silicon substrate, resulting in substantial savings in board space.  The objective of Phase II is to build the filter prototypes and deliver them to NASA for testing.  The results of the Phase I feasibility study convincingly justify Phase II continuation.","The filters proposed by Harmonic Devices will provide a compelling value proposition to mobile phone OEMs by reducing component count and freeing up valuable board space so designers can continue to add new features, reduce costs and shrink form factors.  The current directly addressable market size is estimated at approximately $1.7B per year.  Since these AlN resonators are fabricated with standard CMOS semiconductor processing steps on silicon substrates, they could ultimately become less expensive than legacy surface acoustic wave (SAW) and quartz crystal passives.  Several US companies have expressed a keen interest in HDI's technology.  There is an extensive market for filters and resonators outside of the wireless handset market.  Other applications include frequency control semiconductors for space, consumer, military, automotive, and industrial electronics.  In the VHF / UHF range, contour-mode AlN filters and resonators can be orders of magnitude smaller than their SAW counterparts.","The UHF, S-, and Ka-band filters are a key enabler for NASA's next-generation cell-phone sized EVA SDR radio.  This miniaturized, low power, and light-weight EVA radio improves astronaut maneuverability and provides fault-tolerant, reliable communication in harsh conditions.

Important areas include active microwave / synthetic aperture radar, short-range radio modules for miniature satellites, radio astronomy, and GPS. Because of its inert physico-chemical properties, the AlN resonators function over a wide-range of harsh temperature, power, and pressure conditions.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Highly-Reconfigurable; RF; Telemetry, Tracking and Control"

This will include digital image compression algorithms as well as system level integration, encompassing the image sensor all the way to compressed imagery data transport.  To accomplish these goals Toyon will design a complete FPGA-based video compression system. The novel aspect of this design lies in the dynamically reconfigurable hardware IP cores that will interface to an embedded processor. Similar to a software defined radio (SDR) system where separate RF waveforms are loaded at runtime, Toyon aims to reload separate image compression encoders.  This enables the use of several different image/video compression standards, all on the same hardware platform.  The dynamically reconfiguring architecture of this system enables a single image sensor and hardware platform to handle the two most common space video camera applications, while still maintaining low power consumption in a highly integrated package.  First, H.264 for high framerate, real-time video for situational awareness and surveillance.  Second, lossless JPEG200 encoding for scientific and research post-processing.  However, due to limited funds for this Phase II design, we will most likely work with a purchased H.264 IP core along with a standard JPEG compression core, which Toyon developed on the Phase I of this program.  Providing the capability to reconfigure for both motion video and still image compression will provide near-term utility and demonstrate feasibility for Phase III development.  Toyon will target the solution to a custom fully radiation hardened hardware platform.  Potential radiation hardened components include a Xilinx FPGA, Xilinx PROM, Atmel SRAM memory, Aeroflex voltage regulators, and a Cypress CMOS image sensor paired with space-ready optics.","Potential NASA applications have direct non-radiation hardened terrestrial counterparts, with possible platforms including vehicles, personnel helmets, aircraft, and permanently mounted structures.

This ability was demonstrated not only in ambient conditions but also in a thermal/vacuum chamber replicating Mars pressure and extreme temperatures. The rotary percussive approach is simple, robust, and highly efficient with regards to power and mass.  During the SBIR 2006 Phase I effort, Alliance took this heritage device and expanded its potential to include coring against a variety of rock materials anticipated to be encountered on Mars. Through the use of a breadboard fixture, coring bit designs and coring parameters were evaluated to identify optimum combinations. At the completion of test a conceptual design was generated taking this coring experience into account and adding core retention, break and ejection features. A bit change mechanism, identified as a requirement for successful operation while maintaining design robustness and simplicity, was added as well.  A Phase II effort is now proposed that will take this conceptual design into prototype form. Primary activities to be performed during Phase II will include:   Additional coring test runs to work out final details of detail bit design  Detail design and prototyping of core handling mechanisms  Prototype testing of core handling mechanisms  Design and manufacture of full prototype LSAS Corer system  Testing of prototype LSAS corer  Integration of LSAS corer onto robotic platform and functional demonstration","The RPCT configuration is fairly specific to the requirements of interplanetary and lunar exploration.

A mission currently in development that has been directly impacted by the unavailability of mature coring capability is the Mars Science Laboratory, which recently was forced to drop coring from its sample acquisition plan since the technology would not be available.

(ASC) has developed a 128 x 128 frame, 3D Flash LADAR video camera which produces 3-D point clouds at 30 Hz. Flash LADAR captures an entire frame of data from a single pulse of light, therefore platform motion and vibration will not affect the measurements.  This is not true for any other laser-ranging system, such as scanning LIDAR.  Additionally, with no moving parts, the system is smaller, lighter, and requires less power than traditional approaches. The Phase I project used an ASC camera at the JPL mars yard to gather test data. Hazard Identification, and Entry Decent and Landing applications were investigated. These data sets were taken and delivered to JPL.  The analysis demonstrates that a Flash LADAR system can resolve landing hazards and is suitable as an EDL sensor.  This data, together with inputs from JPL scientists, was used to develop a brassboard camera concept for NASA applications. The optimized camera will be fabricated and delivered in Phase II.  This sensor will not be spaced qualified, but the Hi-Reliabilty module developed for phase II will be the first step.  Space qualification will be the next necessary step for Flash LADAR.","The compact, low power 3D Flash LADAR Camera developed on this project will have direct applications to collision avoidance and navigation for military autonomous air and ground vehicles.

All hardware will be demonstrated in simulated Venus surface conditions.  During Phase I, a first-generation prototype BLDC motor and resolver were designed, built and tested in Venus-like conditions (460oC temperature, mostly CO2 gas environment).  The Phase I tests demonstrated the feasibility of the design through verification that the motor and the resolver can operate at 460oC for an extended period of time.  A further developed and optimized version of this motor and resolver could be used to actuate sample acquisition systems, robotic arms, and other devices outside of an environment-controlled landed platform on the surface of Venus. The motor and resolver's capability to survive for hours (and potentially longer) in that environment is a major benefit to future Venus science missions since it would allow time for communication ground loops to optimize sample target selection and allow for multiple samples to be acquired from the surface.  The extreme temperature motor and resolver would therefore revolutionize the exploration of Venus.  In Phase II, an extreme temperature resolver and a suite of different size of extreme environment brushless motor will be developed to TRL 6.   High temperature scoop and joint will also be developed to TL 6.  Aside from Venus exploration, other potential NASA and non-NASA applications for an extreme temperature motor include actuation of fluid pumps, gimbals, robotic joints and manipulation systems, as well as turbine, expendable launch vehicle and furnace tending system components.","Electrical submersible pumps (ESP) are down-hole pumps used in oil and geothermal applications such as steam floods (used in many fields to improve mobility of heavy oil and bitumen), geothermal wells, and other high temperature/ poor cooling applications. ESPs have been identified by Schlumberger to be the most efficient and economical material lift method on a cost-per-barrel basis. The trend in the application of ESPs has been toward installation in higher temperature reservoirs. These higher temperature reservoirs are typically found as the operation depths become deeper. Baker-Hughes and Schlumberger are the main manufacturers of high temperature ESPs. Schlumberger's HOTLINE series and Baker-Hughes Centrilift series ESPs can operate at temperatures approaching 300oC. An extreme temperature motor could potentially allow oil and water pump operation at greater depths than those attainable using these existing ESPs. Other potential applications identified include (1) gas turbine starter/generators for aircraft engines, (2) actuators for turbine fuel and steam control, inlet guide vane positioning, bleed heat valve control and remote subsea system actuation, (3) high temperature electromechanical actuation systems for expendable launch vehicle thrust vector control and gimbaling of engines and adaptable aerodynamic surfaces , and (4) furnace tending for glass/ceramic manufacturing.","The most promising and immediate application for the high temperature BLDC motor, resolver and the high temperature joint is on future exploration missions to Venus' surface. This application is the main driver for the development funded under this SBIR award. Currently, an extreme temperature motor, resolver and joint that can operate at Venus surface temperatures does not exist. Most high-temperature terrestrial motors can operate at a maximum temperature of 250oC, with a few that can reach 300oC for short durations. None of these motors could operate on Venus, where temperatures can reach 486oC. Based on the Phase I test results, Honeybee believes that the feasibility of designing an extreme temperature motor capable of operating for extended periods on the Venus surface has been demonstrated.  A high temperature resolver as the output feedback can give us precision control.  The high temperature joint can be used in the rover arm for any Venus surface operation.",Control Instrumentation; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Superconductors and Magnetic

An isothermal furnace liner is an annular alkali metal heat pipe.  Replacing the current heat pipe with a pressure controlled VCHP will allow much tighter temperature control.  A second commercial application is the alkali metal VCHPs in fuel cell reformers.  In a fuel cell reformer, diesel fuel and air pass through a series of high temperature reactors to generate hydrogen.   The operating temperature of the reactors must be closely controlled to maintain their chemical equilibrium.  A typical system must maintain inlet and outlet temperatures within ±30oC despite a turndown ratio of 5:1 in the reactant flow rate.  The current scheme uses bypass valves, which has several drawbacks: it requires active control, consumes power, and has a large pressure drop.  The alkali metal VCHP heat exchangers can replace the current heat exchangers and control valves with a passive system that automatically maintains the output stream from the heat exchanger at a constant temperature.","The immediate NASA application is to provide backup cooling for the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG).  The heater head lifetime decreases rapidly at temperature above the design temperature of 850oC, so the Stirling engines can only be stopped briefly before the heater head overheats.  VCHPs allow the engines to be stopped to minimize electromagnetic interferences and mechanical vibrations while taking scientific measurements for as long as desired, without the danger of damaging the heater head.  In addition to allowing multiple stops and starts of the Stirling engines, the VCHPs also help to isothermalize the heater head, increasing the engine performance.",Cooling; Nuclear Conversion

The processor's task scheduler may induce delays and preempt measurement processing and estimation tasks in favor of other tasks. Hence, estimation accuracy and in general the performance of any embedded algorithm can be significantly lower than expected during execution. The goal of this project is to develop distributed spacecraft state estimation algorithms that account for real-time multi-tasking processor constraints and delays in the availability of measurements and make the best use of limited onboard computing resources. We bring together new advances in advanced Kalman filtering techniques to develop an innovative framework for the design of embedded distributed state estimation algorithms and software. We will deliver to NASA JPL a novel ``any time'' Kalman Filter (AKF) architecture and software for distributed state estimation that, i) selects and uses the best measurements under given CPU constraints, and ii) continues to improve the accuracy of estimates by opportunistically using any additional CPU resources that become available.","Embedded control and estimation systems are used in a wide range of commercial and military applications. This SBIR effort uses a novel Anytime Kalman Filter (AKF) approach to develop state estimation algorithms for implementation using real-time multi-tasking operating systems, which has vast commercial potential for industrial (electric power networks, distributed process control) transportation and environmental monitoring applications.","This SBIR directly addresses concerns in embedded control systems for formation flying spacecraft. NASA's Next Generation Air Transportation System will use real-time multi-tasking environment for control, estimation and integrated vehicle health monitoring tasks.

Efforts have been directed toward both large and small thrusters, depending on the end use.  A current program is focused on the development of a miniature thruster.  Development of a Miniature Xenon Ion (MiXI) thruster will enable precision spacecraft positioning and formation maneuvers for formation-flying spacecraft.  The current MiXI thruster prototype will provide 0.5  3 mN thrust at 3000 sec specific impulse and efficiencies around 50% or better.  The MiXI thruster will use Xenon propellant, a noble gas, minimizing spacecraft contamination.(http://dst.jpl.nasa.gov/thrusters/)  One of the challenges of such a thruster is to be able to accurately control the flow of propellant.  The required flow rates are on the order of 0.1 to 1.0 sccm of Xenon.  To this end Midé, in Phase I, demonstrated that a small flow control valve, based on piezoelectric technology, met all performance objectives.  Midé is a world leader in this technology, demonstrated by its existing patented packaged actuator product line and past valve experience.  Aerojet provided electric propulsion expertise for the duration of the program and serve as a technology integration and transition path.",Midé is involved with a commercial partner to optimize oxygen respirator usage though the use of accurately controlled low powered piezo valve.  The military also maintains a presence in space that can require accurate precision positioning of their assets.  A small valve can find application in precision process control in the manufacturing industry and in the medical field for accurately controlling small amounts of fluids or gasses.   A general trend towards smaller flow control devices can be seen across several industries.  The driving force behind this trend is the large mass-to-power and mass-to-response capacity of the miniature device.  These valves are widely used in dispensing of high purity or aggressive fluids.  Some of the largest markets for miniature valves are in the biotechnology industry and in laboratory equipment.  Typically these valves are mass-produced as OEM products for incorporation into smaller sensing products.,"The initial platform for the MiXI thrusters requires 18 thrusters per spacecraft.  Since there are 5 spacecraft, and 2 valves per thruster for redundancy, there is a potential to deliver 180 valves.  In addition, this valve helps to meet a technology gap that exists for this thrust range. One focus area of late in satellite design is a push for multiple, smaller satellites that are maintained in tight formations.  This allows for larger aperture space telescopes without the need to build one large spacecraft.  A key ingredient to the success of these formation flying spacecraft are the thrusters needed to maintain the tight distances from spacecraft to spacecraft.  The station keeping thrusters of these small spacecraft must provide a sufficiently small impulse bit to actively and accurately control their position.  The proposed piezo based valves can easily meet these requirements for all small scale thruster station keeping needs.",Feed System Components; Micro Thrusters; Multifunctional/Smart Materials

The initial application is intended for 2.5 m diameter PMMA Fresnel lenses which NASA anaticipates as part of the EUSO mission cosmic ray telescope.  The new thin film technology combines MIT advances in nano-structured, self-assembled, low index multilayer structures with Agiltron's recently developed mist deposition process, a method for applying large area thin films at low temperature with precise layer thickness control. The proposed UV AR coatings consist of inter-connected oxide nanoparticles in the form of a 3D nanoporous network able to produce stable films with refractive indices as low as 1.1 and high transparency in the visible - UV. In Phase I of this program we successfully demonstrated AR coatings on PMMA substrates with UV reflectance less than 1% at 300-400 nm (compared to 5% for bare PMMA substrates). In Phase II, Agiltron intends to further develop the coatings to a higher technical readiness level (TRL) by improving the robustness and abrasion resistance of the films and engineering the deposition techniques to enable multilayer coatings of tuned refractive index (graded index) for broader band AR performance. By the end of Phase II, nanoporous films deposited by the mist process will possess high transparency, good environmental stability, and excellent abrasion resistance and mechanical integrity. The material can be applied conformally on large area glass and plastic substrates (polycarbonate, PMMA) using low annealing temperatures. Mist deposition is fundamentally inexpensive and may have commercial applications to the plastic optics industry for eyeglasses or cellphone camera lenses.","Nanoporous coatings offer dual functionality of anti-reflection and anti-fogging. Potential military applications include goggles, laser safety eye protective lenses, chemical/ biological face masks, ballistic shields for explosive ordnance disposal personnel, and windows for vehicles. Mist deposition is fundamentally inexpensive and may have commercial applications to the plastic optics industry for eyeglasses and cellphone camera lenses, sport and diving goggles, auto windshields, windows in public transit vehicles, solar panels and green-house enclosures, and architectural products.","Nanoporous coating technology is applicable to anti-reflection coatings for the electromagnetic spectrum from UV through near-IR. An immediate need is for coatings on large (2.5 m) PMMA Fresnel lenses intended for the EUSO extreme energy cosmic ray telescope.  Previous coatings have given poor adhesion on PMMA. NASA's contribution to this international mission depends on design of a plastic lens telescope whose antireflection treatments show very high optical efficiency over a wide UV band, large area uniformity, conformal deposition, low film stress, and minimal scattering and absorption.",Composites; Multifunctional/Smart Materials; Optical; Optical & Photonic Materials; Photonics

This long-wavelength region of the EUV includes the important solar emission lines O V near l=63.0 nm and Mg X near l=61.0 nm, formed at intermediate temperatures in the solar atmosphere.   While narrow-band EUV multilayer coatings are by now widely used in NASA missions for high-resolution solar imaging at wavelengths shorter than 35 nm, the observations made at those wavelengths probe coronal and transition region lines formed at either low (e.g., He II at l=30.4 nm) or high (e.g., numerous Fe lines) temperatures.  In contrast, the 6065 nm wavelength region provides a unique spectral window in which to observe intermediate-temperature solar emission lines.  However, efficient narrow-band multilayer coatings operating in this range have been unavailable until now.  The successful development of efficient, stable Gd-based multilayers as we propose, based on preliminary experimental results, especially those obtained during our Phase I effort, will therefore enable the construction of new high-resolution solar telescopes tuned to O V or Mg X that will complement existing multilayer telescopes tuned to shorter EUV wavelengths, thereby providing more complete temperature coverage, and leading to better understanding of the solar atmosphere, its variability, and its crucial role in driving space weather.  EUV imaging instruments incorporating the multilayer technology we propose to develop may be included in future missions such as RAM, Solar Probe, and Solar Orbiter, as well as future GOES satellites and new Explorer-class missions.","The same Si/Gd coatings developed in this proposed SBIR project will also enable the construction of related high-performance imaging and spectroscopy systems, for other organizations engaged in solar physics missions such as  ESA, ISAS, etc., as well as researchers in the US and abroad involved in a variety of non-solar scientific and technological disciplines including plasma physics, synchrotron radiation, photo-lithography, and EUV laser research. Our research and the resulting commercial products will therefore have a broad impact on the scientific community in general","The successful completion of our proposed SBIR activities will result in the development and commercial availability of affordable, high-performance Si/Gd EUV multilayers that operate near normal incidence in the 60-65 nm range, a region of the EUV in which no narrow-band multilayers are currently available. These coatings will enable the construction of high-resolution, high-cadence, narrow-band imaging telescopes for solar observations of intermediate temperature O V and Mg X lines, thereby complementing existing EUV multilayer coatings that operate at shorter wavelengths. Such telescopes may find application in future NASA solar physics missions including Solar Probe and RAM, as well as future GOES satellites and Explorer-class missions.",Optical & Photonic Materials

Called the Spatial Frequency Remapper, SFR, it trades the large field of view of a Fizeau design for simultaneous observations at multiple wavelengths.  Since SI does not require a large field, SFR, is a clearly better design.  It can produce better images and allows tight control requirements to be relaxed.  The SFR is also the heart of a full-aperture interferometric imaging system that will dramatically improve the performance of AO equipped telescopes.  The Phase I study was remarkably successful.  The SFR design was rejected during the Vision Study because of its perceived optical complexity.  That concern was retired; the design is robust, even with many apertures.  It needs only three optical surfaces, down from the five-surface design of the Vision Study.  Tolerances are not tight.  The inputs can be divided between combiners, further simplifying the optics and data flow with negligible effect on mission performance.  The search for better sparse-aperture configurations worked.  The search was sped up 1000 fold, enabling the discovery of the 30-aperture configurations needed for SI.  The main commercial application, improving images from AO equipped telescopes, requires a seemingly impossible to build optical fiber interface.  We found an alternative assembly procedure that is standing up well to detailed study.  A data reduction technique was developed that should improve sensitivity by a factor of 1000, increasing the range of possible applications.  The configuration search found ways to divide a full-aperture into the multiple configurations, tying off another loose thread in the design.  Finally, a testbed and prototyping plan was developed since in our view the success of the Phase I study clearly supports continuing the development of this technology.","SFR technology is the heart of a full-aperture interferometric imaging system, an improvement over the already successful aperture masking.  Aperture masking is a proven technique that has produced repeatable, high dynamic range images of complex sources at the diffraction limit of the telescope.  It has consistently outperformed adaptive optics in image quality but lacks the sensitivity of an AO system.  The new system improves on aperture masking both by enabling better amplitude calibration, which will further improve the images, and by using light from the entire aperture.  Placed behind a good AO system, it should approach the sensitivity of the AO while maintaining its high-precision calibration.  Applications should be numerous with the Air Force satellite imaging community targeted as the first customer.  Other major observatories are also potential customers.  An exciting possibility is that this may be the technology that, when coupled with a good AO system, will provide the image quality needed for the next generation of large (30-meter) ground-based telescopes to move forward.  Seabrook Engineering plans to pursue this link and to be in position to provide instrumentation for those facilities.","The direct NASA application of the Spatial Frequency Remapper (SFR) is to the Stellar Imager where it significantly improves the capabilities of that mission by providing simultaneous observations at multiple wavelengths.  Seabrook Engineering plans to be in a position to provide hardware for Stellar Imager, a precursor mission or for ground testing in preparation for one or both of those missions.  Also, one could imagine deploying SFR at ground-based optical interferometers to jump start the Stellar Imager science program.  Another exciting NASA application is to direct planet detection with a high-dynamic range coronagraph.  Full-aperture interferometric imaging, has the remarkable ability to form an image that is not corrupted by wavefront errors.  In particular, interferometric imaging eliminates the speckle noise present in images from a typical astronomical telescope.  Since the performance of TPF-C is limited by speckles, using interferometric imaging instead of a traditional CCD camera for the detector could potentially revolutionize the mission.  Full-aperture interferometric imaging can also work as a powerful wavefront sensor and is potentially useful where ever the wavefront quality is not good enough for the required task.  Space-telescopes with large, deployed apertures are a possibility.  Undoubtedly, more applications will become apparent as the technology develops.",Optical

Semimetallic HgTe has already proven itself as an excellent soft x-ray absorber material due to its low heat capacity. Hg0.834Cd0.166Te was shown in Phase 1 to have a heat capacity superior to that of HgTe. Hence Hg0.834Cd0.166Te-based microcalorimeter arrays are expected to have an energy resolution superior to that of HgTe-based ones. We propose the growth of single crystal Hg0.834Cd0.166Te layers by molecular beam epitaxy on Si substrates. Mercury vacancies will be filled after growth to reduce the possibility of them acting as acceptors and introducing a significant electronic heat capacity. The samples will be characterized by x-ray diffraction to assess their structural quality and crystallinity, FTIR mapping to confirm the uniformity of their energy gaps and alloy compositions, Hall measurements to assess their electrical transport properties, etch pit density counts to determine dislocation densities, transmission electron microscopy to determine microscopic structural information, and heat capacity and thermalization efficiency measurements at mK temperatures. These assessments will further test their promise as high energy resolution quantum calorimeters and will help optimize material and processing parameters. The thermal property measurements will be performed on samples specially processed to remove some or all of the Si substrates and CdTe buffer layers. Finally, the development of a broadband infrared/mm wave reflective coating will be undertaken. The produced samples will be compatible with incorporation into microcalorimeter arrays for NASA missions.","Soft x-ray calorimeters have several industrial applications including X-ray microanalysis and ground-based scientific instrumentation, for example in the fields of laboratory atomic physics and the analysis of biological materials at synchrotrons. The materials to be developed under this program also have broad ranging applications in the defense and commercial markets. Specifically, Hg1-xCdxTe/Si with x>0.166 material is of great importance to the US infrared focal plane array industry that desires the lower costs, higher formats and greater mechanical robustness that Si substrates provide. Applications include night vision; daytime navigation aids in the presence of fog and other atmospheric obscurants; sensors for manufacturing quality control and nondestructive evaluation; medical applications such as non-invasive thermal imaging for the diagnosis of cancer and other life-threatening diseases; environmental monitoring; drug and law enforcement; and search and rescue.","The principal application will be as next-generation soft x-ray calorimeters for astrophysical observations. The material system to be developed under this program, Hg1-xCdxTe/Si with x=0.166, promises high x-ray energy resolutions and benefits from well-established device and array processing technology (already developed for infrared arrays with x>0.166). Hence the fabrication of large (greater than 1000 pixel) arrays is feasible with energy and spatial resolutions superior to the current state of the art.  Achieving heat capacities lower than HgTe would also make high resolution microcalorimeters more feasible for hard X-ray and gamma-ray instruments, where much thicker absorbers are required.",High-Energy; Semi-Conductors/Solid State Device Materials

We propose to develop a highly efficient, lightweight space magnetic cooler that can continuously provide remote/distributed cooling at temperatures in the range of 2 K with a heat sink at about 15 K.  The proposed magnetic cooler uses an innovative cryogenic circulator that enables a lightweight magnetic cooler to operate at a high cycle frequency to achieve a large cooling capacity.  The ability to provide remote/distributed cooling not only allows flexible integration with a payload(s) and spacecraft, but also reduces the mass of the magnetic shields needed.  The circulator has heritage in Creare's space-proven micro-turbomachinery technology which has demonstrated long-life (>10 years) with no-discernable emitted vibrations.  The proposed system will be lighter than current multistage ADRs.  In Phase I, we proved the feasibility of the magnetic cooler by showing its high thermal efficiency, light weight, and high reliability through detailed component design and system performance analysis.  In Phase II, we will design, build, and test a prototype circulator module at design conditions.  We will deliver the circulator module to NASA for integration into a prototype magnetic cooler.","The military applications for the proposed magnetic cooler include cooling systems on space-based surveillance, missile detection, and missile tracking systems.  Scientific applications include cooling systems for material microanalysis using X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometers, cryogenic particle detectors, and biomolecule mass spectrometry using superconducting tunnel junction detectors.  The cryogenic circulator itself has many cryogenic thermal management applications.","The proposed magnetic cooler will enable NASA's future science missions using cryogenic infrared, gamma ray, and X-ray detectors, as well as the detector systems in the Constellation-X (Con-X) and the Single Aperture Far-Infrared observatory (SAFIR).

Current wavefront correctors, while dimensionally stable, require closed loop control using a wavefront sensor and complicated electronics to maintain mirror shape. For space based systems, simplified open loop control is desirable since it reduces power and weight while greatly improving system reliability by reducing complexity and electronic parts count. Xinetics proposes a Programmable Relaxor Open-Loop Mirror using Integrated Spatial Encoders (PROMISE) that uses a high frequency and/or high channel count surface parallel actuator array, made using ferroelectric micromachining originally developed for silicon based MEMS. The programmable actuator array enables the dimensionally stability and angstrom level control provided only by relaxor ferroelectrics, as has been demonstrated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The mirror will feature both larger excursion and lower power consumption as compared to commercially available actuators.","These types of mirrors hold great promise in extending adaptive optics to a wider community including amateur astronomers. Also, imaging, laser propagation, and laser control would all be able to use these mirrors, since they don't suffer from the MEMS limitation of little or no coating compatibility. Immediate application would be within the Airborne Laser program, where weight and control are critical. Solid state laser development could use these mirrors inside the resonator cavity with great success. Also, commercial applications in the ophthalmic market already are beginning to use deformable mirrors to aid in research into the properties of the human eye.","Surface parallel actuated deformable mirrors capable of open loop control offer a greatly simplified approach to future NASA adaptive optics programs for both ground based and large (20m) space telescopes. The proposed device maintains the large scale integration feature of Xinetics' Photonex mirrors while enhancing the stroke response and enabling open loop control. The system complexity and resultant processing are greatly reduced while improving the dynamic range of high density deformable mirrors. This also overcomes the problems of optical quality, dimensional stability, and bandwidth associated with present MEMS devices while retaining the fabrication methods developed for MEMS. Open loop control significantly reduces the complexity, cost, and weight of using adaptive optics in space while greatly enhancing mission assurance.

This innovation results in a vast improvement in the measurement capabilities of lidar systems by enabling the use of a single stabilized laser to both operate a high power transmitter and generate low power frequency tripled light for synchronous calibration and frequency locking of the Fabry Perot filter on the lidar receiver.  To be used in a space-based system, the UV module must be rugged and must perform optimally in a radiation environment over the mission lifetime.  To achieve this goal, the proposed dual-element structure will be packaged in a compact, robust fiber-pigtailed package which will readily lend itself to future space qualification for mechanical stability of the package and radiation damage resistance of the non-linear optical material.","AdvR's development of a non-linear dual-element periodically poled waveguide is the basis for a robust UV source.  By enabling a single-pass configuration in a sealed, compact package, the resulting UV lasers can be cost effectively mass produced, and provide end-users with convenient hands-off operation.  This technology will enable new applications including wildland fire assessment, bathymetry, weather and water quality assessment, as well as being used in highly effective blood coagulation tools, time-of-flight fluorescence spectroscopy systems, and sources for optical lithography.","The primary near-term NASA application for the fiber pigtailed UV converter module is in Goddard Space Flight Center's Tropospheric Wind Lidar Technology Experiment (TWiLiTE) project, an instrument that measures the Doppler shift of aerosols in order to measure wind speed.  Beyond the TWiLiTE demonstration the UV module with its capability to produce, highly efficient, light in the ultra-violet region will be an important technology for future NASA Doppler lidar and High-Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) aerosol missions. Incorporation in TWiLiTE will be a system level validation of the approach to advance the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for the future NASA space based lidar system development. The Atmospheric Sciences Competency (AtSC)/Chemistry Dynamics Branch (CDB) at the NASA Langley Center also uses a similar lidar system that will benefit from a robust efficient UV converter module.",Optical

The PLC integrates a frequency doubling element, a waveguide splitter, and phase modulator into a monolithic, waveguide-based device.  This technology is important for lidar systems requiring high frequency stability and accuracy.  The proposed device, with the proper IR input, will generate the required visible radiation, spectrally formatted for the HSRL seed laser stabilization scheme.  The PLC concept advances NASA's lidar systems due to its compact, efficient, and reliable design, thus enabling use on small aircraft and satellites.

A number of medical applications such as phase-modulation fluorimetry in bioprocess and clinical monitoring may benefit from this technology.  A number of commercial lidar or lidar-like systems will benefit from the insertion of the PLC.  These markets, which are presently inadequately accessed, include security, defense, space, forestry, floodplain measurement, land use assessment, bathymetry, robotics and machine vision applications.  As costs are reduced, a host of lidar-based applications will emerge, such as smart cruise control, lane change notification, traffic flow and robotic control.  Non-lidar applications for the PLC also offer opportunities in medical imaging, therapeutic lasers, fiber optical channel switching, active Q-switching, free space communication.","The primary customer is NASA Langley's High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) program for aerosol and cloud characterization.  The proposed PLC will find multiple uses in other NASA's lidar remote sensing programs, such in altimetry and DIAL lidar in which a waveguide phase modulator is used to stabilize a single frequency seed laser, and also has potential application in spectroscopic measurement techniques.",Laser; Optical; Optical & Photonic Materials; Photonics

For Phase II, we propose upgrades to the technology that are designed to reach that target sensitivity. We are further proposing individual projects within restricted airspace that will demonstrate the potential of the technologies for significant kinds of observations for Observational Climate Change. Two robotic platforms are to be utilized, the Unmanned Airborne Vehicle (UAV) and The Portable Tower Observatory (PTO). The PTO will provide fluxes and eddy spectroscopy of CO2. The UAV will give CO2 eddy spectroscopy that can be compared for a range of practical heights (5- 30 m) of the PTO.

The use of CO2 technology on all those platforms would no doubt prove informative for models of Climate Change.  An attractive platform of opportunity for climate monitoring is the weather balloon.  Approximately 75,000 are launched world wide each year.   If CO2 instrumentation were deployed on one third of them, then 25,000 systems could be sold each year.   Applications outside of climate monitoring include detection of human cargo by the Department of Homeland Security.","We are proposing to develop observational platforms with full technological capabilities. They are the Portable Tower and the Unmanned Airborne Vehicle. By execution of this proposal we will have much of what we require for eddy covariance observations of CO2 from both.

This is at least 10dB better than the best fully integrated oscillator reported today. To our knowledge this is the first ever implementation of a waveguide cavity on standard MMIC process.

Such noise arises from mass imbalance, bearing imperfections, and other sources. It takes the form of a number of discrete harmonics of the wheel speed, often also with a broadband noise component. Jitter problems can arise when harmonics sweep across observatory modes, and can be exacerbated by gyroscopically coupled spin-rate-dependent wheel structural modes that dynamically amplify the tonal and broadband disturbances. For a well-balanced wheel, higher harmonic forces can be on the same order as the fundamental, therefore when there is a jitter problem it can occur at very low wheel speed. These higher harmonics are generally less well-characterized than the fundamental.  The proposed Reaction Wheel Disturbance Model Extraction Software (RWDMES) is a tool for fitting a hybrid physical/empirical model to wheel induced-vibration data. The physical model captures the wheel structure including gyroscopic effects, while the empirical model captures the harmonic forcing and broadband noise. The Phase I effort demonstrated the ability to fit a highly accurate harmonic/broadband/structural model, including 43 harmonics up to 14.63 times the fundamental, to measured wheel disturbance data in a point-and-click environment in about 2 hours. The benefits of the technology include reduced program effort to produce wheel disturbance models, leading to more accurate jitter prediction earlier in a mission. This in turn allows jitter problems to be mitigated at the design stage when changes are relatively inexpensive.","The Earth observing community would benefit from the RWDMES technology, as would any spacecraft with tight pointing requirements for a three axis stabilized spacecraft. Other applications would include ground-based systems that are sensitive to mechanism induced disturbances, for example large ground based telescopes with rotating mechanisms such as filter wheels.

No product handles these functions entirely, largely because of the complexity of the control and the number of converters required is cost-prohibitive to a very cost-driven market.  APECOR believes the 3-port topology with a microcontroller-based management structure will represent the minimal solution and will present the industry's first economically-viable product offering.","The power system of a spacecraft is the major contributor to overall mass. The sources and the energy storage devices are the heaviest and bulkiest components. The design of a spacecraft power system is dominated by the compromise between system architectures. A limited number of conversion stages yields a simple non-flexible system, often with over-sized sources and storage.  This effort targets the need for oversized systems by developing control and power conversion protocols that can greatly reduce the required size of arrays, batteries, and converters without reduced functionality.  The concept proposed here promises to address these mass issues and could find use on all NASA programs  manned and unmanned.Current programs like Constellation and its Crew Exploration Vehicle would greatly benefit.  In addition, the work will have a direct application to unmanned satellite design where battery management and array power extraction can be greatly enhanced - a requirement for interplanetary missions.",Energy Storage; Photovoltaic Conversion; Power Management and Distribution

It is expected that the Phase II results will bring the PCHP to TRL 6: Prototype Demonstration in a Relevant Environment.","VCHP heat exchangers:  ACT is developing VCHP heat exchangers for a diesel fuel reforming process.  The PCHP would yield an improved since it would allow for changes in exchanger set point after manufacture, improve set point stability, and provide more rapid transient response.Thermal Calibrators:  ACT has a product line of high temperature heat pipes which are frequently sold to national standards laboratories in several countries.  The PCHP technology could be extended to high temperature fluids such as sodium or potassium and allow sales of improved high-temperature calibrators.  A similar market may exist for a low-temperature device such as a PCHP based on ammonia or ethane. Laser Diode Cooling:  Laser diode bars generate substantial amounts of waste heat.  Since the emitted wavelength is temperature dependent, as well as removing waste heat any cooling solution must also maintain the diode bar within tight temperature limits.  The PCHP would be ideal for this application since it can carry significant amounts of power while providing tight evaporator temperature control.","The immediate NASA application is to provide an alternative to a heater-controlled VCHP that had been used as a temperature-regulation element for an LHP. This device regulated the amount of heat that was transferred between the liquid and vapor lines and thereby allowed control of the LHP operating temperature.  The PCHP would provide a device with much faster response time and more repeatable performance and could also consume less power.  A second, more general NASA application is thermal management of satellites, in particular those carrying highly temperature-sensitive components such as laser diode arrays.  As well as providing cooling for those components, the actual operating temperature is important because it affects the output wavelength.  The PCHP would provide much tighter temperature control than existing VCHP solutions.   The PCHP would also allow on-orbit adjustment to adjust for uncertainties in performance of the other thermal management components or to compensate for aging of components such as radiator coatings.",Cooling

Accompanying this is an unprecedented need for reduction in spacecraft size and weight.  However, reduced weight leads to higher power densities, and waste-heat dissipation densities have grown by an order of magnitude with the use of smaller, more powerful electronics.  Active thermal control methods are needed to cope with the increasing heat dissipation requirements and environmental extremes.  In recent years, spacecraft have employed mechanically pumped fluid loops to efficiently transfer large amounts of thermal energy between two points by means of a forced liquid convention loop.  The development of long-life fluid pumps, however, has not kept pace with the demands of advanced thermal control systems.  Conventional electric motor-driven fluid pumps are heavy, bulky, inefficient, and prone to wear.  In Phase I, the operation and storage of Lynntech fluid pump over a range of environmental extremes was demonstrated.  In Phase II, Lynntech will develop a fluid pump significantly smaller, lighter, and more efficient than conventional pumps currently used in NASA spacecraft.","With the increasing power density of electronics, there is a growing market for miniature, low-power pumps for use in the thermal management of consumer electronics.  In particular, the interest in a low-cost, lightweight, quiet, efficient liquid pump for laptop cooling is high.

Supercomputing enables many of our most important high-tech tools, and nowhere is it more important than at NASA, where attaining increased computing speed and performance at lower costs are constant objectives.  The goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is exactly thatto develop, validate, and commercialize next-generation supercomputing capabilities that provide NASA and other government/commercial users with massive increases in speed at minimal cost and with reduced energy requirements and  significant ""footprint"" efficiency. In Phase I of this NASA SBIR project, Accelogic successfully demonstrated the feasibility of developing the world's first reconfigurable computing linear equation (banded) solver for large-scale computing problemssuch as those seen in aerospace applicationswith greatly increased speed using an FPGA chip.  The speed attained was equivalent to 240 CPU's per FPGA chip for banded systemswhich represents nearly a 60x computing speedup (surpassing the 50x Phase I target).  Accelogic's Phase I success sets the stage for a Phase II effort focused on prototyping/validating an initial supercomputing acceleration product.  The Phase II technical goal is to demonstrate the potential for 1,000x speedup.   During Phase I, Accelogic has proven it is ideally positioned to capitalize upon recent advances in reconfigurable computingmany of which were attained by Accelogic's own experts.  Applications for the products targeted by this project include many that are of interest to NASA, DOD, DOE, and many commercial entities.  Based on Phase I results and the clear commercial potential, Accelogic has obtained interest/commitment letters from well-established commercial vendors and key NASA contractors, including Silicon Graphics.","In addition to the NASA applications, many other applications are highly dependent on high-performance linear algebra, and those applications will be enabled by the acceleration levels (100x to 1,000x) targeted by Accelogic.  They include circuit simulation, financial portfolio management optimization (interior point methods and linear programming), nuclear physics, power distribution network design, and radar signal processing.  Each one these applications represents a significant market by itselfwith many of them crossing the $1 billion threshold. The ability to solve large-scale linear equations rapidly is a clear and fundamental driver for the following activities and/or industries both inside and outside of NASA:  product design and performance simulation (aerospace, automotive, defense, boats, nuclear energy, electronic chips, power networks, radar, telecommunications, acoustics, buildings and bridges, drugs, chemistry, antennas and radio systems, machinery, combustion); economic forecasting (insurance, financial markets, budgeting, hedge funds management); physical forecasting (weather, environmental engineering, geophysics); and data analysis (defense, logistics, search engines, national security, gaming, marketing).","As leading supercomputer vendor Silicon Graphics states in its Phase III commitment and partnering letter to Accelogic, our proposed NASA Phase II work on extremely-fast linear equation solvers is expected to be ""absolutely disruptive"" for the High-Performance Computing and supercomputing industries, enabling a significant leap in performance for important supercomputing applications that are at the core of NASA's mission.  Those applications include CFD, structural analysis, computational molecular dynamics, chemistry, computational electromagnetics, machinery, combustion, plasma physics, weather and climate modeling, and earth sciences. These fields depend heavily on large-scale linear algebra kernels, and they have not yet seen significant benefits from the typical performance leaps of reconfigurable supercomputing, due to the difficulties that the RC community has had in achieving large speedups for linear equations.

In this project, we propose the development of general purpose computational libraries capable of solving numerous core numerical functions on commodity graphics cards.  These solvers will be based on accepted, industry-standard interfaces and will be easy to integrate with current and future applications.

MATLAB currently integrates BLAS compliant routines to solve computationally intense problems.  Some versions of MATLAB even ship multiple implementations of this interface and allow the user to select between them.  The solvers developed here could simply become another option for users to select, thereby offloading processing to the system's graphics card.

The DoseChip will complement the existing Crew Passive Dosimeters by providing real-time dosimetry and as an alarming monitor for SPE.","Inexpensive radiation dosimeters are in general demand for commercial applications, such as personnel or waste monitoring, other applications include border monitoring for homeland security and protecting satellites and ground-based equipment from solar flares.  The ability to inexpensively mass-produce these devices creates an entirely new market for arrays of distributed sensors.  As high altitude commercial flight become more prevalent, active dosimeters can provide the redundant safeguards and information required to protect companies from unnecessary litigation and passengers from hazardous radiation conditions.","During spaceflight, both the immediate rate and total exposure information can be recorded simultaneously by these high-efficiency digital dosimeters.  The lightweight, compact size and inexpensive nature of these sensors also opens the possibility of monitoring many areas for comparison of radiation exposure, including individual monitors for each crewmember with online data for the whole mission.  Ground-based research and comparisons will also become easier and less expensive with the SSPM dosimeter.  The CMOS environment used to fabricate the SSPM and supporting electronics enables low-cost and lightweight space radiation dosimeters and solar particle monitors for NASA satellites.",High-Energy; Particle and Fields; Photonics; Radiation-Hard/Resistant Electronics; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Tools; Ultra-High Density/Low Power

The treadmill offers excellent periodic impact exercise to stimulate bone remodeling and cardiovascular activity as well as an added component of resistive exercise to encourage all-body muscle maintenance. The goal of this project is to demonstrate by design and analysis that the proposed treadmill will satisfy the stringent volumetric, power, and performance requirements demanded by lunar missions and provide the active feedback necessary to control the treadmill and display Daily Load Stimulus (DLS). We are additionally developing a new novel speed control algorithm in which the runner can modulate the treadmill speed through adjusting their stride.  A new subject load device is being developed for use in providing a more earthlike gravity replacement load to astronauts during spaceflight. We along with our partner the Cleveland Clinic believe that a hybrid compact exercise device along with the direct feedback of DLS is a unique and new approach that will provide a superior in space exercise system than ones currently in use on ISS.","The aging of our population will require exercise devices that are in-line with core conditioning and management of musculoskeletal health. Osteoporosis is a major public health threat for an estimated 44 million Americans or 55 percent of the people 50 years of age and older. In the U.S., 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone mass, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis. The proposed mini-treadmill exercise device with real-time Daily Load Stimulus (DLS) measurement has the potential to provide an effective mechanism to combat or manage osteoporosis.  In addition to the unique applications of the integrated mini-treadmill for Space Flight crews, ZIN Technologies will develop specific commercial technologies:   -Resistive pneumatic constant force technologies (actuator design) -Treadmill daily load stimulus monitoring and feedback to runner -Treadmill drive system speed control based on center of pressure measurement  We believe this intellectual property to have high licensing value to commercial treadmill original equipment manufacturers.  Our partnership with the Cleveland Clinic will again be utilized to ensure the successful planning, implementation and commercialization of the Mini-Treadmill technologies.  Together we have already developed a SBIR success story in the commercialization of a medical monitor and the incorporation of a joint venture:  ZIN Medical.","With the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) calling for long term extended missions to the moon and Mars, there is a pressing need to equip astronauts with an effective exercise countermeasure system to maintain astronaut musculoskeletal health and ensure mission success. Countermeasures such as cycling, treadmill, resistive exercise, and rowing have been employed extensively on the International Space Station (ISS), however the space and power requirements will be much more stringent on lunar missions than on ISS. The treadmill design of this effort will aim to address the inherent challenges of spaceflight along with the specific implementation of the Daily Load Stimulus (DLS) theory to mange musculoskeletal health of astronauts.",Biomedical and Life Support

Heart rate and EKG data taken using the Metal RubberTM sensors are essentially identical to those obtained using standard biomedical instrumentation.  The combined high electrical conductivity, low mechanical modulus, and environmental robustness of the Metal RubberTM materials make them a lightweight, stretchy and comfortable alternative to conventional metal wiring and cabling.  During the proposed Phase II program, NanoSonic would work with a large-volume U.S. textile manufacturer, the sensor and electronics design group of a major aerospace company, and a biomedical sensor and devices laboratory of Food and Drug Administration.  NanoSonic would improve the Metal RubberTM materials and methods for their integration as sensor and interconnect materials into instrumented garments, design, fabricate and evaluate the performance of sensor jerseys based on the results of Phase I tests, develop data acquisition electronics needed to interface to standard storage and communication modules, and investigate requirements for scaled-up manufacturing.","Commercial applications of NanoSonic's Metal RubberTM-based instrumented sensor garments similar to the ones developed through this NASA program are for emergency first responders (firemen, police, disaster relief personnel), the sports clothing industry, automated home and institutional health care, and the military and homeland security market.  NanoSonic's patented Metal RubberTM materials and their unique combination of high electrical conductivity, low mass density, and low modulus will enable the penetration of this broad e-textile products area.  Additional uses include as 1) electrical interconnects in truly flexible electronic displays, from large-area billboards to foldable computer screens, 2) large-area deployable photovoltaic fabrics for electrical power generation, 3) low-weight RF shielding and ground planes for cellphones, computers and other electronic instrumentation, 4) low weight, conformal RF phased array antennas for communication, asset tracking and surveillance, 5) air flow and water flow sensors for commercial aircraft and ship systems, and 6) electrical interconnects in next-generation prostheses.","Metal RubberTM materials may be used as conformal and comfortable replacements for metal electrodes and wiring used in physiological sensor networks to monitor the status and performance of astronauts during long duration space missions.

This new technology area of wearable health systems, sometimes referred to as smart-clothing, promises to allow for a secondary human nervous system that connects various different electronic devices positioned on or around the human body. As the shrinking in size and weight of electronic circuits has progressed, it is now possible for the modern human astronaut to carry increasing numbers of different electronic devices and sensors such as thermometers, gas monitors, microphones, altimeters, digital processors, digital memory, and push-button controls. These devices allow the astronaut to access data about their current environment and health status, and communicate with other astronauts and/or databases to send and receive information of value. As the variation in the number of devices and sensors that can be deployed increases greatly, a new technology is required to allow the seamless integration of these devices with the human astronaut so that the devices can be electrically powered, operated, re-charged, and communicate with each other over a digital pathway.","The use of wearable health monitoring systems for human beings promises wide potential use in various different sectors of the health industry. It allows medical researchers to monitor the daily vital signs of one or many patients participating in medical trials in a non-invasive manner. For example, it seems likely that a wearable monitor system could be linked to a central medical database through telephony or internet access such that patients may go about their daily routine without having to remain under strict supervision at a hospital or clinic. It also allows personal physicians to monitor the health status of individual patients during normal lifetime pursuits, or before and after surgical procedures. Individuals themselves will have access to greater personal health knowledge and in certain cases alarm triggers may be set to warn of excessive risk activities, e.g., core temperature critical status prior to onset of heat stroke. Wristband and armband health monitors are now commercially available along with hand-held blood sugar monitors. Wearable health monitoring systems appear to be a continuation of this trend.","The proposed invention for monitoring human vital signs in-situ will allow the health of an astronaut to be monitored at all times by the individual themselves and if desired, stored in digital memory for later use in a medical database. With additional wireless communication technology it will be possible for these vital signs to be monitored by other personnel in real-time, during flight preparation, take-off, travel, landing, eating, sleeping, exercising, working, and during any other general activity.

However, the power systems health management techniques have generally been limited to the energy sources and storage elements.  Furthermore, these functions have been performed off-line by mission planners for the sole purpose of estimating future energy availability and effective device lifetime.  As new programs and vehicles developed for space exploration, degradation analysis and prognostics in spacecraft EPS are becoming key issues for safety and success of these missions. QSI propose a novel approach to utilize ISHM decisions to estimate power generation, storage and delivery capabilities, and subsequently using the information for generating optimal reactive mission plans to maximize the mission success probability.  The key innovations in the proposed effort are 1). Utilization of diagnostic, prognostic, and recovery decisions to estimate the power supply capability of a spacecraft EPS and assess its reliability; 2). Development of an automated process to optimally utilize the available power supply capability with consideration for maximizing mission success probability; 3). Generation of optimal reconfiguration options and concomitant control actions for spacecraft EPS by using the onboard reactive planner and universal executive.","The new technologies from proposed effort will provide an integrated solution for Electrical Power System (EPS) and other embedded system health management and reconfiguration.  The technologies can be applied to many commercial applications which contain embedded diagnostic and prognostic subsystems, such as commercial airplanes, hybrid vehicles and ships, industrial automation and semiconductor manufacturing machinery.","Resulting technologies from proposed effort will provide an integrated solution for spacecraft EPS and other embedded system health management and reconfiguration to support higher level goals (e.g., mission planning).  The efforts will also lead to techniques and software packages that will be readily deployable for integrated system health management (ISHM) in Orion, the crew exploration vehicle (CEV) of the Constellation program.

The prognostic enabled power systems from Ridgetop are to be integrated into NASA's Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics Testbed (ADAPT) and later used in the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV).   Prognostics will provide power supply ""state of health"", remaining useful life (RUL) and notify operators of impending failures so that load-shedding or orderly switch-overs can be supported.  Using the ADAPT at NASA/Ames Research Center, Ridgetop will design, implement and validate a prototype prognostic sensor that employs both analog circuits and digital logic in a microcontroller unit (MCU) or microproprocessor controller (MPC) to ""prognostics-enable"" a high efficiency switching power converter. The ADAPT is a testbed, developed to explore health-management systems in manned spaceflight with three main goals: 1) to assess performance of diagnostic tools and algorithms against a standardized testbed and repeatable failure scenarios, 2) to develop prognostic models (performance degradation, remaining life estimation) for spacecraft subsystems, and 3) prototype Advanced Caution and Warning System (ACAWS) algorithms and user interfaces.By developing effective and practical prognostics for a power supply, Ridgetop's role will be to extend the capabilities of the ADAPT testbed.","There is large potential for prognostics in the commercial sector which is expected to exceed $200M by the year 2010.  Ridgetop has segmented the market to focus on high reliability applications such as automotive, banking systems, industrial process control, and commercial aerospace applications.  Prognostics can leverage existing diagnostic backbones such as JTAG, I2C  and CAN buses, to support Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and Prognostics/Health Management (PHM) strategies for critical industrial applications.  For CBM and PHM applications, the value to preserving operational readiness is paramount and these applications are not expected to be cost-sensitive.  Ridgetop estimates the following market sizes for health monitoring systems that have tremendous commercial application for the enabling of prognostics on power systems: - Military Market (aircraft and helicopter): $170B by 2015 at an annual growth rate of 5% - Aircraft Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO): $64B by 2010","Ridgetop's plans are to work closely with the NASA Office and its contractors on the application of Electronic Prognostics to a representative Switch-Mode Power System within NASA.  To that end, Ridgetop has had communications with NASA engineers, and has conducted meetings with Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman.  In addition, prognostics can support remote diagnostics/prognostics.  The value proposition to customers is that early detection of impending failures can be made remotely, via the web, and corrective actions employed quickly to preserve overall system integrity.With remote systems deployed on other planets, autonomous operation enabled with electronic prognostics is very important.  Advanced warnings and mitigation of failures is facilitated using electronic prognostics that detect an impending failure before it occurs.  For example, there is a 40-minute bidirectional communication delay in Mars-to-Earth communications.  Another application is to detect the degradation of power systems during flights of the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) spacecraft in real-time.  The CEV is the actual crew capsule that will transport up to six crew members on missions to the International Space Station, lunar missions, and deep space travel to Mars and beyond.

Human acceptance of autonomy hinges on trusting system-level behavior. The goal is to develop technology to verify system properties for high-level autonomous control of complex systems operating in rich and unpredictable environments. The System-Level Autonomy Trust Enabler (SLATE) applies constraint-based models and reasoning to support incremental modifications necessary for system-level V&V of fixed and reconfigurable systems, given component-level guarantees. The significance of this innovation is to enable trusted high-level autonomous control systems across a wide range of critical applications, including manned and unmanned spacecraft, rovers, and habitats. If successful, this will simplify the process of control system design, maintenance, and reconfiguration in response to changes in the environment, the system being controlled, or the mission profile.  Phase I addressed SLATE feasibility for requirements representation and reasoning.  A TRL-4 proof-of-concept prototype on a multi-level robotic control system, implementing a surface robotics exploration mission, demonstrated that SLATE is feasible in practice. Phase II will develop an application-specific version and provide a user interface, improve performance and reasoning, and demonstrate operation on a NASA application.","The design and V&V benefits of SLATE extend beyond space-based systems to include other complex, high-value, life-critical control systems.  Department of Defense UAS missions, for example, are expanding beyond remote sensing missions to include target illumination and weapons delivery, e.g., the vertical takeoff and landing tactical UAV (VTUAV) MQ-8B Fire Scout and MQ-9 Reaper, and the Hellfire-enhanced MQ-1B Armed Predator. Concerns range from satisfying strict rules of engagement (e.g., positive target identification), collateral damage and non-combatant casualties, and risk to friendly resources, especially when a UAS returns with weapons to base, a particularly high-risk scenario for ship-based UASs. Other potential customers include airframe integrators and supporting vendors, US critical infrastructure owners with significant unattended operating requirements such as remote pumping and transfer stations, and requirements design and analysis vendors.","SLATE has the potential to be useful on any NASA mission requiring some form of complex automation, whether or not the mission is manned. Two NASA directorates are relevant to SLATE's contribution to Automation for Operations (A4O): Exploration Systems Mission Directorate and the Space Operations Mission Directorate. In each, SLATE has a role in system-level V&V, both for design time as well as operational reconfiguration in onboard execution of rovers, managing rover operations, and human procedure development. Specific applications include ATHLETE, K-10, Robonaut.  For the International Space Station and the Space Shuttle programs, SLATE can be used support compositional verification and V&V of human procedures developed for operations and ground controllers.","Architectures and Networks; Attitude Determination and Control; Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Expert Systems; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Intelligence; K-12 Outreach; On-Board Computing and Data Management; Operations Concepts and Requirements; Power Management and Distribution; Software Development Environments; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation; Telemetry, Tracking and Control; Testing Requirements and Architectures"

For this data to be useful to humans monitoring these systems and to automated algorithms controlling these systems it will need to be converted into more abstract data.  This abstracted data will reflect the trends and characteristics of the systems and their environments.  Currently this data abstraction process is manual and ad hoc.  It is manual in the sense that either humans do the abstraction in their heads or the data abstraction is done by hand-coding computer programs for each data item.  It is ad hoc in the sense that each data abstraction is developed on its own with no representation of how it relates to the tasks being performed or to other data abstractions.  In this project we propose building a Data Abstraction Architecture (DAA) that allows engineers to design software processes that iteratively convert spacecraft data into higher and higher levels of abstraction.  The DAA also formalizes the relationships between data and control and the relationships between the data themselves.  The DAA consists of representations for data and data abstractions, a data store, a abstraction architecture processing engine and a development environment.  We will evaluate the architecture using three NASA domains: 1) a lunar outpost monitoring and control application; 2) a robotic scientific survey application; and 3) a vehicle procedure execution scenario.","he Department of Defense (DOD) is the primary non-NASA commercialization customer.  Unmanned vehicles, both air, ground and underwater, are becoming more and more common in battlefield situations.  Future Combat Systems (FCS) envision manned and unmanned vehicles of all sizes working side-by-side.  In addition, Congress has mandated that one-third of all military vehicles must be unmanned by 2015.  Unmanned air vehicles patrol the borders in Iraq and provide intelligence to support ground operations.  Current vehicles require multiple crew members to fly each mission.  Often missions cannot be performed because there are not enough trained crews.  Software that can allow one person (or a ground commander) to obtain information directly from several vehicles in an integrated fashion would provide a significant return on investment.  Our software will help reduce the operator burden and increase productivity and mission success. Civilian uses of unmanned vehicles are expanding rapidly.  The recently announced immigration reform bill authorizes unmanned air vehicles to patrol the US borders.  Commercial companies might also use unmanned vehicles to fight forest fires, patrol large installations, track wildlife or take pictures.  We expect that commercial applications of our software will mature as unmanned vehicles become more prevalent over the next decade.","With NASA investing many billions of dollars in the first new spacecraft in thirty years, there will be many opportunities for advanced information technology.  We will target the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) prime contractor (Lockheed Martin) or one of their subcontractors (e.g., Honeywell) as partners.  We will also target NASA Mission Operations Directorate ( MOD) and United Space Alliance (USA) as a customer for data abstraction in ground operations.  In addition, NASA's robotic missions and uncrewed space vehicles are also potential customers. NASA commercialization will focus on two areas. First, human monitoring of space system (e.g., mission control). In this case, the DAA is being used to provide human operators with abstracted data about the system to support their decisions.  The operators could easily create new DAAs for specific tasks that they have.  The second NASA application is as a companion to spacecraft and robotic automation.  Most automation software requires abstracted data in order to operate.  This project will allow data abstractions to be created outside of the control software and connected via the data store.  Control engineers would specify what data they needed for their control tasks and a DAA would be built to supply that data.

Typical software development practices are not acceptable in systems where failure leads to loss of life or other high costs.Software best practices for high confidence systems are often codified as coding rules. Adhering to these practices can increase software readability and predictability, thereby enhancing quality. However, adherence is limited by the lack of high-quality tools to measure adherence automatically. Checking rule conformance requires a diverse set of software analysis technologies, ranging from syntactic analysis to sophisticated inference of runtime behavior.  By combining lightweight verification techniques with other scalable analysis techniques that target syntactic and other static properties, we will create a tool that flags violations for almost all the rules typically applied to high-assurance code.   Our Phase I work demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In Phase I, we developed a tool for checking compliance with rules developed for JPL flight software. The tool leveraged GrammaTech's existing technology for static analysis, including facilities for analyzing a program's abstract syntax tree, control-flow graph, and inferred runtime behavior. The prototype successfully checks a set of rules designed for high-assurance software. Our experiments show that the tool adds only minimal overhead to our CodeSonar bug-finding tool, and generates few or no spurious results that could distract or annoy users.","The proposed tool will search source code and flag those parts that do not conform to coding standards and best practices. The tool will improve software development by: - Identifying non-conformant code that slips through other quality control efforts, and thereby increase software quality. - Reducing the effort required for manual code review. Code inspectors can spend more time on identifying subtle flaws in software and less on checking rule compliance. - Encouraging codification and application of best practices. The presence of a tool to define and check coding rules will make it easier for engineers and project managers to apply best practices to projects that would otherwise ignore them because manual inspections are too cumbersome.  We expect the Phase II work will be applicable in any industry that develops high confidence software. Department of Defense projects often adopt their own coding standards for safety-critical software (for example, the Joint Strike Fighter project). Defense contractors can use the proposed tool to identify non-compliant code cheaply, increasing productivity and software quality. Other industries that develop high-assurance code, such as the automotive, medical device, and banking industries, can apply the tool to enhance their own development processes.","The proposed tool will be applicable to all NASA centers and contractors that develop or validate flight software written in C/C++. Flight software must meet a higher standard of quality than typical general-purpose software, and a common technique for encouraging quality software is by applying coding rules. For example, Holzmann's Ten Rules are being adopted for mission-critical flight software across JPL.  The proposed tool will search source code and flag those parts that do not conform to the rules. The tool will improve flight software development by: - Identifying non-conformant code that slips through other quality control efforts, and thereby increase software quality. - Reducing the effort required for manual code review.

The presence of a tool to define and check coding rules will make it easier for engineers and project managers to apply best practices to projects that would otherwise ignore them because manual inspections are too cumbersome.

Such technology would significantly improve reliability, performance and lifetime of electronics that are used for space applications, including satellites and space travel. This will be achieved through the development of unique circuits and simulation tools that are derived from novel physics-based modeling techniques and verified by experiment. Temperature-stable designs and design methods will be provided as well. The new cryogenic design tools will greatly reduce the chances of error during actual circuit implementation, and thus reduce the number of design cycles, thereby substantially decreasing fabrication times and expenses. Models and CAD tools are relatively inexpensive as compared to fabrication costs; thus the results of this project should provide a very large return on investment.","In addition to NASA, there is a large civilian space applications business, especially with respect to communications satellites. There is also a large commitment by the Department of Defense to space applications. This work should find applications with these types of organizations as well.   There is also a very large need for cryogenic electronics in terrestrial low noise applications. These applications can be found in infrared and far infrared optical detectors. Furthermore, any application where the input signal is extremely weak, and a very large signal to noise ratio is required, may be enhanced by cryogenic operation.

To design low-temperature radiation-hardened (rad-hard) electronics and predict circuit and system characteristics, such as error rates, modeling tools are required at multiple levels. To determine the electrical responses of transistors and circuits to radiation events, physics-based Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) and mixed-level tools are required. This project will provide models and tools that will improve capabilities for prediction of technology-dependent responses to radiation in wide temperature range, which will lead to better design of rad-hard electronics, better anticipation of design margins, and reduction of testing cost and time. Future NASA missions will use nanometer-scale electronic technologies which call for a shift in how radiation effects in such devices and circuits are viewed. Nano-scale electronic device responses are strongly related to the microstructure of the radiation event. This requires a more detailed physics-based modeling approach, which will provide information for higher-level engineering models used in integrated circuit (IC) and system design. Hence, the proposed innovation: detailed high-energy-physics-based simulations of radiation events (using MRED/Geant4 software from Vanderbilt University) efficiently integrated with advanced device/circuit response computations by CFDRC NanoTCAD three-dimensional (3D) mixed-level simulator. This will also enable a large number of statistically meaningful runs on a massively parallel supercomputing cluster. The extreme low temperature physics models combined with radiation effects will be validated with the help of consultant, Dr. John Cressler (Georgia Tech), in collaboration with the NASA Extreme Environment Electronics program, and serving the NASA RHESE Program (led by NASA-MSFC).","Potential other users include all space electronics suppliers, in particular for DoD space communication, surveillance, and imaging systems, as well as commercial satellites. Since modern electronic technologies and parts are getting smaller all the time, the radiation and extreme temperature effects become more severe, the life time and reliability become essential, and the capability to predict them increases confidence and reduces risk. The new computer aided design (CAD) tools can also be applied for cryogenic electronics for high-sensitivity, low-noise analog and mixed-signal applications, such as metrology, infrared (IR) imagers, sensors (radiation, optical, X-ray), radiometrology, precision instruments, radio and optical astronomy, infrared and photon detectors, and other high-end equipment.  For all such devices and systems, predictive and accurate modeling and design tools reduce the amount of required radiation/temperature testing, thus decreasing their cost, and time to market or field application.","Prediction of electrical performance and radiation hardness of electronic components in extreme environments (wide temperatures, high radiation) are crucial to design reliable electronics for all NASA Exploration Missions (Moon, Mars, etc.), for both crewed and robotic systems. Since electronic parts are getting smaller, the radiation/temperature effects are more severe  the life time and reliability become essential  the capability to predict them increases confidence and reduces risk.  The new tools will be immediately applicable to the NASA Radiation Hardened Electronics for Space Exploration (RHESE) Program, and other mission programs. The new models and design tools will help NASA to: 1) assess and select new electronics technologies, materials, and devices for very low temperature operation in radiation environments;  2) investigate, generate, test, and validate new fast/compact engineering models (""toy models"") used in designing larger circuits and systems;  3) design low-temperature rad-hard electronics with better understanding and control of design margins, and evaluate redundancy scenarios;  4) predict circuit and system level characteristics, such as error rates;  5) better evaluate the wide-temperature performance and radiation response at an early design stage;  6) set requirements for hardening and testing;  7) reduce the amount of testing cost and time.",Radiation-Hard/Resistant Electronics; Simulation Modeling Environment

The nanopores of the catalytic substrate are conformally coated with appropriate catalyst, forming ultra-high aspect ratio, high surface area, cylindrical nanoreactors.  Such unique architecture provides improved mass and heat transfer and ensures conversion of volatile organics into non-toxic products with unmatched efficiency.The proposed low-mass, low-volume and low-power-consumption reactors are intended to replace conventional packed-bed catalytic oxidizers used currently for removal of trace organic contaminants from spacecraft atmospheres.  The Phase I project unequivocally demonstrated the feasibility of VOCs oxidation and confirmed the strong competitive advantages of the proposed architecture over conventional reactors and structured catalysts.  The Phase II goal now is to develop, fabricate and validate nanochannel reactor prototypes, and to initiate their integration into air purification modules.

Less capable and expensive collection system technologies are generally based on stagnation of high velocity ambient airflow on a collecting surface. The momentum of particles and heavy molecules precludes their following gas streamlines during this stagnation. Instead, they concentrate and are trapped on the detector's surface if the surface is ""sticky,"" or concentrated in the surface boundary layer, which can be separated from the mainstream flow and collected. Typically, current separation methodology collects about 50 percent of the particles between 1.0 and 10 microns in diameter from a flow of 500 L/min with a power consumption of up to 500 watts; i.e., about 1 watt of power is required for a small fan to compress 1 liter of air per minute to produce the high velocity airflow necessary for effective trapping of small bio-particles and heavy molecules. However, our electrospray technology consumes negligible power and achieves virtually 100 percent particle collection.

Compared to the Trace Contaminant Control System (TCCS) and the Vapor Phase Catalytic Ammonia Removal system (VPCAR), this novel technology operates at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, requires less energy, has no moving parts, and requires no consumables. The non-thermal plasma has been proven successful in decomposing various volatile organic carbons (VOCs) found in spacecraft environments. The prototype PADS reactor developed in Phase I has also demonstrated successful removal of ammonia and selected VOCs (e.g., methane, acetone, methylene chloride, and ethylbenzene) in air. The Phase II effort will further optimize this technology and improve its efficiency. It will be designed to interface with both TCCS and VPCAR. Its incorporation would eliminate the high-temperature catalytic reactors in the two systems, and facilitate a decrease in size or total elimination of the intensive resupply of activated carbon for adsorbent beds. This would result in significant savings in launch mass and cost for long duration missions and a reduction in power requirements. It also has great potential to be scaled to various applications and/or incorporated into other life support systems for streamlined air purification.","This technology has broad possibilities for air purification in commercial systems. Portable, plasma-based, air purifiers are a relatively new entrant to the home health market. This opens the possibility for ORBITEC to license the advanced plasma technology created from this SBIR application to major manufacturers. Targeted markets such as office buildings, airplanes, buses, and trains, where large numbers of people are grouped together could benefit from a compact system that would both decompose pollutants and neutralize biological contamination introduced by others. This system would be readily integrated into existing ventilation infrastructure in these applications. Larger scale applications may include accommodation of large air flows from industrial processes where quantities of VOCs or other pollutants are required to be removed or altered prior to release into the atmosphere. This same larger system also has applications in homeland security, protecting military personnel from certain chemical attacks, or remediation of polluted ecosystems.","The PADS technology will likely provide a higher quality of trace contaminant control in a spacecraft or habitat than is provided by the current technology, and will eliminate many of the disadvantages including the high temperature/energy requirements by the catalytic reactors, significant re-supply mass of the disposable adsorbent beds, and the risk of adsorbent beds releasing adsorbed pollutants. It also does not require a vacuum as do regenerable adsorbent solutions, giving significant advantages for use in planetary surface base applications. The system is also suitable for use both on spacecraft and on surface habitats where a ready source of vacuum does not exist.

Reverse osmosis (RO) is a compact process that has proven its ability to remove inorganic and organic contaminants from space mission wastewater. Our Phase I feasibility study indicate that the use of low-energy composite hollow fiber RO membranes developed at Santa Fe Science and Technology resulted in a 65-80% increase in the production of purified water compared to that obtained from the corresponding low-energy RO flat-sheet membrane without sacrificing the water quality of the permeate stream. Therefore, replacing existing spiral wound membrane elements in the RO subsystem with hollow fiber membrane elements will reduce the batch processing time or enable a lower feed pressure to be employed due to the use of higher productivity membrane elements. This will lower the overall power requirement for the RO subsystem. Phase 2 will be based on expanding the size of the membrane element in order to develop several working prototype membrane elements that can eventually be mounted in the RO subsystem of the closed-loop Integrated Water Purification System. Also during Phase 2, we will explore the use of hydrophilic polymeric coatings to determine whether it is possible to minimize the rate of membrane fouling due to the high concentration of organics in the wastewater feed stream.","Reverse osmosis membranes consist of a dense surface layer (50  500 nm) that is highly permeable to water, but highly impermeable to dissolved salts, organic molecules, microorganisms, and colloids. Consequently, membrane elements have been successfully used in municipal and residential POU/POE water treatment systems (desalination of tap water, brackish water and seawater desalination), industrial water treatment (power generation/boiler feed water, food & beverages, wastewater treatment and reclamation), and producing ultra-pure water for microelectronics and semiconductor manufacturing.  End-users of reverse osmosis membranes continue to look for products that perform at lower pressures and have improved fouling resistance. If this project is successful, these composite hollow fiber membranes offer significant performance improvements over spiral wound membrane elements in terms of being able to operate at lower pressures or by operating with lower numbers of membrane elements with the additional benefit of reduced fouling.","The technology is specifically targeted towards the wastewater treatment systems on board spacecraft to produce potable water on long duration missions, such as the establishment of bases on the lunar surface or human planetary exploration. Reverse osmosis technology is well suited for wastewater treatment in space because it has the advantages of high rejection of contaminants, durability for removing inorganic contaminants with high water recoveries, a compact configuration and minimal re-supply of consumables for continuous operation when to compared to other physical-chemical treatment processes. The current design of the RO subsystem in NASA's Integrated Water Recovery System employs spiral wound membrane elements. Composite hollow fiber membrane elements have many advantages over spiral wound membrane elements for reclamation of space mission wastewater applications (i.e. higher module productivity/lower feed pressure, higher recovery and reduced mass). These advantages should make the use of composite hollow fiber membrane elements a viable alternative to spiral wound membrane elements being considered for the Integrated Water Recovery System.",Waste Processing and Reclamation

The EBDS development will build on previous developments in condensing heat exchangers to establish reliable, passive, and energy-efficient methods for recovering water, and will develop the phase separation and solid salt removal and collection methods required for EBDS functionality. The EBDS will use evaporation and condensing surfaces designed to eliminate biological growth through material selection, surface treatments, and hardware operational procedures. Design for the reduced gravity of Lunar and Martian applications enables simplified liquid/gas separation, compared with microgravity applications, and makes the design readily applicable to terrestrial applications. Crew interaction is limited to periodically removing the bio-isolated waste byproducts from the system. A fully functional prototype Lunar Outpost EBDS will be developed and tested for an extended duration, to evaluate long-term feasibility and performance, and to bring the EBDS to TRL 6.","EBDS provides a reliable, scalable, energy efficient, and low maintenance method of recovering usable water from reverse osmosis brines. The primary use of the EBDS technology is for long-duration space applications due to the high cost of launching extra water, thus both government and commercial space travel will benefit. The first application of EBDS is seen for the Lunar Outpost application to enhance water recovery with some of the systems currently being tested at JSC (e.g., Honeywell Water Cascade Distillation System). Then, as commercial space travel becomes a reality, launch mass and volumetric savings provided by EBDS will directly impact viability of commercial space travel. The EBDS technology will also provide benefits to commercial aerospace when long-term ventures in space, such as orbiting space stations or extra terrestrial outposts for the purpose of tourism or other commercial gain, become a reality.","The EBDS enables water reclamation from waste water brines without the use of consumable wicks. EBDS can process wastewater created by reverse osmosis treatments and provide water suitable for post-treatment and human consumption. The EBDS can also be used to recover water from laundry washing and drying applications, and directly from urine. The primary application of the EBDS is on extraterrestrial outposts, but it can also interface with the Advanced Water Recovery Systems (AWRS) of the Advanced Life Support (ALS) project or similar systems required for all long-duration human spaceflight systems. By using EBDS, launch mass and volume can be greatly reduced by minimizing the amount of water lost to waste. In addition to saving the volume and mass associated with carrying extra water, crew time and stowage are reduced over other NASA brine water recovery hardware currently under development by greatly increasing the time between service operations.",Waste Processing and Reclamation

The Modular Distributed Concentrator (MDC) comprises an array of identical, smaller-sized solar concentrator dishes with a network of power transmission links that route the high quality concentrated energy to a centralized receiver and avoids the challenges of deploying large concentrators with furnace chambers suspended at their focus. The Phase I showed the ability to optimize the concentrator reflector scale to provide low mass, showed that the heat pipe approach had better figures of merit than the optical waveguide approach, and, as a proof-of-concept, used a terrestrial solar concentrator to fire a sodium heat pipe to transmit heat at 1000C. The Phase II effort proposes to establish a system design for a MDC / heat-pipe based carbothermal processing system which requires >1625C process heat.  We develop and demonstrate the components needed to deliver heat at this temperature with high performance, using space quality materials, including concentrator, concentrator receiver, tungsten/lithium heat pipe, and an innovative Heat Pipe Thermal Interface (HPTI) that most effectively transfers the power directly into the regolith. The Phase II includes an end-to-end demonstration of all of the subsystems, collecting and concentrating solar energy, transmitting it at >1625C, through the heat pipe and HPTI into the regolith, and extracting oxygen from regolith simulant in an existing process chamber.","The growth in photovoltaic applications has resulted in a critical shortage of solar grade silicon that could be alleviated through the establishment of renewable energy foundries based on the MDC approach.  Because energy content is a large fraction of the cost of silicon wafers for solar cells, the commercialization of the MDC could result in more cost effective photovoltaics.  In addition, the MDC Furnace could be applied as a renewable energy system to meet any industrial need for high temperature process heat.  Of particular interest is the ability to apply the MDC system to a solar-fired centralized power system.   The advent of economical Stirling engines have led to the start of large construction projects for arrays of kilowatt sized concentrator/Stirling units.  Since MDC thermal outputs can be ganged together, arrays of concentrators could be hooked up to much larger power generators, providing economies of scale for not only Stirling, but also conventional turbine generators.  This may have a significant benefit in capital cost per kilowatt, the driving cost for renewable energy power plants, and could also considerably reduce operation and maintenance costs associated with large arrays of small engines.","The target application for the MDC Furnace System is to process oxygen and other materials from lunar regolith; however, there are a variety of other NASA applications that could be implemented with this approach.  High flux / high temperature solar concentrators can also be used for power and propulsion applications.  The solar dynamic electrical prime power system using Rankine or Brayton conversion cycles and thermal energy storage was the subject of many years of development at NASA because of its potentially high payoff.  The Integrated Solar Upper Stage also was the subject of much development, with a promise of very high specific impulse from super-heated hydrogen combined with a thermionic electrical power system. Both of these systems were hampered by the challenges of a large, high accuracy concentrator reflector, but could be enabled by the MDC approach delivering high power at high temperatures as proposed here.",Composites; In-situ Resource Utilization; Renewable Energy; Solar; Thermodynamic Conversion

In particular:  We propose to develop a prototype excavator for mining the top few centimeters to meter (via strip mining) of lunar regolith using pneumatics in an analogous jet-lift dredging method and excavating holes and trenches of various dimensions. This method uses a pulsed gas to draw adjacent material into a delivery pipe connected to a receiving container or exit tube for delivery over long distances. This work would continue development on the base technology of the pneumatic approach.   We also propose to adapt the pneumatic system developed for mining to the task of regolith transfer. For example the pneumatic regolith transfer method could be used in place of an auger (which has a tendency to jam) to move the regolith from a hopper to an oxygen extraction plant.  As another application of this pneumatic approach, we proposed to use dusty gas (regolith suspended in carrier gas feeding from a hopper to a processing plant) and heat it in a heat exchanger. The convective heat transfer (or even gaseous conduction) in granular material is much more effective than solid-solid conduction especially in vacuum where particle to particle conduction is minimal making a regolith four times better insulator than aerogel.",There is no terrestrial application for this system as it was actually derived from the earth-based methods.,"The pneumatic mining system with heat exchanger directly addresses goals of NASA Vision for Space Exploration. For example, imagine a lunar ISRU plant with power supply that has a ""lunar vacuum"" hose that is used to acquire the lunar feedstock. The dusty gas (gas with lunar regolith) that is acquired is passed through a heat exchanger in the ISRU plant where the particles are brought up to ~600C process temperature prior to depositing the hot feedstock into a reactor in preparation for the next O2 extraction process and porting the residual gas to a storage container for mining.  The mining system may be used for ISRU  mining top few centimeters of lunar dust for oxygen extraction. In addition the same system may be used for construction purposes: excavating large holes and trenches, clearing fluffy layer of lunar regolith in preparation of the landing zones.",Earth-Supplied Resource Utilization; Fluid Storage and Handling; In-situ Resource Utilization; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Monopropellants; Propellant Storage

It will process gas streams generated by upstream lunar in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) processes to produce purified gases such as hydrogen, oxygen, water vapor, and others that support human habitat here. The SPIES system, consisting of a series of compact (<20 cm diameter, 60 cm long, <5 kg) and energy efficient (<30 W) modules, produces highly purified gases of interest at ambient temperatures and pressures, requires no consumables, and eliminates the need for extensive downstream equipment thus, reducing equipment launch size and weight by 33%. In Phase I, POC designed and assembled a proof-of-concept prototype of technology readiness level (TRL) 4 that successfully demonstrated purification of simulated lunar ISRU hydrogen gas streams by gas separation and extraction to reduce hydrogen sulfide contamination to <1 part per million (ppm). In Phase II, POC will optimize the system design to assemble a fully functional TRL 5 SPIES system prototype that will efficiently reduce the hydrogen sulfide concentration to <1 ppm in a realistic gas stream like those generated by NASA's hydrogen reformate process.","Commercial applications of the SPIES system lie in the area of energy-efficient production of industrial gases.  This system will enable production of oxygen at a cost that is significantly lower than those of the current energy-intensive processes.  Another application is the direct production of hydrogen for fuel cells. This system can be customized to address applications in other areas such as waste management, pollution control, environmental systems, bio-dome research facilities, medical life support tent systems, commercial underwater construction, and natural resource mining.","The SPIES system will find applications in in situ resource utilization (ISRU) to harvest consumables such as hydrogen and oxygen for life support for generating breathing air and potable water, reclaiming iron for in situ fabrication and repair (ISFR), and source materials for radiation shielding and shelter from hostile atmospheres to enable future space commercialization. The SPIES system will find application in efficient high-volume generation of hydrogen, oxygen, and other gases for applications other than ISRU, such as production of gases for use propulsion systems.",Air Revitalization and Conditioning; Biomedical and Life Support; Earth-Supplied Resource Utilization; In-situ Resource Utilization; Portable Life Support; Renewable Energy; Waste Processing and Reclamation

The shields will provide protection for homeland security first responders employed by law enforcement agencies, fire departments and hospitals.  It is also expected that the shielding can be fabricated into temporary shelters used by defense personnel and considered for use in the protection of individuals in case of a nuclear or radiological event.  The radiation-shielding material will be suitable for fabrication into protective clothing for healthcare professionals involved in X-ray and nuclear medicine.","The proposed multifunctional nanocomposites will find application in the Exploration Systems mission in protecting astronauts and sensitive optical, electronic, thermal and acoustic components from environmental hazards including radiation, dust and thermal transients while, at the same time, providing lightweight structural functions.

Whatever the task, robot teams will need to interact with Astronauts and possibly Mission Control. There is a need for cooperation and communication among all autonomous entities. Robotic intelligence is required in at least four areas: two-way communication with humans, safety awareness, self-monitoring, and self-maintenance. Robot teams will need to interact with Astronauts concerning the state of their hardware. They may need to interact with humans in order to insure human safety.  In Phase 1, we developed an initial HSI Framework (HSIF) to structure protocol-driven interactions (conversations) among Astronauts and multiple-component autonomous systems (soft-bot systems (SBS)). In Phase 2, we extend our HSI framework, with new protocol development that will support interactions among {human-robot team}, {SBS robot}, {human robot} and {SBS- human  robot team}. In Phase 2, a protocol library will be developed. Scenarios involving interactions among humans, robot teams and soft-bot systems will be simulated using the protocol library. The protocol library will be integrated with robotic software and implemented on a hardware (robot) platform.","This HSI Framework (HSIF) is also applicable to multiple DoD needs, as it is applicable to general autonomous systems.

They will perform precursor missions to pre-position resources for manned missions.  They will assist astronauts in site preparation, buildup, and maintenance of a lunar outpost.  To support these roles, new forms of human-robot interaction are needed.  Task-level commanding and predictive interaction are promising for tasks where time delay and limited bandwidth make tele-operations difficult.  Supervised autonomy has potential to make better use of human resources by reducing the mission preparation time for routine tasks.  But these new types of operations require human operators to support new types of tasks.  TRACLabs proposes to develop a software framework that facilitates human-robot teaming.  This software framework will provide tools for human supervisors to use when monitoring the performance and health of robots.  The framework also will assist task coordination by applying operational protocols for information communication and allocation of control during remote distributed operations.  This work is an innovative combination of technologies to support the new human tasks that arise when operating robots at different levels of autonomy.  For performance monitoring, we propose to develop tools for users to define and adjust monitoring conditions, computations, and summaries in response to changing situations and missions.  Additionally we will provide software to aid understanding of operational events and their relationship to underlying data.   To support coordinating tasks, we propose to integrate our existing agent technology for role-based notification using communication protocols with new technology for authorizing the handover of robotic control.  Phase II will produce a software framework for human-robot teaming.","Unmanned air and ground vehicles are becoming more common in battlefield situations.  Future Combat Systems envision manned and unmanned vehicles of all sizes working side-by-side.  Additionally, Congress has mandated that one-third of all military vehicles must be unmanned by 2015.  The military envisions robots and soldiers working side-by-side to accomplish missions, as well as remote operators supervising robot teams.  Currently several operators control one autonomous vehicle.  The proposed framework for human-robot interaction will help reverse this ratio.  The software developed under Phase II also has potential application for commercial robots. Health and performance monitoring of robots becomes particularly important when deploying robots for long-term, arduous operation.  And the ability to notify personnel of trends and issues using a variety of widely available communication modalities enables broader marketability.  The software for performance monitoring has potential application beyond the area of robotics. As household and workplace automation becomes pervasive, this type of technology is needed for health and performance monitoring.   Software to create custom summaries of data and notify users based on their situation and preferences has wide application with the growth of online information access and the availability of wireless devices.","Exploration missions will require that humans and robots work together.  Robots will perform high risk tasks like EVA and routine or repetitive tasks to improve crew productivity.  Introducing robots into manned space operations, however, will change the way these operations are conducted.  It will introduce new supervisory tasks for crew and ground control, including maintaining awareness of robotic activities and handling problems the robot cannot resolve.  The proposed software framework for human-robot teaming will enable effective human interaction with robots at different levels of autonomy.  Such capability will first be needed for lunar surface operations and will be enabling for manned missions into deep space.

The vehicle will feature four-wheel, all-terrain mobility with traction control. A multi-purpose tool interface and interchangeable cargo bays will support a variety of mission payloads. The LATUV will be used for mission such as site preparation, emplacing beacons, equipment and commodity distribution, and sampling. Our phase I work showed the feasibility of a new, high-efficiency, high duty, lunar-relevant traction drive system; a simplified steer / suspension chassis capable of handling 2 m/s speeds in lunar gravity; interchangeable utility modules for earthmoving, sampling, emplacing, etc.; and traction control software for earthmoving tasks as well as slope- and obstacle-climbing. In Phase II we will produce a terrestrial LATUV prototype with two rocker modules and two central modules designed for earthmoving the emplacing beacons.  ProtoInnovations brings an impressive amount of experience to the task of designing the LATUV. Two of our robots built for NASA Ames, dubbed K10red and K10black, are operating in the high Canadian arctic. Working at Carnegie Mellon University, members of our team have developed robots to operate in some of the harshest environments on Earth: surveying Antarctic ice fields, traversing the Atacama Desert, and exploring into an Alaskan volcano. In total, our robots have traveled roughly 500 km through some of the most difficult terrain on Earth. We've accomplished these tasks by building robots that are, above all else, controllable and reliable. Our team has experience building all of the subsystems involved in this project.","Innovations exhibited by the LATUV, such as traction control, a quick-disconnect tool interface, and those yet unrealized, will certainly be applicable to commercial markets beyond the lunar program. A scaled-down LATUV chassis would provide benefits for explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) robots similar to Foster-Miller's TALON. The flexible interface between the LATUV rockers and central modules makes the low-cost rockers line-replaceable units (LRUs) that could be very easily swapped out in the field. Maintaining field inventories of EOD robots would be much easier when parts are universally interchangeable. Repair tasks would also be much easier since no special tools or skills would be required.   Our drivetrain and chassis design will also benefit terrestrial UGVs operating at speeds of several meters per second. It is a more efficient alternative to tracked vehicles such as the Foster-Miller TALON that are used extensively by the military and police departments. Our design features will extend battery life while maintaining a good mobility performance.","ProtoInnovations will vigorously push our LATUV technology into NASA's manned and unmanned lunar exploration program. This will require close interaction with the customer. We will foster this by making the vehicle available for testing wherever possible. With our rapid and iterative approach to development and the flexible design of the LATUV, we will adapt as NASA's lunar exploration program continues.  The LATUV also represents a new class of space robotics research rover: larger, faster, and more capable than K9 and K10 with a high payload capacity. We'll partner with NASA research groups to make the LATUV terrestrial prototype available for this kind of field testing, in particular building on our partnership with NASA Ames IRG formed while building the K10 rovers.

When humans are present, robotic systems will assist and support them in the various activities of exploration and habitation. Given the great cost of developing such systems, transporting them to the Moon, and maintaining them there, NASA must ensure that the robots it sends are capable of many different tasks. This will enable a smaller number of robots to accomplish the necessary tasks while providing better redundancy in case of subsystem failure. We propose to build an innovative manipulation system that includes a modular dexterous manipulator for various mobile platforms and a software control system that seamlessly coordinates motion control of rover and manipulator. The manipulation system will be JAUS-compliant, enabling many existing technologies to easily interface with it. The proposed innovation has two main components. The primary component is a lightweight, low-power manipulation system for mobile platforms.  The manipulator itself will be swiftly reconfigurable with up to seven degrees of freedom (DOF).  There will be several different tools available for use at the end effector: some passive, some active.  All associated electronics will be internal to the manipulator, requiring only power and data connections externally.  Connections between modules will use the innovative ""Universal Mating Adapter"".  The second innovative component is a software control system that coordinates control of the vehicle and manipulator. Such coordination extends the robot's dexterous workspace and facilitates teleoperation by providing the operator with a unified interface.","There are many terrestrial applications where a robot adept at mobile manipulation would be preferable to a human.  These include bomb disposal and other hazardous tasks, disaster recovery, search and rescue, and law enforcement activities.  As with the NASA activities, a single universally-capable robot is unrealistic.  It is preferable to assess the situation and simply equip the robot with the appropriate tools for the current task.  Unlike NASA applications, where our primary customers are research groups exploring the issues of manned spaceflight who would provide recommendations to the teams that design future flight articles (perhaps including TRACLabs), our non-NASA customers will use our technology directly on the ""front lines"".","In manned missions, humans are scarce and valuable resources.  Thus, as many tasks as possible should be automated.  For tasks that require interaction with physical objects, this means robots!  Researchers in space-related fields have a lot of experience with robots that are all alone in space or on another planetary surface.  However, they are still gaining understanding of the extra complexities and capabilities that come when humans are nearby: close enough to teleoperate, service, or reconfigure the robot.  In particular, easily reconfigurable robots will be essential to future manned missions, especially where mobile manipulation is required, because a universally-capable robot is unrealistic.

However, conventional Li-ion batteries experience loss of capacity and increased impedance and poor cycle life when they are charged/discharged at high rates over C-rate. These problems are magnified at low temperature operation. The limitations in the high rate capability of Li-ion batteries are mainly caused by slow solid-state diffusion of Li+ within the electrode materials Yardney/Lithion Inc., the world leader in cutting edge Li-ion battery technology proposes to investigate new non-toxic nano-engineered electrodes that significantly shortens the Li+ diffusion length within the electrode materials and increases the rate capability of Li-ion batteries. The goal of this Phase II project is to manufacture rapid recharge Li-ion battery for aerospace application. Yardney will manufacture 5 prototype cells capable of recharge at less than 15 min at room temperature. During the phase I we found that the nanoengineered anode showed excellent rate capabilities compared to planar electrode. Nanoarchitectured current collector provides higher safety due to large surface area contact with the active material and that acts as heat sink in high rate applications and also lower impedance.","High power applications include power tools, electric vehicles and telecommunications. Automotive and industrial sectors, where the slim, small-sized battery will deliver large amounts of energy while requiring only a minute to recharge. For example, the battery's advantages in size, weight and safety highly suit it for a role as an alternative power source for hybrid electric vehicles.",he target application for this nanoengineered Li ion battery technology is space applications that require high energy and power densities. This technology will have superior performance at low temperatures due to the very small internal impedance of the nano-engineered electrode materials.

The single-cell performance of the larger cell will be compared against the smaller cell. Sub-scale stacks will be tested for durability. The number of cells per stack will be increased as the thermal management and mass transport phenomena permit.  Thermal modeling will be conducted to predict the level of heat removal required by scaled-up stacks. Thermal management techniques will be investigated to permit effective scale-up.  Flight cell stack and system design will be undertaken at the concept level.","DESC is pursuing several emerging markets through its Hydrogen Technology business unit.  The common element of these market opportunities is the need or desire for electrolysis-based hydrogen generation.  One of the emerging markets in the Hydrogen Technology business plan is backup power for wireless telecommunication sites.  Several fuel cell companies have already been offering backup power packages for this market.  However, the typical fueling solution has involved delivered hydrogen.  Based on the market analysis DES has conducted, this is not a practical solution for many wireless sites.  In response to this application gap, DES has been working with several fuel cell companies and backup power OEM's to specify a high pressure electrolyzer module (2,400 psi output) that will meet the recharge requirements for a fuel cell powered backup system.","Based on DESC's unique experience in commercializing PEM-based products, transitioning to military and civilian aerospace applications are important outcomes of this technology development effort. Civilian commercial derivatives of this technology would be enabling technology for airship-based telecommunications systems and reliable remote power applications. Impacts of this technology on military operations include enabling high altitude unmanned aerial vehicle operations and a variety of underwater vehicle operations, especially unmanned underwater vehicles. The similarity between the high altitude and undersea applications is that both require the storage of oxidant in addition to the storage of fuel.

Zero or low cryogenic propellant boiloff is required during extended missions and lengthy on-orbit times. Multilayer insulation (MLI) is currently the insulation of choice for cryotank insulation. MLI's high vacuum performance exceeds alternative insulations by a factor of ten.  However, heat flow through MLI is usually the largest heat leak in cryogenic systems, so improvements in thermal performance are desirable. Integrated Multi-Layer Insulation (IMLI) is an innovative new technology using a micro-molded polymer substructure integrated with radiation barriers to provide an ultra-high performance thermal insulation system.   IMLI was proven a viable concept in Phase I work, reaching TRL4 with component validation in the laboratory. Prototypes were built and tested, demonstrating equal to lower thermal conductivity than MLI, and layers attached to each other in a snap-together assembly with controlled layer spacing. The Phase I IMLI prototype had a thermal conductivity of 1.8 W/m2, with the Celcon polymer used for these prototypes still outgassing. The IMLI thermal conductivity was calculated to be 63% that of MLI, which would provide improved long term cryogenic propellant storage.   This improved insulation can provide lower thermal conductivity, vacuum compatibility, layers inherently attached to each other that support themselves, and efficient assembly. IMLI may also provide inherent structural benefits, including improved strength and integrity over current MLI.  This proposal is to further develop IMLI toward commercialization. Tasks proposed include a next generation design improving on what was learned in Phase I, for material selection, fabrication methods for seams and corners including interleaving and layer thermal matching, and building and testing prototypes in realistic environments such as a 500 liter cryotank.","There are current spacecraft and instrument thermal insulation needs outside of NASA that would benefit from IMLI.  DoD and commercial space ventures have requirements for thermal insulation.  The DoD space market is about equal to the NASA and commercial market, or potentially $100M over twenty years.   High performance thermal insulation has use in a broad range of non-aerospace applications and markets, including commercial cryogenic applications such as cryogenic vessels and pipes in scientific and industrial applications. A major use is insulating cryogenic dewars which are widely used in research (university, government and industrial labs), medical (preserving specimens and generating gases such as oxygen) and industrial uses. Another application is insulating superconducting devices such as medical MRI systems.   Other potential applications include large commercial tanks, industrial boilers and industrial hot and cold process equipment, refrigerated trucks and trailers, insulated tank, container and rail cars, liquid hydrogen fueled aircraft or fuel cells, appliances such as refrigerators and freezers, hot water heaters, Thermos type liquid containers, picnic and mobile containers to keep foods hot or cold, marine refrigeration, potentially even house structures.

IMLI has excellent properties required for spacecraft use; low thermal conductance, vacuum compatibility of materials, inherent control of layer dimensions and density, snap-together, self-supporting layers with a polymer substructure, and ease of assembly.   Specific NASA applications include insulation for the cryogenic propellant tanks for the EDS, LSAM and EDCUS vehicles.

Washington, Naperville, IL 60563 - 1366",(630) 557-1928,,,,,,,"The Phase I effort conceived a novel method for ISRU oxygen extraction and liquefaction from lunar regolith, repre-senting a significant advance in the state of the art.  The approach uses solar photovoltaics as a power source to heat and extract oxygen with highly favorable system metrics, capable of achieving TRL 3 during a Phase II effort and TRL 6 in earth gravity during Phase III. Autonomy of operation is straightforward with simple robotics.  Annual oxygen output is calculated to be many times the system mass.  Projections of engineering development indicate the potential to be flight-ready for lunar operations by the time a lunar outpost is established, followed by commercial lunar operations.","Many nations have announced plans for missions to the moon (China, Russia, India, Japan, Sweden, US).  With a fueling depot on the moon selling a guaranteed supply of LOX for return missions, an economic payback exists for the expenses required to build this factory on the moon.  Trips to Mars using chemical rockets can be fueled from the L1 point (""Gateway""), greatly reducing the rocket requirements for earth launch.","NASA Administrator Mike Griffin has been quoted saying that entrepreneurs who can extract oxygen on the moon by roasting the soil may generate a ""21st century gold rush"".  Mike Duke (Colorado School of Mines) has outlined a system involving transport of lunar LOX to LEO to service the needs of space operations, which can generate significant profits.  A number of methods for LLO to LEO transport have been envisioned to carry both passengers (tourists) and cargo.Economics become favorable with a high-value product such as fuel oxidizer.  Therefore, our invention is necessary for the commercialization of cis-lunar space, making space conducive to further development by entrepreneurs and aerospace companies.",In-situ Resource Utilization

Technology of low-loss thick volume Bragg gratings in photo-thermo-refractive (PTR) glass which provide extremely narrow spectral width down to 60 pm in the spectral range of 1.5 um is developed. New narrow-band filters based on coherent and incoherent combinations of Fabry-Perot etalons and volume Bragg gratings are demonstrated. The main purpose of this NASA SBIR Phase II project is to develop the prototype of a compact single-frequency mode laser oscillator with pulse energy in millijoule region by means of pulse pumped Er-doped single-mode fiber. The main feature of the laser design is the use of new narrow-band filters based on a coherent and incoherent combination of Fabri-Perot etalons and volume Bragg gratings (VBGs) recorded in photo-thermo-refractive (PTR) glass for longitudinal and transverse mode selection in an external laser resonator. Those new spectral filters will be used in external resonators of large area photonic crystal fibers. Optimization of parameters of Bragg filters and active fibers will provide both single frequency operation and high pulse energy.,"While the proposed project is directed to the particular NASA application, diffractive gratings in PTR glass have a lot of various applications in science and high technology. They will be used for laser beam steering, beam combining and sampling, intracavity mode control, etc. Moreover, PTR diffractive optical elements have great advantages for detection of laser signals in LIDARs and LADARs, for Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) in telecommunications, for spectral selection in telescopes used in astronomy, and in various optical sensors. Optical sensors are a major component of U.S. import and export trade, and, as an enabling technology, are critical to a broad range of fields: national security, environmental, material and information science, transportation and space exploration, construction and manufacturing, biology, chemistry, medicine, and many others.  The main area of interest of DoD government agencies and private laser and semiconductor companies is focused on spectrally and angularly controlled diffractive beam deflectors, beam steering elements, mode selectors, incoherent and coherent beam combiners for both solid-state and semiconductor lasers, adjustable attenuators and beam splitters for laser beams. It is clear that the range of PTR technology applications is significantly wider that those mentioned above. OptiGrate is committed to develop these various applications and successfully bringing them to the commercial markets in a cost effective manner.","Practical implementation of our innovation should dramatically increase the parameters of manufactured pulse lasers at 1.5 um. These lasers are applicable for a wide range of remote sensing devices and a number of instruments under consideration by NASA scientists. They include Lidar systems for global measurements of atmospheric winds, CO2 and Ozone concentrations, aerosol and cloud composition and density, and Earth surface topography. In addition, the Lidar remote sensing technology is being pursued for planetary exploration and aeronautics applications.   Potential NASA commercial applications of high efficiency diffractive optical elements in PTR glass are in the fields of high-resolution spectroscopy, narrow-band filtering for detection of different chemical agents, spectral scanning with sub-Angstrom resolution, remote sensing and targeting, range finding, spectral sensing and other NASA applications where diffractive optical components are the key elements.",Laser; Optical; Optical & Photonic Materials; Semi-Conductors/Solid State Device Materials

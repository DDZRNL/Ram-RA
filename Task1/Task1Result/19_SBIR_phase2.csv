These include recently developed approaches for mitigating the curse of dimensionality when training PROMs, SoA hyperreduction methods for achieving practical wall-clock solution times in the presence of structural nonlinearities and/or turbulence modeling, and various approaches for incorporating PMOR and PROMs in MultiDisciplinary Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) processes.The main goal of all innovations outlined above is to make high-fidelity aeroservoelastic MDAO problems feasible and practical, including for a relatively large number of design variables and constraints when needed for capturing the design problem in a realistic way -- that is, of relevance and interest to industrial problems.","The proposed development will contribute to NASA multidisciplinary design optimization studies of a variety of aircraft configurations of current and future interest controlled by many control effectors, including variable camber continuous trailing edge wings, distributed propulsion, morphing supersonic configurations, etc. NASA will benefit from the new technology by either using the numerical capabilities developed or by integrating selected modules of the new capabilities into NASA’s multidisciplinary optimization environment.",The new technology will create numerical capabilities not yet available for multidisciplinary design of aircraft controlled by many control effectors.

(ATA) and partners propose a Phase II SBIR project to further develop methods to efficiently characterize and predict noise performance of aircraft with substantial propulsion airframe aeroacoustics (PAA) effects. The methods utilize near-field surface source models informed by high-spatial-resolution acoustic measurements. Over the last decade, ATA has matured the multireference continuous-scan (CS) acoustic measurement technology that is needed to define and validate such source models. Previous demonstrations of CS measurements include beamforming, near-field acoustical holography, and turbofan tone order tracking.In Phase I, the team applied such measurements to canonical experiments along with a small-scale ducted fan using fixed and scanning sensors in the near, mid, and far field to define stochastic source models. These models supported novel acoustic shielding predictions by directly detecting the wavepacket-like nature of acoustic events that propagate to the far field as well as using this information to define surface-based source models to predict noise shielding/scattering from PAA using the boundary element method (BEM). Additionally, a 60-channel 2D rotating array characterized the sound field generated by a speaker with and without scattering bodies at an unprecedented high-resolution of nearly 10,000 virtual sensors. This provided a clear visualization of the interference patterns of a complex sound field in the presence of a rigid body and demonstrated the ability to couple isolated source characterization measurements to BEM for PAA problems.In Phase II, ATA proposes to extend the methods to more complex geometries in order to (1) define an efficient BEM-based noise prediction process that utilizes PAA sources derived from high-resolution CS measurements and/or state-of-the-art predictive tools, and (2) integrate the process into far-field noise prediction frameworks such as NASA’s Aircraft NOise Prediction Program (ANOPP).","This technology provides NASA new capabilities to develop next-generation airframes and propulsion systems. The tools will find use at NASA centers like the AAPL and 9′ × 15′ LSWT, the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnels, and the 14′ × 22′ subsonic tunnel and Structural Acoustics Loads and Transmission (SALT) facility. NASA can test PAA in these facilities with devices such as the Compact Jet Engine Simulator, Broadband Engine Noise Simulators, fan engine simulators, and a small turbofan.","Non-NASA applications of this high-resolution technology include air mobility vehicle noise, automotive and heavy equipment noise, consumer audio, and factory equipment. Many of these applications rely on source localization using acoustic cameras, implying immediate commercialization opportunities for the superior diagnostics resulting from this effort."

These improvements will allow for increased usage of phased-array flyover testing, and increased size/resolution arrays. Potential applications for the system include field-deployed noise flyover-measurement tests, and field-deployed engine-stand noise emissions tests. The realization of this capability not only benefits the testing of next-generation innovative noise-reduction airframe structures, but also impacts turbine test facilities, extending the current capabilities of NASA’s flight- and ground-test facilities.",The target application for entry into NASA is microphone flyover phased array measurement for low-noise commercial airplane technology development testing and for development of low boom technology of supersonic aircraft.  The proposed system is applicable to other NASA test interests such as full-scale static engine testing where large microphone phased arrays may be deployed to detect various sources of engine noise.

Given the technical challenges to meet the more stringent NOx emission limits at the higher CST cruising altitudes and the unique characteristics of the CST thermodynamic cycle, the proposed innovation intends to enhance the capabilities of the first-generation Software Toolkit for NASA’s OpenNCC CFD code. The second-generation Software Toolkit will feature (i) enhanced predictive accuracy of the primary turbulent flame with real fuels, NOx and soot, (ii) computational efficiency and (iii) software portability, e.g., to NASA’s OpenNCC. Since CST combustor concepts will operate at higher temperatures and with higher fuel flow rates, a detailed understanding of flame dynamics is required, in particular within the context of parametric or trade studies. Given the competing performance and emission targets to be considered, a large number of design parameters needs to be considered, including both geometric parameters as well as parameters associated with combustor operation, for instance use of alternative fuels as a means to reduce NOx emissions. The significance of the innovation is that it addresses NASA’s core needs for an economically feasible and environmentally acceptable propulsion technology suitable for a supersonic commercial aircraft. Historically, commercial supersonic transport has received significant opposition with respect to economic viability (e.g., due to excessive fuel consumption) and environmental impact, both in terms of sonic boom and noise generation for communities along the flight path as well as negative effects on the climate and on public health.","This product addresses (i) NASA’s core needs for an economically feasible and environmentally acceptable CST propulsion technology, (ii) NASA ARMD core needs for enabling safe and reliable operation of next-generation (e.g., ""N+3"" and beyond) ultra low-emission conventional gas-turbine engine as well hybrid electric aircraft propulsion and (iii) core needs of NASA’s vision for next-generation aircraft systems with hybrid integrated wing/body systems with significant improvements in engine performance, emissions and noise reduction.","The commercial market includes the broad aerospace, power-generation and defense industry.

Instead of designing specific hardware for the best static ratings and functionalities of the key equipment, dynamic inter-dependencies and functionalities must be modeled and controlled. This nonlinear fast control has become possible by progress in power electronics and materials. However, missing is the control logic for integrating these highly diverse technologies into a system which must meet difficult multiple performance objectives. This project is intended to fill this void. The unique contributions of this project are control and protection logic for providing power to vehicles operating over broad ranges of conditions. These include challenging missions as well as faults. In this project we view a vehicle as a composition of dynamically-controlled subsystems whose interactions depend on how sensing, control and protection are designed and integrated. The overall approach is the one of ``co-design” by which the candidate architecture is selected for its functionalities, control is designed and the hardware-control-protection integrated system is  re-assessed for its performance. This approach is one of the major new R&D&D pursued for changing terrestrial sources and the emerging  power systems, including stand-alone microgrids.  The problem of power train design for vehicle architectures is even harder because of the needs to reduce their weight and thermal effects, all else being equal. This requires control co-design selection of machines (DC, permanent magnet (PM), synchronous machines SM), doubly fed induction machines (DFIM)) and their power electronically-controlled conversion logic so that the integrated system meets previously unmet functionalities. This is achievable through cooperative control and protection of vehicle resources, loads and their interfaces.","The energy based control framework developed here directly addresses the need to integrate individual aircraft energy system components into electric power systems that operate in ways to ensure fault-tolerance, stability and efficiency.  It introduces a multi-layered interactive approach so the desired power is provided in transiently stable ways in response to varying aircraft situations. The approach can be extended to controlling electric power systems for single vehicle and future multi-vehicle manned deep-space missions.","The non-NASA commercial applications primarily concern the operation of terrestrial electric power systems such as utility systems, “smart” grids and micro-grids. The proposed framework enables a significantly new approach to the modeling and control of future electric power systems which require the integration of diverse energy storage and intermittent resources."

A critical barrier to UAM adoption is ensuring safety of passengers in hard-landing and crash scenarios. Our proposed solution is to develop an advanced materials system that is light-weight, highly energy-absorbent/dissipative, and capable of out-performing current solutions by providing multi-/omnidirectional impact protection. Current solutions typically fail in this latter regard, and instead trade-off between the amount of energy absorbed and the directional sensitivity to a given impact.

The result is a metamaterial that is lighter, stronger, and more multi-functional. Our SBIR Phase I effort was successful at developing OIMMs that satisfy the technical criteria desired in energy absorbing devices without making the trade-offs typically found in such systems.  In this SIBR Phase II proposal, we seek to build on the success of our feasibility study to: (1) further validate the properties of our OIMM structures in empirical tests; (2) determine a pathway for scalable manufacturing of high-performance OIMMs; and (3) demonstrate scalable manufacturing of OIMMs for UAM vehicle crash protection. If successful, our deliverables will include new IP that we will commercialize in the trucking/semi-trailer manufacturing industry, where OIMMs have the potential to displace high-density foams currently used in the construction of semi-trailers.

Some of these changes include electrode expansion, electrode ruffling, dendrite formation, internal gas formation, and internal density changes. A key characteristic of these changes is that most of them occur prior to any external measurable parameter variation, such as in terminal voltage, surface temperature, or mechanical surface strain. Therefore, detecting internal cell structural and mechanical changes early and with adequate resolution has several benefits, including the prevention of catastrophic accidents sufficiently ahead of time, and the gathering of additional information that can be used to more accurately assess the health and life of cells during operation. We propose a novel approach that simultaneously detects and corrects these internal cell changes early and using hardware that can be permanently installed externally on the surface of a lithium-ion cell. Our approach enhances the safety and prognostics associated with lithium-ion batteries, and its reconstruction capability has the added benefit of rejuvenating a cell to extend its life. Finally, the proposed solution will be implemented on small, low cost, and low power hardware to ensure its seamless integration to existing commercial cells and systems.","It is estimated that the proposed system can have a substantial impact in the following NASA projects: Advanced Air Transport Technology (AATT) project, Flight Demonstrations and Capabilities (FDC) project, Transformation Tools and Technologies (TTT) project,  as well as the NASA X-57 prototype and other efforts where electric and/or hybrid-electric propulsion systems are being engineered at NASA.","Battery technologies are critical for renewable systems, such as solar, wind, and hybrid/electric vehicles.

The new avionics will have 2 sets of computing cores. One high speed set of cores running Linux and hosting non-critical software.  The other computing cores run in lock-step and host critical software. The two zones of criticality execute completely separate operating systems, preventing faults from crossing zones and allowing zones to be reset independently of one another.  The avionics package also includes an Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), allowing limitless extensibility. Combined, the platform provides maximum flexibility with reconfigurable hardware and high speed computing as well as maximum reliability with a lock-step processor, all in a low cost package about the size of a deck of playing cards. In addition to the increased safety and flexibility, this proposal also includes integration of NASA’s Autonomy Operating System (AOS) directly into Airliner as native applications, providing Airliner a path to Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) integration.  This proposal makes this possible with the increased performance, with no sacrifice in safety. Current avionics platforms capable of running Airliner flight software take up to 80% of the processing power performing just minimal stable flight. The proposed avionics has up to an 1100% increase in performance, depending on the configuration, providing ample processing power to run both Airliner and AOS with margin to spare for growth and additional functionality.  Integration with AOS not only provides a significant increase in functionality, but the development process of AOS fits well with the Airliner development, providing a smooth path to FAA certification.","There are numerous NASA projects that could use this avionics board, including both Autonomy Operating System (AOS) as well as Independent Configurable Architecture for Reliable Operations of Unmanned Systems with Distributed On-board Services (ICAROUS, https://software.nasa.gov/software/LAR-19281-1).

We define operational risk from the airline perspective as the likelihood that flights will be delayed, re-routed, or cancelled due to weather, congestion, and FAA decisions. Using algorithms based on analysis of historical data and current weather and forecasts, ORCA generates conditional capacity probabilities and combines them with airline cost data to define the possible scenarios and quantify the expected cost of airline actions under the possible outcomes. ORCA will provide airlines with an improved ability to predict possible operational conditions at destination airports, allowing them to build better plans and manage their network operations to improve on-time performance, customer satisfaction, and assist the FAA in matching demand to available capacity. Our tool provides a guide for airlines to make decisions under uncertainty, estimating the expected costs of different actions for a set of possible outcomes. For the FAA, ORCA offers a tool to integrate multiple factors into a probabilistic assessment of ever-changing conditions and their potential impact on flight safety and efficiency. Our concept aims to support airlines operating in an environment in which they collaborate with the FAA to define objectives, share constraint information, develop plans, and share responsibility in the execution. In that vision, operators require the ability to predict with greater accuracy than today what the operating conditions and constraints will be over the next several hours.

The future ATS will need to support an incredibly diverse set of vehicles operating from urban vertiports in addition to conventional airfields. Approach and landing systems were originally designed for tube and wing aircraft operating between large airfields with long, clear approach paths free from obstacles. Similar performance characteristics across the fleet enabled the creation and publication of standardized approach and landing trajectories. Future aircraft, especially those designed for high cruise efficiency, may not be capable of meeting standardized approach and landing performance criteria. Urban air mobility concepts typically require small vertiports without clear approach paths increasing the likelihood of encountering wind shear and turbulence during approach and landing. Low wing loaded and disc loaded vehicles, which include many future air vehicle concepts, are more susceptible to turbulence and face larger deviations from the desired trajectory in turbulent conditions. We propose researching, developing, and commercializing an innovative solution to these challenges called the Performance-based Approach and Landing System (PALS). PALS will use information about the air vehicle’s performance and estimates of current turbulence and wind shear levels to autonomously create safe performance-based trajectories for approach and landing. PALS will be able to estimate and control the aircraft’s future position along the generated trajectory to coordinate with air traffic control or directly with other aircraft.

The risk is amplified in urban areas due to presence of tall building and other manmade objects. The phenomenon of urban canyon can cause high winds between building that are beyond the capabilities of current meso scale weather prediction models. High demand operations such as package delivery involves the sUAS to take off from fulfilment center, travel to the destination and land where the customers are and takeoff for the return journey. Therefore, the ability to forecast hyperlocal weather is a critical requirement for sUAS operations. During Phase I of the project the team demonstrated the feasibility of the concept by forecasting winds over a nine-block urban area in Manhattan. The technology combines the coarse estimates of mesoscale prediction from NOAA weather products with high fidelity but localized ground station data using machine learning and computation fluid dynamics simulations. For the Phase II effort the team proposes to expand the use of GUMP over a larger urban as well as rural area while validating the results with mobile ground-based sensors. When fully functional, GUMP will fill a critical gap in weather prediction technology that will be beneficial for NASA researchers and industry UAS operators.","Researchers at NASA will find the tool useful for exploration of new concepts in small UAS operations. The service will allow them to identify times of day best suited for specific applications, e.g., package delivery operations should occur at times with very relatively calm weather while surveillance operations can take place in presence of mild winds as these operations do not involve landing. The operations can be designed as per local weather neighborhoods.","GUMP service would be most beneficial for commercial operators of sUAS. At present no such service exists. Companies like Amazon, Google and Uber are investing millions of dollars towards sUAS operations and this service would help them improve the reliability of their operations. General aviation pilots can also use the service then taking off from an un-towered airport."

This effort will consist of designing and fabricating a multi-band transceiver chip that can provide ADS-B functionality. In addition, the chip will also have the ability to port vehicle data into other formats for dissemination over multiple bands to enable integration into multi-vehicle missions. In Phase II, the components of this chip will be developed and tested individually, and then integrated into a final design as a single chip. This will be tested in the lab, on the ground in a moving vehicle, and finally in flight on KalScott's small UAV.","The ADS-B chip can be integrated into several NASA UTM projects underway, aimed at the safe integration of UAVs into the national airspace. Discussions with the NASA COTR have identified insertion points for this technology. An interesting feature is the ability of this chip to serve as a bridge between ADS-B and other emerging IoT messaging protocols. This would enable exchange of information between aerial vehicles, ground vehicles, fixed nodes, etc. to support multi-node robotic/automated operations.","The ADS-B chip is aimed at the manufacturers and operators of civilian UAVs, specially small UAVs operated in dense urban environments. It can also be adapted for larger UAVs to enable ADS-B In/Out for longer range operations."

The system allows position determination of an aircraft using ground nodes that transmit very accurately timed (subnanosecond) short pulses and only propagation time differences are used to determine aircraft position. Two variants are Comms Mode (which uses an active node on the cooperating aircraft) and Radar Mode (which assumes no extra hardware on the aircraft). The advantage of Comms Mode is that its link budget is based on a 1/r^2 propagation loss so it is easy to achieve the required range coverage to 1000’ altitude above a Take Off and Land area (TOLA); and that all processing for position determination can be done locally within the aircraft. The advantage of the Radar Mode is that it can detect non-cooperating aircraft in the service volume, but then has to transmit the position information to the aircraft by some other means. Radar Mode also suffers from the fact that the radar equation propagation loss is 1/r^4, limiting effective range at the low RF power levels desired. Phase II will begin by developing the hardware, firmware and software for a COTS based Comms Mode prototype. Five nodes will be built and tested on the ground and in flight. The work performed in Phase I to determine operating frequencies, waveforms, pulse coding, positioning algorithms will be realized in working hardware that will be tested. Phase II will also further develop Radar mode operation using same hardware by using multiple pulses and a coherent receiver architecture, though this will be at higher risk than Comms Mode. Flight testing will be carried out with two second generation GUMPS nodes that will be built using custom hardware in a low size, weight and power configuration. These will be based on the preliminary design from Phase I. A three-month flight test program will employ the second generation hardware on a commercial helicopter with ground nodes at its home base.TBD","GUMPS can provide vertical and slant approach conformance and flight guidance integrity monitoring.  Using the multi-static nodes that are installed at surveyed sites, and on cooperative air vehicles, ensures that GPS errors and dropouts will not require alternative approach/departure procedures.  IFR and non-piloted air vehicle approaches can be provided accurate approach guidance information with GUMPS acting as a GPS integrity monitor .  This is true for conventional and vertical flight approaches.  A Field expedient GUMPS is also possible.","Placement of non-surveyed GUMPS nodes can provide an expedient landing zone in IFR and for unmanned vertical capable vehicles by tracking their position relative to the system's node orientation.  This is valuable for emergency service support (police, fire, medical, Homeland security and FEMA).  It provides DoD with an expeditionary Landing Zone capability for unmanned air vehicles and IFR ops."

Because of its potential to be easily tunable in response to combustion dynamics observed in operation, we expect to develop this injector for a stable operation at a rapid pace.  This injector can be used in any system flowing hot high-speed hydrogen or hydrogen-rich mixture needed to be burned or neutralized, such as NASA's ground testing of nuclear rocket engines or similar hydrogen-rich combustion devices.

Our meshing technology provides equivalent propellant flow and transpiration cooling behavior as Rigimesh, but eliminates the need for welding that faceplate in place, which results in a drastic reduction in both cost and lead time for a modern propellant injector. Importantly, our mesh is not based upon either a CAD representation of a faceplate that contains thousand or tens of thousand of individual orifices, which makes the STL and slice files (needed for actual printing) prohibitively large (~5 GB) and extremely low-quality.  Equally importantly, our mesh is of regular orientation and is not stochastic in any way.  We proved in Phase I that such meshes do not flow in a manner consistent with good injector compatibility or in a repeatable manner. Instead, our regular mesh is printed by direct, but simple (in hindsight) manipulation of the selective laser melting (SLM) process itself.  The porosity of the mesh can be manipulated by the designer and tailored (within the same faceplate) to the local flowfield.  The CAD file for such meshes is very small (~10kB), which results in very small STL and slice files.  It also means the resultant mesh prints very quickly compared to both alternative approaches. Critically, our mesh printing technology enabled a breakthrough in the printing of small orifices: AFA was among the best AM vendors in the printing of small holes using traditional CAD depictions, and the smallest holes were able to print prior to this Phase I was on the order of 0.012"".  With this new technology we have developed, holes as small as 0.003"" were printed during Phase I and showed excellent repeatability and excellent flow behavior.

For the exploration of space, therefore, a method is needed to assess operator state, quickly and reliably detect stress, and provide objective feedback to the individual, crew, and ground support, in order to mitigate adverse events and mishaps. Due to the unique challenges of NASA missions, Quantum Applied Science and Research (QUASAR) proposes to develop a system to identify Individualized, Noninvasive Speech Indicators for Tracking Elevations in Stress (INSITES).

A methodology for recalibrating normative models to individuals using minimal additional training data in order to optimize model performance will be developed. QUASAR will also prepare and validate an INSITES prototype that will provide a real-time visual output describing an individual’s stress level. The prototype will be based upon an app that can be readily installed on a mobile device or implemented in NASA spacecraft and habitats to detect changes in stress acutely and over time.","Unobtrusive, low volume, easily-integrated stress detection for all NASA missions involving constrained space and weight, including Earth-based training, low Earth orbit, and deep space.","Multiple markets across both military and civilian mission critical environments where personnel operate and communicate in stressful environments.

Human metabolic solid waste (feces) contains 75% water by mass which is currently not recovered on the ISS and is instead transported back to earth. Return transportation of this waste results in significant cost and unneeded payload utilization. Water recovery and stabilization of solid waste is a critical technology gap for long-duration human planetary exploration and future missions to the moon and Mars. Under SBIR Phase Ι, direct contact ultrasonic results showed that it is feasible to remove 80-100% of the water from human solid waste at the rate exceeding >140 kg/m2.hr, which is about 2 orders of magnitude faster than conventional thermal (evaporative) based drying at a fraction of the energy input. The direct contact ultrasonic drying technology was invented at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in 2015. During 2015-2017, the ORNL team demonstrated five times higher drying energy efficiency for clothing (1/5th of the energy input) and two times faster drying rates compared to state-of-the-art residential clothes dryers. In September 2018 the lead inventor, Dr. Ayyoub Momen, along with a team of seasoned professionals launched UTS, and exclusively licensed the direct contact ultrasonic drying technology from ORNL for commercial and industrial fields of use. Phase Ι of SBIR showed a promising result for removing water from feces. Under SBIR Phase II, the team is planning to design, develop and evaluate the performance of a full-scale ultrasonic drying machine that is compatible with the established solid waste management system at ISS.","Removing water using direct contact ultrasonic drying can potentially reduce the operational cost of space travel and improve crew hygiene and comfort. Excess water in feces adds up to approximately 680 kgs (1,496 lbs.) of unnecessary waste for a 1,000-day mission by a crew of four.",Direct contact ultrasonic drying is a platform technology that has the potential to dry many types of material. Many other industries and markets have strong potential for long term business.

STOOLE allows the recovery of this water in concert with the traditional ECLSS and the high-level of feces dehydration will limit ongoing biological risks. STOOLE also improves the overall logistics of long-duration and planetary exploration by eliminating the disposable Universal Waste Management System (UWMS) canisters and bags and replacing them with a reusable canister and potentially up-cycleable expanded PTFE bags that can be fused into useful end products or allow the solid waste to be likewise upcycled as filler and reinforcement of 3D printed objects.

Maintaining an antimicrobial residual is crucial for assuring water potability.  The Halogen Binding Resin (HBR) technology is directed toward developing halogen (chlorine or bromine) based water disinfection using an approach that resembles that currently used for iodine delivery.  The aim of the research is to develop flow-through devices containing a novel HBR for the controlled release of halogen for water disinfection.  Previous materials that bind chlorine and bromine fall short of meeting NASA’s biocide residual needs. Successful syntheses of two slow-release resins during the Phase I effort should be expanded upon.  Both of these resins function exceptionally well for bromine slow-release, however, our initial attempts to develop a resin for the slow-release of chlorine have been unsuccessful.  Although a continued effort to develop a chlorine based resin will be ongoing, a bromine based resin may be well suited to NASA’s needs.  Bromine has been adopted by the US NAVY as their primary means of disinfecting potable water aboard naval vessels.  Our resin will be used in a simple flow-through cartridge that will act as both a contact kill biocide device and as a source of free chlorine or bromine.  A halogen residual of 0.5 to 4 mg/L will be delivered to the water.  This concentration range is generally accepted as being safe and therefore removal is not required prior to crew consumption.  The residual concentration will remain within this range over a wide range of flows.  This Halogen Binding Resin will be entirely analogous to the original MCV® resin but will release chlorine or bromine instead of iodine.  The next generation Microbial Check Valve (MCV2) made with this resin can be used as a direct replacement for the currently used MCV®.","The NASA application will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future manned missions.  The production and storage of safe potable water is a requirement for all manned operations in space.  MCV2 technology will be microgravity compatible, reliable (>3-year life), and will remain functional with system pressures exceeding 30 psig.  The  MCV2 will find application in various deep space manned exploration mission phases including Mars transit.","Non-NASA applications of this MCV2 technology will find widespread use in terrestrial markets.  MCV2 technology is particularly applicable towards water disinfection in locations where access to safe drinking water is unavailable.  In many third world nations, the occurrence of diseases such as typhoid and cholera, which originate from waterborne pathogens, could be prevented by MCV2 use."

One of the key technical challenges for xPLSS operation on the Martian surface is the need to vent CO2 and water vapor from the swingbeds to an ambient pressure that is generally greater than the bed desorption pressure. We propose to develop a boost compressor that will enable the swingbeds to operate on the Martian surface. The boost compressor will pump CO2 and water vapor from the beds to the external environment with a pressure rise that is high enough to overcome the local ambient pressure. Compact size and high efficiency will enable use of the system as part of a portable life support system.

NASA has identified technology gaps in using the xPLSS for deep space and surface missions, specifically Mars missions due to the amine swing-bed system not being designed for the partial atmosphere of Mars. To bridge this technological gap and simplify future adoption, Air Squared successfully fabricated the novel Spinning Scroll Boost Compressor (SSBC) designed to meet NASAs specification pulling vacuums down to 0.1 torr and outlet pressures tolerance over 15.2 PSIA in Phase I. The SSBC is a compact and ultra-reliable boost compressor which can run at a wide range of operating conditions and doesn’t need to run at tens of thousands of RPM’s to achieve performance. For Phase I, the primary technical objective was to run the SSBC as fast as possible in order to confirm the high speed capability of the SSBC and select the operating speed for the ground up prototype to be developed during Phase II. This objective was accomplished. For Phase II, Air Squared will develop an Alpha Prototype in year one and a Beta prototype in year two. The Alpha will demonstrate the operation of the SSBC in a simulated Martian environment while the Beta prototype will include design updates which more aggressively decrease size and weight and increase life.","The SSBC will define next-generation PSA for xPLSS xEMU in Mars and Deep Space exploration. Capable of operating over several different partial atmospheric environments in a compact footprint, the SSBC will provide flexible and reliable xPLSS design adaptable to varied NASA missions and provide a foundation for both Lunar Gateway habitation and human exploration of Mars. This will accelerate the SSBC’s adaptability for the ORION Spacecraft. The SSBC would fulfill a vital function of PLSS CO2 removal in advanced extravehicular activities.","Given the improved pressure and flow rate, adaptability as a compressor and  vacuum pump, and reduced complexity of spinning scrolls, several positive displacement solutions would benefit from the development of the SSBC. Qualified spinning scroll machines would upgrade the performance of aerospace environmental control systems, vacuum mass spectrometry, and the commercial space industry."

Furthermore, Alphacore developed a full set of strategies utilizing radiation hardness by design (RHBD) techniques for the whole design flows to achieve high radiation hardness of the converter to increase reliability of space applications. Fully integrated isolated DC-DC converters are essential for power monitoring, biomedical, and motor control applications where ground isolation is required. Several applications require traditional low-voltage CMOS data acquisition circuits to interface with very high common mode voltages. These include current sensors that operate at the high side of a voltage source, solar converters/inverters, DC motor controllers, FET drivers that switch high voltages and eMeter data products for smart grid management. Alphacore’s mixed-signal isolated DCDC converter controller enables use of a wide range of small transformers and capacitors through high frequency operation.","The applications for the ASIC are numerous since almost all spacecrafts need DC-DC converters. It is especially ideal for low power applications such as the next generation xEMU spacesuit and xPLSS for the future manned missions to the Moon, and Moon to Mars missions. The DC-DC converter is a great match for NASA’s LEO and MEO missions and future deep space and Earth-observing missions. Past similar missions include ECOSTRESS, GeoCARB, HyspIRI, MAIA, InSAR, Pre-ACE, TEMPO, TROPICS and solar system exploration missions such as MAVEN.","The new Alphacore DC-DC converter is application-driven and is meant to be an excellent fit for key Small Size Weight and Power (SWaP) high-reliability (Hi-Rel), high-radiation tolerance levels applications such as the cubesats, nanosats, robotics, autonomous aircrafts/spacecrafts, and constellation satellites that may be operational in space environments."

These deployable array systems have been optimized for maximum specific power (W/kg) and maximum specific packaging volume (W/m3) for a given array size and power requirement in a microgravity environment. The structural requirements for these systems have traditionally been derived from minimum stiffness requirements and/or spacecraft guidance, navigation and control (GNC) acceleration rates, not from terrestrial or lunar gravity. The proposed array concept can perform multiple deployment and retraction cycles, and is simple and reliable, and will be relatively low cost compared to more complex fully mechanical systems.  The proposed system will also be modular and scalable such that elements of the lunar lander array will be directly applicable to building a power infrastructure for lunar surface arrays in the future. A new light weight deployable solar power array module is proposed to address the need for a retractable solar array for the initial human lunar lander and future lunar surface applications. The proposed concept leverages recent advancements in thin film solar cell array technology which enables the array to be rolled into a compact cylindrical shape for stowage. The proposed concept uses a very simple pneumatic deployment system to deploy the system and a passive constant torque spring to retract the array. The simplicity and reliability of pneumatic/hydraulic systems have led to their widespread use in aircraft applications. The constant force/torque spring mechanism for retraction requires no power, motors, or controls. The combination of current state of the art flexible thin film solar array technology with a very simple and reliable deployment/retraction system will result in a highly reliable solar array system capable of multiple deployments and retractions in space and lunar surface environments.","Current NASA programs and applications that would benefit from the development of this technology are: Lunar Gateway, Lunar Human Lander, Lunar Outpost, High Power Electric Propulsion, Orbit Transfer Vehicles","Commercial and DoD spacecraft with high power requirements or launch volume constraints Commercial targets include One Web, Starlink, and Project Kuiper DoD satellites that need to retain stealth capabilities"

This “Sustainability Base” will require habitat environmental control and life sustainment systems. Such systems are necessarily complex, the volumes of sensor data are large and not well-suited for human-only monitoring, and the consequences of system failure are severe. Thus, to sustain optimal performance and avoid catastrophic failures, NASA seeks a health management system that will continuously monitor and quickly and accurately diagnose faulty system behavior. Navatek proposes to develop a fault prediction and detection solution that improves NASA’s ability to reveal latent, unknown conditions while also improving its detection time and reducing the rate of false positive and negative detections of known conditions that would lead to failure of the life sustainment system. Our approach feeds historical and real-time sensor data to a digital twin of the life sustainment systems, which is a digital simulation of the entire functioning system and its environment. This digital twin is used by a reinforcement learning adversarial agent to simulate many possible scenarios into the future. The adversarial agent autonomously learns the environmental and system perturbations that lead to faults in its simulations, thus providing a method for prediction. These predictions are continuously compared against new incoming data to detect faults and further improve the digital twin’s accuracy. If successful, our proposed solution will provide NASA with an early warning system for faults in the life sustainment systems on space habitats, particularly integrity of the structural and HVAC systems. We will also show how our digital twin and reinforcement learning adversarial agent approach can be generalized to monitor other space habitat systems.","If successful, the active fault detection architecture we are developing would significantly expand the operational envelope of NASA space environment research by enabling faults to be accurately predicted and prevented by a fault management system, saving lives and infrastructure.

The distance from Earth makes communication less reliable and mission management more complex, and places a greater burden on human crews. Managing the complexity of the various onboard systems, processes, and resources, including health systems, payloads, etc., will present new kinds of crew challenges and stresses not experienced in Earth orbit where the ground station manages much of the mission. Autonomous cognitive agents that act as “virtual assistants” could interact with the crew and with the onboard systems to help with tasks that would be too burdensome or time-consuming for the crew alone. Cognitive agents based on modular, extensible cognitive architectures are needed to enable effective interaction, reasoning, problem solving, and teaming with human crews. In Phase I, we explored different use cases and design concepts, developed designs and simple prototypes, and conducted an initial feasibility assessment. Based on our findings in Phase I, SoarTech proposes in Phase II to develop a comprehensive working prototype cognitive architecture-based virtual assistant to support human exploration in deep space, and to demonstrate it in a representative environment. In performing this Phase II work, we will leverage our team’s considerable background in cognitive architectures, interactive systems, cognitive systems engineering, user-centered design, and space operations.

Given the structural and functional complexities of modern NASA space missions such as the lunar exploration using the Gateway, and other human exploration missions in development, SE processes need to have extensive Fault Management (FM) support and analytic capabilities right at the onset of system design, to capture their operational relevance during missions. The key focus of the Systems Engineering Handbook is System Level Analysis across the entire Life Cycle performed within Cost and Schedule constraints. QSI, in partnership with Sanford Friedenthal of SAF Consulting, and Stephen Johnson of Dependable System Technologies (DST) plans to develop a TEAMS-FM (Fault Management) “plugin” capability with the SysML modeling environment, that (1) provides a capability to perform FM analysis of a system-of-systems (SoS) design in SysML, (2) enables the FM design to be evaluated in an operational context by performing System Health Management (SHM), (3) supports Trade Studies to evaluate the merits of a architecture such as Sensor Placement, Fault Protection, etc. and (4) enables a “System” level assessment and visualization of FM qualities in the SysML Diagrams. The proposed effort seeks to aid the integration of FM of system(s) with the MBSE environment in multiple usage scenarios by utilizing existing capabilities and migrating them into the SysML IDE (Integrated Development Environment). The integration of TEAMS-FM plugin in SysML will entail information integration; extending, as necessary, existing SysML conventions to accommodate FM entities; and assessing the effect of implementing ISHM on the overall efficacy of the system design during the SE phase.

The low power comes from the type of machine learning (Spiking Neural Network (SNN)) and the hardware the neuromorphic anomaly detector runs on. The ability to detect and react to anomalies in sensor readings on board resource constrained spacecraft is essential, now more than ever, as enormous satellite constellations are launched and humans push out again beyond low Earth orbit to the Moon and beyond. Spacecraft are autonomous systems operating in dynamic environments. When monitored parameters exceed limits or watchdog timers are not reset, spacecraft can automatically enter a 'safe' mode where primary functionality is reduced or stopped completely. During safe mode the primary mission is put on hold while teams on the ground examine dozens to hundreds of parameters and compare them to archived historical data and the spacecraft design to determine the root cause and what corrective action to take. This is a difficult and time consuming task for humans, but can be accomplished faster, in real-time, by machine learning. As humans travel away from Earth, light travel time delays increase, lengthening the time it takes for ground crews to respond to a safe mode event. The few astronauts onboard will have a hard time replacing the brain power and experience of a team of experts on the ground. Therefore, a new approach is needed that augments existing capabilities to help the astronauts in key decision moments. We provide a new machine learning approach that recognizes nominal and faulty behavior, by learning during integration, test, and on-orbit checkout. This knowledge is stored and used for anomaly detection in a low power neuromorphic chip and continuously updated through regular operations. Anomalies are detected and context is provided in real-time, enabling both astronauts onboard, and ground crews on Earth, to take action and avoid potential faults or safe mode events.","The software developed in Phase II can potentially be used by NASA for anomaly detection onboard the ISS, the planned Lunar Gateway, and future missions to Mars.

Preclinical evaluation of the technology demonstrated the ability to reproducibly stimulate degenerated retinal tissue and safely insert the implant into the subretinal space of both rats and pigs. The implants are manufactured using a layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly technique, in which alternating layers of the light-activated protein, bacteriorhodopsin, and a polycation are sequentially deposited onto a film. However, the current terrestrial LBL approach is influenced by gravity, in which sedimentation and gradients of solutions interfere with the quality of the implants. We hypothesize that manufacturing in a microgravity environment will improve the quality of the films and, as a result, will enhance stability and performance for future preclinical and clinical trials. A pilot manufacturing trial was carried out on the ISS via SpaceX CRS-16, which resulted in the proof of concept of creating multilayered thin films using a LEO platform. Subsequently, a Phase I SBIR effort allowed us to perform a series of parameterization experiments for follow-on spaceflight optimization. In this Phase II proposal, we will build on the terrestrial-based findings to achieve the following: (1) the completion of a LBL prototype with optimized parameters for implementation in microgravity, (2) the design of a chamber configuration that supports scale up for nonclinical non-GLP toxicity studies in a large animal model, and (3) a proof of concept of utilizing the LBL microgravity device for additional applications beyond the proposed use in vision restoration. This Phase II effort fits in to NASA’s strategic plan for commercialization in LEO to build a sustainable production pipeline for this technology and for forthcoming technologies in the biomedical sector.","This Phase II SBIR establishes the capabilities required to support LEO commercialization of protein-based retinal implants. The implant targets patients with retinal degeneration, a leading cause of blindness for millions around the globe, including astronauts exposed to extended-duration spaceflight. The work outlined will support a new sector in the Space economy, which utilizes the impact of microgravity on physical systems to improve current production methods for patient therapies.","An enhanced layer-by-layer manufacturing process can improve the homogeneity, orientation, and stability of multilayered thin films for broad applications, including retinal implants, photovoltaic cells, chemical sensors, drug delivery systems, and tissue engineering. Efficient ordering of biomaterials is of interest to scientists with technologies across therapeutic and biomedical sectors."

SNSPDs are planned for use in future NASA space-to-ground laser communication. In the current state of the art, the clock rates are limited in part by the timing jitter of the SNSPD. Improving the timing jitter of SNSPDs results in higher clock rates, higher data rates and longer ranges. Currently timing jitters of 2.7pS have been demonstrated in laboratory research. The Phase 1 SBIR Project focused on the feasibility of a low power, low noise cryogenic differential amplifier. It is expected that integrating the amplifier with the SNSPD will lower the timing jitter to less than 1pS, allowing higher data rates and longer ranges without requiring additional mass and power on a spacecraft. Higher data rates will also result in higher resolution images received from space probes. The successful completion of Phase 1 resulted in the delivery of a differential amplifier prototype for integration and testing with a SNSPD. The delivered amplifier exhibits 20db of gain, 5K noise temperature with 2.0mW of power dissipation. The next phase towards a long-range communication system is to fabricate a multi-channel MMIC and construct a 64channel receiver. A 64 channel receive allows 64 digital bits of information. The large number of digital bits are necessary for high speed communications and high-resolution images. The scope of the Phase 2 research will focus on miniaturization of the differential amplifier and design of the 64channel receiver.  Delivery of the receiver will push the efforts for a longer-range optical communications system.",Communications between Deep Space Network stations and spacecraft use large single dish microwave antennas. The ability of the dishes to receive and process large amounts of data is limited. The solution is using Long Range Optical Transceivers.  Super Conducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors are moving this technology into reality. A low-noise cryogenic differential amplifier completed during Phase 1 is a critical component for a 64channel receiver. The new receiver will increase data rates and ranges for deep-space optical communication.,"Commercial applications will benefit from the high performance of Long-Range Optical Transceivers.  Applications include Cloud data systems, back haul systems, commercial satellite communications and imaging in the medical field.  The amplifier coupled with the Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detector will extend the useful distance, data rate and reliability of the optical receiver."

NNs are used as function approximators, learning the complex relationship between spacecraft state and the costates defining the OC to return to a reference trajectory. The NNEP technology builds on the variety of technologies that exist for onboard navigation (such as GPS, CAPS, or OpNav). Once the spacecraft has generated a state estimate, it evaluates a pre-trained NN to find the corresponding costates (non-physical terms created in the process of solving an OC problem). The NNEP technology maps state errors to costates because the costates are always smoothly-varying, even for non-smooth OC. Within seconds of the nav update, the spacecraft autonomously determines the control required for the next several days and checks for constraint violations. The NNEP technology consists of both a novel application of NNs to relevant astrodynamics problems and an architecture for implementing this technology in real operational environments and in flight software (FSW). A proof of concept of the technology was developed during Phase I, including demonstration of the building blocks for a FSW implementation. Phase II funding will mature the technology further and result in a prototype FSW implementation running on representative space hardware. Many research groups are now investigating the use of NNs to automate spacecraft trajectory corrections. NNEP combines Advanced Space’s practical institutional experience of mission design, navigation, and operations for a wide variety of cutting-edge space missions with the powerful theoretical advantages of NNs and OC.","The proposed innovation has wide applicability to NASA space missions.

Space-based applications, however, require entangled photon sources that must operate in the presence of abundant sunlight. Because quantum techniques require the measurement of single photons, background light poses a formidable challenge. One of the major constraints limiting the effectiveness of filtering techniques is the large spectral bandwidth of the entangled photon sources themselves (~1-2nm). To address this problem, Qubitekk proposed to develop narrowband photon pair sources for space-based quantum communication. The Phase I effort revealed two approaches that are feasible with today’s technology and these two will form the basis of the Phase II effort. The first approach is to filter the output of a conventional single-pass downconversion source and to compensate for the reduced output by increasing the pump laser power. The second approach is based on cavity-enhanced downconversion, in which the nonlinear crystal is placed in an optical cavity that has the effect of enhancing emission at resonant wavelengths and suppressing emission elsewhere. Although this approach is more complex, much narrower bandwidths can be achieved, not only offering greater background discrimination but also a source capable of coupling to matter-based qubits. The latter feature is an important element of quantum repeater development. These two approaches will be achieved through the execution of four Technical Objectives: 1) Demonstrate filtered downconversion with strong pump; 2) Conduct studies of filtered downconversion with realistic lighting conditions; 3) Demonstrate cavity-enhanced downconversion; and 4)Demonstrate narrowband photon detection using an etalon filter.","The 2015 NASA Roadmap for Communications, Navigation, and Orbital Debris Tracking and Characterization identifies Quantum Key Distribution and Quantum Communications as Revolutionary Concepts with high payoff if successful. Photon pair sources with narrow spectral profiles address NASA’s roadmap goals by extending the operational range of quantum communication. In addition, a recent NASA workshop on quantum networks identified the need for narrow-band entangled photon sources for coupling to matter-based qubits for quantum repeaters.",The project will be of interest to non-NASA initiatives. The National Quantum Initiative is dedicated to US superiority in quantum information sciences. The Defense Optical Communications Program is a tri-service effort that includes quantum communication as a primary thrust.

These contact schedules are developed without an awareness of customer mission objectives and often require arduous human-in-the-loop iteration to ensure the resulting contact schedule also supports mission objectives. ATLAS has demonstrated the capability of an algorithmic solution to develop satellite ground station contact schedules designed to optimize around a customer’s goals.  This capability offers substantial savings in man hours over the use of current scheduling systems which simply deconflict satellite contacts from interfering with one another but do not necessarily resolve solutions optimized to meet a customer’s mission goals.  A cognitive constellation management scheduler is made aware of the customers goals and seeks to produce and select the ground station contact schedule that best satisfies a customer’s goals among all possible/feasible schedules.

This prototype will enable: System Wide Load Balancing: Define clear goals and allow the customer to adjust their importance, generates task requests, and feed them into the lower lever Flex Scheduler Time Reduction: Abstract the management into a simple to understand set of goals that the customer can adjust on a day to day basis.

The proposed MOPA transmitter will reduce transmitter size and weight by integrating a Passive Q-switch (PQS) into the master oscillator, which will eliminate the Active Q-switch (AQS) used in high power MOPA’s. Replacing the AQS with a PQS eliminates the high voltage power supply, high voltage AQS driver, and intracavity AQS crystal. This also eliminates the sensitive alignment and locking of the intracavity AQS and mount.

The MLC™ takes advantage of the small dimensions, scaling by wavelength, at millimeter wave frequencies to quickly switch the magnetic field. The driver circuitry for both configurations were demonstrated in Phase I and will be enhanced in Phase II. Both topologies have different strengths providing options to the radar designer. The MLC™ innovation allows for a scaling the switch to higher frequencies where the decreasing waveguide dimensions benefit the design trades rather than becoming prohibitive as they do with traditional approaches. With our current fabrication methods, we are confident in reaching frequencies beyond 200GHz.","The proposed work will provide NASA with millimeter wave latching switches for use in remote sensing applications like differential absorption radar for measuring surface level pressure. With low SWAP, the resulting switch would benefit cubesat/smallsat instruments such as RainCube.

Alphacore proposes to design an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that provides significant SWAP (size, weight and power) reduction as compared to the existing board-level systems that use COTS ADCs and FPGAs with their total mass reaching kilograms. Alphacore’s solution will be an ASIC that will have a 5 GS/S (gigasamples per second), 10-bit, <40mW, radiation hard ADC and a 256-channel back-end digital signal processing (DSP) block consuming <100mW. The ASIC will be developed in a small-geometry CMOS silicon on insulator (SOI) technology (28nm) that is inherently tolerant to relatively high total ionizing dose (at least 500krad(Si) can be expected), and has better immunity to single event effects than bulk CMOS processes (no latchup, better upset rate due to isolation). This system greatly benefits all future NASA missions that need systems to detect interference in different bands of frequencies. The results of this work also enable applications that require low-power receivers that incorporate ADCs and back-end filters, without the need for RFI mitigation. The proposed RFIM ASIC has much higher power efficiency along with expected better radiation hardness than the currently available solutions. The embedded ADC will also be offered as a separate intellectual property (IP) design block, and thus a stand-alone ADC can be fabricated as well. The impressive rad-hard ADC has, 30X lower power than the top-of-the-line space-qualified COTS ADC. Thus, the ADC itself is well-suited as an upgrade for numerous NASA missions.","Alphacore’s solution can be incorporated into future radiometer designs used for short-term and long-term weather predictions, measuring changes in the atmosphere, ocean and land surfaces, and understanding the space environment. Future missions such as GLIMR, FARSIDE and PICO, as well as space exploration missions such as the manned missions to the Moon, followed by the Moon to Mars initiative will benefit from this solution. The technology could have been applied to Iris Version-2, Jason-3, DORIS, GMI and the NASA Space Geodesy Program.","Commercial applications of the technology includes mitigation for weather satellites against interference caused by 5G communication, commercial nanosatellites for weather forecasts, maritime data and aviation data, and well as defense CubeSat constellations for missile defense and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance."

Our design and advanced multi-layer Niobium fabrication process enable us to make a compact SQUID based readout for large scale superconducting bolometer arrays. Arrays of superconducting transition edge sensors (TES) are frequently deployed in instruments for far infrared (IR) astronomy, particularly for cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. In order to reduce thermal loading due to wiring between the detectors and readout, as well as to reduce the cost of readout electronics, multiplexing (in either time or frequency domains) of multiple detectors on a single readout channel has become a key technology for enabling detector arrays at the kilo-pixel level and beyond. Current NASA missions employing time domain multiplexing (TDM) include HAWC+ and PIPER. These experiments feature a SQUID based TDM readout circuit that is interfaced to the TES array through an Indium bump bonding process. Next generation missions such as PIPER Dual Polarization Upgrade and PICO require and increase in sensor density. As part of the 2019 SBIR subtopic S1.04, NASA put out a call for kilo-pixel scale cryogenic, multiplexed readout capable of reading out two TES per 1 mm2 pixel. In Phase I, SeeQC designed, fabricated and performed preliminary tests on single pixel and small array TDM readout circuits that meet the area/pixel goal set by NASA. SeeQC also fabricated flux tunable superconducting resonators as a first step towards developing microwave SQUID multiplexing (µmux) as an alternative readout technology with a higher multiplexing factor.

We use the Landsat 9 Thermal Infrared Sensor 2 (TIRS-2) as a boilerplate example for the benefits of the technology.  Using CPI technology, the performance of the TIRS could be improved significantly while also reducing the mechanical complexity of the sensor system.  Alternatively, it may be possible to build a smaller, simpler, less expensive sensor with the same performance as TIRS-2.  We will develop a 640x512 format, 20m pixel pitch ROIC design, compatible with HOT infrared detectors to offer significant performance benefits for future NASA missions such as Landsat TIRS.  We will develop the architecture for performing on-chip TDI with high dynamic range using HOT LWIR detectors.  The architecture will support:- High dynamic range - to accommodate the LWIR background and dark current pedestal, which could be high using HOT detectors.- Dual band – 2 optical bands can be supported simultaneously with 2 independent frontends and ADCs per pixel- On-chip TDI scanning – Up to 512 rows of TDI gain can be accomplished while scanning without the need to readout the image sensor to accumulate data in a separate processor. - Pseudo simultaneous dual band scanning – Both bands will be accumulated on-chip, and with high dynamic range at the same time.

Numerous missions in the past has had uses for high voltage supplies such as the HST High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS), plasma experiment power supplies, particle detection (HAPI LAPI, DE, International Sun-Earth Explorer (ISEE), etc.) and aboard Cassini.  The evolution of high voltage power supplies has proceeded over the years in order to generate higher output voltages and faster slew rates.  The underlying functionality of these power supplies invariably include a step up transformer and multistage rectifier to provide additional boost.  The power supply must be designed to a particular load in order to assure good impedance matching to the rectifier to allow for fast transients.  In addition, supplies can be linearly regulated by using optoisolators in the output.  A challenge with the optos is degradation over the life of the platform.  In order to avoid this, we propose a fast switching based high voltage power supply that utilized the resonant switching to provide good efficiencies to the high voltage load.  The proposed topology allows for very fast transients at the output on the order of 200V/us which will enable new potential scientific missions by allowing for rapid turn on/off and control of the HV supply.  Linear control of the output will be achieved with the development of this converter.  The design is to provide magnetic-based isolation between the low voltage satellite bus and the high voltage output.  The high voltage converter will use Wide Bandgap (WBG) switches in order to provide fast, efficient switching.  As the operational environment for the converter is critical, the design will be evaluated in order to ascertain reliability and impact to operation with implementing high reliability components.","Based on the target output voltage and transient response, our targeted NASA applications will be in the electrostatic analyzer (ESA) field in which the power supply could potentially improve the capabilities of these scientific payloads.  Another potential aspect is in electronic propulsion with this application taking advantage of the fast transient capabilities of the power supply.  The CubeSat class of EP required approximately 10W at under 1kV of potential such as the Pocket Rocket (600V) and Busek class of Eps.","A non-NASA application we would target is with Kearfott and modification to the HV supply to provide a compact, reliable, voltage source for a Monolithic Ring Laser Gyro (MRLG).  We know the design parameters for the MRLG and they are lower than NASA’s requirements.  The application would thus require modification to the NASA design for the lower specifications."

The instrument extracts 5 × 1 cm cores, and immediately performs in-situ, time-resolved, coregistered imaging and spectroscopic mapping at high resolution – 10 µm and 50 µm, respectively. The significant attribute of our technology is the ability to focus on a specific layer or location on the core surface – something that none of the previous, current, or even future surface missions have capability to do. The Mars Exploration Rovers clearly illustrated the need for such a capability by exposing rock surface and identifying round nodules. Unfortunately, the arm mounted instruments were unable to analyze the nodules themselves, but rather took an ‘average’ of the area. DiSCO is the first instrument that boasts integrated drilling/coring/caching, imaging, and laser spectroscopic mapping systems. DiSCO integrates a combined fiber-based optical imaging, laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS), laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), and laser-induced native fluorescence (LINF) system into an SBIR-funded, demonstrated drilling and coring platform. DiSCO delivers three game-changing advantages in lander/rover based planetary exploration: a) unprecedented analytical capabilities – in-situ, coregistered high-resolution imaging and LRS+LIBS+LINF core mapping, b) minimization of the resources and complexity required to perform subsurface science analyses – no need for core processing and delivery systems and robotic arm movement between the rock and an instrument onboard of the rover, and c) possibility for novel mission architectures – coring + analysis + caching capabilities are offered within a single, highly modular arm-mounted instrument.","DiSCO supports the characterization of both surface and subsurface materials, significantly improving instrument measurement capabilities for planetary science missions such as Discovery, New Frontiers, Mars Exploration, and other planetary programs, including: a) landed exploration missions to Venus, Moon, Mars, Europa, Titan, comets, and asteroids; b) sample return missions to Moon, Mars, comets and asteroids, and ISRU.","DiSCO-derived technologies currently being commercialized in the resource development industry both speeds up and expands data analysis capabilities for core logging operations by moving the lab to the borehole and removing the need for coring.

More specifically, (SPICE) consists of an ultrasonic sample chamber that can be operated in two different modes: (1) A static mode for mixing and homogenizing the sample, and (2) a dynamic mode that flows solvent (e.g., water) through the ultrasonic chamber during sonication to avoid the re-adsorption of the analytes to the solid surfaces. This second mode is useful for extracting the maximum amount of analyte from the solid sample with a reported increase in extraction efficiency of up to 70 %. Where traditional extraction from soil/mineral samples mostly involves the removal of organics from the exposed surface, ultrasonic acoustic energy can be used to rupture small particles and break apart aggregates to expose inner surfaces that can trap chemicals of interest. The increased efficiency that can be achieved with ultrasonic assisted extraction (UAE) is a technology that supports high precision in-situ measurements, as called out in subtopic S1.07 (In Situ Instruments/Technologies for Lunar and Planetary Science) of the NASA SBIR call.","The detection of life on planets (and other bodies) is an important goal for NASA that requires the identification of molecular biomarkers. It is also important to identify other chemical species that provide insight into makeup of planets, moons and small bodies.

The specific NASA SBIR solicitation technical topic that we address, S1.08 Suborbital instruments and sensor systems for earth science measurements, includes development needs for reduced volume multi-pass cell designs and optical subsystems for open path measurements.  The solicitation topic also calls for small trace gas sensors suitable for UAV’s, which need low-volume multipas cells.  The work we propose addresses stated needs for advances in optical absorption cells and related subsystems, both for open path as well as closed path (low volume) measurements.  One of the cell designs we have conceived is specifically for open path measurements, where the base length may vary with the experimental circumstances.  That design, the “Retro-Cat Cell” combines a remote retroreflector with an “inboard” mirror combination that acts like a variable focal length mirror, so it can adapt to variable base length.  We present four different pathways for improving path-length per unit volume in multi-pass cells.  These pathways range from simple filling of excess volumes, to re-injection systems to a new cell architecture.  These development pathways are expected to yield results that improve existing commercial multi-pass cells, improve existing instrumentation and make new more compact instrumentation possible.","These multi-pass cell advances will positively impact NASA scientific endeavors that rely upon optical detection of gases, particularly in its Earth Sciences Division.  Our new open-path cell design may be useful for increasing the path-length of measurement systems such as the NASA LaRC Diode Laser Hygrometer.  New closed path cell designs may be of benefit to numerous NASA centers involved in trace gas measurements, such as: Goddard, Langley, JPL and Glenn.  We note those centers because we previously sold then trace gas instruments or cells.","The new open-path cell design will have application to industrial settings with variable base paths, such as fence-line monitoring, or in environmental measurements where the measurement circumstances change.  Closed path cells are integral to the set of trace gas instruments produced and sold by ARI, so new designs will enhance our products and capabilities."

Critical requirements for such a gyroscope include a high sensitivity to rotations, insensitivity to accelerations, and a simple scheme that is well-suited to miniaturization.  An atomic gyroscope based on the combination of point source interferometry (PSI) and large momentum transfer (LMT) beam splitters is well-suited to meet these requirements.  A conventional PSI is based on the use of cold atoms released from a trap, and subjected to two-photon Raman transitions that act as beam splitters and mirrors for a Mach-Zehnder light-pulse atom interferometer.  In a PSI, the rotation signal is observed by monitoring the fringes develop across the spatial profile of the expanded cloud, and is unaffected by acceleration.  The spacing and the orientation of the fringes are analyzed to determine the components of the rotation vector that are orthogonal to the laser pulses, thus realizing a multi-axes gyroscope.  The sensitivity of a conventional PSI is limited by the relatively small area enclosed, since the conventional Raman pulses produce a momentum separation equivalent to only two photon recoil momenta.  Under the work carried out in Phase I, we have established the feasibility of realizing a PSI that makes use of the technique of large momentum transfer (LMT) based on alternating Raman pulses.  For experimentally feasible parameters, our Phase I work shows that such a gyroscope would be able to achieve a rotation sensitivity of about 2.5 micro-degree/hour per root-Hz.  This sensitivity would be nearly a factor of 50 better that the best atom interferometric gyroscope, which is large and based on atomic beams, demonstrated to date.   The LMT-PSI can be compact, occupying a volume of 10 cm X 10 cm X 10 cm, holding the potential for revolutionary advancement in inertial navigation, for NASA, civilian and military applications.",• Improved space vehicle positioning and navigation • Ultra-precise pointing and platform stabilization for telescopes • Space vehicle health monitoring • Tests of general relativity via measurement of gravitational frame dragging effect,• Improved positioning and navigation of missiles • Positioning and navigation for atmospheric and ground vehicles in GPS-denied environments • Guidance of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) • Guidance of smart ammunitions • Advanced laser beam pointing/steering systems

It will include 370 nm, 935 nm, 436 nm and 760 nm lasers. The system will feature the properties required for long duration space applications. The system will be based on a semiconductor laser locked to monolithic microcavities using self-injection locking technique. This technique results in a complete suppression of mode hops in the laser during its operational lifetime. The microcavity will not only stabilize the frequency of the laser, but will also be used to measure and stabilize the power of the laser. The microcavity provides a modulatable laser that features exceptionally low residual amplitude modulation, allowing a robust lock to the clock transition of interest.  The proof of principle validation of the technique was supported by earlier OEwaves efforts. In Phase II of this Project we propose to demonstrate experimentally and deliver to the customer two most critical components of the set, comprising a 370 nm laser system and an ultastable cavity. The other lasers will be demonstrated at OEwaves and the measurement data will be delivered to the customer. The complete set of narrow-line ultra-stable modulatable diode lasers that can be instrumental in integration of a miniature Yb space ion clock will be packaged in Phase III of the project. At the end of Phase II, we expect a prototype of 370nm laser to achieve better than 10-10/g acceleration sensitivity, required frequency stability (varies depending on the laser use). The reference cavity will have the same stability in a wide wavelength (frequency) range determined by the optical transparency of its host material, which typically is broader than 300 nm – 2,000 nm.

HARPOON’s superior performance meets the top-level scientific requirements of multiple planetary missions to the inner and outer Solar System. HARPOON boasts an innovative combination of adaptive spatial coding optics and detector that enables unique measurements: in-situ chemical identification and sub-ppb quantitation of complex organic compounds, including pre-biotic compounds (e.g. amino acids); biomolecules (organic biomarkers such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acid polymers); minerals; salts; volatiles. HARPOON has five science objectives traceable to observational requests of high-priority mission objectives and specific science investigations. HARPOON informs these five science objectives by performing high-resolution, high-sensitivity quantitative analyses of samples via an innovative approach to Raman spectroscopy. Raman is probably the most powerful tool available for in-situ, non-invasive molecular and mineralogical characterizations. Based on the inelastic scattering of light, the Raman technique identifies molecular species and their chemical and structural nature. HARPOON changes paradigm in in-situ planetary Raman exploration: it enhances the sensitivity of Raman intruments by several orders of magnitude. Our strategies for maximizing the likelihood of mission infusion are: cost-effective scheme, versatile design, and operational flexibility. This makes HARPOON suitable for multiple spacecraft configurations. The use of remote fiber optic sensing: (1) enables the placement of multiple Raman heads both external and internal to the spacecraft; (2) allows to concurrently or sequentially analyze different types of samples (non-contact and contact; solid and liquid); and (3) provides flexibility to couple Raman analysis to other analytical tools.","Our innovation significantly improves instrument measurement capabilities for planetary science missions such as Discovery, New Frontiers, Mars Exploration, and other planetary programs. It has potential to become a critical new instrument in NASA’s exploration toolbox that can replace already-flown in-situ sensing technologies in future mission opportunities, including: a) landed exploration missions to Venus, Moon, Mars, Europa, Titan, comets, and asteroids; b) sample return missions to Moon, Mars, comets and asteroids; d) ISRU","HARPOON-derived technologies currently being commercialized in the resource development industry both speeds up and expands data analysis capabilities for core logging operations by moving the lab to the borehole and removing the need for coring.

To help meet this need, Quartus Engineering Incorporated (Quartus) is proposing leveraging analytical models and existing opto-mechanical designs to provide a shift in the approach to the development of Custom Optical Science Telescope Payloads-as-a-Service (COSTPaaS) for deployment on CubeSats and small satellite platforms. It is common for technology to be leveraged from mission to mission, such as customizable CubeSat, small sat, or larger satellite buses. This is less common with precision optical subsystems, which are often designed from the ground up to meet the science needs of a mission. If the appropriate work is done to validate the analytical tools used to design optical components and subsystem designs, beyond a particular use case, these tools could be used to adapt current component and subsystem designs to new missions. Quartus will perform correlation of analytical data to as-tested thermal data on a system-level basis, with the system being an afocal reflective telescope consisting of three optics.  The fine-tuned analytical approach will then be able to be translated to other optical systems, for trustworthy, validated thermal optical performance results, without the need for thermal testing. In addition to the thermal testing of an afocal reflective system for correlation results, Quartus will also validate a flight-ready design of the afocal system for Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment IV (SAGE IV) for thermal performance. This system will be a deliverable at the conclusion of the SBIR Phase II effort, to be used either as a flight instrument or spare for a future SBIR Phase III SAGE IV flight mission.","Quartus is building the COSTPaaS approach around the SAGE IV instrument, thus the immediate potential NASA application is an anticipated Phase III SAGE IV technical flight demo. Beyond the immediate benefits to the SAGE IV program, any number of low TRL programs could engage with Quartus during initial systems engineering to leverage the work done to date. One example that can leverage results from lessons learned and actual hardware from this work is DEMETER IIP, an instrument which Quartus is currently working on with LaRC to develop.","The COSTPaaS approach can save cost and schedule by taking a program TRL from 2-6 in relatively short order. This can open up high-end science instrument development for smaller missions who may lack the funding and timelines to be able to “start from scratch” each time, such as universities.

This work will push CMM technology into the realm currently dominated by expensive, complex, and error-prone optical testing.

Indeed, in Phase I we designed and built a Probe that demonstrated 0.48nm repeatability (one sigma).  When scanned across the surface of the mirror a full topographical map of the surface – and its surface errors – can be produced. While the Phase I probe could only operate at rates of 10 measurements/second, we have developed optical power budget spreadsheets that model how 10,000 measurement can eventually be reached with currently available off-the-shelf components.  Furthermore, the Probe is generally not light-limited, and we believe that it can function with the weak back-scattered (non-specular) light from highly-polished highly-tilted surfaces, although this assertion will be tested in Phase II. Other work proposed in Phase II for the Nanometric Probe is directed at improving the current performance of the Probe to a level consistent with its full performance expectations.  In particular, the Probe’s light throughput and align-ability will be improved substantially.  With light throughput improvement we also expect to see a corresponding improvement in the Probe’s signal-to-noise ratio, which we are hopeful will reduce the Probe’s measurement uncertainty five-fold to less than 100 picometers (one sigma). Also, other factors limiting the measurement rate of the Probe, such as the capture rate of the spectrometer and the processing speed of the digital hardware, will be upgraded so that a rate of 1000 measurements/second can be achieved by the end of Phase II.  Finally, infrastructure will be procured and installed so that the Probe’s displacement measurements can be calibrated, and the Probe’s performance over its full operational envelope can be characterized.","The Nanometric Probe is ideal for mirror surface error (including mid-spatials) metrology of HabEx and LUVOIR missions, as well as X-Ray missions such as Lynx and AXIS.  In each case the measurement uncertainty of the Probe is expected to be less than 10% of the surface error budget of the mirror being measured.  The usage of the Probe in such applications requires that the Probe is mounted on a high-performance CMM so the Probe's position above the mirror is known.  The ANCMM featured in a co-pending Phase II proposal meets that requirement.","Researchers in the field of synchrotron X-Ray generation at Argonne National Labs have discovered our activities in nanometric metrology, and we have had in-depth conversations with them about X-Ray mirror metrology.   The Nanometric Probe can also be applied to the measurement of aspheric optics used in the lithography industry in which the surface error tolerances are often less than 2nm RMS."

The gyro noise is reduced by a factor of 4 by utilizing an innovative approach for the light source noise reduction. The gyro’s sensitivity to vibration is substantially reduced by implementation of new signal processing algorithm and advance sensor’s optical and mechanical design enabling the gyros’ operation without the need for mechanical isolation, enabling smaller and lighter system size. The sensor is using a new radiation hard fiber that can operate with little degradation in harsh radiation environment i.e. during Jovian missions without the need for additional shields for the gyro optical head. The combination of these attributes supports smaller, lower cost, and higher performance IMUs that can serve future NASA mission needs. These  innovative technologies enable a concept for a miniaturized tactical IMU based on the above technology (< 0.5 deg/hr bias over temperature and ARW of 0.0065 deg/rt-hr) with a volume as small <26 cubic inches and potential miniaturization to < 15 cube inch.

VTOL capabilities simplify the interaction of the vehicle with the surface and enable true vertical profiling of the atmosphere, while the ability to transition to horizontal flight increases the spatial range of possible observations. Creare’s Titan Ringlet drone utilizes a novel nonplanar wing geometry and mechanically simple controls without the need or complexity of traditional fixed-wing control surfaces. The drone packs efficiently into an aeroshell for safe entry into the Titan atmosphere and then separates from the aeroshell for a precision vertical landing on the surface. Compared to a pure rotorcraft, the fixed-wing cruise flight of Creare’s drone increases range by three times, increases endurance by two times, and increases altitude by four times. A small variant of the Titan Ringlet can support a larger mobile lander, e.g., the Dragonfly spacecraft, and increase the flight range of the lander threefold by pre-scouting landing sites.",The primary intended application for Creare’s Titan Ringlet drone is to support NASA and its planetary exploration missions.

Hyperspectral data collects and processes information across the electromagnetic spectrum, dividing the spectrum into many more bands than are visible to the human eye.  The collected images are combined to form a three-dimensional data cube, where two spatial dimensions of the same scene are joined by a third dimension comprised of a range of spectral wavelengths.  These data cubes are capable of supporting many surface biology and geology applications, with particular potential for improving the discovery and management of energy, mineral, and soil resources.  That said, the ability to efficiently process hyperspectral data is currently limited by the complexity of the data itself, and the inability to present and store it in formats and public cloud environments useful to data scientists. In addition to building standalone tools that can be used independently, this project will enable efficient consumption, reformatting, and processing of hyperspectral datasets in the NASA-funded Raster Foundry platform, an open source solution for finding, analyzing, and publishing geospatial imagery on the web.  In so doing, the proposed research will build on previous agency investments that are making additional remotely sensed imagery from NASA and other public resources more broadly accessible for global application to contemporary geospatial challenges.  Furthermore, it will provide access to a rich ecosystem of image processing and scientific computing libraries that will support data science studies in industries ranging from precision agriculture to security and defense.","The proposed research provides potential benefit for the Goddard Space Flight Center and Jet Propulsion Lab, where hyperspectral data tools could support the following missions: the planned Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), and the planned Mapping Imaging Spectrometer for Europa (MISE).

The proposed system promises to substantially improve the study of high frequency land cover dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes by addressing two principal roadblocks to higher spatial resolution and more frequent land cover classification: 1) the high cost of acquiring high resolution multispectral imagery on a frequent basis, and 2) the general complexity of using machine learning techniques to improve classification capabilities. Our innovation involves using time series of multispectral imagery with relatively rich spectral content as a trade-off with spatial resolution, and applying it on a pixel by pixel basis.

No longer exclusively the domain of isolated experts, MBE has been implemented across the full product lifecycle. This success is, however, giving rise to new challenges. The ability to share disparate models across teams, organizational boundaries, and among communities of practice is important for collaboration on complex projects. Model reuse is important because it minimizes the need to “re-invent the wheel” for each new project or initiative. Additionally, organizations face the challenge of model traceability and results repeatability. Both these qualities are critical in the lifecycle of an engineering product, and far too often is not attended to until a crisis occurs. Phoenix Integration proposes to address these challenges by developing an analysis model sharing platform, coupled with a reliable and repeatable way of deploying those analysis models. This platform will be easy-to-use, web-based, and built on the Git version control system. This model-sharing platform will have provision for documentation, tags and metadata. Software containerization is used to ensure a stable and repeatable analysis execution platform. This ensures that given a set of inputs, running the same analysis or workflow will always yield the same results. Shared analyses and workflows would be easily run in ModelCenter®, as well as on web-interfaces. It will rely on cloud computing resources with on-demand provisioning and execute the analyses and workflows on them when requested. Additionally, published analyses and workflows would be verified automatically whenever supporting software versions change.","A successful project will help NASA further advance the MBE vision and will help enable more comprehensive, broader, and deeper modeling efforts across all of NASA’s programs. Specifically, the project will help NASA to share engineering models and workflows across teams, organizational boundaries, and among communities of practice.

These capabilities will directly benefit ongoing and future NASA projects and initiatives, such as the Mars 2020 and Europa Clipper missions.","We propose developing an easy-to-use analysis sharing platform, while enabling reliable model executions. Executing these analyses on cloud computing resources opens the possibility of easy accessibility, including automatic model verification.

Until now, they have been computed primarily from a scientific perspective, on an individual basis, and, to a large extent, without cross-validation. We propose to develop a tool that combines the most robust techniques currently available, together with a wide range of data from the Heliophysics System Observatory (HSO), and the option to upload user-supplied data, to produce the most accurate estimates of benchmarks, together with their uncertainties. During our Phase I effort, we developed a prototype web-based tool that illustrates how space weather benchmarks can be estimated using the most sophisticated statistical methodologies, which have been previously investigated by our team. Importantly, we carefully quantified the uncertainties with these benchmark estimates, a quantity that is at least as useful as the actual benchmark value. We incorporated a selection of sophisticated methodologies (e.g., Peaks-Over-Threshold). In Phase II we propose to refine this tool substantially by: (1) carefully migrating all code from R to Python; (2) migrating the Shiny app to Dash; (3) incorporating a range of new numerical techniques into the pipeline; (4) Generalizing the analysis to include spatially resolved datasets; (5) Adding multivariate analysis; and (6) Providing additional refinements to the model fitting. We anticipate that this tool will find broad appeal within the NASA community, and, ultimately, across many other scientific and engineering disciplines where an accurate assessment of risk likelihood is necessary. We plan to commercialize this work by providing tailor-made solutions for customers, including support and service.","Our tool would be valuable to a variety of NASA groups, including the Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF) and the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC).

More generally, it would be useful wherever time series data are collected and analyzed, which would include many groups at ARC, JPL, and LaRC.","NOAA, and SWPC in particular, collect time series data from a fleet of satellites, with a particular emphasis on forecasting terrestrial and space weather.

More specifically, the first phase of the project developed and assessed a model that provides information needed to identify whether a satellite anomaly is likely to occur or was caused by an impact from a Solar Energetic Particle (SEP). These high energy ions stream from the sun and can pass through satellite components causing instantaneous failure, latent damage, or uncommanded mode changes. Fortunately, Earth’s magnetic field deflects some of these particles and shields some regions of near Earth space. To assess the anomaly likelihood, these access regions must be well defined.

The first is to integrate the model into an online application that will allow users to easily access and interpret the model output.

SiC devices offer higher temperature operation, higher breakdown voltages, and higher power conversion efficiency than silicon devices. However, vulnerability to heavy-ion induced failure and uncertainty in response to nuclear radiation are challenges facing FPS applications of SiC technology.

The design is based on Thin Red Line Aerospace’s (TRLA) Ultra-High Pressure Vessel (UHPV) technology which has the highest specific strength of any competing design. In EPT, a cryogenic propellant tank design was matured to demonstrate a 500+ psig system with a factory of safety of 2.5. Fluid barrier materials exhibit low helium leak rates and can be used in a launch configuration or launched in a stowed configuration for on-orbit or planetary deployment for use in propellant depot, propellant storage for long-duration exploration missions, and for such innovative uses as surface cryogen storage on the Moon. Results from this effort indicate a more mass efficiency and volume efficient design that utilizes 73% of required volume envelope as compared to 66% for traditional spherical tanks. Additionally, EPT exhibits masses at 70% of the current NASA counterpart with a baselined polar bulkhead design. System integration of EPT based on current SOA tanks was evaluated for integration, as well as bulkhead analysis and pressure restraint analysis. These efforts informed a barrier layer demonstrator design for the EPT which we then evaluate through helium coupon leak testing to validate the barrier materials selection and manufacturing process. The results of Phase I provide feasibility demonstration of the materials and processes to provide a helium leak tight barrier and an overall pressure vessel design for Phase II prototyping and test. Future efforts will mature bulkhead design for greater reductions in mass, system integration, and the barrier laminate. Additionally, thermal management will be evaluated with integration of traditional MLI and our CELSIUS, expandable, deployable, high mass efficiency MMOD/MLI system previously funded by NASA.",,

The FOMS addresses NASA’s need for measurement of pressure, temperature, and strain in a high temperature and radiation environment to support rocket ground testing. The FOMS sensors are based on fabrication of unique multimodal sensors along the length of a single unique optical fiber and coating of the fiber with a novel high-temperature-resistance ceramic material.

To reduce cost and potential burdensome security and handling requirements, low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel is desired.  The high uranium density of uranium nitride (UN) over uranium oxide (UO2) favors the use of UN for the LEU option.  However, similar to UO2, techniques are needed to produce refractory metal coatings on the UN particles to allow fabrication of the cermet fuel element and to protect the UN from the hydrogen propellant. During this investigation, techniques for producing spherical UN particles along with methods for producing refractory metal coatings on the spherical nitride particles were developed. To facilitate development of the spheroidization process and subsequent refractory metal coating of the particles, UN surrogate materials were used.  Characterization of these materials showed the as-received nitride powders were comprised of angular particles, which is the morphology of the current UN powders. To produce spherical particles for subsequent coating, plasma processing techniques were used. Analysis of the plasma treated nitride particles demonstrated the ability to produce spherical nitride powder with significant improvements in flowability. Using these powders, the ability to refractory metal coat individual nitride particles was demonstrated, and characterization confirmed continuous, uniform coats were produced. During Phase II, the techniques will be optimized and scaled for producing kilograms of powder per run. Coated particles will be produced and used to make cermet based fuel segments for testing at NASA.

We propose the combination of a neural network approach with a traditional finite element simulation to generate realistic thermal-based NDE methods for precise determination of structural defects such as cracks, delaminations, and ageing. The proposed approach will allow simulating the structural behavior of complex structures and different types of materials, including any metal alloy and composites. Although the method will be first developed to simulate thermal-based measurements such as thermography, flash thermography, and vibrothermography, the framework could be expanded to other domains including, ultrasonic, microwave, Terahertz, and X-ray. The proposed method has the potential to reduce simulation time by 2 orders of magnitude and an increase the compression rate by 2 orders of magnitude also. Due to the machine learning approach of the method, the accuracy and reliability will increase overtime as the number of validated experimental data increases.","The method will improve the quantitative data interpretation and understanding of large amounts of NDE/SHM data that will lead to safer, more robust, and more enduring structures operating in space. Performance prediction and defect characterization will also be greatly improved, leading to more efficient and timely maintenance operations and scheduling, which will also reduce costs.

Many of these spacecraft are targeted for long-term use, which offers challenges for inspection and maintenance. In orbit or on the Moon or Mars, the use of traditional NDE is prohibitive because of location and inaccessibility, and infrequent inspection can lead to conservative, high-weight designs. NASA is seeking technologies to facilitate inspections on large complex structures and provide reliable assessments of structural health. Structural health monitoring (SHM) can help overcome inspection difficulties and has shown good results on small structures. However, transition to large complex structures has been slow. Some reasons for the slow adoption are difficulties with large sensor arrays, timely analysis of large data sets, and overall weight of the system. In order to realize the benefits of SHM, there’s a need to reduce the number of sensors and minimize data acquisition processes while maintaining the ability to accurately detect, locate, and characterize damage. Compressive Sensing (CS) has been shown to greatly reduce data acquisition/processing burdens by providing accurate signal recovery from far fewer samples than conventionally needed. In this project, it is proposed to develop data analysis software and hardware to detect damage in large complex structures using CS at two stages in the data acquisition/analysis process: (1) temporally undersampled sensor signals from (2) spatially undersampled sensor arrays, resulting in faster data acquisition and reduced data sets without any loss in damage detection ability. The overarching goal is to reduce data acquisition requirements (energy consumption, number of sensors, data collection and storage, and total system weight) of NDE/SHM systems without compromising damage detection accuracy or probability of detection.","Post-Phase II, the technology can be tested and used in the Combined Loads Test System (COLTS) facility at NASA Langley Research Center to help reduce sensor data acquisition and processing burdens. It is anticipated that the first application of the technology will be the integration into NASA’s inspection tools for large complex space structures made with composites or thin metals, such as the Orion crew module, Space Launch System, and the Lunar Outpost Platform-Gateway.","Non-NASA applications include large, commercial space launch vehicles. Other industries/applications include aerospace (aircraft wings and fuselage), marine (ship hulls), wind energy (rotor blades), transportation/railways, civil infrastructure (buildings and bridges), oil and gas (pipelines), and the wearable sensors market in healthcare."

Orbiting neutron spectrometer instruments are capable of measuring hydrogen within the top 10s of cms of regolith but are limited to spatial resolution in the 100’s of km^2. Reducing the spatial resolution of such an instrument via collimation is technically challenging. Alternatively, a neutron spectrometer instrument on a lunar rover would be able to measure hydrogen and He-3 within the top meter of regolith with a spatial resolution of ~1-m^2, similar to the cancelled RESOLVE mission. The RESOLVE rover was a large rover capable of prospecting for lunar ice, drilling into such ice, and determining the actual ice content. Thus, the area at which RESOLVE could prospect was hampered by the objectives of the other instruments. Therefore, this work aims to resurrect the prospecting part of the RESOLVE rover by allowing a small size and low cost of the micro-sized detector/rover package “the NeuRover” that will allow for a single mission to disperse numerous micro-rovers over a much wider range than is possible with a single rover. The high-resolution data will be invaluable for future lunar exploration as it would allow future in-situ exploration to of highly concentrated locations of hydrogen. Additionally, such a mission could revolutionize our understanding of trapped volatiles on planetary bodies (e.g., Moon, Mercury, Ceres), as it will better map the heterogeneity vertically and laterally of hydrogen deposits. The innovation proposed is a small-mass, low-power, Neutron Energy Spectrometer (NES) for Mapping of Sub-Surface Lunar water content that can be supported by a micro-sized rover.

The proposed design builds on ACT’s experience with passive two-phase devices, as well as our pumped two-phase expertise, to address the needs outlined in the subtopic titled, “Mechanically Pumped Two-Phase Flow Thermal Control System Technology Development”.  In Phase I, ACT designed and demonstrated, through simulation and experiment, a prototype cold plate capable of managing heat fluxes up to 5 W/cm2 while maintaining spatial isothermality to within 3 K and temporal isothermality to within 0.05 K/min.  This capability results from a passive design that exploits two-phase phenomena and the unique behavior of fluids at saturation conditions. Compared to single-phase systems at significant heat loads, two-phase thermal management systems reduce spacecraft mass, volume, and power usage while providing performance improvements such as enhanced heat transfer and temperature uniformity.  The Thermal Management Systems Roadmap (TA14) challenges researchers to develop two-phase thermal management systems that can manage high heat loads with improved temperature control.

NASA uses two-loop TCSs to mitigate crew toxicity risk whereby one loop collects heat within a crew module with a low-toxicity fluid and transfers the heat to a second loop in the external module that rejects heat through the radiators.  This architecture is used for crew safety (most very low freezing point fluids are somewhat toxic or untested) but comes with a mass penalty due to the duplication of prime movers (pumps), mass of the intermediate heat exchanger, and extra radiator surface area to account for the additional temperature delta required for the intermediate heat exchange process. The two-loop mass penalty is a driving force toward reducing the TCS to a single working fluid. However, the toxicity risk must be mitigated for this architecture to be realized. Mainstream proposes to replace the two loop TCS architecture with a single loop TCS architecture that has toxicity mitigating technology. In Phase I, Mainstream demonstrated the performance of the lightweight and compact compressor, by far the most critical component in the single-loop system.  In Phase II, Mainstream will refine the compressor design, and then will build and test a full-scale 8-kW capacity single-loop thermal system prototype.","NASA applications for the proposed toxicity mitigating thermal control system include future Orion-like manned missions, Deep Space Gateway and Transport missions, and lunar habitation modules.

Doing so supports the SBIR topic interest in having a fault tolerant, bare metal hypervisor for the HPSC, supporting asymmetric and symmetric multi-processing for operating systems, such as Linux and RTEMS. seL4 is a member of the L4 family of high-performance microkernels developed, maintained, and formally verified by the Trustworthy Systems Group at Data61. seL4 is owned by General Dynamics, which released it under the open source GPLv2 license in 2014. This microkernel has been proven correct via a formal mathematical proof using Isabelle/HOL, an interactive Higher Order Logic theorem prover. The proof guarantees that seL4 correctly implements its specifications, e.g., is free from buffer overflows, has no null pointer exceptions, never hangs, etc. A second proof guarantees that the binary executable is a correct translation of the source code. Thus, the kernel is proven correct “end to end”, from specification to executable. Furthermore, the architecture of seL4 is cleverly designed to provide important security properties while retaining good performance. The seL4 follows microkernel design principles by delegating typical operating system (OS) features up to user applications via Capability objects that determine specifics feature and access privileges. The result is that seL4 is one of the fastest microkernels on the supported platforms. However, there is a steep learning curve with seL4, which is further complicated when using the hypervisor functionality to host multiple virtual machines running different operating systems, an HPSC system requirement. The proposed SDK will handle the complexity of configuring and building the various OS kernels, files systems, and configuration files needed to support VM-based systems.","This effort will simplify use of virtual machine-based architectures on the HPSC, Xilinx MPSoC/RFSoC-based, and Raspberry Pi 4 platforms.

Dust and debris particles are liberated and may strike the landing vehicle and surrounding assets and may obscure ground observation for safe landing. In addition, craters are formed on the landing surface, posing an additional challenge to vehicle stability and surface operations. CFDRC has developed the Gas-Granular Flow Solver (GGFS) capable of simulating the multi-phase gas-particle interaction and the complex granular physics within Moon and Mars regolith. Eulerian-Eulerian models are applied to efficiently model the gas and particle phases as continuum fluids. This capability has successfully been introduced into NASA project applications for Mars lander development including the InSight lander and future human Mars lander architectures.  With the current focus on returning to the Moon in the near future, this plume-surface effects simulation capability must be extended for applicability to lunar vacuum environments where a mixed continuum/rarefied approach must be used to properly simulate the gas-phase dynamics. In Phase I, the gas-granular capability was adapted for use in mixed continuum/rarefied regimes by coupling with a kinetic solver using a novel multi-fluid coupling approach. This combination facilitates a local switch to continuum or rarefied gas flow in a seamless automated process, distinctively accounting the gas-particle interactions. In Phase II, the multi-fluid continuum and rarefied gas and solid particles coupling algorithm will be implemented and extended for use with realistic gas and granular mixtures.

In modeling these flows, constitutive relationships are incorporated as collisional, kinetic and frictional stresses as well as drag terms due to momentum exchange with the carrier phase, which become increasingly complex with increasing particle cloud density, compressibility effects in supersonic gas flow, and complexity of multi-size irregularly shaped particle mixtures.

CMP-X (CUA Mono-Propellant 10) is a non-detonable yet energetic COTS formulation that possesses many system-level advantages including lower cost (COTS propellant and non-refractory thruster construction), lower thermal load (~950 C flame temp), water-like viscosity, and common materials compatibility (aluminum, stainless steels, and most elastomers). CMP-X thrusters have demonstrated 180 s specific impulse at 174 mN thrust during thrust stand testing and continuous firing times > 10 min. Phase I demonstrated an improved catalyst for CMP-X with higher reactivity and longer life with minimal warmup time, enabling scaling to >500 mN. An earlier, slightly more concentrated formulation (CMP-8) has demonstrated shelf life exceeding 1200 days. Phase II studies will include long-duration CMP-X storage testing, UN/DOT Series 6 testing to establish a formal hazard classification of CMP-X (anticipated to be permitted on common commercial air transport such as UPS), further catalyst risk reduction studies / characterizations, and brassboard feed system development. CMP-X is designed not for highest performance Isp, but as a monopropellant option for customers who can accept a modest 20% performance penalty (relative to AF-315E and LMP-103S) for the advantages of lower cost, air transportability, considerably fewer range safety concerns, lower flame temperature resulting in considerably less thermal soakback into the spacecraft, and longer continuous thrust burns. The estimated total impulse of a 2U-sized flight MPUC is >2400 N-sec with a peak power draw of ~6 W and 180 s specific impulse.","MPUC responds to goals in NASA’s Roadmap for In-Space Propulsion with a focus on long life and cost reduction both with common COTS construction materials. MPUC has demonstrated performance that will yield volumetric impulse levels above those of legacy hydrazine systems. Its lack of detonation and demonstrated storability makes it a prime candidate for missions where costs and logistics are dominated by system transportation and range safety concerns. Potential missions include orbit change, drag makeup, and deorbiting.","Potential MPUC applications include drag makeup allowing extended-duration low altitude orbits, orbit raising, deorbiting for micro/nanosatellites, and/or deep space missions. The MPUC green monopropellant system offers affordable access to Cubesat propulsion and is easily scalable to larger sizes depending on mission requirements to meet needs of differing users in DOD, industry, and academia."

Results from Phase I of this project indicate that a system built around a resistojet thruster could increase specific impulse by up to 110% while remaining within the power budget of a typical CubeSat/SmallSat mission. That level of specific impulse would make the proposed propulsion system useful for Lunar and deep space missions, as well as enhancing the capabilities of low Earth orbit missions. The key advantages of the proposed system include: This technical effort will take the concept evaluated and tested in Phase I and bring it to a flight-ready propulsion system that can be inserted into a range of upcoming commercial, DoD, or NASA technology demonstrations.","NASA has identified CubeSats and SmallSats as a valuable platform for performing technology demonstrations and scientific research on a modest budget. Past, planned, or anticipated missions using CubeSats include Earth observation, Low Earth Orbit activities, and Lunar and deep space missions. Propulsion is a key enabling technology for many future mission concepts, and the characteristics of the system developed and tested in this Phase II SBIR Project offer a meaningful enhancement to current state-of-the-art.","There are dozens of announced commercial constellations based around CubeSats/SmallSats, representing tens of thousands of potential new small satellites in orbit.

While it is relatively easy to shield against non-ionizing RF and microwave radiation, shielding against higher energy ionizing radiation – gamma rays, protons, neutrons and galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) – is much more challenging.  With longer missions to Jupiter or future manned missions (higher cumulative radiation exposure for astronauts) and with the use of smaller spacecraft that cannot accommodate additional weight needed for shielding, the importance of lightweight radiation shielding to NASA has increased.  To be effective, conventional shielding materials typically need to be thick and material thickness increases the total unwanted mass to be carried by a small satellite, and the amount of power required to create a deflection field would require significant fuel, so again unwanted additional weight. NanoSonic proposes to continue to refine our lightweight composites consisting of multiple layers of graded atomic number (Z-number) materials as effective ionizing radiation shields beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO).  Radiation attenuation as a function of areal density was researched during Phase I and NanoSonic’s material was 71% higher attenuation vs. polyethylene.  The shielding composites possess a tough woven Kevlar and Boron Nitride (BN) wound composite which could be used as the structural shells and support members of small satellites so serve multiple purposes (shielding, micrometeoroid impact protection, and structural support).  Preliminary research results with NanoSonic’s materials in the Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences at Colorado State University (CSU), and at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL/BNL), have shown that our materials significantly attenuate X-rays and gamma rays without secondary radiation, and structurally survive simulated 50-year exposure to solar energetic particles (SEP) and GCR.","This Phase II program would develop a lightweight radiation shielding composite. We foresee integration with future spacecraft as a path to market materials on a much larger scale. These radiation shielding composites offer enhanced safety and reliability for space structures as they include components for moderate protection against galactic cosmic radiation, solar energetic particles, and secondary neutrons. This radiation shielding methodology could represent a large market to improve virtually any existing NASA spacecraft shielding needs.","Similar, multifunctional nanocomposite shielding materials are being developed for other applications by NanoSonic building on our Metal Rubber family of materials, in the 1) electronics, 2) aerospace and defense, and 3) biomedical engineering areas.  We foresee integration with current commercial partners such as Lockheed Martin and others as a path to market our materials on a much larger scale."

Lafayette, IN 47906 - 9070",(770) 331-2340,4,7,"The safe disposal of a satellite upon mission completion or in the event of satellite failure is necessary to preserve the utility of high-value orbits. Vestigo Aerospace is developing the Spinnaker product line of dragsails, sized to provide deorbit capability for host vehicles ranging from microsatellites to launch vehicle stages.  Sizing takes into account both deorbit duration and probability of collision requirements. Substantial work was completed in Phase I to demonstrate the feasibility and benefit of dragsail aerodynamic stability. Evaluation of the six degree-of-freedom (6DOF) dynamics of the system allows determination of how to utilize passive aerodynamic stability in order to reduce deorbit times. A large database was generated characterizing the deorbit behavior and characteristics of various host/dragsail configurations. The Phase I study clearly shows the benefits using passive aerodynamic stability to increase the average drag coefficient of the vehicle during deorbit. The Phase II investigation will develop dragsail system prototypes and perform environmental testing. These prototypes, along with high-fidelity modeling and definition of Level 3 and Level 4 requirements, will establish TRL 6 for the dragsail designs.  During Phase II, the 6DOF software will be enhanced and validated with flight data. Vehicle control surfaces for passive stability will be evaluated.  Level 3 and 4 requirements will be defined.  Reliability analysis will be performed, and will be used to inform the design.  Command and telemetry dictionaries will be developed, and the Spinnaker3 18 m2 dragsail will be flight qualified on a Firefly launch, establishing TRL 7. Targeted reentry analysis will be performed to demonstrate the benefits of the deployable decelerators for constraining reentry corridors. Completion of the Phase II investigation will position Vestigo Aerospace for commercialization of the Spinnaker dragsail product line.","Every NASA satellite and launch vehicle that is delivered to low-Earth orbit must have an approved plan for its timely deorbit at end-of-mission.  Current NASA programs that can benefit from dragsail technology include the Space Technology Mission Directorate Small Satellite Technology Program, and technology demonstration missions within the NASA Earth Science Technology Office. The Science Mission Directorate Earth Venture program can also utilize dragsails for deorbit capability.","Vestigo will market its dragsail systems to NOAA, the Department of Defense (DoD), the small satellite community, industry satellite providers, and small launch vehicle developers. Planned satellite mega-constellations represent a target market of thousands of units,  providing major long-term growth potential for dragsail systems."

The first is a passive de-orbiter suitable for use at altitudes up to 1200 km where no vane sail articulation is needed. For altitudes above 1200 km our analysis showed that in order to decay within the 25-year ""requirement"" an articulating vane sail type de-orbiter is needed for rough-pointing against solar pressure.  Even if the vane sail of the de-orbiter is mis-pointed by 45 degrees, it will still see about 70 percent solar pressure drag. For these higher altitudes a passively articulating bolt-on de-orbit device based on two-way shape memory alloy is used. The two-way shape memory alloy unfurls to a large area against solar pressure during the sun-side of the orbit when it is warmed, and when its ""back is turned against the sun"" on its way to the eclipse side of the orbit, it cools down and folds back to a low area device decreasing the solar pressure on it as it exits the sun side.  The de-orbiter area can be tailored such that after it crosses the 1200 km limit on its way down, the active area against the atmosphere is still sufficient for de-orbiting within 25 years.  The SMA based de-orbiter has no need for motors or sources of power and the mass and stowed volume gained can be used for an increase in the amount of material to package making it suitable for both altitude regimes.","The potential NASA applications include the use of the Bolt-On De-orbiter to assure that its LEO satellites de-orbit within the 25-year ""requirement"". The 2-way shape memory based de-orbiter unfurls when warmed and folds when cooled.

The turbopump has a unique feature in that it has an electric generator used to generate electricity and power an external fuel pump. By using a monopropellant decomposed over a catalyst pack only one fluid can be used to drive one or more turbines. Typically, a turbopump combusts a fuel and an oxidizer in a gas generator to generate the gases to drive the turbine. This requires two sets of feed lines (one for fuel and one for oxidizer) and careful mixture ratio control so that the two combust at a ratio that does not yield such a high temperature that may destroy the turbine. If the mixture ratio is too close to the stoichiometric ratio it will be hot enough to damage the turbine. If it is too far away from the stoichiometric ratio it may not generate enough of the required gases to drive the turbine or even cease combustion (flame out). This problem does not exist with most monopropellants as their maximum decomposition temperature is about half that of modern turbojet engines. Thus, no exotic materials need to be used for the turbine. The electric generator generates electricity to power an external fuel pump. This allows the pump for one propellant to be placed anywhere on the rocket engine that is desired and does not necessitate mounting it onto the turbopump itself. this greatly simplifies the plumbing of a rocket engine. It also allows the oxidizer and fuel pump to have different speeds so that the engine can change its mixture ratio in flight. This turbopump is designed to be used with a rocket engine burning propellant combinations where one of the propellants is a monopropellant. This allows for a relatively simple yet fairly high performing rocket engine. In addition, it can easily change its mixture ratio in flight for optimum propellant utilization and little waste.","A rocket engine using a Turbo-Electric Turbopump would be of significant interest to NASA since it is essentially a staged combustion cycle engine with a lot less headache. It uses non-toxic storable propellants and is ideal for small launch vehicle intended to launch on short notice. It can also be used as spacecraft propulsion where higher chamber pressures than typically used with pressure-fed systems are desired, such as on heavy lunar and Mars landers. Such an engine is highly throttleable and very scalable. No ignition system is required.","A rocket engine using a Turbo-Electric Turbopump offers advantages to commercial space companies since it is a high thrust, staged combustion engine that is drastically simpler (and thus less expensive) than a typical staged-combustion engine. It could be used for both vertical and horizontally launched rocket vehicles as well as spacecraft, especially lunar landers for Moon missions."

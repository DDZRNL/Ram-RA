12-1 A1.01-8267,,Aviation External Hazard Sensor Technologies,Development of a High Energy Amplifier for an Airborne Coherent Wind Turbulence Lidar Sensor,SibellOptics,"815 Beauprez Avenue, Lafayette, CO 80026 - 3419",(303) 913-1772,Steven R Vetorino,svetorino@sibelloptics.com,"107 Sioux Drive, Berthoud, CO 80513 - 1363",(970) 635-3145,Russell E Sibell,hanoverberry@msn.com,"815 Beauprez Avenue, Lafayette, CO 80026 - 3419",(303) 913-1772,1,3,"The capacity of coherent LIDAR systems to produce a continuous, real-time, 3D scan of wind velocities via detection of backscatter of atmospheric aerosols in clear-air conditions gives this technology a clear advantage over other atmospheric monitoring technologies. LIDAR has proven its value in a number of applications, including the detection of clear-air turbulence, wind shear, and aircraft wake vortices.Of particular interest under this NASA sub-topic is the development of an airborne Lidar system capable of detecting and measuring aircraft wake vortices and turbulence out ahead of the aircraft in order to improve aviation safety. To perform this task well a Lidar must have certain characteristics and be paired with a highly optimized wake and turbulence processing algorithm. The key development area for detection of turbulence at cruising altitude is Lidar transmit energy and pulsewidth. High energy output on the order of 1.0 mJ for low flying manned or unmanned aircraft (10,000 ft) and 10 mJ for commercial aircraft (30,000 ft) is required. Aerosol density decreases rapidly as a function of altitude and the backscatter coefficient at 30,000 ft is only 4x10-10 as opposed to 2x10-7 at sea-level. Furthermore, commercial airliner crews will need at least 30 seconds reaction time after turbulence is detected in order to take action, requiring the Lidar system to see 6.67 km ahead (assuming an average flight speed of 500 mph). Other key requirements of an airborne Lidar system involve the size and power consumption of the system.  The limited space and available electrical power on an aircraft necessitate that a Lidar system be compact and efficient.  In addition, the system must be able to be integrated onto the aircraft without inhibiting other flight systems.SIBELLOPTICS proposes a Phase 1 SBIR to develop and test an Er-doped polarization maintaining (PM), large mode area (LMA) fiber amplifier to boost transmitted Lidar power to greater than 1 mJ per pulse.","The major incentives for the detection, tracking, and measurement of turbulence and wake vortices are twofold:  safety and efficiency.  Turbulence has been shown to be the cause of at least 51 aviation accidents over the last 20 years. In the wake vortex and turbulence sensing mode Windimager will operate at a high PRF (as high as 20 kHz) and transmit a narrow pulse in order to sample the region with high transverse spatial resolution. The localized scan and high PRF will allow Windimager to measure a tighter array of radial wind velocities. In this mode Windimager will be able to detect turbulence out in front of the aircraft with enough range and spatial resolution to give warning to the crew.","Windimager has been designed to be an extraordinarily flexible, general purpose, wind measurement platform with applications in a number of different industries, including: 1. Aviation.2. Wind EnergyWind energy generation is one of the fastest growing industries in the world and LIDAR technology is gaining a great deal of momentum in this market segment. Windimager can perform both wind assessment and power operations improvement, replacing multiple LIDARS or anemometer towers.  3. YachtingMaritime markets potentially include ocean-going vessels as well as subscription wind data and weather sales to harbors and ports.  There are four opportunities to address in this market: (1) the owners of luxury yachts, (2) the yacht manufacturers, (3) the yacht charter operators and (4) the harbor market where ships of all types operate. 4. MeteorologyEnvironmental scientists have successfully used Lidar systems to accurately track the direction and dispersion of factory atmospheric emissions and volcanic ash, as well conduct studies of the formation of typhoons.  5. Homeland SecurityWith its ability to monitor aerosol movements over large areas Windimager is an ideal platform to track the dispersion of atmospheric contaminants.  6. FirefightingSuccessful suppression of any large scale fire depends on an understanding of environmental factors which effect fire behavior.  Wind speed and direction are among the most important environmental influences.",Air Transportation & Safety; Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing)

The resulting Raman Icing Detection System (RIDES) will be an integrated air data sensing and icing condition detection instrument, providing a backup to the Pitot tubes potentially affected by icing, thus providing redundancy for critical information. The proposed solution will operate without protrusions into the flow, behind a flush mounted window on the skin of the aircraft, mitigating the risk of ice build-up during operation.  This project will utilize MAC's extensive heritage of rugged LIDAR system design and construction.","For NASA's own use, the system resulting from this effort will allow better studies of icing by giving clearer indications of the actual conditions outside a test aircraft in real time, providing safer and more accurate means of studying icing conditions.","Outside NASA, military and civil aviation is often affected by icing, sometimes severely (e.g., Comair flight 3272 in 1997, Air France flight 447 in 2009) and the ability to detect these conditions so as to avoid or at least account for them (activating de-icing systems, etc.) would be of tremendous safety value, suggesting a substantial market.

Total lightning is the combination of cloud-to-ground and in-cloud lightning and has been shown to correlate well with storm dynamics. Total lightning activity will be measured globally at high temporal resolution from total lightning detectors onboard future geostationary satellites such as the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-Series (GOES-R) and the Lightning Imager (LI) on the Meteosat third generation satellites. Thus, we seek to investigate the relationship between in-cloud convective turbulence and total lightning measurements, and determine the skill of total lightning as an indicator of in-cloud CIT.  We investigate how to use proxies for GLM lightning data to enhance the diagnosis of hazardous turbulence over the Continental United States (CONUS) where verification data is readily available from ground-based (radar-based) systems.   This system will enhance safety of flight for aircraft in the CONUS as well as oceanic and global airspace.  Such a technology would be useful to all aircraft that fly, from General Aviation (GA) aircraft to Unmanned Air Systems (UASs) to business jets and commercial jets.","Our proposed SBIR product helps Aviation Safety Program (AvSP) researchers study technologies and concepts that enhance aviation safety.  The proposed product enables NASA researchers to evaluate the detection, identification, evaluation, and monitoring of in-flight CIT and lightning strikes hazards to aviation.  An example of this would be the detection of moderate or severe turbulence detected by our system, distributed to other aircraft via electronic PIREPs, electronic flight bags, voice communication warnings, or other mechanisms to tactically adjust the flight levels of nearby aircraft prior to entering into an area of MoG CIT.  Our Phase II system also provides in-cloud lightning activity, which aircraft could use for avoiding lightning strikes to the airframe.  In our R&D plan, we consider multiple sensors in combination to improve hazard detection and quantification of hazard levels in our validation work; this may also provide opportunities for data fusion of total lightning strike, NTDA, DCIT, satellite, in situ measurements, and other data for use in NextGen safety related R&D analyses conducted by NASA.  Our technology holds promise to be used as a global turbulence detection system when operating with satellite sensors, providing NASA the ability to advance turbulence sensing in oceanic and remote areas.","A commercial product can be customized and implemented under contract to Airline Operations Centers (AOCs) for use by dispatchers and ATC coordinators, or for industry ATM R&D specialists.

It is not just a matter of stereo being better than 2D, but of stereo being necessary to interpret representations of complex data sets, physical phenomena, engineering designs and position in space.  The US Air Force has long recognized the potential for 3D displays in the cockpit but until now the limitations of 3D display technology have prevented implementation.  Interest in 3D image display has recently surfaced among SPAWAR and among agencies who use helicopters and firms that make camera systems for helicopters for use in power line inspection, law enforcement, and military applications. There is also interest in the use of plane mounted cameras in collision avoidance while taxiing on runways, where 3D display may be of benefit because it can show the pilot how much room there is between the plane and obstacles. 3D displays for these applications must be of the glasses free type, but current embodiments of such displays possess extremely low resolution, produce visual artifacts, and tend to produce very narrow viewing areas.  Under a recent DOE SBIR Phase II contract DTI developed a new glasses free 2D/3D switchable display that avoids the resolution loss, visual artifacts, and viewing restrictions associated with all other autostereoscopic displays, providing full HD resolution in 3D as well as in a 2D viewing mode.  DTI's believes that this new technology can lead to the first practical implementation of a 3D display in the cockpit. During this Phase I program DTI will investigate the adaptation of its 2D/3D displays to cockpit displays through compact design, ruggedizing, and the development of mechanical, electronic, computer, and software interfaces to an aircraft system.  This investigation will lead to a high level design and specification for a prototype display that can developed in Phase II and delivered for testing in a cockpit or simulator.","Displays embodying the proposed technology would have wide application for improved situation awareness aboard aircraft and spacecraft, icluding hazard avoidance while taxiing and in the air, as well as air or space based human controlled or human assisted robotic applications such as manipulator arm operation on the International Space Station.

The system will ensure that the aircraft will make the next maintenance interval by catching errors in the shop and/or detecting emerging problems to maintain vehicle safety between major inspection intervals with an emphasis on the subsystems of airframe, avionics, and propulsion.  The system will provide condition indicators, using model-based or data-driven approaches, from a subsystems' or components' point of view, and these will be fused, using the hybrid modeling based on Bayesian theory and/or graph theory, to provide overall safety from a system point of view.   FVDS approach consists of a multi-level processing architecture that includes three levels of reasoners: 1. Individual Components and Line Replaceable Units that provide BIT test, sensor measurements and control commands to track the behavior of the particular component, and report faulty and abnormal conditions; 2. Subsystem reasoners to monitor the state of health of the airframe subsystem; and3.

Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) helps maximize the availability of air assets by servicing the air vehicle based on actual condition as opposed to a fixed number of operating hours. Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) enables improved CBM on air vehicles by comparing in-situ sensor data to prognostic models of components and subsystems to predict wear as it occurs. Integration of these PHM systems with an autonomic logistics infrastructure can lead to even greater increases in sortie generation rates and decreases in maintenance cost and logistics burden by eliminating unnecessary preventative maintenance as well as identifying failures occurring outside the normal scheduled maintenance cycle. Aurora's innovative approach utilizes information from existing sensors (i.e., does not require additional sensors added to the vehicle, hence, 'sensor-free') to determine PHM.Current implementation of PHM is focused on new designs of manned aircraft to allow co-development of the PHM system and its specific sensors. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have sensors and subsystems already installed that can provide the capability for a PHM retrofit on in-fleet systems. UAV specific subsystems, such as the autopilot, also provide the opportunity for new PHM capabilities beyond those considered in manned aircraft.Aurora proposes the Integrated Vehicle Health Management System (IVHMS). Aurora's IVHMS will compare models of the aircraft in different configurations to an estimate of the current state of the aircraft in order to generate a better understanding of the real-time operating condition of the vehicle and its constituent components. The IVHMS uses these capabilities to generate a vehicle-wide identification of systems in order to detect faults as they influence overall performance.","The proposed Aurora IVHMS will use the BAMS/Global Hawk class UAS as the vehicle on which to base development. As such, NASA will have the opportunity to retrofit their Global Hawk with the Aurora IVHMS.  Because NASA's Global Hawk is used in extreme flight environments, such as hurricane and severe storm research, such a PHM system would provide valuable vehicle state information. It is anticipated that other NASA vehicles would also benefit from the Aurora IVHMS system as it matures and is developed for other families of manned and unmanned air vehicles.","The initial Aurora IVHMS will be focused on as single UAS, such as BAMS, marketed as either a retrofit or for incorporation in the production process. Aurora believes the same IVHMS can, with minimal modifications, also be marketed as a retrofit to the existing Global Hawk fleet. The combined inventory of RQ-4 A,B, and N vehicles is expected to continue growing in the immediate future and will provide a steady market for the Aurora IVHMS as the process of developing Aurora IVHMS products for other UAS families begins. It is also expected that Aurora IVHMS will be an appealing addition to other UAS applications, such as Auroras own products like the Orion UAS.","Air Transportation & Safety; Atmospheric Propulsion; Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Inertial; Man-Machine Interaction; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Pressure/Vacuum; Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport); Sequencing & Scheduling; Simulation & Modeling; Structures"

This property of BDDs allows the efficient solution of many problems. The proposed tool will exploit multi-core CPUs and the thousands of stream cores in the latest GPUs, which were made accessible to programmers through specialized software development kits. These large numbers of stream cores in GPUs, and the possibility to execute non-graphics computations on them, open unprecedented levels of parallelism at a very low cost. In the last 8 years, GPUs had an increasing performance advantage of an order of magnitude relative to x86 CPUs. Furthermore, this performance advantage will continue to increase in the next 20 years because of the scalability of the chip manufacturing processes. The technical objectives will be to efficiently exploit the GPU parallelism in order to accelerate the execution of our prototype GPU-based parallel BDD package, and to implement hybrid approaches combining it with our GPU-based parallel SAT solver. BDDs and SAT solvers are orthogonal methods with different advantages, and a hybrid of the two will significantly increase both the speed and capacity when formally verifying complex software for space missions. We achieved at least 2 orders of magnitude speedup with our prototype GPU-based parallel BDD package in a previous Phase I, and expect to achieve at least 4 orders of magnitude speedup with our hybrid BDD-SAT tool by the end of Phase II, compared to the current state of the art.","Efficiently solving of challenging Boolean formulas is critical to NASA, as this will increase both the speed and scalability of the following applications:  1) formal verification and testing methods for complex mission software and hardware, including those of the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV), the next generations of Mars Rovers, and other spacecraft;  2) formal methods to prove the correctness of radiation-hardening transformations for software and hardware;  3) logic synthesis of circuits;  4) Boolean methods for scheduling, planning, and solving of other Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs);  5) formal methods for network coding that will increase both the bandwidth and reliability of space communications by using the existing communication equipment that is already deployed in space after updating the firmware;  6) reliability analysis of hardware, software, and mechanical systems;  7) power and timing analysis of circuits;  8) design of experiments;  9) design of error-correction codes;  10) technology mapping and routing for FPGAs and other reconfigurable circuits;  11) formal methods for cryptanalysis; and   12) cyber security---detecting security vulnerabilities and malicious intent in software.","The potential non-NASA commercial applications include:  1) Formal verification and testing of software and hardware, where the potential customers will be all major semiconductor and software companies.  2) Scheduling, planning, and solving of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), where the potential customers will be all companies that use scheduling and planning tools.  3) Solving of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) problems, such as FPGA technology mapping and routing, power and timing analysis of circuits, and formal methods to check the robustness of radiation-hardened circuits, where the potential customers will be all EDA and semiconductor companies.  4) Formal methods for cryptanalysis, where the potential customers will be the Department of Defense, the NSA, and all companies that use cryptanalysis.  5) Formal methods for cyber security, such as for detection of security vulnerabilities and malicious intent in software, where the potential customers will be all companies that develop robust virus scanners based on formal methods, and companies that develop formal methods for detecting security vulnerabilities in software. Because of the potential for a very wide range of software obfuscations that can be used to hide malicious intent, future virus scanners will have to employ efficient formal methods to detect malware, and thus the importance of speed and scalability that will be possible with an efficient hybrid BDD-SAT tool.","Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Methods; Architecture/Framework/Protocols; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Coding & Compression; Command & Control; Computer System Architectures; Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Development Environments; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Operating Systems; Programming Languages; Project Management; Prototyping; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Verification/Validation Tools"

The Boeing 777, for instance, includes over 2 million lines of code.  Future projects will only feature an increasing amount of source code, mostly written in the C programming language.  The only way to completely ensure the safety of flight critical systems is through static, formal program verification.  In order to effectively verify such large programs written in the C programming language, we propose a scaleable system for the verification of program written in C based on matching logic, or program verification logic.  Matching logic has the benefit of being more scaleable than traditional Hoare/seperation logic verifiers because they build a large first order logic proof goal for entire functions at a time, while matching logic proceeds in program order, proving goals incrementally.  Additionally, matching logic verifiers are based on operational semantics of the programming language in question.  Operational semantics offer the benefit of being fully executable, so that one may increase belief that they are correct by testing typical compiler test suite programs, such as the GCC torture tests for the C language.  Ultimately, our proposed research will result in a verifier that is both more scalable and more trustworthy than the competition.","Our matching logic verification system for the C programming language will lower the time to develop, and reduce the number of bugs in NASA software. Our verification will be one of the most comprehensive available, able to prove very difficult algorithms correct. It will be particularly useful in mission-critical and safety-critical systems, flights systems in particular, where bugs cannot be tolerated. This work is equally useful to any government agency, which produces software, but, in particular, to those with mission or safety critical code. We also believe that the term rewriter developed in this project will have uses as a faster replacement for Maude in some specific cases(e.g., no associative or commutative matching and where builtin data structures are desirable).","We plan to market our completed tool to software companies, such as Microsoft and Google. Additionally, we have written confirmation from Dr. Shin'ichi Shirashi of Toyota-ITC that they would like to apply our tool in the automative industry, should this project be funded. We believe,especially with the movement to multicore architectures, multi-threaded systems being harder to verify, that all software companies, and potentially even students, can benefit from our work. We plan to allow a relatively cheap single user license download of the system, with a free license for open source projects. We believe that such a licensing structure allows for risk-free adaptation of our technology. From video games, to media players, to business applications, to Mars rover control programs, all may benefit from the increased ability to guarantee the operation of software components provided by our system.","Air Transportation & Safety; Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Development Environments; Programming Languages; Quality/Reliability; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Space Transportation & Safety; Verification/Validation Tools"

The formal verification will be done assuming execution on the PowerPC 750 architecture that is implemented in the radiation-hardened RAD750 flight-control computers utilized in many NASA space missions, and are planned to be used in future spacecraft, including the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. A unique advantage of our project will be that the formal verification will precisely account for the bit-level semantics of all instructions, as well as the memory system, the bus, and devices on the bus, including multiple CPUs, and thus will allow us to precisely analyze all possible behaviors of the entire system, which is critical for aerospace applications.During Phase I we will lay the foundation for Phase II by: developing initial models of the memory system and the bus; formally defining the bit-level semantics of additional instructions from the PowerPC 750 architecture that we have not specified yet; identifying properties that we will prove to guarantee correct interaction of user processes with the target RTOS, the memory system, and the bus, including scenarios such as multitasking, interrupt handling, user and kernel mode switching; proving some of these properties; and identifying the most promising directions for Phase II work.","The tool flow and formal verification methods that we will develop will allow NASA to easily retarget the formal verification to any RTOS and user processes, represented as binary code, and to any new processor architecture, given formal definitions of its instruction semantics, memory system, bus, and devices on the bus. By reusing the formal definitions of all functional units for integer, logical, and floating-point instructions in the PowerPC 750 architecture that we have already defined in our NASA SBIR Phase II project titled Efficient Techniques for Formal Verification of PowerPC 750 Executables, it will be possible to formally specify the bit-level semantics of a new processor architecture in several months. Also, we will be able to use the formal definition of the bit-level instruction semantics of the architecture as a non-pipelined specification when formally verifying a new pipelined/superscalar/VLIW implementation processor for that architecture by applying our industrial tool flow for formal verification of pipelined processors. Thus, we will prove that the designs of new processors will implement the exact bit-level specification of the instruction semantics that is used to formally verify the correctness of the software and its interaction with the RTOS, the memory system, bus, and devices on the bus, including under scenarios such as multitasking, interrupt handling, user and kernel mode switching. These capabilities are critical for aerospace applications.","The NASA applications will also benefit other government agencies, such as DoD, DoE, NIST, and NIH. Furthermore, all companies that either manufacture microprocessors or develop IP of microprocessors, as well as all their clients that develop safety-critical software, will be potential users of the resulting technology. As embedded microprocessors are increasingly used in safety-critical applications, many of them controlled by an RTOS, it will become the norm to formally verify the executables for such applications, as the correctness of a microprocessor alone will not be sufficient to guarantee correct execution of the software, and the absence of errors in the binary code will become a requirement. Additional applications will include the formal verification of executables for absence of security vulnerabilities.","Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Methods; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Computer System Architectures; Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Data Input/Output Devices (Displays, Storage); Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Data Processing; Development Environments; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Operating Systems; Programming Languages; Quality/Reliability; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Verification/Validation Tools"

Specifically, this effort will build upon a developing synthetic vision system for landing piloted aircraft to: 1) customize the design and feasibility for targeted unpiloted autonomous systems (UAS), and 2) incorporate interferometry for terrain mapping and hazard detection.Dubbed ""PathIn"", the proposed sensor is comprised of a Ka-band digitally beamformed (DBF) radar interferometer that will serve as a complement to existing infrared (IR) and near-IR enhanced visualization systems and provide a real-time data interface for ground-collision avoidance systems.  The proposed effort is aligned with the effort to integrate UAS into the National Airspace (NAS).  The Phase 1 effort will assess the PathIn performance for sample UAS flight scenarios over variable terrain using a high-fidelity point target simulator to provide synthetic digital surface maps and obstacle detections.  This will demonstrate the potential of the PathIn as a technology that can contribute toward safe UAS operation in the NAS and in the terminal area.  In Phase II we will realize a prototype of the PathIn sensor, leveraging our extensive radar, interferometry and DBF experience and key technology capabilities.  In particular a FPGA-based digital receiver system will be extended for real-time beamforming and interferometry. At the end of the Phase I, a technology readiness level of 3 will be achieved.","NASA's expanded reliance on UASs has dramatically increased the need for alternative airports to support mission scheduling. Limited available airports meeting FAA landing restrictions will have a more profound impact on mission planning, success and cost as longer duration aircraft use is increased. Challenges include low visibility conditions and the difficult scenario of long duration mission planning with weather forecasting uncertainty. With the capability of obstacle detection, RSS' proposed PathIn system would allow for the use of airports not previously acceptable, and do so during conditions such as fog and drizzle, which conventional infrared enhanced vision systems cannot provide adequate visibility through. By providing ""improved sensing capability in the terminal area where higher density and more reliable operations are required for NextGen"" this sensor stands to directly support NextGen.","Low visibility conditions during aircraft landing presents significant hazards to the commercial and defense sectors.

First, a suitable anisotropic composite material will be identified and further studied for its suitability to the design objectives of this research. A baseline SUGAR aircraft configuration will be thoroughly studied for exploring design possibilities as well as to provide a benchmark for comparing performance improvements achieved by optimization studies performed during later stages. Secondly, the skin of the baseline SUGAR wings will then be modified to comprise of the anisotropic composite material, and the FE model will be modified to comprise of (1) distributed multiple control surfaces for AAW-type optimization in Design Route 1, and (2) variable camber continuous trailing edge flaps (VCCTEF) for control output optimization in Design Route 2.

The noise from the gear originates due to complex, unsteady bluff body flow separation from gear components and the subsequent multiple interactions of unsteady wakes with downstream undercarriage elements.  The object of this SBIR effort is to develop and advance a novel 'plasma fairing' technology for quieting landing gear noise.  The concept deals with the use of single dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD) plasma actuators to reduce noise associated with bluff body separation around the gear.  SDBD plasma actuators will be employed either in the form of spanwise-orientated actuators or plasma streamwise vortex generators (PSVGs) to suppress surface pressure fluctuations, and consequently flow-induced noise, on a representative landing gear model.  Our Phase I effort will involve a combination of numerical and experimental studies to be conducted at Innovative Technology Applications Company, LLC and the University of Notre Dame, respectively, in order to advance the design and optimization of 'plasma fairings' from a simple geometry (tandem circular cylinder) to a more complex/realistic landing gear geometry (e.g., the Gulfstream G550 nose gear).  A combination of DES numerical simulations and wind tunnel experiments is expected to provide a clear demonstration of the plasma fairing performance for noise reduction, while providing a clear path forward for Phase II.","This research aims to directly address NASA technical challenge for Quiet Low-Speed Performance under the Fixed Wing Project, that is, to reduce perceived community noise by 71 dB with minimal impact on vehicle weight and performance.   While the main thrust of the proposed research is to develop plasma fairings for reducing noise on an aircraft landing gear, these can be effectively configured to reduce noise caused by the wing flap and slats as well.  Other potential NASA applications of the proposed plasma flow control concepts include lift enhancement and drag reduction on aircraft wings, high angle-of-attack operation using plasma actuators as lifting devices, enhanced performance and efficiency of propulsion (S-ducts, inlets) and aerodynamic (control surfaces) systems at both on- and off-design conditions, and improved cycle efficiency of NASA's air-breathing propulsion systems.","Potential non-NASA applications for the plasma actuators include design of revolutionary subsonic and hypersonic aerospace vehicles for commercial and military (DoD) purposes, use in turbomachinery systems, noise-control on landing gears of commercial aircraft, design of smart wind turbine rotor blades, drag reduction on ground vehicles, smart helicopter rotor blades, tip-casing clearance flow control for reduced turbine losses, control of flow surge and stall in compressors, and turbulent transition control experiments.","Actuators & Motors; Aerodynamics; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation)"

A dynamic system typically exhibits distinctively different response characteristics as frequency increases. In recognizing the complicated behavior of a structure, the modeling methods in dynamic analysis are usually classified into low, mid, and high frequency models.  A substructure-based modeling technique, based on enhanced Fourier Spectral Element Method (FSEM), that is applicable all frequencies, is proposed for the modeling of complex dynamic systems. This method also does not require meshing as is traditionally used in discretization methods such as finite and boundary element methods.","Engineering tools that increase the quality of the environment and life of instruments are very important. For example, the development of space vehicles and space stations requires the prediction of vibration levels to assess the fatigue life of critical components and noise levels to ensure the comfort and functionality levels of crew members. The software product developed as part of the proposed project will enable NASA to effectively evaluate and apply noise and vibration control procedures spanning the entire frequency spectrum. It will also substantially reduce the effort involved in the design of products since the proposed development offers a truly unique and far-advanced modeling capability and unparalleled ease-of-use at mid-frequencies without involving any secondary artificial or derived model variables. The software will also enhance NASA's ability to evaluate the acoustic environment and resulting vibration in the payload bay of launch vehicles, diffuse sound field excitation on payloads during rocket launch, ground qualification, and structural integrity of airframes. Manufacturers of aircraft engines and components will also find the software useful for analysis and design.","The proposed development will also extend and enhance the computational modeling capabilities in many industries such as automotive, naval, heavy equipment and consumer products.  Customers often equate quality of a product with its sound and vibration performance. As a result of elevated demand for quieter products from customers together with the increased government regulations, manufactures of products with noise problem in all industries are searching for effective ways to make products with improved noise characteristics. For example, in automotive industry, the increased use of multi-media and telemetric devices demands quieter vehicle interiors and the manufacturers and suppliers of interior products not only need to consider functionality, but also the noise control capability of the products. Consequently, there is increasing demand for tools based on computer simulation that can be used to guide design at the early design stage. Furthermore, the software can be adapted to evaluate and improve radiated noise from engines, exhaust, tires, etc. It can be used to evaluate and improve consumer products such as compressors, air conditioners, hair dryers, vacuum cleaners, and washing machines.","Acoustic/Vibration; Analytical Methods; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

The nearfield noise is then numerically propagated to the farfield phased array microphone locations. Beamforming analysis methods will be used to predict noise source locations, and these predictions will then be compared with the original LES results. Discrepancies between the phased array prediction and the LES flowfield results will be used to guide development of new and improved phased array source models, as well as develop improved methods for positioning Ffowcs-Williams Hawkings (FWH) integration surfaces around complex noise-generating configurations such as landing gear.When fully developed, this technique offers the potential for significant benefits. First, it will empower experimental aeroacoustics researchers to customize the layout of microphone arrays for a given experimental configuration. Similarly, this approach offers the potential to customize the analysis of the recorded data they take for optimum accuracy. Beyond this, the improved FWH and beamforming methods that will be developed using this technique will benefit any experiment which makes use of phased arrays of microphones.

EHT has developed similar MHD plasma injection technologies, which have been applied to a number of different fusion energy science, aerospace thruster, and basic research investigations. Here, we aim to computationally investigate and verify the dominant physical mechanisms for MHD plasma drag reduction; develop a proof of concept plasma injector demo, which conforms to necessary power and efficiency requirements for an onboard flight-relevant system; and use insights gained through our computational investigations to optimize the performance of our MHD plasma injector for maximum aerodynamic efficiency. This investigation will focus on flight-relevant Reynolds and magnetic Reynolds numbers at low supersonic (M<~3) speeds.

The plasma injector works by modifying the turbulent viscous skin layer surrounding supersonic vehicles to reduce the mach wave shock front and resulting turbulence. This plasma injector technology can be applied to most supersonic aircraft and re-entry vehicles. Beyond drag reduction and sonic boom mitigation, plasma injection technology could eventually be developed as a steering mechanism during the critical period of re-entry of spacecraft and during hypersonic flight. The technology underlying plasma injectors is very similar to plasma thruster technology, so oportunities exhist for cross-fertilization between the two sub specialties. Finally, the insight gained through detailed extended MHD simulations can be applied to geospace environmental modeling and several astrophysics applications.","This plasma injector technology can be applied to several fields outside of aeronautics and astronautics.

Aerodynamic efficiency is the foundation of energy-efficient flight in any regime, and low drag is one of the fundamental characteristics of aerodynamic efficiency. For supersonic aircraft, drag can be broadly decomposed into four components: viscous or skin friction drag, lift-induced drag, wave or compressibility drag, and excrescence drag. The relative impact of these four drag forces depends upon vehicle-specific characteristics and design. However, viscous skin friction drag stands out as particularly significant across most classes of flight vehicles. Therefore, effective techniques to reduce skin friction drag on a vehicle will have a major and far-reaching impact on flight efficiency for low supersonic aircraft. In an effort to address the need for increased aerodynamic efficiency of low supersonic vehicles, PM&AM Research, in collaboration with Texas A&M University, propose to demonstrate the feasibility of depositing energy using basic, well-demonstrated techniques along the surface in supersonic flow to control/compress/forcibly-move the boundary layer fluid by creating a low-density ""bubble-like"" region, thereby reducing the viscous skin friction. If successful, this solution will reduce the drag experienced by a low supersonic platform, allowing vehicles to exhibit increased aerodynamic efficiency.","Our technology could be used to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of a wide range of supersonic NASA programs, including access to space platforms and prototype aircraft.","Our technology could be used to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of a wide range of supersonic Government and industry platforms including commercial and military access to space vehicles, supersonic cruise vehicles, and high-speed delivery platforms, among others.",Actuators & Motors; Aerodynamics; Lasers (Weapons); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation)

With the nanosecond discharge, very high field strengths are applied and then the field is turned off before glow-to-filamentary transition occurs.  The semiconducting surface array suppresses the backward breakdown that has previously been shown to produce a cancelling backward jet leading to very little thrust for conventional nanosecond driven devices.  The embedded semiconductors achieve this by conducting the backward current through the surface and thus eliminating the backward breakdown. This allows all the momentum produced in the forward direction to be delivered to the surrounding boundary layer flow field.  Conventional sinusoidal driven Surface DBD's are capable of generating surface jets with velocities up to ~10 meter per second, limited by glow-to-filamentary transition of the discharge.  The proposed SBIR work will explore the possibility of increasing the surface jet velocity by more than a factor of five.  In addition, the SSDBD can be driven at a very high repetition rate, producing high repetition sequential surface jets and total thrust that are expected to be orders of magnitude higher than possible with conventional sinusoidal DBD configurations.  These surface jets are expected to provide new methods for the control of boundary layer interactions including separation, transition to turbulence, and drag through the introduction of time varying momentum at selected locations close to the surface.","Potential flow control applications of interest to NASA, based on the delay or early initiation of laminar-to-turbulent transition by manipulating near wall instability mechanisms, includes steering moments, reduced viscous drag, enhanced mixing, and reduced heat transfer.  The SSDBD device may also be useful for reducing viscous drag, heat transfer, and fatigue caused by cyclic loading due to airframe vibration.  These specific applications are achievable by controlling shock-induced boundary layer separation encountered in compression ramp geometries.","The potential flow control capabilities of the nanosecond pulse driven, offset semiconducting surface dielectric barrier discharge (SSDBD) device are not limited to NASA flight vehicles.  In particular, the manipulation and control of subsonic instabilities such as stationary crossflow vortices by discrete roughness elements in the form of plasma bumps could potentially delay laminar-to-turbulent transition, greatly reducing viscous drag.   In addition, the use of this device should be able to control boundary layer separation which would reduce viscous drag, and fatigue caused by cyclic loading due to airframe vibration.","Actuators & Motors; Aerodynamics; Atmospheric Propulsion; Characterization; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Image Analysis; Image Processing; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Thermal"

Active Combustion Instability Control (ACIC) controls the combustion process such that the heat release profile is modulated to dampen the naturally occurring thermoacoustic instabilities. A major challenge to effective implementation of active combustion control is the availability of valves and actuators that provide adequate flow modulation control authority. The majority of the published work revolves around valves designed to modulate the main combustor flow. At present these valves are not designed to operate in a harsh environment and as such are required to be located outside the main flow path, reducing their control authority. To effectively meet the challenge, valves and sensors that are smaller, more responsive and robust must be developed. Ultimately the control valves are co-located with the fuel injection manifold. The trade-off for the harsh environment operation is the ability to maximize the flow modulation control authority. The objective of this research is to integrate the required control authority into an operational environment. This research initiates the development of a light weight fast-acting fuel control valve for harsh environment operation.  The valve will allow the precise time dependent fuel control required for lean-burn combustor operability. In this Phase I research a proof-of-concept valve is designed, fabricated and cold-flow tested using commercially-available driver circuitry to uncover potential performance benefits and demonstrate feasibility of the approach for further development.","NASA, specifically the Controls and Dynamics branch at GRC, is actively engaged in Active Combustion Instability Control research. NASA is currently focusing on low emission lean-burn combustor design along with the application of ACIC techniques to increase the operating range of said combustors. The proposed harsh environment valves enable the application of the ACIC techniques due to the fact that the actuators, being closed-coupled to the fuel injector, have the required flow modulation control authority to implement the control schemes.","Operational gas turbine combustors, including augmentors, are prone to thermoacoustic instabilities.  Therefore, companies such as GE, PW and Rolls Royce, are actively investigating ACIC.  The valves developed for the lean-burn combustor fuel control can also be used to provide the control authority required to implement ACIC techniques into existing product lines of not only the gas turbine manufactures listed above, but other engine manufacturers as well.",Active Systems; Actuators & Motors; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Process Monitoring & Control

It will offer significant flexibility regarding placement of the propulsive devices for top-level hybrid design, including over-wing, under-wing, split-wing, fuselage pylon-mounted, and other configurations.  The user will supply power required, fan speed, fan torque, TOGW estimation, desired power split between engines and batteries, and selection for propulsion system locations.  Sizing and weight analysis for electric motors, generators, speed controllers, gearboxes, cables, transformers, batteries, and cooling systems will be considered including structural considerations for heavily modified aircraft components for each system.  The outputs will be hybrid electric propulsion system weight, sizes for the sub-system components, and revised HEDP specific TOGW calculation.  The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a tool within a framework for top-level and conceptual hybrid electric propulsion studies.  Additionally, the fidelity of the current NASA models is based on empirical-data and extrapolations.  This proposed tool will employ physic-based models with empirical corrections, when needed.  A Phase II and future commercialization plan have been identified.","The potential NASA applications for this proposed effort will focus on integrating this tool into a larger MDAO framework for turbo-electric, hybrid electric aircraft design synthesis, benefitting multiple NRA projects, and other direct NASA efforts, both internal and external.  Several nuances native to the turbo-electric or hybrid electric distributed propulsion are electric component weight and structure, electric component cooling, and electric cabling requiring a tool such as the one proposed for initial aircraft design synthesis.  These new hurdles have not been addressed in previous textbook methods or efforts, but play a significant role in determining the feasibility of these new aircraft configurations.  One of the major benefits to a decoupled energy management system using distributed propulsion is the freedom in placing the propulsors.  The user can determine where; the options will include under-wing, over-wing, split-wing, fuselage pylon-mounted, and others.  Each configuration will inherently have vastly different structural and cooling considerations.","A commercial application for top-level distributed propulsion sizing tool would be very attractive, as the industry is pressing toward hybrid-electric distributed propulsion (HEDP) concepts as new technologies for electric components and batteries develop.  This product will leverage its ability to customize the propulsion system locations, such as under-wing, over-wing, split-wing, and fuselage pylon-mounted.

Significant rotorcraft problems such as dynamic stall, rotor blade loads in forward flight, and blade-vortex interaction all have significant unsteady pressure oscillations that must be resolved in order to understand the underlying physics. Installation of pressure transducers is difficult and expensive on rotorcraft models, and the resulting data has limited spatial resolution. Application of a fast-responding pressure-sensitive paint should provide unsteady surface pressure distributed over the blade surface. Fast PSP measurements have been demonstrated at NASA Langley on a 2-meter rotor model in hover and in forward flight by the ISSI/OSU team using two single camera systems. More recently, measurements were conducted in forward flight using multiple cameras and lasers at two azimuthal positions. We propose expanding this system for production testing. This will be accomplished by adding remote control of the system interrogation region using remote focus/zoom/aperture lenses and pan/tilt stages combined with Ethernet hardware to control the systems remotely. Motion blur will be addressed using both a rotating mirror and de-convolution software. Data processing software will be customized to allow scripting of repetitive operations to speed up data processing. Finally, a temperature measurement capability will be added to the system to allow temperature corrections to be applied to the PSP data.

However, given their demanding operational environment, composite aerospace and aircraft structures are prone to damage and manufacturing related flaws. An accurate assessment of composite structural performance and system life management strategies requires quantitative information on the aforementioned damage states of the components. Recent advances in infra-red (IR) sensing and data processing technologies have enabled real-time thermoelastic stress analysis (TSA) methodologies to finally become viable for accurate diagnostics and prognostics of composite structures. The success of these thermography methods, however, depends strongly on the characteristics of the surface of the composite components. Materials Technologies Corporation (MTC) proposes to develop a specialized, spray-on and peel-off coating technique which would facilitate high accuracy quantitative thermoelastic analysis through improved IR response and thus enable on-going in-situ diagnostics and prognostics during component lifecycle without necessitating disassembly and off-line inspection. A major benefit of the product would be to facilitate usage of less expensive inspection systems that can take advantage of the advanced high emissivity coatings.","For NASA, the proposed coatings would help in the Low-Cost and Reliable Access to Space (LCRATS) program. Specifically, it can be used for determining structural integrity of bonded assemblies; and non-intrusive inspection of Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPV), Orion heat shield and painted surfaces. It will facilitate detecting and pinpointing corrosion under painted surfaces; identifying composite defects and evaluating integrity; non-destructive measurement and evaluation of COPV; and damage inspection and acceptance testing of Orion heat shield.","The commercial applications are numerous. Almost all industries including aerospace, automotive, and energy sectors would need coating enhanced IR-NDE inspection systems.",Coatings/Surface Treatments; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Infrared; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT)

To monitor the overall HEDP system health in real time, a virtual requirement to flight qualify any architecture hardware components, reliability centered maintenance (RCM) applied to prognostics and health management (PHM) will yield significant improvement in HEDP system reliability, availability, safety and cost.  This work will identify the tools and create a generic methodology for the PHM of a HEDP system based on RCM and failure mode data of likely HEDP architecture components.  The proposed work will notionally design a PHM system into a HEDP system architecture, with feedback systems from each component within the stated architecture, as well as potential mitigation strategies for component failure modes.  Specific attention will be applied to understanding of the reliability, availability, and safety for the HEDP components.  Heating, arching, unexpected voltage drop, and other potential electronic pitfalls will be identified and mitigated.  ESAero will leverage their component databases, experience with HEDP component architectures, aircraft design, and vendor relationships while General Atomics (GA) will provide expertise in PHM with their HealthMap software.","The potential NASA commercial applications for this proposed SBIR effort will be twofold: during the conceptual design phase for HEDP architectures, a PHM system will provide a method for determining the health and functionality of these new electronic systems as they are integrated into the HEDP architecture, and eventually, the conceptual design process, directly benefitting NASA's work in HEDP and anticipated future testing activities, whether ground or flight.  These methodologies will provide a valuable tool during initial design as well as provide a significant boost for further HEDP aircraft design development. Another area which could benefit NASA is to back away from HEDP specific PHM and re-configure the methodology and models for targeted PHM on any given subsystem related to HEDP, as a single component could be considered another ""subsystem"" in the view of the aircraft PHM.  This could even include land-based monitoring devices.","The potential non-NASA commercial applications for this proposed SBIR effort will be similar to the NASA commercial applications, specifically during conceptual design for HEDP system architectures.  This tool would provide valuable performance, health, and reliability information during top-level design as well as provide a significant boost for further aircraft design development. The ESAero/GA team proposing this work is in a unique position because the subcontractor, General Atomics, is the best path for immediate commercialization as a manufacturer of RPAs, RPA payloads, and propulsion systems for the Air Force.  The HEDP PHM methodologies and models to be developed during this work are directly applicable to multiple AFRL, NASA and IARPA programs, along with some private industry work with particularly Lockheed Martin and Boeing.

NASA needs innovative gasification reactors to convert trash into useful intermediate products such as carbon dioxide and water, which can ultimately be used to make methane and oxygen for propulsion and energy generation applications.  Unfortunately, partial oxidation reactors and incinerators that might be used to reduce trash to useful products operate at high temperatures and also create ash, tar and other undesirable by-products.  TDA Research has developed a low temperature (< 135 degrees C) ozone oxidation process that efficiently and cleanly converts trash into carbon dioxide and water.  These intermediate products can then be delivered to a Sabatier reactor for the production of methane and oxygen.  However, our reactor was designed for use on the moon or Mars whereas future spacecraft will need systems able to function in zero-g and micro-g environments.  Therefore, TDA proposes to develop a trash gasification reactor that uses our ozone oxidation process and will work in the absence of gravity.  In this project we will conduct the analysis and experiments to design the reactor.","This project will develop a trash gasification reactor to generate CO2 and water that can be used for in situ synthesis of propellants.  The ability to convert trash to propellants is critical to the success of long term space missions. As yet no technologies have been developed that meet all of the demanding criteria required by such a process, and our low temperature trash gasification reactor is critical to such missions.  A successful Phase II project will lead to Phase III support for the development of flightweight hardware.","Agencies and communities other than NASA also need to reuse or recycle trash and sterilize water and medical equipment, which can be accomplished with ozone.  The Army needs portable systems to eliminate trash and purify grey water for reuse.  Ozone can also effectively remove organic contaminants from surfaces that would have once been cleaned with chlorocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons; materials now banned from use.  For example, ozone can be used to clean hydrocarbons from semiconductors, magnetic disks, medical devices, flight hardware, etc. which would be damaged by high temperature cleaning processes.",Fuels/Propellants; In Situ Manufacturing; Resource Extraction; Waste Storage/Treatment

This is accomplished by harvesting CO2 from the atmosphere and processing it electrochemically to release methane fuel and water. Sustainable Innovations' EMG technology has the potential to lead to a global sustainable energy infrastructure and could also play a pivotal role in achieving both the energy and the life support needs of extraterrestrial bases.

The intention is to demonstrate that this methodology is an excellent candidate for creating a highly efficient reactor for carbon dioxide conversion to methane. Unlike conventional electrolytes, ILs generally have very low vapor pressures.  This will make it possible for them to be used in the much lower pressure Martian atmosphere without the problem of evaporation.Our goal is to build on the results achieved by other research groups by using our own knowledge and years of experience working with ILs, including electrochemistry, to efficiently reduce CO2.  We will prepare the task-specific 3rd generation ILs and then measure their electrochemical properties; i.e., conductivity, electrochemical window, etc.  These are currently unknown but are important in order to ascertain whether these ILs are suitable for this application.   Anticipating this will be the case, we will then test various electrodes, including TiO2 and silver cathodes, to determine which gives the most selective reduction of CO2 to methane.  The efficiency of the process (including power requirements) will be quantified and compared to the Sebatier and Fischer-Tropsch processes.","The proposed electrochemical reduction of CO2 using 3rd generation ionic liquids will provide a means to produce methane from atmospheric CO2 in low pressure and temperature environments such as those found on Mars.  The product selectivity and efficiency is thought to be governed by the mass diffusion profile in the electrochemical cell.  Consequently, methane quality and conversion rates can be optimized to space applications by the proposed characterization of electrode interfaces.  The low volatility, low vapor pressure and anticipated viscosity when loaded with CO2 makes 3rd generation ionic liquids an excellent choice for investigation of applications in both space and terrestrial environments.  Since one of NASA's main goals is to produce methane propellant from the CO2 found in the Martian atmosphere, we also propose to determine the effects of small quantities of Martian dust.  Any practical space hardware operating on Mars will be designed to capture CO2 directly from the Martian atmosphere.  There will no doubt be some sort of filter mechanism in line, but some contaminants are likely to get into the IL.  Our group has considerable experience working with meteorites.  We will use powder from well characterized Martian meteorites to provide the dust contamination.","Supercritical CO2 (scCO2) extraction is a highly efficient but costly industrial process.  It is anticipated that increasing the CO2 in the bulk phase ionic liquid (IL) electrolyte will not lead to large increases in the bulk phase viscosity which is a critical issue in previous studies with IL/CO2 equilibriums. If so, the low viscosity of the saturated  IL media  will make them excellent candidates for improving supercritical fluid extraction efficiencies and reducing capital costs;  scCO2 and ILs are environmentally friendly alternatives to  replace traditional solvents.The IL could be integrated into both upstream and downstream syngas production in gas-to-liquid type plants.  Application in the water gas shift reactor layout could provide a low temperature route for electrochemically controlling the CO:H2 ratio and impurity of the feed stream into the Fischer-Tropsch reactor which is critical to the operating  costs.  Downstream processing and recycling could be enhanced as well by replacing or working in tandem with methyldiethanol amine units for increased waste gas absorption and carbon recycle efficiency.   The same downstream recycle system could easily be scaled down and adapted for lower capacity carbon sequestering. This has the potential to work in tandem with scCO2 technology to improve syngas production while also reducing costs and improving efficiency for scCO2 separation units.","Characterization; Conversion; Fluids; Fuels/Propellants; In Situ Manufacturing; Metallics; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Organics/Biomaterials/Hybrids; Processing Methods; Resource Extraction; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable)"

Our proposed technology converts waste from space missions into hydrogen, water, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide that can be used for energy production and/or life support. This innovative reactor technology employs a pyrolysis reactor as the first step, followed by a chemical looping gasification reactor as the second step. The two-stage process is more suitable than the traditional one-step gasification process, because solid residues associated with the waste, such as ash and tar, are contained in the pyrolysis unit. The utilization of metal oxides that can be readily obtained at the site of exploration as an oxidizer in the gasification (second) step instead of traditional oxidizers such as oxygen or steam further saves the valuable resources that can be used for life support systems or other space applications. If successful, our innovation can fully utilize natural (metal oxides) and discarded (wastes from space missions) materials that may exist during space exploration, thus saving the valuable oxygen or water that can be used for life support systems or other space applications.","The target NASA application for our technology is in-situ production of useful compounds using discarded waste and natural mineral resources in space. Our innovation, if successful, fully utilizes resources readily available during space exploration, and is inline with NASA's vision of ISRU – to harness and utilize resources at the site of exploration and to create products that significantly reduce the mass, cost, and risk of near-term and long-term space exploration. We anticipate the proposed technology can be readily used for Mars exploration, since hematite (mineral form of Fe2O3) is believed to be widely available on Mars. Other space missions in need of water or power generation may also benefit from our technology.","Other government agencies can also benefit from our proposed technology. The proposed technology will be of interest to DOD for military deployments in remote areas where water and/or energy resources are scarce. The proposed pyrolysis-chemical looping technology can provide a more environmental friendly alternative to convert waste plastics and biomass into synthesis gas–carbon dioxide produced from the process can be easily separated from the combustion air and almost no NOx and SOx emissions will be resulted from the process.

KSC's scheduling problem is decomposed into many individual but coordinated scheduling problems, each with its own unique set of resources, tasks, constraints, ground rules, and scheduling techniques, resulting in different scheduling processes for each of the individual applications. Stottler Henke's existing Aurora intelligent planning and scheduling system development framework was specifically designed for KSC ground operations scheduling and to be highly adaptable to different domains and has already proven to be adaptable by its successful applications in many dozens of widely varying domains (including multiple KSC scheduling domains). In every domain where a comparison was performed, Aurora always generated more optimal schedules.  The proposed vision is to develop one scheduling tool that SMEs in wildly different KSC areas can adapt to create automated scheduling software for different scheduling applications. New capabilities need to be added to address the new KSC realities and to make the adaptation process more SME-friendly. Initially the Intelligent Operations Scheduling System (IOSS) would be fielded in a small number of vehicle and payload processing applications.  Later SMEs could adapt IOSS themselves. Eventually, IOSS-based automatic scheduling systems might constitute the majority of schedule decision making at KSC. These separate IOSS scheduling applications could automatically interact, providing automated coordination capabilities. These applications will also be able to interoperate with legacy scheduling systems. Ultimately, by automating, replacing, or interfacing to every scheduling function or system, extreme synergies of coordination and manpower savings would result.","The most direct targets for transition of this proposed effort are the large number of various payload and vehicle processing scheduling applications at KSC. By showing its ability to create high-quality schedules with greatly reduced manpower, IOSS will clearly illustrate its advantages over the status quo. Because it will be possible for SMEs to customize the eventual IOSS themselves to their own scheduling applications, a large number of intelligent scheduling applications can be quickly developed. As more are fielded, additional synergies will be created by the cooperative interactions between IOSS-based intelligent scheduling applications and each other. Capabilities to easily interface and interact cooperatively and in a peer-to-peer manner with legacy scheduling systems will also provide additional cooperative synergies. There is a potential to automate the majority of scheduling decision-making at KSC with a corresponding massive savings in highly skilled manpower. An additional, nearby target is the CCAFS, which has nearly identical scheduling problems. Beyond KSC, NASA has a large number of difficult scheduling problems that IOSS could be readily adapted to. Major IOSS successes at KSC will facilitate entry into other NASA markets.","On the commercial side, Stottler Henke already sells Aurora and associated customization services to private companies. Commercial product and service sales related to Aurora have already resulted in over $4 million in revenue. IOSS improvements can be readily incorporated into Aurora and sold through existing sales channels.  Most importantly, by providing an SME customization capability, IOSS will be removing one of the most significant current constraints on Aurora sales—the need for Stottler Henke's involvement in 90% of the customization projects. An SME-customizable version of Aurora would be applicable to orders of magnitude more customers. And by requiring far less of our time, it would allow us to sell the product for far less.  Current Aurora customers tend to be aerospace manufacturers, partly due to our early conversion of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner production line to being an Aurora customer. Companies like Learjet and Bombardier quickly followed suit as well as some of Boeing's suppliers. Other customers tend to have high-value applications both requiring a high-quality solution and justifying the relatively high price. An IOSS-enhanced version of Aurora would presumably tend to have a similar diverse base of customer but the lower cost should greatly increase the number of potential customers.",Sequencing & Scheduling

For example, most fluid systems aboard spacecraft are impacted by the presence of capillary forces—a poor understanding of which has led to poorly performing life support equipment. Despite an increasing number of flight investigations concerning capillary phenomena, no broad re-assessment and re-design of low-g fluids systems has been undertaken. We propose a fundamental change to spacecraft fluid systems design. In this Phase I research, concurrent with a modern review of all candidate spacecraft fluid systems, we will design and demonstrate two new geometric flow components for the critically and persistently problematic unit operations of in-line bubble and liquid rivulet separations. The new components can be exploited across a variety of spacecraft fluids systems to markedly increase system reliability and performance. Many other components are envisioned as inspired by recent results from space experiments and the application of novel geometries. Such components offer the advantages of no power, no moving parts, and little to no pressure loss as they passively separate fluid phases using capillary forces and motive fluid streams.","Challenges remain for design engineers to produce robust fluids handling equipment for spacecraft such as critical life support systems: i.e., oxygen supply, air revitalization, thermal management systems, water reclamation, medical fluids, and others. The new passive phase separating components to be designed and developed in this Phase I effort can be exploited across a variety of spacecraft fluids systems to markedly increase system reliability and performance. They may also be employed throughout spacecraft in systems from fluid feed lines in hydrolysers, to condensing heat exchangers, urine processors, portable life support systems, plant and animal habitats, food preparation facilities, propellant management systems, and others—basically, all liquid systems on spacecraft: coolants, water, aqueous solutions, fuels, and cryogens. The components offer the advantages of no moving parts, little to no pressure loss, and no additional power consumption, and could benefit greatly in terms of increased TRL via testing aboard the ISS.","This research applies recent advances in the study of microgravity capillary flows and phenomena. We expect to change the overall approach to spacecraft fluid systems design and provide common geometries that naturally and routinely separate fluid phases in a manner more akin to terrestrial applications and experience. Our primary intent for low-gravity demonstration aboard the ISS is to increase TRL levels and gain wider acceptance for our non-traditional approach among the aerospace community. However, terrestrial applications are identified and pursued as part of our broader commercial objectives in Phase I and Phase II. Applications of our design approach to routine microfluidic flows relating to fuel delivery and biomedical drug delivery represent significant growth opportunities.","Analytical Methods; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Fluids; Heat Exchange; Medical; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Passive Systems; Remediation/Purification; Simulation & Modeling; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Waste Storage/Treatment"

Our NASA customer is the Macro Fiber Composite Actuator Experiment (MFCX), which uses the Materials International Space Station Experiment-X (MISSE-X) platform. MISSE-X will expand ISS utilization by advancing the Technology Readiness Level of new materials, devices, and subsystems. OVS uses the impedance method to validate both MFCs and in situ self-health monitoring methods.Implications of the innovation:MFC piezocomposites have been flown, but only in a shielded enclosure for a short duration. MFC materials will need to operate continuously with minimal thermal protection to enable active composite reflector structures, large solar array active control, and structural self-health monitoring. Data is needed on the viability of MFC materials for long-duration space applications.Technical objectives:OVS leverages our previous NASA SBIR research. Our initial impedance method prototype exists as a TRL 5 unit. We have demonstrated both analog and digital MFC operation. However, it is not clear which approach (analog or digital) is best for OVS. Each approach has different power, mechanical, electrical, and computational needs—it is not clear which is the best match for MISSE-X. Indeed, a new configuration may be required. Phase I addresses these concerns and establishes feasibility through validation tests and experiments.Research description:We have already developed an impedance-based electronics package and validated it under simulated launch conditions. Phase I transforms this implementation for MISSE-X compatibility and produces a Phase II road map.Anticipated results:Phase I addresses the main barrier to MISSE-X operation, and completes a TRL 5 prototype that is MFCX compatible. Phase II delivers a fully operational TRL 7 unit.","MFCX data will be used to establish operational limits, determine long-duration space environmental exposure trends, and evaluate thermal shielding options for MFC-based active structures. The MFCX is the first flight validation for in situ electrical impedance-based structural health monitoring (SHM).

Support structures include habitats and Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPVs). Specific customers include the SMD Scanning Microwave Limb Sounder (SMLS) advanced reflector concept designs and OCT Lightweight Materials and Structures (LMS) long-duration space deployables. Maintaining the shape of these large, high-precision composite reflectors in space will be extremely difficult; active composite reflectors that adjust their shape in situ should be both cheaper and considerable lighter. OVS expands and maximizes ISS utilization by using the long duration ISS space environment to increase operational availability, reduce maintenance, minimize crew interaction, and reduce spaceflight technical risks and needs. OVS is therefore directly responsive to Topic H10.02, which calls for technologies that advance the state of the art of spacecraft systems by utilizing the ISS as a technology test bed.","Non-NASA commercial applications include Homeland Security structural analysis to mitigate threats (preparedness) and assess damage (response), smart structures, and SHM of civil infrastructures, land/marine structures, medical devices, and military structures.

The proposed aspirator will draw up to 40 L/min of air and produce a nominal vacuum of 500-mm Hg, which is comparable to commercially available medical aspirators.  The unit will also provide a means for separation and containment of up to 1000 mL of aspirated fluids.  Waste material separation will be accomplished by a reticulated foam trap that will utilize hydrophilic adsorbent materials to sequester liquids within the reticulated foam structure.  The aspirator assembly will also include a sub-micron filter to prevent aerosol from escaping to the spacecraft cabin.  During the Phase I research, an efficient trap will be designed and tested using a commercial off the shelf (COTS) vacuum pump.  Additional trap features will be investigated including collapsible walls to minimize storage space and chemical resistance to enable suction of corrosive and/or toxic materials.  Phase II research will focus on improving overall ESM and incorporating features such as a trap fill level indicator, an emergency shutoff in case of liquid breakthrough, and an alarm indicating a blocked airway, which will improve microgravity performance.","The proposed technology has a strong potential for use by NASA as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of the International Space Station and for future long-duration missions such as a Mars transit, Mars base, or a permanently manned Lunar outpost where return to Earth for emergency medical care is not an option.  The current medical programs utilized on the ISS are extensive and have been under development for decades.  To date, the medical supplies carried on the ISS and Shuttle have been adequate to handle the relatively minor problems that have occurred, but as NASA looks to the future of manned space flight, dramatic increases in mission duration are apparent.  Longer duration space flights increase the potential for a medical emergency that current systems are unable to treat.  One shortcoming in particular, is the lack of a medical aspirator onboard any current space platform for accommodating medical procedures that require aspiration to remove saliva and blood during dental procedures; blood and loose tissue during surgery; or vomit, mucous, and saliva during airway management.  In these situations, a microgravity and hypogravity compatible aspirator capable of providing medical suction and containment of extracted fluids and debris will enhance NASA mission capabilities and provide a needed safety margin in ALS activities.","The proposed advancement in medical suction technology will provide military and municipal emergency response teams the ability to provide portable self-contained medical suction without concern for local terrain, patient position, or motion.  This versatility will enhance the attractiveness of this technology and meet the growing concern for the safety of emergency personnel.  The private sector will also utilize the technology in niche applications such as at sea and in flight.  Presently, medical suction units rely on gravity and buoyant force to seal collection vessels once they become full.  The seal is required to prevent contaminated material; blood, vomit, mucous, etc., from entering the pump.  A seal failure caused by an overturned collection vessel results in tedious clean-up procedures in the best case and disease transmission in the worst case.  The proposed innovation enables emergency response teams to provide medical suction in any orientation and physical environment.",Medical

VAs capable of detecting changes in astronaut psychosocial states can increase astronaut self-awareness, suggest countermeasures, and provide rehearsal scenarios to maintain and enhance interpersonal skills.

This behavioral modeling technology could also be applied to NASA's Aerospace activities.  For example, it could be used to measure stress on air traffic controllers. Adaptation to commercial airlines, in which the standardized procedures and repetitive nature of their execution within the close confines of an aircraft facilitates the modeling and establishment of norms for the behavior for individual crew.","The military has teams of individuals working in high stress environments over long durations. Examples include submarine crews, aircraft carriers, embedded special operations forces and pilots flying unmanned air vehicles for hours on end.  We expect this same technology to transfer to military applications, since even a lag of one minute makes most real time interactions impossible, and this technique would allow are more interactive communication where none was possible before (ex: on a submarine).  A variety of commercial activities also have similar characteristics to NASA missions, and the ABCAT software has commercial potential here.  As mentioned, air traffic controllers work in high-stress environment where small mistakes can be costly.  Likewise, teams of operators control nuclear power plants, petrochemical plants, oil refineries, etc.  They often perform standard operating procedures and need to be monitored closely for degraded performance.

Using progressive 3D printing and inkjet technologies, SMRC will design, build, and test a complete nutritional system for long duration missions beyond low earth orbit. The 3D printing component will deliver macronutrients (starch, protein, and fat), structure, and texture while the ink jet will deliver micronutrients, flavor, and smell. SMRC will team with the food science program at North Carolina State University and International Flavors and Fragrances to ensure the production of nutritious and flavorful mission supplies. SMRC proposes producing synthetic food which meets the nutritional needs of each and every mission specialist and astronaut. Using unflavored macronutrients, such as protein, starch and fat, the sustenance portion of the diet can be rapidly produced in a variety of shapes and textures directly from the 3D printer (already warm). Since basic sustenance will not ensure the long term physical and mental health of the crew, this is where the microjetting will add value. In addition to adding flavor, low volume micronutrients will be added as the food is processed by the 3D printer. The macronutrient feed stocks will be stored in dry sterile containers and fed directly to the printer. At the print head, these stocks will be combined with water or oil per a digital recipe to minimize waste and spoilage. Flavors and texture modifiers can also be added at this stage. This mixture is blended and extruded into the desired shape. The micronutrients and flavors are stored in sterile packs as liquids, aqueous solutions or dispersions. SMRC's approach not only addresses uniform long term storage, sustenance, and micro-nutrition, but also variable and changing dietary needs, variety, and boredom.","SMRC will develop a system that is targeted for long duration space missions. This system will include a micro- and macronutrient storage system, mixing system to formulate paste and a 3D dispensing system, where flavored and textured food will be prepared for astronauts. The storage system will provide maximum shelf life for the nutrients for the future space missions. The 3D printing system will provide hot and quick food in addition to personalized nutrition, flavor and taste. Such system can be modified and used during short duration space missions as well, which will eliminate nutrient storage system of the proposed 3D printed food system. The short duration food system will utilize various pastes prepared in advance to print appetizing flavored food. The biggest advantage of 3D printed food technology will be zero waste, which is essential in long-distance space missions.","With the anticipated world population of 12 Billion by the end of the century, the current infrastructure of food production and supply will not be able to meet the demand of such a large population. The conventional technologies can only provide marginal efficiency, which is not enough in keeping food prices at affordable level for the population growth. By exploring and implementing technologies such as 3D printing, this may avoid food shortage, inflation, starvation, famine and even food wars. In addition, US military can use 3D printed food system during many of their missions. 3D printed food system can reduce military logistics, disposal waste, increase operational efficiency and mission effectiveness especially during wartime. In addition to that, 3D printed food can provide optimal nutrient to the soldiers depending on their personal needs and level of physical activities. Submarines and aircraft carriers can effectively benefit from 3D printed food system, which may reduce their downtime to refill supplies and provide efficiency in executing their missions.","Food (Preservation, Packaging, Preparation)"

This will be accomplished by designing and building a rugged, small, light weight, low power, easy to use analyzer with appropriate software, which can identify and quantify API and degradation products with little or no sample handling in 1 minute.  Feasibility will be demonstrated during Phase I by successfully measuring acetaminophen, azithromycin, epinephrine, lidocaine, and their degradation products at percent level concentrations.   The overall goal of the Phase II program is to build a working prototype Drug Stability Analyzer that is suitable for space deployment (e.g. aboard the ISS) and capable of monitoring drug degradation.  The ability of the analyzer to nondestructively quantify the amount of the API and the degradation products, would also allow assessing drug potency at the time of use to ensure crewmember safety.  The Drug Stability Analyzer will be transitioned from a Technology Readiness Level 3 to a 7 (ground tested) from the beginning to the end of the program.","The proposed Drug Stability Analyzer is specifically being designed to monitor degradation of pharmaceutical drugs that are used by astronauts, so that drug types, formulations, and packaging can be improved, and supplies can be selected to match mission length.

In addition, the support frame carries the mass of an actively cooled shield and outer MLI blanket enabling ultra low heat leak storage of cryogenic fluids.  The support frame is conveniently mounted to the top and bottom center tank penetrations, eliminating any direct supports to the cryogen tank itself, which reduces the heat leak to near the theoretical minimum.  The novel design approach is significantly better than conventional MLI, which does not possess the required structural or thermal capabilities required.  The technical approach is to integrate low-risk, high Technology Readiness Level (TRL) (TRL 7-9) components into a new and unique low-cost, light-weight, high-strength, thermally efficient MLI system.  This approach enables the system to meet and exceed all requirements for reduced heat leak, low-mass, and high strength to withstand flight loads.  The NASA Cryogenic Propellant Storage and Transfer Program will directly benefit from the development of the proposed MLI system.","Application of this technology would significantly reduce the losses associated with the storage of cryogenic fluids.  The advanced insulation techniques being proposed by Sierra Lobo will directly benefit NASA's Advanced Space Exploration Program.  Cryogenic fluids such as hydrogen, methane, and oxygen are required for many current and future space missions that will use life-support, propulsion, and power systems.  The targeted NASA applications for long term cryogenic propellant storage, in-space as well as on the lunar surface, include space transportation orbit transfer vehicles, upper stages, space power systems, spaceports, spacesuits, lunar habitation systems, and in situ propellant systems.  In addition, NASA spaceport operations and propulsion test facilities are both heavily dependent upon a wide range of cryogenic systems.  Improving the efficiency of these systems at these facilities using advanced insulation techniques will directly benefit the programs they support through reduced operating costs.","The advanced insulation techniques being proposed by Sierra Lobo can be used in nearly any industrial, commercial, or medical application currently requiring storage of liquid cryogens such as helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.   Such fluids are routinely used in the medical industry, metals processing, semiconductor manufacture and as well as many non-NASA government agencies.  The targeted applications for the Department of Defense include Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) that carry liquid oxygen and potentially liquid hydrogen, liquid hydrogen powered ground transportation systems, space platforms using electric propulsion (xenon, hydrogen), space-based chemical lasers (hydrogen, helium), orbit transfer vehicles (hydrogen, oxygen), and orbital propellant depots/space stations (hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen).

This pump will fulfill several needs stated in SBIR Research Topic, H2.01: Cryogenic Fluid Management Technologies. Zero gravity cryogenic control devices (spray bars and mixers), require cryogenic liquids to be pumped efficiently. Propellant conditioning and densification technologies require compact, efficient pumps. Broad area cooling of cryopropellant shields can be facilitated by the pumping of a cold gas such as helium in a loop from a cryocooler to a shield. Various methods of liquefaction of oxygen such as passive radiative cooling can be enabled by cryogenic pumping. Other aerospace applications such as a fuel pump for liquid hydrogen fueled aircraft.  A compact, reliable, and light weight pump for cryogenic liquids currently does not exist.  Our subcontractor, Ball Aerospace and Technologies, has identified the need for such a pump several years ago, but has not found a suitable available product.Scroll pumps have several advantages over other pump technology, including being compact, light weight, reliable and efficient.  The pump can be hermetically isolated from the drive motor by the use of a magnetic coupler, allowing the pump to be hermetically sealed. Because of the orbital motion, the scrolls can be placed in a metal bellows that are sealed to the housing which isolates the liquid via a vacuum enclosure for thermal isolation. The bearings can be placed on thermally isolating arms, so they do not need to operate at cryogenic temperatures.Scroll pumps have considerable technical heritage relevant to this application. Air Squared has developed and successfully tested scroll pumps for liquids and for cryogenic gasses. Air Squared has developed several compact pumps for pumping air which has similar viscosity and compressibility to liquid hydrogen.","Launch Vehicle – Load Responsive Multi-Layer Insulation (LV-LRMLI) could provide a high performance thermal insulation for Launch Vehicles with an integrated lightweight vacuum shell, able to withstand aerodynamic forces during launch, and substantially reducing cryopropellant boil-off. LV-LRMLI could provide benefit to NASA with increased launch vehicle mission capabilities such as longer duration cryogenic powered missions, longer coast times for orbital transitions, higher payload capacity to GSO, enhancements to the workhorse Atlas V and Delta IV launch vehicle families, applicability to upcoming cryogenic upper stage designs such as Advanced Common Evolved Stage and Space Launch System.A small, cryogenic scroll pump would have several NASA cryopropellant applications.  It would enable efficient, low boil off or zero boil off cryogenic systems by circulating cryogenic helium gas from a cryocooler to broad area thermal shields surrounding the tanks.  This would eliminate the need for high efficiency heat exchangers that are required with ambient temperature circulator pumps.The pump would also enable thermodynamic vent systems in which cryopropellants are dropped in pressure and temperature and heat exchanged with liquid pumped in a circulation loop with the tank.   NASA Marshall has done considerable work with such systems involving spray bar tank heat exchanger and destratifiers.","United Launch Alliance (ULA) is currently developing an integrated fluid system (IVF) to recover and use boil off hydrogen and oxygen from its Centaur upper launch vehicle.  An enabling component of this system would be a positive displacement cryogenic pump. The cold propellant gases would be pumped to a pressure of approximately 200 PSI and stored in tanks for use as reaction control system fuel or tank pressurization.  The small size and pressure capability of the scroll pump would be well suited for this application.A strong demand exists for small cryogenic pumps for use in liquid hydrogen fueled aircraft.  The Boeing Company and AeroViroment, Inc. have developed and flown hydrogen fueled, unmanned aircraft as reconnaissance platforms.  Typically, these aircraft fuel systems require the hydrogen to be delivered at a pressure of 90 PSIG, currently this done by making the operating pressure of the tanks at minimum of 90 PSIG. This results in tanks that can operate with a safety margin above this pressure.  If the tanks could operate at a lower pressure, such as 30 PSIG, the tank walls could be thinner and lighter.  The estimated weight savings of a pumped system for the Boeing Phantom Eye hydrogen fueled aircraft is over 400 pounds per aircraft.  The scroll pump would be an important discriminator in aircraft performance.",Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Fuels/Propellants; Pressure & Vacuum Systems

This reduction in manufacturing lead time, combined with the fact that SLM manufacturing costs are driven almost exclusively by the amount of raw powder used during fabrication, results in a substantial cost reduction for future regeneratively-cooled rocket engines.

An expander cycle engine would benefit greatly from the reduced pressure drop, either by an increase in chamber pressure and thrust or in MCC and turbomachinery life.The Space Launch System (SLS) Program is another opportunity, particularly since the expendable boosters will be competed.

A critical aspect of the program is to develop a robust, stable nuclear fuel.  One of the nuclear fuel configurations currently being evaluated is a cermet-based material comprised of uranium dioxide particles encased in a tungsten matrix.  To prevent excessive fuel loss from reaction with the hot hydrogen gas passing through the cooling channels, both the internal surfaces of the cooling channels and the exterior of the fuel element must be clad with a hydrogen compatible material such as tungsten.  To reduce the potential for uranium hydride formation that can lead to grain boundary separation and cracking, the diffusion of hydrogen into the cermet must be minimized.  Therefore, fine-grained tungsten claddings are needed.  Recently, advanced electrochemical processing techniques (EL-Form) have been developed that enable the tailoring of refractory metal microstructures through process parameter manipulation and/or alloy additions.  Therefore, these innovative electrochemical forming techniques will be used to produce fine-grained, hermetic tungsten claddings for both the internal and external surfaces of cermet based nuclear fuel elements.","NASA applications that would directly benefit from this technology include Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) and Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP).

The proposed Phase I program will focus on developing a 5N green monopropellant thruster by scaling up the long-life catalyst design from the 0.5N thruster.  Both empirical and modeling works are proposed to validate the scaling theory.  Thruster performance will be evaluated based on hot-firing test results that include c* and vacuum thrust measurements.  The Phase I findings will lead to the design of a full-scale, 100N green monopropellant thruster to be developed in Phase II.","Potential NASA applications of the green monopropellant rocket include missions to the moon, NEO and Mars.  As with SOA reaction control rockets the green monoprop is radiation-cooled and restart-able, making it a simple yet reliable propulsion option.  Storability and reliability are important factors especially for missions supporting NASA's manned spaceflight.  The low toxicity of the propellants will benefit both the ground crew and the astronauts.  Without the need for excessive safety measures, overall operational cost can be reduced.  The proposed technology is easily scalable in the 0.1-100N thrust range, which opens the door for small- and nano-satellite applications.","Market size for green monopropellant thrusters is very large.  In addition to NASA, all branches of the military have potential interests in such propulsion for tactical or in-space applications.  The non-toxic storable feature of the propellants makes them prime candidates for preloaded systems that can accommodate speedy launch operations.  Because the proposed thruster has the potential for extended life without performance degradation, developers of small satellites will likely consider it for both reaction control and primary propulsion.  This versatility will help broaden market access.  A successful Phase II program will lead to direct sales or licensing of the green monopropellant thruster and its novel, long-life catalyst.",Fuels/Propellants; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices

One area open for improvement is seals for rotating-to-static hardware.  Florida Turbine Technologies, Inc. (FTT) is proposing the use of a floating seal for turbopump applications.  The floating seal would allow lower leakages than current state-of-the-art seals, such as labyrinth seals.  The floating seal also has the added benefit of maintaining low leakages throughout transients and rotor displacements, since the floating seal's clearance tracks with the rotor axial movement and is independent of radial movement.  Plus, the floating seal is a non-contacting seal with high pressure and speed capability; this increases its reliability relative to contacting face seals or labyrinth seals operating at the same conditions and leakages.  The floating seal is proposed to work with the cryogenic liquid propellants used in upper stage engines, liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.  The feasibility of the floating seal for turbopump applications will be determined through detailed 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses.  1D parametric studies to vary the seal geometry and boundary conditions will also be performed.  The concerns of axial instability and increased turbopump axial length will be addressed during Phase I.","NASA's potential application of the innovation would be in cryogenic rocket turbopumps, such as those fed with liquid hydrogen.  The floating seal could be located along vertical portions of turbine disks or the shroud or hub of pump impellers – wherever large pressure drops and low leakages are needed.  The seal could be used in place of labyrinth seals, brush seals, carbon face seals, and inter-propellant seals.  Under FTT's Teaming Agreement with Aerojet, FTT is responsible for design and analysis of the turbopump as well as component hardware manufacturing.  Current potential applications include the Affordable Upper Stage Engine also under development with target applications on NASA's SLS family of rockets.  FTT is also exploring turbomachinery opportunities to support the nano/micro satellite launch market.  Finally, Aerojet is in the process of acquiring Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne from United Technologies Corporation which will open up additional product lines for the floating seal, such as the RS-25 high pressure fuel and oxidizer turbopumps.","Non-NASA potential applications include similar uses in the Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) Hydrocarbon Boost technology demonstrator engine, in the low or high speed oxygen turbopumps.  Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne could benefit from implementing the floating seal into the RS-68 Oxygen and Hydrogen turbopumps to isolate turbine gases from the bearings and minimize hydrogen leakage onto both turbine disks.  Outside of space propulsion, the floating seal could be incorporated into industrial pumps for nuclear power coolant, oil and water transfer pumps or water injection applications.",Launch Engine/Booster; Spacecraft Main Engine

The ICRNE technology will allow high-temperature composite materials to be directly integrated into a regeneratively-cooled nozzle section or thrust chamber made out of high-strength metallic alloys, thereby eliminating the heavy bolted flange joint that is currently used to attach high-temperature nozzle extensions. The resulting weight reduction will increase the thrust-to-weight ratio of the rocket engine. The ICRNE will also eliminate the need for multiple seals in the bolted flange joints, thus increasing reliability. The focus of the proposed Phase 1 effort will be to demonstrate the ICRNE technology by manufacturing and evaluating test specimens. A prototype ICRNE will also be designed and analyzed. In Phase 2, a prototype ICRNE unit will be fabricated, installed, and hot fire tested on an existing rocket engine.

With the NEE engine, nitrous oxide is used as an autogenously pressurizing oxidizer, and a mixture of ethane and ethylene is used in the same manner as fuel.  Initially, the ethane and ethylene mixture have the same vapor pressure as the nitrous oxide.   By utilizing the autogenous pressurization capabilities of these propellants instead of an additional pressurization system greater system simplicity and reliability can be attained.  Achievable specific impulse with pure N2O is about 315 s, which can be raised above 325 s by dissolving some O2 in the N2O.  Catalytic ignition can be achieved by using a ruthenium reactor to exothermically dissociate N2O. Since both propellants can exist as a liquid in the same temperature range, no thermal separation is required, and the two propellants can be stored together in compact common bulkhead tanks, and freezing is not an issue down to -90C. Pioneer Astronautics has demonstrated monopropellant nitrous oxide thrusters with a specific impulse of 190 s.  Using such nitrous oxide monopropellant engines for low thrust RCS together with the NEE for ??V and larger thrust reaction control propulsion, it will be possible to build spacecraft propulsion systems that are completely storable and non-toxic, with only two propellant fluids required. In the proposed program, we will demonstrate a NEE engine.","NEE propulsion would have many commercial spacecraft applications. The NEE would enable the first non-toxic storable stage, and as such would find many customers who would value it as a cost-effective alternative to the current choice of toxic hypergol or cryogenic propulsion. With its high performance and indefinite space storability, the NEE engine would be ideal as a lunar ascent/descent reaction control propulsion system. The NEE is particularly advantageous if used on manned spacecraft such as the lunar ascent/descent vehicle, the MPCV, or vehicles used in conjunction with manned spacecraft (such as free-flying inspection telerobots used in support of the ISS or MPCV), as in that case the N2O can be used for NEE bipropellant ??V propulsion, nitrous oxide monopropellant low-thrust RCS, and to provide a storable reserve supply of crew breathing gas.","Non-NASA commercial applications would include myriad of the propulsion chores for small satellites and large satellites as well, if designers of larger satellites wanted to take advantage of the compactness and non-toxicity of the NEE propulsion system.  The NEE engine could be used for onboard spacecraft propulsion or for dedicated upper and transfer stages supporting every type of mission. The NEE engine is the highest performing non-toxic storable propellant combination that exists, and with a performance that matches the increasingly shunned toxic hypergols, is sure to find many customers in every niche from microsatellites to missiles and launch vehicles.",Fuels/Propellants; Launch Engine/Booster; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Main Engine

Exposure to hazardous chemical species threatens the well-being of the crew and prevents them from fulfilling their tasks.  While a wide variety of sensors currently are available to monitor such chemicals on the ISS, some of these sensors are inadequate.  In particular for one important species, formaldehyde, Southwest Sciences proposes to develop a sensor that can provide continuous, real-time monitoring of this gas, so as to assure that the crew is better protected.","Successful development of a real-time formaldehyde monitor will allow NASA to replace the currently used badge system that provides only a quick monthly snapshot of formaldehyde concentrations in the International Space Station, with a continuous monitor having real-time readout.  The same gas sensing platform also could be adapted for meeting the needs for a multi-gas sensor for monitoring cabin air, gas regeneration, and life support systems.  The compact size and low power usage permit ready adaptation to other platforms (e.g. aircraft, balloons, UAVs, ground-based networks, etc.) of interest to NASA.  Since our monitor  is designed for long-term operation with minimal attention and maintenance, it is expected to find use in validation of remote data sensing obtained from planned NASA atmospheric research missions.","The platform used for monitoring formaldehyde could readily be adapted to measure other gases, including those related to combustion and fire safety, health monitoring, climate change research, and industrial process monitoring.",Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Infrared

Our innovative design for the pre-concentrator assembly combines high water sampling flow rates with low dead volume in the device, enhancing pre-concentration while avoidingcavitation effects. This will help meet monitoring needs for NASA's Spacecraft Water Exposure Guidelines (SWEGs). Although miniaturized mass spectrometers and other detectors are under development by NASA, the potential of such instrumentation to meet NASA needs will not be realized without complementary developments in the technology for collecting andpreparing samples for in situ measurements. Based on our analysis, we project that it will be possible to develop a miniaturized water pre-concentrator module with a mass on the order of 0.5 kg and an average power consumption of <1 watt, depending on the configuration selected. Ourgoal in the proposed SBIR Phase I effort is to demonstrate feasibility for such a system and to develop a detailed design for fabricating and demonstrating prototypes in Phase II.","The proposed high flow, low dead-volume pre-concentrator for monitoring trace levels of contaminants in water under microgravity conditions is designed to address a key technology gap for long-duration human spaceflight, especially for human exploration of the solar system beyond low-Earth orbit to the moon, near-Earth objects such as asteroids, future space stations established at Lagrange points, and missions to Mars and its moons. We plan to incorporate this technology into a miniaturized water pre-concentrator module, designed to be directly interfaced with other spacecraft instrumentation for air monitoring, such as the Vehicle Cabin Atmosphere Monitor (VCAM), currently deployed on the International Space Station.  This will enable long-term monitoring of trace contaminants in both air and water using a single instrument.It may also be possible to adapt our pre-concentrator sampling system for use in non-aqueous solvents. For example, an important future NASA planetary mission application might arise for pre-concentration of trace organic compounds in the cryogenic methane-ethane lakes on Saturn's moon Titan.","Analysis of commercial instrumentation markets shows that two of the three major growth areas for analytical instrumentation are real-time analysis and environmental monitoring, with projected annual growth rates of more than 15%. Our modular design approach for the miniaturized high flow, low dead-volume pre-concentrator for monitoring trace levels of contaminants in water under microgravity conditions will help it be adapted for measurement needs in scientific and environmental monitoring applications. For example, it may be possible to adapt this technology to meet needs for miniature field portable analytical chemical instrumentation for water monitoring applications.

For these long duration missions, NASA is interested in replacing the iodine water treatment system with ionic silver. Although iodine treated water has been used successfully with the International Space Station, its use requires that the iodine be removed before being consumed by astronauts due to its adverse effects on the thyroid. For long duration exploration missions, minimal mass systems are desired that lessen logistical supply requirements for storing and distributing potable water. In particular, it is imperative that an effective biocide is used that prevents microbial growth, biofilm formation, and microbially induced corrosion in the water storage and distribution systems. To address these needs, Reactive Innovations, LLC proposes to develop an electrochemical silver ion generator that produces an effective biocide concentration throughout the water storage and distribution system. The generator and system control will also minimize spurious deposition of silver on the wetted components of the water system maintaining a viable biocide activity to prevent biofilm growth. Materials compatibility testing will be examined with the generator to assess long duration operation.","A potable water treatment process is needed to prevent microbial growth and biofilm formation in the water storage and distribution system for long duration missions. Silver ions have been proven by NASA to be effective for such microbial control, however, there remain significant challenges with the biocide delivery system and materials of construction that are compatible with silver. Our proposed process produces an effective delivery system with a control system that prevents silver deposition on the wetted materials of construction. This offers expanded degrees of freedom for designing the water system.",Silver ion water treatment systems have been used in commercial systems for treating potable water.

Condensing surfaces must be hydrophilic to control the condensate flow and ensure efficient operation, and biocidal to prevent growth of microbes and formation of biofilms on condensing surfaces.  Coatings must be extremely stable, adhere to the condensing surface, and maintain hydrophilic and biocidal properties for many years.  We propose to develop a zeolite coating system that incorporates two key innovations: (1) modifications to the coating chemistry to enable much longer life than prior coatings, and (2) an in situ cleaning process that can decontaminate the surface and renew hydrophilic properties.  In Phase I we will prove the feasibility of our approach by developing preliminary cleaning formulations, developing chemical analysis models to predict coating lifetime, producing trial coatings, and demonstrating coating performance and the effects of cleaning.  In Phase II we will scale up and refine the coating process, produce sample coupons and heat exchanger cores, and measure the coating performance after long-term exposure to prototypical environments.  We will also develop and demonstrate a coating regeneration process and associated hardware suitable for ground testing and eventual demonstration on the International Space Station (ISS).","The primary NASA application will be environmental control and life support (ECLS) systems on future manned exploration missions, including spacecraft and rovers designed for long missions that require active ECLS systems.  The coating technology will be equally applicable to any active life support system, including potential upgrades to the ECLS system on the International Space Station.  Implementation of our coating and renewal system on the ISS can potentially save large amounts of crew time and large costs associated with reapplying the existing hydrophilic coatings to the condensing heat exchangers.","The long-life, biocidal coating is potentially inexpensive and can be used to prevent microbe growth in condensing heat exchangers used for dehumidification in terrestrial HVAC systems.  Benefits would be enhanced component performance and improved air quality.  Another key market will be balance-of-plant equipment for terrestrial fuel cells, which will include water management components that will also require hydrophilic and antimicrobial coatings.

Systems ranging from military aircraft to computational platforms to photovoltaic (PV) power generation all generate unwanted heat and traditional methods for transporting and removing this heat are often heavy, cumbersome, power hungry, or lack adequate heat removal capacity.  Excess heat can result in reduced efficiency in PV systems, limit duty cycles for pulsed power applications, and ultimately cause failure of critical components if not managed properly.  Similar problematic scenarios exist for many power generation systems, high power radio frequency (RF) devices, portable electronics, and lasers, to name a few.

The analytical and experimental results demonstrate that the torso could be expanded to facilitate donning and doffing, and then contracted to match different wearer's body dimensions. Using the system of interconnected parallel manipulators, suit components can be accurately repositioned to different desired configurations. The demonstrated feasibility of the Morphing Upper Torso concept makes it an exciting candidate for inclusion in future EVA suit architectures.

RadFlexPro can be integrated into current space suit TMG designs and act as multifunctional layers, providing additional protection from micrometeoroids.  Current RadFlexPro designs have three layers. The outer layer serves as a first barrier to decelerate high speed and high energy particles: the following layer decelerate particles more, and the final layer protects from possible secondary radiation. It is proposed that RadFlexPro will significantly increase radiation protection without compromising bulk and mobility in a space suit. RadFlexPro is a composition of several materials and layers, with different properties selected to protect against various types of radiation. Compared to single-material shielding, such as Demron, the same mass of Graded-Z coating shows increased radiation opacity; as an alternative, a lower mass of graded z shielding can provide the same level of protection as a single material sheild. In a typical graded-Z shield, the high-Z layer effectively scatters protons and electrons. Because the matrix of RadFlexPro is adjustable, the coating can be sprayed on surfaces, rolled or laminated, and/or dipped into solution.  A matrix solution can be made with different viscosities and densities to suit several bonding techniques. Coated fabrics can in turn be cut out according to flat patterns and sewed with other pieces into a TMG configuration.  FFD has considerable experience and hardware to sew thick, heavy, rubbery materials effectively.","NASA currently operates EVA in LEO without any dedicated radiation protection.  Future missions for EVAs to environments like the moon, asteroids, and Mars require additional protection against radiation. RadFlexPro could serve as a method to further protect astronauts from harmful radiation for NASA.

The added radiation protection of an astronaut within a highly functional pressure garment would insure a significant advantage for NASA in future space missions.In addition, RadFlexPro is an adaptable coating strategy, which could be incorporated into vehicles for radiation protection for humans and sensitive computer equipment.  Its low mass relative to solid lead or aluminum shielding and flexible application options are an economical and efficient alternative to traditidonal vehicle shielding.","FFD has identified several potential Non-NASA commercial customers for RadFlexPro.

FFD has developed a flat patterned asymmetric shoulder joint for their current space suit pressure garment, with a natural position in human rest adduction, approximately -10 degrees.  In addition, this joint has a focused point of rotation, like the human shoulder. Their design reduces discomfort from gathering of fabric in the armpit, provides a large ROM, favorable torque, and allows for close tracking of natural human anthropometry.  In addition, FFD's elbow joint design show consistently high performance, in terms of ROM, torque, and operating pressure.This proposal also utilizes a unique approach to the pressure garment: the single layer integrated pressure garment joint as opposed to a traditional double layer bladder-restraint pressure garment.  FFD's pressure garments have a host of important advantages over double layer pressure garments, including a lower mass, increased ROM, decreased torque, a thinner wall, the reduction of suit layers, the elimination of  indexing, lower cost manufacturing, and flat-patterned ease of scaling and repeatability.   This proposal will develop two design iterations of FFD's single layer pressure garment arm, to include both the elbow flexion-extension joint and the shoulder ad-abduction joint.  The arms will be designed and tested for +8PSI operating pressure, to meet current ROM standards of NASA's pressure garments and test and increase FFD's technology cycling ability.  FFD aims to increase their TRL in this project from 4 to 6 through Phase II of this contract.","NASA currently operates EVA in LEO.

The added benefits in mobility of astronaut within a highly functional pressure garment would ensure a significant advantage for NASA in future space missions.  In addition, the proposed mass reduction in the pressure garment is highly desirable for several reasons, including launch weight and overall suit mass during EVA.  FFD's pressure garment technology is comparatively very inexpensive to manufacture, easier to maintain, and easier to scale than many advanced concept space suit equivalents.  Finally, the pressure garment components developed here could have a crossover interest in IVA space suit design, as they are soft, flat, and stowable.","FFD has identified several potential Non-NASA commercial customers for their pressure garments, including their advanced arms.

There are several manned space access companies currently in the market for IVA suits beyond these providers, in the Commercial Crew Program of NASA and privately/suborbitally.In 2012, FFD was contracted to construct IVA safety garments for Zero2Infinity, a high altitude balloon company.  We plan supply our first production IVA suits to customers by January 2013, and expect testing and validation in 2013.  FFD sees a significant market in commercial IVA space suits in the near future.The arm joints developed under this contract have applications for commercial IVA suits.  Our designs have unprecedented performance for IVA garments with a high operating pressure, large ROM, low torque, and low mass.  Importantly, the garments are relatively inexpensive to produce and can be easily sized because they are flat patterned.   Our target market price for an IVA pressure garment is $50,000.This SBIR will provide valuable testing and validation to allow FFD to flight certify their material concepts and designs.  We see the testing and proof in flight certification as a significant hurdle to market commercialization for our product, and one that can be greatly assisted by this proposal.","Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Polymers; Protective Clothing/Space Suits/Breathing Apparatus; Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Textiles"

This helmet architecture presents the end user with a myriad of positive attributes, including a large field of view, enhanced CO2 washout and improved component durability/operational life. The 13"" Dome Helmet architecture has proven these attributes via the NASA MK-III and Z-1 advanced EVA spacesuit test beds. Air-Lock's 2012 SBIR proposal advances the 13"" Dome Helmet from NASA prototype/test bed to EVA Acceptability for Use by enhancing the design with a fully functional Extravehicular Visor Assembly (EVVA).Phase I will see Air-Lock engineers leverage current Helmet/EVVA technologies, infuse the design with lessons learned from the EMU Program and implement the resultant design into a 13"" hemispherical helmet architecture; heretofore referred to as the Advanced Extravehicular Helmet Assembly (AEHA). In addition to the design facet of the Phase I task, Air-Lock engineers will develop a Verification and Validation Test Plan (V&V) based on current EMU S/AD and CARD requirements along with higher Advanced EVA operating pressures (8.0 psi). This test plan will lay the foundation for Phase 2 Acceptability for Use testing to facilitate the use of the AEHA aboard the International Space Station in support of NASA's planned 2017 ISS Advanced Spacesuit Demonstration Test.","The resultant product from this SBIR task will be a validated EVA Helmet. NASA will be able to utilize this component for government spacesuits requiring EVA Helmets. In addition to the end product, manufacturing advances will be made in the forming and coating of large hemispherical polycarbonate domes. This process can be utilized for windows on pressurized space structures such as rovers, habitats, space stations, etc. Long duration missions such as planetary exploration will utilize pressurized habitats and structures that allow crewmembers to operate in a shirtsleeve environment. Windows will need to be treated with radiation attenuating coatings to prevent cumulative exposure to harmful radiation. This coating will be shown to be capable of being applied to large hemispherical surfaces during this SBIR.","Similar to the NASA commercial application, it is believed the coating of windows with the AEHA Protective Visor coating will have merit in commercial space activities. The fabrication process developed in this SBIR will yield larger, stress concentration free, optical structures capable of providing radiation protection, impact protection and pressure retention. These optical structures can aid long duration pressurized commercial space structures (rovers, space stations, habitats); allowing habitants to operate in a shirtsleeve environment for long durations safely and efficiently without fear of cumulative radiation exposure.","Coatings/Surface Treatments; Composites; Filtering; Isolation/Protection/Radiation Shielding (see also Mechanical Systems); Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Metallics; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Processing Methods; Project Management; Protective Clothing/Space Suits/Breathing Apparatus; Prototyping; Quality/Reliability"

This approach incorporates miniature full-color laser light sources and low-profile narrowband reflective, see-through toroid-shaped optics, which enable us to meet NASA EVA requirements for displays that are completely decoupled from the user's head and achieving full sunlight readability with automated rapid ambient light response. The Pro/Ref-HUD offers full-color, high-resolution collimated images, with large fields of view, highly suited to the space and weight constraints inside an astronaut's suit. POC plans to demonstrate the feasibility of the Pro/Ref-HUD system by building and testing a preliminary prototype to TRL-4 by the end of Phase I. POC plans to develop in Phase II a fully functional prototype to demonstrate sunlight readability and SXGA  resolution, investigate thermal and radiation issues, and analyze ignition safety due to a 100% oxygen operating environment and vacuum and extreme temperature storage environments. The results demonstrated will offer NASA capabilities to perform EVAs with heads-up displays internal to the helmet to improve crew safety and comfort and prevent misalignment of the display.","The Pro/Ref-HUD technology will provide new capabilities for astronauts during EVA with a see-through display system that allows them to monitor the conditions around them while being provided visual instructions and direction in a hands-free format. This will allow astronauts to be more productive and take on less risk, and eventually translate to boresighted overlays for augmented-reality-based information. Applications include space walks on the International Space Station (ISS) where navigating the structure can be completed with maps and repairs completed with heads-up manuals.  Harsh-environment training can also be completed with the HUD by providing assistance and navigation for improved safety such as dealing with Martian dust storms and facilitating asteroid landings.","We anticipate widespread appeal of the Pro/Ref-HUD technology for such entertainment industry applications as gaming HUDs, gaming flight simulators, and other immersive and augmented display systems, including medical and CAD/CAE 3D image displays, virtual-reality displays for endoscopy/laparoscopy, and displays for environmentally hazardous professions such as bomb disposal and hazmat clean up.

Flexible substrate arrays can have higher specific power (W/kg) and specific volume (kW/m3) than conventional arrays. Typical designs for flexible substrate arrays require a stiff boom mechanism to deploy the array and provide the deployed structure.  Graphite composite slit-tube booms are thermally stable and can enable next-generation flexible arrays by improving mass, volume, and cost. CTD has developed and demonstrated a 5cm diameter graphite composite slit-tube boom and canister designed for a 23m tether-stiffened solar array. The Stable Tubular Extendible Lock-Out Composite (STELOC) boom proposed here will feature two innovations to the composite slit-tube design that enhance stiffness. Slit-Lock interlocks the edges of the slit and Root-Lock eliminates the open section at the root of the boom when fully deployed. Combined, these innovations enable a 10cm STELOC boom that is much simpler, lighter, and stiffer than a 25cm diameter coilable longeron boom. This Phase I program will demonstrate a full length, 10cm STELOC boom including all innovative features to enhance stiffness. The program will also develop a conceptual design that meets all boom requirements provided by an identified spacecraft prime contractor for their flexible substrate array.","Advancement of large deployable arrays is a critical requirement listed in NASA's technology roadmap. Power systems compromise nearly 30% of a spacecraft's mass on average, thus improvements in specific power (W/kg) will enable either a reduction in spacecraft mass or an increase in capabilities. Advanced arrays are required to enable scaling to larger array system up to 300 kW for interplanetary missions using solar electric power (SEP). A highly capable and inexpensive boom will enable these large, flexible substrate arrays.","Near term Air Force satellite missions require more capable solar arrays with more total power on the same platforms.

More powerful arrays must have an improved power to weight ratio, decreased stowage volume and increased deployed stiffness which are all enabled by the STELOC boom. Next-generation solar arrays are also intended for use on commercial geostationary satellites.

NanoSonic proposes to produce a triply redundant bladder assembly comprised of several layers of TR™ films bonded with our low areal density self-healing foam, for a total areal density of less than 6 oz/yd2.  To substantiate long-term use in space, the down-selected, puncture resistant assemblies shall be exposed to gamma, electron, and heavy ions at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory via our partner, Colorado State University (CSU).  Low air permeability and flammability resistance would be verified after simulated Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR) exposure and cryogenic flex testing.  NanoSonic has teamed with seaming and space systems experts who will conduct leak and adhesion testing, and assist with habitat construction.  In support of NASA's goals for a robust space exploration program, it is anticipated that NanoSonic's lightweight, low permeable bladders shall enable space inflatable modules that exhibit long-term, 5 year, radiation resistance upon inflation, minimize launch mass, repair/maintenance, size and costs.","NanoSonic's Thoraeus Rubber™ materials will be primarily developed as the bladder assembly for inflatable, life-critical, NASA space habitats.

The use of analysis to drive design from an early stage is critical to their success, yet conflicting design requirements and demanding space constraints make traditional design/build/test methods challenging and expensive. The proposed SBIR program focuses on overcoming this through the development of a user-friendly multi-disciplinary design and analysis software toolkit that can rapidly perform parametric studies and design optimization of solar array concepts. The software package will provide a graphical user interface and underlying analysis procedures to evaluate critical performance metrics (e.g. deployment, packaging efficiency, strength, stiffness, mass, etc.), while eliminating the unnecessary pre-processing and computational overhead associated with current approaches. The user will be able to interactively investigate effects of design parameter changes (e.g. array geometry, size, number of panels/sections, joint properties, control system parameters) on critical performance metrics and analysis results. Analysis capabilities will include flexible multi-body dynamics, array deployment, loading due to thrust, and modal analysis. Parametric study and design optimization capabilities will also be key features of the tool. Model creation will be simplified through the use of an extensible, hierarchical blockset solution and a library of blocks specific to deployable solar array analysis. The Phase I effort will focus on developing accurate analysis capabilities, a parametric study workflow, and the GUI for controlling them and interpreting results. Phase II will incorporate additional analysis types (e.g. thermal, uncertainty propagation, sensitivity analysis, etc.) as well as a design optimization framework.","The most immediate opportunity for the tools that will be developed under this SBIR is to assist NASA and its contractors in performing design trade studies of large mass-efficient deployable solar array systems. The tools will allow rapid trade studies of these systems to be carried out so that designs can be optimized for critical performance requirements such as deployment reliability, stiffness, strength, control, etc. The tools can also be easily extended and/or customized to allow design and analysis of other hardware of interest to NASA, including lightweight booms, frames, and expandable/inflatable structures.

The approach, which is a based on selective reinforcement, is a change in the basic design philosophy and will result in the development of a hybrid material form.  The selective reinforcement approach allows the structural design requirements to define the material form.  This is the reverse of the typical development flow path used for building structures.  This backward path results in more efficient material forms that are of greater value to structural engineers.  Specifically, the proposed effort will combine a metal matrix composite (MMC) prepreg tape feedstock with an advanced fiber placement process.  The combination of these technologies will lead to enhanced metallic structures through selective reinforcement (SR), which consists of adding a high-performance material to structures to achieve local stiffening and strengthening.","The proposed effort has broad applications across many NASA missions.  Stiffened structures exist in launch vehicles, especially in their tank structures.  Tanks have to withstand high stress during launch and provide stability at cryogenic temperatures.  Essentially, any structure that is part of a NASA mission could benefit from new, lightweight structural components.  These include: future launch vehicle, crew vehicle, surface habitats, robotic explorers or cryogenic tank structures.","Non-NASA applications include aircraft such as the F-35, CH53-K, V-22, ground combat vehicles, and aluminum ship designs.  Commercial aircraft such as the Boeing 777, Airbus A-380, and Airbus A340-600 could also benefit by adding MMC SR concepts.  Applications in the automotive market include aluminum and magnesium castings, flywheels for hybrid vehicles, liners for lightweight composite tanks used on alternative fuel vehicles, and other types of storage tanks.  Incorporation into golf club shafts, tennis rackets, and bicycle frames for the sporting goods market are also possible.","Composites; In Situ Manufacturing; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Metallics; Processing Methods; Structures"

The team will work with NASA to scope a 'generic' opening in an aerospace aluminum structure. UAM will be used to perform two reinforcing activities. Firstly, UAM will be used to thicken the cross section of the aluminum component in a selective manner. This will provide additional stiffness through geometric effects without starting with a large billet of material. Secondly, UAM will be used to embed reinforcing materials (such as SiC fibers, steel wire, carbon fiber) in and around the opening to create a true MMC in the region(s) around the opening. Smalll channels will be machined to receive wire reinforcements. UAM will be used to create an embedded layered structure of embedded fiber around the opening.

While there is an increasing need for metal-based AM processes, only a few companies have entered into this field because of the technology barriers. The patented UAM process is a metals-based AM technology that has the potential to overcome several of these limitations because it relies on a low-temperature, solid-state welding.

Both of these processing methodologies yield parts with inferior mechanical and physical properties as compared to wrought metal of the same composition.  Additionally, the production rates for even the fastest processes are relatively low (~40 lbs/hr for Ti) and the part envelopes are limited to a few cubic feet.  Aeroprobe proposes a highly scalable process for additive manufacturing of wrought metal structures based on their additive friction stir (AFS) process which provides high-strength coatings and welds (strengths comparable to the base metal UTS) while retaining a wrought microstructure.  AFS has successfully deposited materials ranging from light metals, such as Al and Mg alloys, to high-temperature metals, such as Inconel 625 and oxide dispersion strengthened steels.  Initial additive manufacturing demonstrations with AFS were highly successful and produced fully dense structures with wrought mechanical properties.  The overall objective of this project is to further develop AFS technology into an additive manufacturing process to enable full-density, near net-shape fabrication of airframe structures.  An initial process-structure-property relationship study will be conducted to demonstrate the physical and mechanical properties achievable in Al alloys via AFS.  Finally, Aeroprobe will demonstrate the feasibility of AFS to produce complex 3D structures by fabricating an aluminum demonstration part of a relevant geometry.","Additive manufacturing via AFS has the potential to lower the cost and improve the performance of NASA airframes and spacecraft.  Additive manufacturing via AFS also offers the potential to locally control the composition of a component, thus allowing for minimization of stress concentrations which can drive materials selection and design in fatigue-driven applications such as airframes.  Lowering the buy-to-fly ratio is often attributed to subtractive manufacturing of webbed and ribbed components to reduce the structural weight while maintaining required stiffness.  Manufacturing such components using additive manufacturing could drastically reduce extensive machining, excessive materials, the associated energy, and custom tooling costs. Using AFS to additively manufacture webbed and ribbed components on NASA airframes has the potential reduce total airframe cost through the mechanism mentioned above and with the added benefit having wrought material properties and performance.","The primary applications for early adoption of AFS are high-value propositions for which AFS enables some performance that is not achievable by traditional processing methods.  One of the key benefits of AFS is that consolidation and deposition occur in the solid-state, thus highly engineered microstructures can be retained throughout processing.  For, example AFS is being applied to large-plate and component manufacturing using ultra-fine-grained (UFG) Mg.  Fabrication of UFG Mg components at a large-scale is currently not feasible and AFS is proving to make this possible.  AFS is also being applied to coating and part fabrication using oxide dispersion strengthened alloys for fast-reactor nuclear power generation.  Other commercial applications of AFS under development include coating of shaft journals for use in extreme wear and corrosion applications.","Composites; In Situ Manufacturing; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Metallics"

Using automated translation and Constraint Satisfaction Problem generation technologies developed on previous projects, ConCEPT will assist users in identifying conflicts and inconsistencies in procedures as they are developed.  The user edits a procedure in PrIDE, using procedure steps that have been annotated with information about resources and state changes.  Configuration information, current state, and flight rules are stored in and obtained from the System Description, an existing component of PrIDE.  As the procedure is being developed, ConCEPT automatically and continuously gathers appropriate constraints from the domain model and flight rules, translates them into a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) which is then submitted to a CSP solver, which alerts the user to any violated constraints.

Stochastic optimization is combined with randomized simulation to bound statistical measures of performance and convey the parameters giving the extreme scenarios.  It also provides 3D immersive presentation of those scenarios. The act of performing multiple simulation runs in real time is enabled by the fast simulation capability provided by Energid Technologies' existing software combined with the development of new algorithms and software. The new algorithms cover path planning, scene rendering, sensor modeling, and robot-terrain interaction modeling.  In the new software, automatic path planning is calculated using a combination of static and dynamic techniques.  Scene rendering for sensor modeling is implemented using fast ray tracing for low-update-rate sensors and ray-tracing-validated rasterization for fast-update-rate sensors.  Robot-terrain interaction is calculated through particle simulations implemented on graphics cards.  For maximum performance, the new software allows distribution of randomized simulation runs over multiple networked PCs and cloud-based clusters.  This combination of fast algorithms and statistical optimization offers a tool that provides new engineering insights and data. The software will be demonstrated on the example mission of searching for ice near near the southern lunar pole, giving evidence of the ability of the tool to support challenging relevant missions.",The tool Energid proposes will reduce cost and improve schedule in NASA's lunar and planetary missions through digital testing early in a project.

During operations, it is possible for unexpected events and anomalies to disrupt the mission schedule, and in the case of critical faults, even threaten the health and safety of the spacecraft.  Historically, it has been the responsibility of the mission operations team on the ground to issue command sequences and monitor spacecraft health and status to ensure that long-term science, engineering, and safety goals are achieved. Red Canyon Software is building upon previous designs for on-board, layered autonomous software flight systems employing continuous planning and command sequencing. The proposed innovation increases the robustness of on-board autonomy for space vehicle operation, while at the same time offers reductions in mission development costs by leveraging off of newer flight proven software technologies.  Also, developing, verifying, and validating spacecraft activity and constraint models for use with model-based autonomous planners and reactive sequencers are difficult and complex activities.  For robust, on-board autonomous systems with multiple layers of software performing varying levels of constraint checking prior to activity planning and command sequencing, more than one layer will need to be configured with the same model constraints.  To reduce the cost and risk of model development and use, a single, shared spacecraft domain model representation is proposed, along with development of a graphical editor that allows system engineers to easily encode domain information and that uses verification rules to detect inconsistencies or errors.","Similarly, tele-robotics on distant planets, underwater, or on different continents require autonomous real-time integration with the planning software that is driving the vehicle.

To address this need, GoofyFoot Labs proposes the E2-AMP FPGA, a radiation hardened, high performance, low power AMP FPGA capable of operating reliably over wide temperature ranges and rapid thermal changes.  The 150-nm E2-AMP FPGA achieves up to 790-MHz peak performance while consuming 7x less power than conventional, commercial counterparts, implementing TMR.  The E2-AMP FPGA provides exceptional protection from SEUs, SETs, SEL, and high TID while maintaining high performance and low power levels that exceed even today's highest performing, commercial FPGAs.  The E2-AMP FPGA's reconfigurability enables last-minute, no-cost design changes and upgrades even after launch, greatly enhancing mission profile while reducing mission cost and risk.  Unlike any other FPGA, rad hard or unhardened, the E2-AMP FPGA can operate reliably at extreme hot and cold temperatures and can also seamlessly tolerate rapid thermal changes without sacrificing performance and without significant designer effort.  To handle extreme temperatures, conventional ICs are protected via onboard heat shields or warm boxes to maintain ambient temperatures to a much smaller range. This equipment increases the SwaP of the system and also degrades system reliability. The E2-AMP FPGA will operate correctly across a large temperature range reducing the amount of required thermal regulation.  Moreover, we will enhance the E2-AMP FPGA's native low power consumption through the incorporation of a number of power savings techniques.  With the E2-AMP FPGA, designers of space-based or high-altitude systems operating in hostile radiation environments and at extreme temperatures can reduce system SWaP, while adding flexibility, capability, and robustness to any system.","Autonomous Landing Systems, Mars Science Lab Instrumentation, Tele-robotics, Surface Mobility, Nuclear Systems, Robotic Satellite Servicing, In-Space propulsion, Deep Space X-Ray Navigation and Communication, Deep Space Optical Communications, Mars Sample Return, Europa Orbiter, Near Earth Objects and Primitive Body Missions, Space Launch System, Extra-Vehicular Activity Suits","space-based radar, military space satellites, special-purpose C4ISR satellites launched by intelligence organizations, UAVs, ruggedized airborne platforms, commercial and military aircraft, deep-well probes for oil and gas exploration, mining probes, safety-critical terrestrial applications such as bank servers, telecommunication servers","Ad-Hoc Networks (see also Sensors); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Image Processing; Ionizing Radiation; Perception/Vision; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems); Telemetry (see also Control & Monitoring)"

Early investigations have also shown that memristors have high radiation hardness. In this SBIR, CFDRC and Arizona State University propose to develop, characterize, and demonstrate novel, memristor-based, radiation-hardened NVM for NASA space applications. In Phase I we will: 1) Fabricate state-of-the-art Chalcogenide Glass (ChG) memristors based on the CBRAM technology; 2) Examine their wide temperature performance (-230 to +130  deg.C) via thermal experiments; and 3) Add new models to CFDRC's NanoTCAD Mixed-Mode simulator for accurate physics-based simulation of memristors. The Phase I effort will evaluate suitability of ChG memristors for extreme temperature applications. In Phase II, we will extend our scope to include wide-temperature investigation of the competing transition-metal-oxide (TMO, e.g., TiO2) memristor technology. For both ChG and TMO, we will then perform irradiation testing and down-select the technology with the best extreme environment (radiation + temperature) performance. Subsequently, we will generate wide-temperature, radiation-enabled, device physics and compact models for the memristors, develop designs for memristor-based NVM, and perform mixed-mode simulations to determine their radiation and thermal response. These results, and physics-based understanding of device response, will be used to develop an NVM prototype that will be tested and demonstrated for NASA space applications.","Exploration flight projects, robotic precursors, and technology demonstrators that are designed to operate beyond low-earth orbit (LEO) require avionic systems, components, and controllers that are capable of enduring the extreme temperature and radiation environments of deep space, the lunar surface, and the Martian surface.

The generated compact models will also be a significant aid for circuit design/analysis.

Therefore, one center of focus for NASA is to have robots increasingly perform these tasks to give the crew more time flexibility. Robots are also employed with tasks that are too dangerous for humans or when movement could affect the results and success of a task. The following proposal applies nanoGrip's expertise in design, fabrication, and characterization of gecko-inspired microfiber adhesives to produce a new generation of materials that increases the dexterity of these robots' manipulators so that they can perform a larger variety of manipulation tasks with higher precision. In this proposal, an emphasis will be placed on manipulating objects that are either small, delicate, or with a difficult to grip form factor where the current state of the art in manipulation may struggle. Microfiber adhesive materials developed during this project will be evaluated for their shear strength in contact with systems and materials which may be encountered by the Robonaut 2 (R2) manipulator on the International Space Station, for their ability to stick and unstick reliably through pick and place experiments, and for their ability to perform manipulation tasks when incorporated onto a robotic manipulator. Proof of concept robotic manipulation during these studies will be performed in collaboration with our consulting partner on Carnegie Mellon University's (CMU) Robotics Institute's bimanual dexterous manipulation robot. Additionally, prototypes will be delivered to NASA for qualitative or quantitative evaluation. At NASA's discretion, testing may be performed at the Johnson Space Center's Dextrous Robotics Lab for material evaluation on the ground-based R2 manipulator.","With the success of the proposed research and subsequent development during a Phase II project, these materials will be ready to be commercialized as adhesive finger pads or gloves for use on NASA's robotic manipulator fleet. Additional applications for these materials within NASA include temporary anchoring materials for broad range of space applications. This list may include mounting sensors, instruments, tools, tablet computers, checklists, flexible videoscopes, and so on to the International Space Station, inflatable space habitats, or other vessels. Additionally, they may be used on removable gecko-inspired adhesive slippers or knee pads to provide astronaut anchoring, or similar devices to provide anchoring for the R2 manipulator to free these actors to perform two-handed tasks in zero gravity environments.","This work also has broader implications in other government agencies such as the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security, where robots are commonly used to perform tasks such as bomb diffusion or the handling and detection of toxic substances. These areas will benefit from the findings in the Phase I research by enabling similar robots to have more grasping dexterity essential for these dangerous situations.Additionally, there will be commercial applications of the findings of this research for industrial manufacturing robotic manipulators, for example for automotive, consumer electronic, or microprocessor assembly processes where delicate materials may need to be handled in a precise manner.The materials developed in this Phase I research will also directly be valuable to our existing potential commercial clients in the consumer product, apparel, packaging, manufacturing, and medical equipment markets.","Characterization; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Lifetime Testing; Man-Machine Interaction; Material Handing & Packaging; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Nanomaterials; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Polymers; Processing Methods; Prototyping; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Structures; Tribology"

In-situ resources will provide fuel to support far-reaching exploration and enable commercial endeavors. While satellite data supports presence of polar ice, driving and drilling must confirm presence, determine composition, and measure distribution. Ice exists primarily in the dark and cold of polar craters. Current planetary rover planning technologies are not designed for these environments and have avoided them altogether, operating only in mid-latitudes.  The proposed research innovates an Earth-based, resource-aware path planner for a polar prospecting rover. The proposed planner models progress toward the goal while considering resource costs inherent in that progress, generates and explores the space of possible paths, then transmits a set of low-cost viable paths to goal to the rover.  The set of viable paths then resides on the rover to inform limited re-planning if the rover encounters a hazard during traverse, even during communications dropout. The planner considers all of the impacts on polar rover operation – light angles that change over time, thermal operating window, sun angles and blinding light, and communications-shadowed regions. Each of these impacts affects one of the rover's resources – where it can go, what it can see, how cold it can get, how much battery charge remains, and whether it can communicate with its operator.Design of the proposed planner will build on pioneering research at Carnegie Mellon that developed TEMPEST, a temporal-aware, mission-based planner that maximized battery power over a traverse. It was demonstrated using the Hyperion rover, achieving a sun-synchronous traverse of Haughton Crater. The polar environment is both adversarial and unpredictable, and the proposed planner will extend the TEMPEST to account for the unique challenges of navigating on the poles of planetary bodies and add nondeterministic planning.","NASA's Technology Roadmap TA04, Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems, identifies autonomous navigation as one of three impact areas for technology development. The proposed work enhances development of autonomous navigation by building on the successes of the Mars Science Laboratory and other rovers' use of locally acquired data to refine and potentially modify Earth-generated plans without human intervention or approval. By adjusting relative parameters in the planning model, Earth-based controllers can set the bounds on local authority, response, and operational capabilities while maximizing operational advantages of locally-centered decision making. Phase II results will advance technologies to TRL 5, ready for assimilation into NASA missions.Existing NASA collaborations will drive infusion of the developed technologies into future missions. Technical Advisor William ""Red"" Whittaker collaborates deeply with NASA's autonomy experts. Astrobotic intends to produce lunar and planetary rovers encompassing these technologies as build-to-order rovers or as technology licenses. Active Astrobotic contracts with NASA are defining rover missions to carry the RESOLVE payload, excavate on the Moon, and provide data from a lunar mission. Relationships curated through these contracts provide additional paths for technology infusion, and results will be promoted through all NASA partnerships and collaborations.","Resource-aware planning provides significant advances over state-of-art autonomous navigation, mapping, and localization for terrestrial applications. The need for low cost, computationally inexpensive, and easy to integrate autonomous navigation and mapping applies broadly to terrestrial applications particularly those that are GPS-denied. Potential applications include driverless cars, search and rescue, mining, military UGVs and UAVs, and agriculture.Vision-guided UAVs offer a particularly good fit for resource-constrained planning. As small UAVs become more common for surveillance and scouting, the need to reduce operator load will become paramount. With a wide array of sensor suites producing dense data sets, enabling vehicles to make decisions on-board within operator-defined bounds allows an operator to concentrate on high-level mission objectives rather than low-level vehicle operations. The proposed work is particularly suited to terrestrial applications where only low-fidelity data is available for initial planning; by creating a provisional plan to be optimized by future high-fidelity measurements, the overall mission objective can be completed with an minimum of waste. The result is an optimized use of limited resources, including overhead time and ground-based manpower.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Characterization; Man-Machine Interaction; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Navigation & Guidance; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Simulation & Modeling; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)"

The drill uses a novel method of core or powder acquisition. The core acquisition bit can be used for either a rock core, icy-soil or loose regolith acquisition. The continued development of robust sample acquisition and handling tools is of critical importance to future robotic and human missions to Mars, the Moon, Asteroids, and other planetary bodies. For these missions, consolidated or unconsolidated core samples (as opposed to, say, scooped regolith or collected drill cuttings) are of particular interest.","Future robotic astrobiology and geology missions such as Mars Sample Return, Venus In Situ Explorer, Comet Sample Return, South Pole Aitken Basin Sample Return missions will benefit greatly from the ability to produce and capture rock and regolith cores, using a compact, low mass, low power device, and hermetically seal the samples in dedicated containers. A system utilizing a surface drill and a suite of bits for different applications could be deployed during lunar and asteroid sortie missions by astronauts (i.e., hand held coring drill) since it is more manageable to bring small cores back as opposed to large rocks.","Scientists often use small drills to acquire core samples for the study of everything from geological classification to ocean drilling and surveying. Traditionally, petroleum engineers will use large cores to extract information about boundaries between sandstone, limestone, and shale. This process is time consuming so smaller cores are sometimes taken. This method of sampling is called sidewall coring and provides more information to the petroleum engineer than simply logged data. Scientists studying earthquake mechanics could also benefit in a similar fashion. Automation of this process would save time and money; enabling the science goals of the research with reduced schedule and budget risk/impact. The arm-deployed coring tool also has applications in the study of terrestrial biology, such as coring into rocks in the Arctic and Antarctic, among other desirable locations.",Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors)

Novel linear drive eddy current methods are proposed for NDE of carbon-based TPS materials, such as three dimensional woven fiber composites and felts. Using a combination of physics-based models, multivariate inverse methods, high resolution imaging, and innovative sensor array constructs the developed methods will independently monitor the material characteristics of interest.  In Phase I, the focus is on enhancing and adapting methods developed for carbon-based composite structures and laminates and demonstrating feasibility of these enhanced methods for three-dimensional woven composites and felts.   JENTEK's physics-based methods for diagnostics of layered media using MWM-Array technologies, including an eddy current micromechanical model extension for composites, have been demonstrated for condition stress and temperature monitoring.  MWM-Arrays have a linear drive that permits both scanning type imaging and permanent installation for  monitoring of anisotropic properties, temperature, and stresses at multiple depths.  The projected depth of the magnetic field into the test material can be adjusted through the sensor dimensions and excitation frequencies; this enables inspection of materials more than 1.0-in. thick and supports measuring far-side surface recession in ablator materials.  JENTEK delivered the MWM-Array solution used by NASA KSC on the Space Shuttle Leading Edge to detect damage of the Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) thermal protection tiles; thus JENTEK is well-positioned to deliver a practical TPS NDE solution.","If the program is successful, it will demonstrate the capability of the MWM-Array technology to measure relevant material properties and structural damage in the advanced materials in spacecraft thermal protection systems.  This type of analysis tool for detection of damage may be useful for the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPV's), exhaust nozzles, and other critical composite structures.  NASA customers that may benefit from these analysis tools include the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) spacecraft manufacturers and other interplanetary programs such as science exploration mission vehicles and human crew vehicles.","There are numerous applications in which NDE measurement and analysis tools are needed to verify design requirements of advanced composites, such as three-dimensional woven materials.  These include applications for commercial aircraft, wind turbines, land vehicles and composite repairs for pipelines and structures.  Examples are inspection of commercial jet engine blades and fuselage components, wind turbine blades, land vehicle frames and liquid natural gas fuel pressure vessels and other structures where proper woven fiber orientation and defect free structures are critical for strength and fatigue life.

Sensors that can operate at temperatures well above 1273 K are needed to provide reliable validation data for TPS modeling and design tools.We propose to develop a low-intrusive fiber-optical pyrometer capable of measuring temperature profiles within an ablating thermal protection system (TPS).  In this concept a bundle of parallel sapphire fibers is embedded in a step-wise manner into a multilayered ""plug"" of TPS material.   The sensing tip of each fiber consists of a metallic coating, forming an isothermal cavity; graybody emission from this cavity is transmitted through the fiber to a fiber-optic multiplexer, and thence to a compact near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer.   By fitting the thermal spectrum from the shortest fiber to a Planck distribution (adjusted to account for spectral absorption in the sapphire fiber), a cold-side temperature can be inferred first.  The next longest fiber can use this temperature to estimate the distorting effects of self-emission in the heated fiber.  Sequential evaluation of fiber tip temperatures at known locations along the bundle will allow effective estimation of temperature gradient and subsequent calculation of heat flux.The proposed fiber-optic sensors are thermally and physically robust, lightweight, electrically passive, and immune to electromagnetic and radio-frequency interference.  Additionally, our proposed fiber-optic pyrometer is optimized for high temperatures.  As the TPS-embedded sensing tip temperature increases, the wavelength peak for the thermal emission spectrum moves from 2634 nm (at 1000 K) to 1260 nm (at the sapphire melting point of 2300 K), while the integrated spectral intensity increases as the 4th power of the temperature.  Both effects improve the pyrometer signal-to-noise ratio.","Heat shield technology is a critical component for re-entry and hypersonic vehicles  The next generation of crew reentry vehicles being designed by NASA will require more advanced Thermal Protection System (TPS) designs than the conservative approaches currently used.  While new TPS materials are under development, a key difficulty is the ability to predict and diagnose TPS materials with instrumentation capable of surviving the reentry environment","EDA's plan to pursue this technology beyond Phase-II is to develop production of flight hardware for DoD, NASA, and privately funded vehicles.  Boeing has also expressed significant interest in transitioning our technology into their thermal protection systems as part of an integrated vehicle health monitoring system.  As private sector space ventures continue to blossom, there will be significant opportunities for commercialization.  This technology also has derivative terrestrial applications in high temperature industrial furnaces such as for cement manufacturing where temperatures in the Kiln can get up to 1450 Celsius and careful monitoring of temperature is critical.The target market for this technology is focused in re-entry vehicles but has secondary markets in any company that manufactures hypersonic vehicles as well as terrestrial applications in high power plasma processing, energy creation systems and industrial furnaces.  Of particular note, the technology is of significant importance to DoD for terrestrial intercontinental hypersonic weapons systems. EDA expects to work closely with these agencies and their prime contractors to develop the fiber optic pyrometer system to provide mission critical capability.","Diagnostics/Prognostics; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Infrared; Optical; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Thermal"

Both of these programs rely on the use of 3D woven carbon fiber preforms.  Therefore, there is a need to be able to predict the properties and performance of a woven material.  Validation of predictive modeling tools would allow for the use of these tools to design and optimize the 3D weaves, significantly reducing the cost of fabrication and testing of a variety of configurations. While there are proven tools for the prediction of laminate composite properties, textile composites are relatively new materials and much less effort has been focused on modeling this class of materials. Materials Research & Design (MR&D) has experience in working with and designing 3D woven preforms for use in composite material reinforcement and has developed a suite of analytical tools to define the detailed geometry of 3D woven preforms for use in calculating material properties.  However, these tools currently do not have the capability to predict material strengths.  Within the proposed Phase I effort, MR&D will enhance the existing tool by incorporating the ability to calculate material strengths of 3D weaves.  Strength predictions will be made for two different 3D woven hybrid preform reinforced phenolic panels and compared to measured test data for validation.","The successful completion of the Phase I program would directly benefit the Adaptable, Deployable Entry and Placement Technology (ADEPT) program as well as the Woven TPS program, both of which are currently focused on the use of 3D weaves in ablative TPS.  The ability of a predictive tool to generate material properties and strengths for a variety of 3D weaves would allow for the evaluation of multiple design configurations and fiber types to be evaluated in a much more efficient and cost effective manner than having to fabricate and test panels to generate data to be used for downselection of the best candidate designs.","In addition to the potential NASA applications, there is also potential for applications within the Department of Defense (DoD).  The use of 3D woven preforms in ballistic armor applications creates a need for design and predictive modeling capabilities of these materials as well.There would also be potential for applications from the weavers themselves.

The two-piece structure consisted of an ablative-filled foam front surface backed by Ultramet's previously established and highly insulating aerogel-filled foam. Arcjet testing was performed at NASA Ames Research Center to heat flux levels exceeding 1000 W/cm2, with the results showing a significantly reduced ablation rate compared to conventional chopped fiber ablators, and ablation behavior comparable to FM5055 at just one-third the density. It is apparent that the foam helps retain the char layer by physical reinforcement and/or that the network of interconnected passages allows pyrolysis gases to escape with less disruption of the char layer. In this project, Ultramet will team with ARA Ablatives for ablative infiltration of Ultramet foams and Materials Research and Design for ablation analysis, to continue optimization of foam-reinforced ablatives by focusing on two primary areas. The ablator formulation infiltrated into the foam will be modified to maximize heat flux capability consistent with NASA Earth return requirements (1500-2500 W/cm2), and a single-piece foam TPS structure will be developed rather than separate ablative- and aerogel-filled foam sections.

Such a goal requires an innovative solution to the vehicle's entry, decent and landing system (EDL). In order to address this goal,NASA has recently invested in the development of low ballistic coefficient aeroshell technology concepts which typically consist of a flexible 3D woven carbon cloth that can be stowed during flight and deployed to serve as a semi-rigid aeroshell on atmospheric entry. The ability of individual groups of fibers within yarn bundles to undulate in multiple orientations relative to the major axis of the yarn bundle results in full anisotropy for the 3D woven preforms. In addition to adding more complexity to the accompanying analytical models, the testing of such materials is also complicated as compared to isotropic and transversely orthotropic materials.  Within the proposed Phase I effort, Materials Research & Design will develop test methods for the materials characterization of a hybrid, woven 3D fabric for use in a flexible TPS application. The program willinvolve analytical, fabrication and experimental tasks to achieve the overall program goal of maturing technologies for advanced EDL systems. A few select tests will be performed at Southern Research Institute with strain data being captured for use in the anisotropic compliance matrix calculations. Finite element simulations, using a homogeneous representation of the anisotropic material, will be used to simulate each test and aide in the design of test specimens sufficient to generate measurable strain levels while simultaneously allowing the anisotropic material to deform naturally.","The successful completion of the Phase I program would directly benefit an existing, on-going NASA programs which incorporate flexible TPS designs: the Adaptable, Deployable Entry and Placement Technology (ADEPT) program. This program has made significant progress to advance the technology of deployable flexible aeroshells of 3D woven construction. However, there are still multiple risks associated with these designs. Although it is nearly impossible to address all of these risks, the development of sufficient test methods to calculate the material's compliances is an important step to reduce risk in the design.","Relative to commercial space transportation, the Space Act Agreement demonstrates NASA's financial and technical commitment to expanding access to space through a partnership with various organizations. Although these organizations, including Space Exploration Technologies, Orbital Technologies, Boeing and Sierra Nevada Corporation, have made great strides in advancing commercial space travel, their technology has thus far been applied only to low Earth orbit and travel to the International Space Station. However, this does not mean that such organizations could not benefit from low ballistic coefficient aeroshell technology. Based on the improved interlaminar properties and the ability to tailor the material design for a specific application, the increased use of 3D woven fabrics in ballistic protection, structural members, stiffeners and joints has benefited numerous other industries, including automotive, marine, construction and ballistic protection. As part of the commercialization strategy, MR&D will also perform a market research analysis on these industries since in order to identify additional areas within the commercial sector that would benefit from the development of credible test methods for 3D woven fabrics.","Analytical Methods; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Image Analysis; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Textiles"

NextGen's TPS concept is a bi-layer functional composite. The top ablative layer is a two polymer composite layer formed in a conformal shape by infiltrating ablative polymer in a Si based polymeric foam with controlled pore size distribution.  This layer is for the aerocapture portion of the mission. Underneath it is a ceramic foam core sandwiched between a top ceramic ply and the bottom structural laminated composite substrate. This layer is for the entry portion of the mission. The Si based polymer foam core is similar to the top layer but is already pyrolyzed and is not infiltrated with ablative polymer. The proposed TPS when subjected to aerodynamic heating at high integrated heat loads the foam polymer structure pyrolyzes to the high temperature structure and the filled phenolic or epoxy resin will be charred and ablated. The TPS will be designed to minimize areal density while meeting bondline temperature and ablation rate requirements. The proposed TPS is easy to fabricate in aerodynamic body conformal shapes by simple manufacturing steps. The basis for the proposed concept is recent successful TPS development work performed by NextGen Aeronautics and the University of Washington under the Air Force program.,"NASA is always looking for technologies that can be used for interplanetary transport of heavy payloads. In initial studies to find a system capable of delivering heavy payloads to the surface of Mars, a conceptual vehicle that achieves orbit via aerocapture, cools down there, and then enters, descends and lands on Mars' surface is proposed. The proposed Thermal Protection System will achieve the mass efficiency necessary to enable and satisfy the mass requirement of this mission. The novel concept is applicable to other mission scenarios with extreme heating during a finite time. It is also applicable to multiple finite-time heating scenarios because of the unique multilayer design that can be optimized for the given requirements.","The proposed ablative bi-layer composite thermal protection system will be suitable for many applications with severe heat load requirements. Due to the unique fabrication and bonding/assembly methods to be developed, the structure will have good machinability in the pre-ceramic form, minimal required machining due to near-net shape casting and minimal volume shrinkage, and minimal outgassing of bonding agents from the integrated bonding approach. All of these factors and the low materials and equipment cost contribute to lower overall manufacturing cost. Additionally, the focus on near-net shape forming reduces assembly difficulties and expedites the integration process into subsystems and systems. Potential applications for this technology include high temperature structures such as hypersonic vehicles, rocket nozzles, various space structures, and re-entry vehicle parts. Other commercial products that would benefit from this technology include industrial high temperature furnaces, brake pads in aircraft or racecars.","Ceramics; Composites; Destructive Testing; Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Polymers; Processing Methods; Simulation & Modeling; Structures"

Since mechanical compressors have significant lifetime issues, NASA is evaluating high pressure PEM electrolyzer technology to generate and compress oxygen on the ISS.  State-of-the-art electrolyzers use Nafion® and similar perfluorosulfonic acid membranes which have significant hydrogen (H2) permeation issues.  To achieve the efficiencies desired, NASA requires a 50% or more reduction in H2 permeation with less than 10% reduction in ionic conductivity.  Lynntech proposes to manufacture nanocomposite membranes with significantly reduced H2 permeation while maintaining high ionic conductivity.  Preliminary results showed an unprecedented reduction in H2 permeation with minimal reduction in ionic conductivity (which have not been demonstrated before), no acid generation, and increased water transfer capability.  In Phase I, Lynntech will further optimize the membrane microstructure to achieve a target 60 to 70% reduction in H2 permeation with less than 10% reduction in ionic conductivity.  The anticipated Technology Readiness Level at the beginning and ending of Phase II will be 3 and 4, respectively.","In this Phase I project, Lynntech proposes to manufacture nanocomposite membranes with significantly reduced hydrogen permeation without adversely affecting the ionic conductivity.  This nanocomposite membrane can replace the commercial membranes that are used in the following applications: 1) High pressure PEM electrolyzers to compress the oxygen up to 3,000 psi for EVA, 2) PEM electrolyzers to generate oxygen for environmental control, crew life support, replenishing the oxygen for cabin, pre-breath oxygen delivery unit prior to space walking, propulsion for in-space maneuvering, in-space science activities, 3) Electrolyzers for regenerative fuel cell systems for storing energy in the form of hydrogen and oxygen, 4) Low (up to 50 psi) and high pressure (up to 400 psi) PEM fuel cells for power generation, and 5) Electrochemical oxygen concentrators to concentrate oxygen from cabin air for medical emergencies.","Proton exchange membranes that have significantly reduced hydrogen permeation have significant potential to replace current commercial membranes and becoming a new product very quickly.  Fuel cell and electrolyzer industries have been looking for a membrane with lower hydrogen permeability to improve the operational lifetime and efficiencies of fuel cell and electrolyzer stacks.  Therefore, there is a significant immediate market and a need for such an advanced proton exchange membrane.  Lynntech has already demonstrated reduction in hydrogen permeation and high ionic conductivity with its nanocomposite membrane. PEM fuel cells are currently considered to be used for power generation for portable, telecommunication back up, stationary, and transportation applications both in the military and in civilian industries.  PEM electrolyzers are considered to be used for energy storage, oxygen generation, etc. in numerous civilian and military applications.","Composites; Conversion; Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Nanomaterials; Polymers; Protective Clothing/Space Suits/Breathing Apparatus; Storage"

ITN's MEA is more efficient, durable, reliable, versatile and economical than the state of the art because it is made with transformative manufacturing techniques – microwave sintering and energy optimized plasma deposition (EOPD). The proposed fuel-flexible, direct oxidation MEA is capable of power densities up to 2 W/cm2 at 600?C. ITN's EOPD of thin, conformal YSZ electrolytes creates a stress free interface between the anode and electrolyte which improves MEA durability, cycle-ability and cell performance. The MEAs produced in this research effort can be incorporated into SOFC stacks capable of producing power in the 1-3 kW range.  Because the fuel is oxidized directly in the SOFC, without external fuel processing, the thermodynamic efficiencies from fuel source to DC output exceed 70%.  Higher efficiencies translate to minimal cooling required as obtained by way of conduction through the stack to a radiator exposed to space and/or by anode exhaust flow.","NASA needs efficient and reliable methods for both portable and stationary electricity and heat generation, with the greatest possible flexibility. ITN's proposed MEA provides the solution, allowing for SOFC systems capable of generating electricity from a variety of fuels such as syngas, methane, hydrogen or hydrocarbon fuels.  Potential NASA customers are the International Space Station or the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate or other long-term missions where such fuels are harvested from the Earth's atmosphere or the atmospheres or surfaces of other planets and used to generate electricity.","The fuel flexibility, high efficiency, scaleability, and durability of this MEA will lend itself to portable and stationary commercial SOFC applications with power outputs ranging from 20 W to 200 kW. An application of particular interest is the distributed energy generation market. Generators for the distributed energy market would range in size from 2 kW for a single household to 200 kW generators for small communities. This SOFC technology is uniquely suited for stationary distributed energy applications because it can operate directly on natural gas, which is primarily composed of methane, with minimal fuel processing and tolerate a wider range of operating conditions than state of the art SOFCs. This is significant for non-NASA commercial customers in the United States because natural gas is widely available to many homes or communities without investment in fuel delivery infrastructure. In addition, these generators could be used with other fuels in many remote applications where grid power is not available.",Ceramics; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Conversion; Generation; Processing Methods

NASA has set targets of 265 Wh/kg of 675 Wh/l for batteries for near-term energy storage applications. Li-ion battery technology has the highest energy density among rechargeable battery technologies. However, achieving the near-term goals require implementation of next-generation active materials. We propose to develop Li-ion cells that meet NASA's near term targets by combining our CAM-7 cathode material, the highest energy content market-ready cathode material available with market-ready Si-based anode materials.  Because of its high reversible capacity (> 205 mAh/g), high discharge voltage (average 3.85 V vs. Li) and high density (4.8 g/cc), CAM-7 can yield higher energy Li-ion cells than any other market-ready cathode material.  A version of CAM-7 targeting portable power and vehicle applications has been fully developed and, as part of its commercialization, is currently being transitioned to a 50 ton per year plant in Massachusetts. In the proposed Phase I program, TIAX will optimize the CAM-7 composition to yield the highest possible cell energy while still meeting the life targets, and simultaneously optimize an anode electrode incorporating a market-ready Si-based material.  TIAX will then combine them in Li-ion cells that demonstrate the resulting system's ability to meet all NASA near-term energy, performance and life targets.  The Phase I program will demonstrate, at the 200 mAh cell level, performance and cycling of electrode designs projected to meet and exceed NASA's near-term targets when they are incorporated in 18650 cells.  A successful Phase I program will be followed by a Phase II program in which such 18650 cells are developed, assembled, and rigorously tested against NASA requirements.","The absolute necessity of rechargeable energy storage for long-duration space missions, and the extremely high energy requirements and cost per unit mass of launching material into space make the premium for high specific energy and high energy density rechargeable batteries in space applications as high or higher than in any other sector.  At the same time, the costs of space missions, and the extreme danger of manned space missions and necessity of energy storage for survival also create an extremely high premium for reliability of rechargeable batteries.  Therefore, reliable, long life rechargeable batteries with the highest possible specific energy and energy density are a cross-cutting technology of very high value for a wide range of NASA applications (such as EVA suits, landers, rovers, habitats, vehicle power, electric aircraft and power for payloads), and therefore potential costs of development and small-volume manufacturing for the proposed battery technology are not likely to be critical hurdles to its commercial application in NASA platforms.  As such, the proposed battery technology has potential for commercial application across the full spectrum of NASA's exploration, scientific experimentation, defense, communications and monitoring missions.","Li-ion batteries have the highest energy density among rechargeable batteries today, and hence find diverse applications ranging from niche military batteries to widespread portable electronics devices such as laptop computers, tablets, and smartphones. Li-ion batteries are also being introduced in electric drive vehicle applications such as PHEVs and EVs. The highest specific energy and energy density (245 Wh/kg and 230 Wh/l, respectively) currently available in commercial portable power Li-ion cells represent the limits of state-of-the-art cell engineering, approaching the limits obtainable using current commercial cathode and anode active materials. Hence meeting NASA's target of 265 Wh/kg and 675 Wh/l represents a significant advance over the current state-of-the-art, and will find broad appeal in diverse applications.  Higher energy density batteries are of significant interest to the military because of the possibility of reduced weight burden on the warfighter as well as reduced logistics footprint. The rapidly growing market for tablets and smart phones is placing ever demanding requirements on the Li-ion batteries that power these devices.

A complete preliminary design for a single-facesheet VCHP radiator for the non-nuclear system will be developed at the end of the Phase I program.","The low cost VCHP radiator developed under this Phase I and Phase II program would provide the waste heat rejection system necessary for the non-nuclear TDU to be tested at NASA GRC.  Additional, longer term NASA candidate missions that the low cost VCHP radiator would support are initial power sources for human outposts on the Moon or Mars and nuclear electric propulsion systems (NEP) for Mars cargo transport.  A secondary application would be for lunar and Martian radiators that can passively accommodate the large swings in environmental conditions between lunar (or Martian) day and night, including long periods at very low temperatures.  In addition, the VCHP can passively accommodate large changes in thermal load, and avoid damage during periods of low thermal load.  The non-condensable gas in the VCHP will also help with start-up during sudden increases in thermal load.","There is a commercial application for high temperature VCHP heat exchangers in fuel cell reformers. In a fuel cell reformer, steam, air and diesel fuel react in a High Temperature Shift (HTS) and a Low Temperature Shift (LTS) reactor to produce as much hydrogen as possible. Feed streams to and from the reactors must be maintained under tight temperature control, typically within 30�C despite a turndown ratio of 5:1 in reactant flow rate.  ACT believes that VCHP heat exchangers can replace the current heat exchanger and control system with a passive system.  The VCHP heat pipes passively adjust the heat removed, to maintain the output stream at a constant temperature.",Generation; Passive Systems

The project leverages a TRL6 micropackaging process with ~100% yield for cell assembly.  Cost savings are critical as space-qualified multi-junction cells render large panel applications prohibitive.  The proposed project aims to develop a greatly-simplified manufacturing process that can be performed by most compound semiconductor foundries.  Thus, cost savings can be derived from increased competition and scaling by leveraging low-cost high volume manufacturers for wireless components and LED lighting devices.

We will introduce a new multi-layer etch-stop structure into inverted metamorphic (IMM) triple-junction solar cells grown on 100-mm GaAs substrates.  The etch-stop structure will be grown between the original GaAs substrate and the ELO release layer, thereby becoming the effective substrate surface after the ELO process.  The purpose of the etch-stop structure is to prevent pits and surface damage incurred during ELO from damaging the original GaAs surface.  The standard method of reclaiming the GaAs substrate after ELO is to employ chemo-mechanical polishing (CMP) to remove the defect-ridden GaAs surface and chemically polish the underlying GaAs to a yield surface that is suitable for successive epitaxial growth.  This process works effectively but reduces resultant substrate thickness and causes some wafer damage itself, which then requires further polishing.  These factors accumulate over time, practically limiting the number of reclaim cycles to 5–10 for a given substrate.  With the incorporation of the proposed multi-layer etch-stop structure, the defects are isolated in the etch-stop structure, which can be dissolved by successive selective wet chemical etches to produce the original pristine GaAs surface with its original thickness.  All mechanical polishing is eliminated in this proposed work, ensuring a constant substrate thickness through repeated substrate reclaim cycles and also drastically reducing the estimated cost of the recycling process to <$1 per substrate.","Thin, flexible, high efficiency ELO IMM solar cells, currently under development by MicroLink, are attractive as replacements for the solar cells in existing power arrays, for next-generation spacecraft designs, and for solar electric power (SEP) systems.  One of the advantages of ELO cells is that they are less costly than the current generation of Ge-based triple-junction solar cells because the substrate on which the solar cell is grown can be reused multiple times: ultimately the effective cost of the substrate approaches the cost of repolishing after ELO.  This advantage will be further enhanced by the proposed substrate reuse technology development: the cost of repolishing the substrate may drop from tens of dollars to less than one dollar which will result in a substantial reduction in the cost of the ELO cell.  Major commercial manufacturers of spacecraft solar panels have shown substantial interest in MicroLink's solar cells and in lightweight, flexible photovoltaic modules that contain these cells.  The flexible, conformal nature of the cells also makes them suitable for integration with spacesuits and other structures, such as remote fuel generation facilities or habitats.  Finally, lightweight, conformal ELO solar cell arrays are useful for reducing the weight and increasing the operational range of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).","Thin, flexible, high efficiency ELO IMM solar cells are also well suited for commercial and military satellites and spacecraft, either as replacements for existing solar cells in conventional array designs, or in novel, high power arrays.  The cells are attractive for electrical power generation in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which has been demonstrated to allow substantial endurance enhancements.  The cells are also useful for terrestrial power generation in high value military applications, such as off-grid power generation and battery charging.  Finally, the cells are attractive for the terrestrial concentrator photovoltaics (CPV) market.  In all cases, the proposed substrate reuse technology development will substantially reduce the cost of ELO solar cells and arrays, thereby making the cells more commercially attractive.","Manufacturing Methods; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Processing Methods; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable)"

While high efficiency, space-qualified solar cells are in themselves costly, > $250/Watt, there is considerable additional cost associated with the parts and labor needed to integrate the Photovoltaic Assembly. The standard approach has evolved with only minor changes, sacrificing cost because of risk aversion. Integration cost can be as much as double the bare cell cost – i.e. >$500/watt. Dramatic cost savings can be realized through manufacturing engineering of more efficient automated assembly processes. If the design of the Photovoltaic Assembly could be modified to be compatible with conventional and automatable electronic assembly and terrestrial solar panel assembly approaches, there could be considerable cost savings. There are many additional benefits with automation which include higher quality and consistency. This can reduce failures, increase production throughput, speed turnaround, and improve overall reliability. Cost and quality improvements can be realized on both thin and rigid arrays, increasing current capabilities, and enabling future high power missions. The benefits of automation are enhanced by the need for high power generation in support of energy intensive space missions. A 300kW array at $500/W would cost $150M just for the solar cell integrated array panels. A $150/W cell integration cost reduction would translate into savings of $45M, before considering the immediate and substantial benefits in consistency, reliability, and schedule. The Phase I effort demonstrates feasibility of a low cost array using an automated and integrated manufacturing approach, performed on an automation friendly solar cell, verified with environmental testing, and is used to predict array cost for a high power mission. Meeting these technical objectives will demonstrate reduced cost and justify a Phase II SBIR program preparing for a flight experiment.","Low cost, lightweight, high power solar arrays with compact packaging is a key enabling technology for meeting a  variety of NASA missions such as solar electric propulsion, outer planetary, or crew exploration missions. The automated THINS ZTJ approach is an ideal technology for meeting these needs, projecting a specific power improvement of greater than a factor of 3X, and an improved volumetric efficiency when rolled for launch by a factor of 4X compared to today's solar arrays.  The approach additionally prepares for the low cost integration of IMM solar cells as they become economically feasible. Such improvements are needed to allow a high power system up to 300kW to be packaged into a single launch, avoiding expensive and risky on-orbit assembly. The THINS Array also has the advantages of improved electromagnetic shielding because of the continuity of coverglass materials and the ability to create a continuous grounded, shielded enclosure.  Such a technology can be enabling for high performance electric and magnetic field instruments often used on NASA spacecraft, such as THEMIS, MMS, and Maven.  (MMS solar arrays, in fact, have incorporated superstrate technology previously developed on a NASA Phase III SBIR from Vanguard).","Commercial spacecraft have trended towards higher power in recent years, with spacecraft prime power requirements growing from 5kW to over 20kW.  Additional power provides additional functionality for military spacecraft, and additional revenue for commercial spacecraft, but is limited in practice to the 20kW level by the maximum achievable power that can be obtained with conventional rigid panel planar technology.  The implementation of a low mass, low volume, low cost array has application to a broad spectrum of military and commercial users who currently are restricted by the mass, volume, and cost of conventional approaches.","Conversion; Generation; Manufacturing Methods; Processing Methods; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable)"

Relative attitude control is used for target tracking and to compensate pointing drift caused by gyro drift and the Earth's rotation.

For deep space applications at long operational ranges, high performance stabilization of the space terminal data link is required. To meet this need, CDI proposes a novel application of our free-floating isolation platform. Based upon a Shuttle-proven technology, this approach yields 6-DOF isolation from the disturbances of the host vehicle while providing high-bandwidth active stabilization to attenuate both payload disturbances as well as any residual disturbances transferred from the base across the power/data umbilical. The proposed approach is designed to achieve better than 0.5microradian-rms stabilization for all frequencies above 0.1Hz when operating in a space environment.Phase I develops the proposed design concept, performs architecture trade studies, and predicts performance to establish the feasibility of the approach. Using an available free-floating isolation platform and a 2-axis low-g testbed, the design concept is prototyped and demonstrated on hardware in a simulated low-g environment (TRL-5).Phase II proceeds with the development of a prototype system that will be space qualified through comprehensive ground testing (TRL-6). Technology demonstration flight tests will be proposed on sRLVs and/or ISS platforms (e.g., WORF, OPALS upgrade), achieving a TRL-7 maturity by the end of Phase II.","The optical isolation and stabilization technology developed through this research is targeted for insertion into near-term NASA programs such as the Laser Communications Relay Demonstration Mission (LCRD) and as an upgrade for the Optical Payload for LAsercomm Science (OPALS). The capability is considered a ""Push Technology"" enabling new missions or enhancing missions already planned in for Deep Space Planetary Missions, the Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Program, and the Deep Space Optical Terminal (DOT) Project.Design geometry is readily customized to specific payload applications. As such, the design can be scaled for a 10cm telescope (e.g., Lunar Lasercom Space Terminal), a 30.5cm telescope (e.g.,Mars Laser Communications Demonstration), or larger telescopes for deep space missions. For small telescopes, the platform can be used for isolation, stabilization, and beam tracking, thus eliminating the need for the Fine Steering Mirror and its associated cost, mass, power and volume.","By providing component-level isolation and stabilization at the optical payload, this approach does not impose any unusual constraints on the host vehicle. This makes the technology broadly applicable to a wide range of vehicles including sRLVs, orbital RLVs, Earth orbiting satellites (even the simplest thruster-only designs), and deep space vehicles. The technology is targeted for high data throughput applications requiring optical links, but the core approach is applicable any space payload requiring high-performance isolation and stabilization. Applications include commercial and military communications satellites, next-generation large space telescopes, space-based interferometric telescopes, advanced geo-pointing surveillance and reconnaissance payloads, etc.  NASA and the U.S. comprise less than half of the overall total satellite market, so there are significant international applications for the technology.","Acoustic/Vibration; Attitude Determination & Control; Inertial; Inertial (see also Sensors); Lasers (Communication); Optical; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Telescope Arrays"

NASA estimates that the current Mars to Earth transfer rate of 6 Mbps might be increased to 600Mbps using a laser comm (LC) system.  Because the LC beam is less than 10 microradians wide and the Earth at apogee is 32 microradians wide, as seen from Mars, LC beam jitter caused by spacecraft base motion must be reduced to sub-microradian levels to enable beaconless optical beam pointing.  To meet the need, NASA is seeking innovative compact, lightweight, space-qualifiable vibration isolation platforms for payloads massing between 3 and 50 kg that require less than 15 W of power and mass less than 3 kg that will attenuate an integrated angular disturbance of 150 ur to less than 0.5 microradians (1-sigma), from <0.1 Hz to ~500 Hz.  ATA has a long track record of producing stabilized platforms to host small optical payloads.  Building on a previous NASA SBIR, ATA now produces the stable platform used in NASA's LLST and LCRD programs.  ATA will create a Compact, Lightweight Isolation Platform (CLIP) that could host the LC collimator telescope and provide a stabilized platform to prevent the 150-microradian spacecraft disturbance environment from reaching the LC terminal.  Advances in the suspension flexure, the platform structure, and actuators will be required to meet the size, weight and power requirements.  One challenging requirement is that an angular-motion sensor is required for the control system.  Gyros exist that can measure adequately but they are too heavy, too large, and use too much power. ATA will develop a small, lightweight, nanoradian-class angular noise Capacitive Angular Position Sensor (CAPS).  The sensor will have low power and high reliability, which ATA will demonstrate by producing TRL 4 prototypes in Phase I.  ATA will develop the CLIP, a 0.5 microradian residual motion stable platform, in Phase II for programs like iROC.","Laser Comm is currently being demonstrated between the TerraSAR-X and NFIRE satellites in low-earth orbit using LC terminals built by TESAT, a German company, for the European Space Agency.  Relatively short range and the ability to mutually track the other beacon allows relaxation of pointing requirements on that system.  As the amount of data that must be transmitted increases and the distance to transmit the data increases, beaconless pointing will be required to communicate by laser.  ATA's proposed Compact Lightweight Stable Platform (CLIP) and Capacitive Angular Position Sensor (CAPS) could host the laser collimator for NASA's integrated Radio and Optical Communications (iROC) program, which seeks to implement beaconless laser communication to and from Mars by 2025.  Beginning with a NASA funded Phase I SBIR, ATA developed the stable platform concept that serves as the basis for the laser comm terminal that NASA will be flying on the Lunar Laser Comm Demonstration (LLCD) on the LADEE spacecraft and is planned for the Laser Comm Relay Demonstration (LCRD) program that will be hosted on a Loral communication satellite.  Similarly, under this NASA SBIR the CLIP could be developed to meet the need for beaconless pointing and propel NASA to the forefront of laser communication.  The CAPS will ultimately find other applications in base motion measurement aboard other spacecraft to assist with image stabilization and correction.","ATA is committed to commercializing NASA SBIRs, as evidenced by our recently delivered space-qualified inertially stable platform to a government customer for a laser communication application.  The original NASA SBIR program was called Magnetohydrodynamic Stable Reference (MSTAR) and was designed to provide a stable optical reference for line-of-sight jitter removal.  Multiple commercial and SBIR awards matured the technology.  ATA is on contract to deliver an additional seven units for that program. ATA has been active in discussions with numerous primes for their DoD programs and with other organizations for laser communications programs to advocate the technology and performance aspects of the ATA IRU and stable platform developments. Near term opportunities to commercialize and apply the ATA IRU and stabilized platform technology exists with the following programs: Space Laser Communication Terminal (SLCT) – Air Force LWSM (Laser Weapon System Module) – DARPA SpOT (Space Optical Tracking facility) – Lockheed Martin LaWS (Laser Weapon System) – Navy GBAD (Ground Based Air Defense ) – MarinesATA will continue discussions and advocate for the insertion of the OIRU and stabilized platform technology into systems at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control Company, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, Boeing Directed Energy Systems, BAE, and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems.","Acoustic/Vibration; Antennas; Inertial; Inertial (see also Sensors); Outreach; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Teleoperation; Transmitters/Receivers"

Also, their low beam convergence makes electrostatic focusing feasible.  This, in turn, provides a dramatic reduction in amplifier size and mass.  Without magnets, traveling wave tubes and klystrons will be lighter and smaller, a further enhancement for space missions.  Phase I develops cathodes, pierce guns and focusing stacks.  Phase II will see construction of a working klystron or TWT.  Scandate cathodes also provide longer life than conventional cathodes.

Scandate cathodes address this by raising the frequency and power of traveling wave tubes.  This is particularly true of geocentric communications satellites.  Also, their longer life will reduce maintenance costs on these systems.  Eventually, scandate cathodes will be used in earth-based communications networks, where the same issues arise, although not as acutely.

These components are utilized to protect high power amplifiers (HPA) during the transmit cycle from destabilizing, and potentially harmful, power reflections from the antenna element. During receive cycle these components are utilized to direct lower power received signals with minimal attenuation to the low noise amplifiers (LNA). As such, performance specifications of these ferrite control components, such as bandwidth, insertion loss, isolation, power handling, temperature stability, radiation hardness, and linearity impose strict limitations on the overall system performance.Over the course of the proposed Ph1 SBIR program self-biased ferrite control components based on highly textured hexagonal ferrite compacts which have the potential to eliminate biasing magnets and significantly reduce the size, cost, and weight of the TRM while concurrently increasing power handling capability, and improving temperature stability and radiation hardness will be investigated. Specifically, a research and development path to realizing high performance self-biased ferrite materials and device designs for operation in space based environments at Ka-band (>27 GHz, 31.5 - 34 GHz targeted) is outlined.","Metamagnetics anticipates the use of self-biased radiation hardened Ka-band circulators where size, weight, power, and cost of ferrite components are the limiting factors. Metamagnetics components have the capability to influence the total price tag of the long range communication systems, particularly when thousands of T/R modules (TRM) are employed, as is often the case in phased array architectures such as those utilized in next generation observation missions including DESDynI (Deformation, Ecosystem Structure and Dynamics of Ice), SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography), and HyspIRI (Hyperspectral Infrared Imager). Metamagnetics devices are designed to be radiation hardened and temperature stable without costly shielding making them ideal for low earth orbit (LEO) and long range space based communications platforms which require high data rates.","A prominent alternative application of ferrite circulators is in the front end of ground based Transmit/Receive Modules (TRMs) utilized in Active Electronically Steered Arrays (AESAs). Specifically, Metamagnetics circulators have higher power handling thresholds than commercially available semiconductor technologies making them ideal for corporate feed array structures. A single AESA system can utilize anywhere from 300 to over 35,000 TRMs, operating at frequencies from UHF to above Ka-band, each of which is equipped with at least one ferrite circulator. The role of the circulator is to forward the high-powered transmitted signal to the antenna while protecting the amplifier (HPA) from harmful reflections during the transmit cycle and pass the received signals with as little attenuation as possible to the low noise amplifier (LNA) in the receive cycle. Metamagnetics has already identified a series of prime industrial partners who are interested in integrating this technology as the TRL level is increased.","Antennas; Ceramics; Characterization; Electromagnetic; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Navigation & Guidance; Prototyping; Simulation & Modeling; Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Superconductance/Magnetics; Transmitters/Receivers"

We shall also experiment with this waveform to determine how the motion of a low earth orbiting platform can be used to provide geolocation of the interference source.","The use of GPS has also become prevalent in support of satellite operations, enabling improvements in operational efficiencies for orbital maneuvers, rendezvous and docking and station-keeping.  However, there is little information on the presence or effect of GPS interference on space operations.  Many GPS interference sources are unintentionally created from high power transmitters that leak interference into the GPS band.  Even unintentional interference could have significant effect on space operations.  For example, L2 is particularly susceptible to interference, but is critical for precision relative navigation operations, for example for wide-lane carrier cycle ambiguity resolution.  For low earth orbiting platforms, high powered emissions from the ground could affect their GPS operations.  It is also possible that space-based interference sources could exist that cannot be easily detected by current monitoring systems but could affect GPS based space operations.","The level of reliance on GPS for navigation and positioning both in the military and private sector is very high and its reliability has become increasingly important. As a result, jamming, both unintentional and intentional, is becoming more disruptive as more users rely on this technology. While many, including NAVSYS, are looking at methods to mitigate the effect on navigation of jamming, it is also important to be able to detect, identify, and track jammers. This capability would allow for users to be aware of loss of capability and make decisions based on that awareness that could mitigate the impact.

The processing method of the proposed innovation is based on the fundamental statistical concept of confidence interval - a concept seemingly new to such an application. The benefits of proposed processing method for independent, accurate timekeeping are the following: 1) the proposed processing method based on confidence intervals is a purely statistical method of estimation of numerical quantities, and therefore does not require any mathematical modeling of sensors, here clocks, 2) no statistical models, namely no mathematical modeling of probability distributions, 3) no Kalman filter, and 4) the real-time computer programs implementing the proposed method will work with any kind of clock having digital output which can be transferred to a computer processor on which the real-time computer programs are run.

A previous SBIR study demonstrates that nonlinearities have an adverse effect on a linear dynamic filter's ability to accurately declare faults.  Thus, a fault detection filter capable of effectively accounting for nonlinear dynamics and measurement data interruptions is required.  During the proposed Phase I effort, such filters will be designed for faults in the three translational modes of 4 satellites flying in formation near a highly elliptical orbit.  The satellites will carry a limited suite of instruments, just sufficient to determine faults in the three translational modes and include a GPS receiver.  Furthermore, communication with a ground station will only be available near perigee and the measurement data will be transmitted in bursts, which will introduce planned and unplanned communication blackouts that represent breaks in the time history of measurements.  The proposed development will produce a fault detection and isolation algorithm that can mitigate these breaks and perform faster than a simple, cyclical restart implementation.","This type of system may be implemented on NASA flight test experiments for formations of satellites where resources restrictions limit the implementation of code not associated with flight control and the payload.  Furthermore, this system can be readily applied to existing missions to enhance reliability and safety without having to change the on-board flight software or hardware.  For example, the proposed FDI algorithm can be applied to the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) satellites to verify thruster and accelerometer performance even though the MMS satellites are resource-limited and cannot communicate with each other.  Similarly constrained missions can benefit from the product of this proposed effort.","A NASA certified system would have potential markets within the Department of Defense and commercial users who want to implement dynamic fault detection and isolation on an existing system.

Onyx Optics crystalline fiber waveguides are made from true rare-earth doped YAG crystals with Adhesive-Free Bond (AFB®) technology. Compared with silica or phosphate glasses, the YAG crystalline fiber waveguides have the following advantages: (i) YAG crystal has at least one order of magnitude lower Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) gain coefficient than silica or phosphate glasses (10-15 to 10-12 vs 10-11 m/W), which directly leads to the SBS free power being at least one order of magnitude higher than the glass fibers; (ii) YAG crystal has much higher thermal conductivity than glass fibers (10.7 vs 1.38 W/m degree C). Therefore, much shorter fiber length that is only about one tenth of the glass fiber can be used for the same pumping conditions and the SBS threshold can be further increased; (iii) Due to the shortening in the fiber length, straight fiber can be practically used for high power amplification. Therefore, large single mode area (LSMA) can be more easily achieved. Considering the high pulse energy requirement in a future LIST mission, only large mode area (LMA) Yb:YAG fibers with core size >40 mm will be fabricated and investigated in the Phase-I research. The fibers will be double clad to increase the pumping power and efficiency, while maintaining near diffraction limit laser beam quality.","The proposal is directed towards the construction of a micro-pulsed laser for NASA's Lidar Surface Topography (LIST) mission to globally map the topography of the Earth's solid surface with 5 m spatial resolution and 10 cm vertical precision, as well as the height of overlying covers of vegetation, water, snow, and ice. As pointed out by the LIST study findings, the instrument required to meet the LIST objectives far exceeds those of existing space laser altimeter technologies. Onyx Optics' true crystal fiber technology allows achieving the LIST laser source goals but it also represents a proof-of-principle for a whole family of crystal fiber lasers with different dopants than the presently proposed Yb:YAG that operate at 1.6 um (Er:YAG), at 2 um (Tm:YAG and Ho:YAG) or at 940 nm or 1064 nm (Nd:YAG) and frequency converted to 450 – 500 nm, all with close to diffraction limited beam quality and high pulse energies.

It represents a breakthrough capability for diode pumped solid state lasers that also has medical surgical applications in the 2 um region.

Historically, radar systems have tended to be either large, complex, power-hungry, purpose-built systems, or extremely simple systems of limited capability.  More recently, miniaturization of high-performance programmable integrated circuit technologies as embodied in field-programmable gate arrays, as well as rapid advances in high-speed data conversion technologies at a gigasample per second and beyond, have enabled the implementation of direct-conversion radio frequency (RF) systems, including radar, that operate almost completely in the digital domain.  In addition, solid-state high-power RF device technologies have improved in efficiency and speed to the point where highly efficient pulsed transmit sources are possible.  As these device technologies have matured, their application in space environments has accelerated to the point where extremely flexible programmable radar systems can be implemented in a very small size, weight, and power footprint.   Trident Systems has developed a powerful radar architecture called RAPTOR, validating it through flight testing on a number of Department of Defense programs;  initial analysis has shown the feasibility of transitioning this design to the space environment.  Through a comprehensive program of requirements development, trade studies, critical component and design analyses, fault mitigation simulation, and system design, Trident will develop the design for a complete space-qualifiable UHF/L-band radar transceiver in a 96mm x 90mm x 31mm PC-104e form factor that meets all customer mission needs, and is applicable to a wide range of applications (NASA and others).

Surface micro-machined thermopiles are desirable for area array thermopiles because the architecture provides both high detector fill factor and circuit fill factor in the pixel.

Thermal detectors (such as thermopiles), while typically less sensitive than quantum detectors, are useful when the combination of long wavelength signals and relatively high temperature operation (100-200K) makes LWIR and VLWIR quantum detectors unsuitable. Thermal detectors are also appropriate in applications requiring flat spectral response over a broad wavelength range.

The goal of this program is to develop high performance type II SL based FPA for 5-14 um detection. Photodetector arrays using this material are of great interest to the NASA for various applications including, in particular, imaging and optical detection, and object discrimination when tracking targets in space or performing astronomical observations. These LWIR photo detectors can also find application to infrared-based chemical identification systems and terrestrial mapping. Applying the dark current suppression and cutoff wavelength extension process to the type-II superlattice detectors should result in higher operating temperature, extended cutoff wavelength, and improved quantum efficiency, all important factors that should significantly enhance FPA operation.

In Phase II we will refine the techniques to realize passive-cooled high-performance LWIR FPAs with quantum efficiency larger than 60%.","Commercial applications applicable to NASA include remote chemical sensing and IR imaging arrays for deployment on remote vehicles.  The LWIR data is valuable for object discrimination when tracking targets in space or performing astronomical observations.

This in turn reduces the weight and volume overhead required for supporting systems on space-based or portable platforms.  Chemical plumes could be analyzed and identified based on their infrared absorption signatures.  Thermal imagers can be applied to geologic and atmospheric studies, for either earth based or extraterrestrial projects.   Data on weather patterns or geothermal activity could then be collected.  At these long wavelengths objects can also be spotted through fog or dust, which would normally obscure visible light wavelengths.","Non-NASA Commercial Applications includes pollution monitoring, nondestructive testing, medical diagnostics, and target tacking. For civilian medical use thermal imaging can be applied to diagnosing certain cancers based on temperature anomalies at the skin surface.  Search and rescue operations are also aided with this technology in that the ability to detect heat sources provides a great and immediate visual contrast when viewing vast areas of land or seascape.  Similarly military and defense can also benefit from this technology.  Standard night-vision systems rely on image intensifiers which merely amplify the available visible light for the user.  Camouflaging can still fool these types of vision systems.  However, thermal imaging that LWIR arrays can provide adds a higher level of capabilities.  Potential enemies can more easily be spotted by the heat signature that is emitted by their bodies or recently discharged weapons.

High power density GaN devices have recently been demonstrated at millimeter-wave frequencies with power densities of 5 to 8 times higher than GaAs and drain efficiencies of 50%.

The net result is a unique combination of high performance devices and innovative power combining. We anticipate that this work will result in an order of magnitude increase in the state-of-the-art of SSPA output power and efficiency at F-band. As a result, we believe this work could be very important for NASA's Astrophysics and Earth Science missions and for W-band radar and communications applications.","Future NASA Astrophysics and Earth Science missions require submillimeter-wave remote sensing instruments to monitor air quality, climate variability and change, ozone layer stability, weather, and the global hydrological cycle.

This amplifier is need for the LO multiplier chain of the Scanning Microwave Limb Sounder and for the SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy) airborne observatory. Currently available W/F-band SSPAs simply do not have enough power at this frequency, and further, their efficiency is poor. The efficiency SOA for amplifiers in the adjacent W-band is in the range of 10% and with practical packaged amplifiers including regulators, the efficiency is in the single digits. Our approach addresses this need by utilizing high-efficiency wide-bandgap (GaN) device technology and new high-efficiency power combining techniques to reach efficiency levels above 30%. Other NASA applications include planetary exploration missions which require W/F-band FMCW sensors to assist in planetary landings. Typical NASA applications require output power levels ranging from several watts to perhaps tens of watts at W/F-band frequencies.","Applications for this high-efficiency amplifier technology abound primarily at DoD but at slightly lower (W-band) frequencies.

In order to image from long distance, it is important that imagers have high sensitivity, high resolution, and very low dark currents. This leads to technical goals of having low noise, low dark current in small size pixels in large arrays. While saturated performance levels of traditional systems based on bulk semiconductors have not quite met the requirement of applications, it is expected that novel quantum systems will bring new development stage for infrared imagers.In recent years, Type-II InAs/GaSb superlattice (T2SL) has experienced significant development, from theoretical modeling, material growth to device processing and packaging. Performance of LWIR detector based on T2SL has become comparable, even better than that of HgCdTe. However, LWIR T2SL devices have been shown to be limited by surface leakage, especially at lower operating temperature.This proposed effort will investigate gating of Type-II photodiodes as a means to suppress this bottle neck of T2SL technology. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an effective method to completely suppress the surface leakage current in LWIR type-II superlattice photodiodes that is compatible with the development of high performance gated FPAs in Phase II.",LWIR is also of special interest to NASA for planetary observation missions. The LWIR wavelength region is an ideal wavelength to look back at the earth from space and accurately map minute variations in the surface and/or atmospheric temperatures.  It is even possible to use simultaneous measurements from two different LWIR wavelengths (a two-color camera) to help isolate the surface temperature from that of the atmosphere.  This same LWIR technology can also be readily applied for observation of other planets.,"IR imaging sensors also find their use in commercial applications such as deep-space astronomy, commercial satellite imaging, geophysics, geology, remote environmental (pollution) IR sensing, law enforcement, search and rescue, firefighting and emergency response. For its part, the Optoelectronics Industry Development Association estimates that the current infrared imaging market for military and law enforcement applications is about US$3 billion.

United Silicon Carbide, Inc. proposes to develop and commercialize a unique JFET-based monolithically-integrated radiation-tolerant solar blind active pixel sensor (APS) UV imager.  Silicon carbide is the ideal materials system due to its negligible dark currents, excellent radiation tolerance, intrinsic insensitivity to visible and near IR light, and technological maturity.  The Silicon carbide JFET is an ideal choice as an IC building block, as it is immune to the presence of stacking faults in wafer material and is free from possible threshold voltage drifting associated with the SiC MOSFET.The proposed PiN and LJFET based APS circuitry has the potential for reliable operation at temperatures exceeding 150 C.  The proposed design of the active pixel sensor can be adopted for detection of more energetic particles, such as EUV and soft-X-ray, by increasing the thickness of the active low doped layer. Such APS detector arrays could be custom designed, including pixel size and epilayer thickness, and would be of nearly UNIVERSAL USE in nuclear particle detection and spectroscopy. While the active pixel sensor market is niche, applications in related Silicon Carbide LJFET based analog processes offering temperature operation above 200 C have tremendous value in the commercial, industrial & high temperature market space.  LJFET IC building blocks such as voltage references, oscillators, comparators and regulators form the cell circuits for such products as PWM controllers, power transistor gate drivers, voltage regulators and amplifiers.","Future solar astronomy missions need UV- sensors that are ""solar blind"", i.e. insensitive at longer wavelengths where the solar radiation is orders of magnitude stronger and is frequently the limiting factor in photometric measurements in the UV- region. The high sensitivity of silicon CCDs and CMOS arrays in the visible and near infrared (IR) is a liability when employing these same arrays in the ultraviolet. As exemplified in the Hubble telescope instruments, long wavelength blocking filters exact a high price due to their low transmission in the ultraviolet.  There are several identified missions where the detector arrays we have proposed here are ideally suited.  These include: (1) NWO – New World Observer – a very large, two-spacecraft, coronagraphic telescope system to block out the light from a central star to see exoplanets. (Cash et al., 2009, Proc. SPIE 7436, 5. ""The New Worlds Observer: the astrophysics strategic mission concept study"") (2) THEIA – Telescope for Habitable Exoplanets and Interstellar/Intergalactic Astronomy (Sembach et al., 2010,  AAS 21345801S.  ""A High Sensitivity Ultraviolet Spectrograph for the THEIA Mission"") (3) as well as various Midsized Explorers (MidEx) and Small Explorer (SMEX) missions for UV spectroscopy and imaging.","The general design of the active pixel sensor can be adopted for detection of more energetic particles, such as EUV and soft-X-ray, and would be of nearly universal use in nuclear particle detection and spectroscopy. For the aircraft surface-to-air and air-to-air missile warning systems, presently employed by DoD, a low cost solid-state solar blind array would also be of considerable interest. Applications in related Silicon Carbide JFET based analog IC processes, offering temperature operation above 200oC, have tremendous value in the commercial, industrial & high temperature market space.  A substantial host of industrial and under the hood automotive applications (about $31.2B analog market) such as factory automation, motor control, CNC machinery, EPS, BBW, would immediately be enabled with SiC JFET analog sub-circuits offering embedded power management & control functionality at higher temperatures. An immediate commercial opportunity would be to develop a SiC LJFET-based half bridge gate driver to drive SiC transistors, co-packaged together in a multi leg power module to provide a high temperature integrated power train solution with a significant reduction in system cooling for industrial motors, UPS, solar farms and electric vehicle markets. USCi partnering with companies as Powerex, Vincotech, Dynex Semi would lead to breakthrough module powertrain solutions being developed and commercially available within 12 months of Phase III.","Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Detectors (see also Sensors); Image Capture (Stills/Motion); Manufacturing Methods; Materials & Structures (including Optoelectronics); Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation)"

The method, aimed mainly at evaluation for space applications of new graphene detectors, is also applicable to other detectors operating in non-space environments. DEM will test graphene response to very low fluxes of atoms and molecules, ions, and photons; if sensitive to extremely low fluxes of a few 100/s, the timing of pulses produced by bunched events may open up an entirely new avenue to time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Closely coordinating with the NASA GSFC Detector Systems Branch, DEM will characterize the detector response to enable low-cost demonstrations of ionosphere-thermosphere investigations in low-Earth-orbit in CubeSats and sounding rockets. Space-borne measurements require knowledge of the response to the three kinds of particles: photons, ions, and neutrals, to properly design experiments. DEM controls vacuum pressure at the detector and can validate the application of these new detectors to a new series of mass spectrometers that can operate over a broad range of vacuum pressures (0.1 milliTorr and lower) because of their small size – DEM will add value to cost effective NASA balloon, sounding rocket, and satellite investigations.","NASA's interest in CubeSat missions is driven by the need to do high-quality science with a limited budget. NASA is at the threshold of producing fully instrumented CubeSats for less than $0.8M each. To be effective, these must use technologies that are small, consume little power, and avoid risks associated with high voltages and electronic complexity. Therefore, the impact of the detectors that are enabled by our DEM is likely to be very significant for NASA. The new detectors enable low-cost implementations of new ideas that revolutionize Space Applications, like the new WINCS suite for ionosphere-thermosphere missions that provides the function of 4 spectrometers with performance levels exceeding previous instruments, all in a package less than 3x3x3 inches cubed with total power less than 1.6 Watts. Similarly, renewed interest in planetary and inter-stellar science requires measurements of neutral atoms in Space (e.g., LENA in the IMAGE spacecraft) that will require DEM to take advantage of new detectors. Such applications will require careful characterization of this new generation of detectors using the experimental method implemented in DEM - to ensure proper experimental design in such missions, discriminating photons from neutrals and ions.","As with the potential for NASA applications, the intrinsic value of our Detector Evaluation Module is extended by its broad vacuum pressure range to entirely new spectrometers, including mass spectrometers, that are just beginning to offer solutions in many commercial areas: medical diagnosis, industrial process monitoring, volcanology, environmental monitoring of pollutants in air and water, and military value for detection of chemical, biological agents and explosives.

The basis for the cathode is a Barium impregnated dispenser cathode.  The innovation will be the heating technique.  We are proposing to heat the cathode to emission temperatures through radio frequency induction heating.  The current state of the art micro cathodes utilize a resistive heater typically operated by passing a DC or AC current through a small refractory wire, heating the wire through ohmic heating.  This requires significant sized wires and mechanics that create a heat sink through the leads, greatly increasing the power required to heat the cathode. Alternative development programs for micro cathodes have proposed utilizing lasers to heat the backside of the cathode.  The drawback for this method of heating is the low power efficiency of state of the art lasers.In support of our proposed concept, Busek has recently developed an innovative RF generation circuitry that leads to applications like the proposed.  The circuit is highly efficient and load variant tolerant.  During Phase I we will design, build and test a model cathode with integrated induction heater coil and RF generator.  Phase II will optimize the design and develop a commercial cathode for applications such as sensors, traveling wave tubes or micro ion engines.","Potential applications of the micro cathode are abundant, though the likely first and highest NASA interest will be for very high frequency TWT microwave generators.  As the frequencies of these sources increase, the size (diameter) of the electron feed beams needs to decrease. NASA could also have interest for this low power, micro cathode for scientific sensor such as probes for measuring electric fields in earth orbit is by measuring the ExB electron drift.  This requires small beam spot and as spacecraft shrink in size and power, the exceptional low power of the proposed cathode will be needed.Another potential application for the proposed cathode is for use as a neutralizer and plasma initiation electron source for our micro RF ion engines.  Developing a thermionic cathode that emits on the order of 1mA for 100mWatt input would eliminate on critical hurdle for efficient micro ion engine utilization for space propulsion.  We currently have a field emission cathode that can emit this current, but has difficulty starting the plasma.  The proposed cathode should be able to be overdriven for a fraction of a second to deliver multiple mA of current.  The cathode can be scaled larger for the larger ion engines if needed.","Non-NASA applications mirror the NASA applications plus there is significant interest in developing the necessary equipment to enable the use of the extremely high frequency (EHF) band for military and commercial applications.  For the armed services, realization of millimeter wave amplifiers enables Gigabit rate point-to-point satellite communications, as well as access to currently unused spectrum.  Furthermore, millimeter wave radio communications enable reduced antenna size and increased signal directionality, increasing effective signal gain to the target.  Commercial applications for EHF amplifiers tend to focus on atmospheric science, in particular monitoring upper atmospheric temperatures.",Electromagnetic; Microwave; Terahertz (Sub-millimeter)

Focusing on energetic particle detection in the heliosphere, the resulting leap in the resolution with which the deposited charge is measured results in far more precise energy and position measurements, from which the certainty in the particle identification is increased.  Silicon is chosen as the material upon which the avalanche particle detector (APaD) will be developed because it possesses high stopping power for ions, low material cost, and an extensive microelectronic fabrication base.  We have previously made both: a) low-noise silicon detectors for ion and high-energy sensing, and b) avalanche photodiodes (APDs) for optical photon sensing.  The objective of the project is to integrate the two topologies so that we can compare the energy resolution with and without on-chip amplification across the energy range 10 keV – 3 MeV, with a goal of three times improvement in resolution at 80 keV.","The technology developed under this SBIR will help advance solar science and mitigate the effects of harmful amounts of space radiation, whether it consists of high energy charged particles or secondary protons following solar particle events.  The underlying detection technology can possess far higher spectroscopic performance than existing systems, thus allowing one to better correlate the solar particle emissions with the driving feature near the photosphere, thus helping to identify the origins and causes of the solar wind, solar energetic particles, and the Sun's magnetic field.  Thus the Solar Probe Plus Mission and future NASA heliophysics missions will gain far greater specificity in mapping the spectral, directional, and composition of solar-driven particles.  Beyond heliophysics, fine energy resolution can be used to precisely characterize atmospheric and soil samples captured and ionized during planetary studies. In fact, the general amplification technology can be applied to photonic detection as well, yielding another pathway through which high resolution x-ray and gamma-ray imaging can be elicited.","An avalanche diode technology with thin dead layer can not only be used for enhanced particle detection, but it can find use in the fabrication of silicon-based ultraviolet APDs.  These can find wide applicability, useful for biological imaging applications in both defense and commercial settings, flame monitoring, ladar navigation, and in an enhanced night-vision concept.  For instance, if a UV flash illuminator and 2-D pixel array are coupled to form a 3-D imaging ladar, then one can form single-photon images at successive ranges by synchronously range-gating the APD array with the illumination pulse. Multiple single-photon image frames can be collected at each range over a period of time in order to form grey-scale intensity images of the scene.   If applied to neutron or gamma-ray detection, on-chip amplification provides an alternative pathway through which the signal-to-noise ratio can be enhanced, complementing the large body of research conducted in reducing the noise via cooling methods or alternative materials searches.  For the specific sensing of primary or secondary charged particles and high-energy photons, the successful development of a low cost, high performance design will impact the entire industry, standing as a viable alternative to exotic materials.  Thus, optical cameras, medical imaging instruments, and military radiation instruments would all be impacted by the successful development of an amplifying particle sensor.",Ionizing Radiation; Non-Electromagnetic

Our approach will result in an all-optical vector magnetometer (AOVM) that can be calibrated from the fundamental quantum properties of the atoms. Stable calibration is essential if magnetic dynamics are to be inferred by flying different missions to the same planet separated by decades.

The latter will provide the ability to safely operate the cryocooler system off of virtually any spacecraft power bus from all perspectives, meaning that the cryocooler system will be protected from transient effects from a ""dirty bus,"" and the cryocooler will not impart back onto the power bus large amplitude current ripple that would otherwise affect the performance of other devices on the bus.","The overall benefit to NASA for space-based infrared sensing is tremendous.

As such, the cooler addresses the need to prevent boiloff of cryogenic propellants on long duration remote missions.Due to its high heat capacity regenerator matrix, the cooler has a high efficiency and a small footprint, making its launch mass minimal.  The coherent regenerator matrix configuration prevents movement and so prevents degradation over time.  Due to its unique compressor being cold-tolerant down to 150 K the cooler can keep running even where the sun is so far away and dim that the energy captured by the spacecraft cannot keep the compressor warm.  The compressor being designed to run cold and on minimal input power allows it to run at the inherently low solar intensity, which seriously depresses solar cell power generation.In all, our cryocooler innovation is an enabling technology for far-flung missions that have the need to preserve mission propellants in their liquefied state until needed to maneuver near a destination or a midway point.The design concept calls for: 1) Using regenerator materials from a recently developed class of high heat capacity rare earth alloys;  2) A compressor and coldhead design optimized for a low temperature heat sink;  3) Minimizing the known losses in the pulse tube proper.  The cryocooler design will be possible due to the long standing cryocooler design and manufacture heritage of the team members.Phase I will verify the low temperature capabilities down to 150 K of an available mini compressor, and, will put forth the design of the crucial components of a complete 0.3 W at 35 K cryocooler targeted to run in a 150 K environment.Phase II will build and test a complete prototype cryocooler that is small in size and power consumption enabling long durations missions to planetary objects at remote locations within the solar system.","Pertinent NASA projects include missions to the outer planets and their moons, such as Europa, Titan, Neptune, and Triton.  All of these missions need to carry considerable propellants for many years to be used in braking and/or orbital insertion maneuvers at the target location(s).  High thrust propulsion (acceleration comparable to planetary surface gravitational acceleration) is required for these near planetary maneuvers.Significant benefit can be gained from improved mission performance, which is greatly impacted by propulsion system mass.  Propellant is usually the predominant contributor to the mass of such chemical systems.  Therefore, the largest potential system and mission performance gains are likely from improved specific impulse (ISP) by using cryogenic propellants.  The challenges associated with cryogenic propellant use include the reduction of propellant boil-off so that the system is not penalized by the additional propellant mass required to accommodate typical boil-off.  The availability of a low input power, low mass cryocooler will make this option more attractive and attainable.Madison CryoGroup's intent is to design the cryocooler for a low reject temperature, which makes it highly applicable to missions to remote locations and orbits that have a low level of solar input. Depending on the extent of radiation shielding applied, even earth orbiting systems may benefit from the innovation.","The design and construction process is targeted to produce a space-born cryocooler that will have a host of qualities in-demand for space missions.  However, its small system size, efficient performance, long-life reliability, low input power and low vibration all make this cryocooler a high-value product that meets the demand of businesses aiming to deliver truly high-quality products for systems that require low failure rates.The proposed cooler is operable over a wide range of loads and temperatures.  Several government agencies outside NASA (MDA, Air Force) and various commercial entities have interest in integrating small and efficient high-frequency cryocoolers into their equipment.

The AMRR system uses three novel design features to achieve a large cooling capacity and very high thermal efficiency: a vibration-free, reversible cryogenic circulator; innovative micromachined regenerators; and lightweight superconducting magnets.  The superconducting magnet uses low-current superconducting YBCO tapes and a unique winding arrangement to enable an AMRR to achieve high thermal efficiency. In Phase I, we will develop a design for the superconducting magnet and its electrical, thermal, and structural support subsystems.  Based on the performance characteristics of the magnet system, we will optimize the magnetic field in the AMRR to minimize the overall system size and mass.  In Phase II, we will build a superconducting magnet and demonstrate the performance of a magnetic regenerator driven by this magnet under prototypical conditions.  In Phase III, we will assemble an integrated AMRR system and demonstrate its performance.","The proposed AMRR system will enable NASA to carry out future space astronomy missions that use cryogenic infrared, gamma ray, and X-ray detectors.  These detectors need to operate at temperatures in the range of 4 K to below 1 K to reduce the thermal emission of the detectors themselves and to achieve high sensitivity and resolution.  The vibration-free, lightweight AMRR can provide efficient cooling for these missions at the required temperature ranges.  The fabrication technologies developed for the lightweight superconducting magnets can also be applied to the fabrication of advanced magnets for multistage ADRs, particle accelerators, and portable MRIs.","Military applications for the proposed magnetic cooler include cooling systems on space-based surveillance, missile detection, and missile tracking systems.  Scientific applications include cooling systems for material microanalysis using X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometers, superconducting radio frequency cavities, superconducting cavities, and superconducting digital electronics.",Cryogenic/Fluid Systems

Many of these remote sensing applications furthermore are satellite and space based, where the imaging array also needs to be rad hard; particularly for the harsh radiation environments typically found on certain deep space missions, such as to the moons of Jupiter. LightSpin Technologies is developing a high performance solid-state cross-strip anode imaging single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array technology using rad hard GaAs SPAD arrays. This approach promises substantial improvements in spatial resolution (< 10 microns), timing resolution (< 100 psec), and count rate (> 10 Gcps). LightSpin has proven the concept provides excellent performance in small arrays (8 X 8 pixels) and developed a theoretical foundation enabling rapid scaling of the arrays to achieve Megapixel resolution at low cost.","NASA has an ongoing need for imaging detector arrays capable of withstanding the harsh irradiation environment of certain space missions.  While silicon imagers are widely available at low cost, they are generally unable to withstand harsh radiation environments.  In addition to static and video rate imaging, the development of imagers with time resolved capabilities enable time-of-flight instruments such as ladar, lidar, altimetry, and mapping.  And finally, the ability to detect single photons with high sensitivity is critical.","High performance, time-of-flight imagers are rapidly making inroads into a number of applications, including autonomous navigation (automobiles, UAVs, marine), gesture recognition, and robotics.  Current time-of-flight sensors are either too expensive (Google autonomous car system costs more than $50,000) or too limited in range (Microsoft Kinect system has a maximum range of 20 feet).  Successful completion of this SBIR project (Phase I and Phase II) will enable Kinect like pricing (< $100) for autonomous car systems (range > 1 mile).  Nearly all autonomous navigation applications would benefit, including automobile ladar (collision avoidance, pedestrian avoidance, autonomous driving), robotics (autonomous robotic navigation), airborne ladar (UAVs, airplane collision avoidance).","3D Imaging; Detectors (see also Sensors); Image Capture (Stills/Motion); Infrared; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Navigation & Guidance; Optical; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Perception/Vision; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Ranging/Tracking; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Ultraviolet; Visible"

The instrument will require no reagents or consumables and by simply placing the instrument on a sample of rock, soil, or ice, it will be able to detect a wide range of minerals and organics (at or below the 10-100 ppb-level) including proteins, free aromatic amino acids, F420 (a biomarker specific to methanogens), NADH, PAHs, and porphyrins (e.g. chlorophyll). It will be designed with flight in mind so mass, volume, and power-requirement will be minimized as much as possible. The use of multi-anode photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and avalanche photodiodes (APDs) will make the system compact and rugged and thus suitable for future missions and ongoing field and laboratory studies.","Both the Moon and Mars may hold important clues to the origin of life in our solar system and the need to detect trace levels of organics on them is on-going. With the recent discovery of potentially ancient water ice in permanently-shadowed craters on the Moon comes the tantalizing possibility that a treasure trove of pre-biotic organics may be trapped in that ice. These organics would be indicative of the kind of material that may have seeded life on Earth. On Mars, the discovery of water-created sedimentary minerals, verification of water-ice near its surface and the strong possibility of liquid water existing on and near its surface continues to make it an important target for discovering evidence for extinct and extant life. A stand-off fluorimeter, capable of measuring fluorescence emission lifetimes and time-gating, would make a fantastic tool for discovering organics on extraplanetary bodies as it would require no consumables, be very sensitive, require little to no sample handling, be rapid, and be rugged. Such  an instrument would be suitable for development and deployment on future extraplanetary missions including upcoming lunar and Mars missions. Additionally, its miniature size makes it suitable for Small-Sat missions to study organics such as O/OREOS. For terrestrial use, it will allow researchers in NASA's Space Science and Astrobiology Division to quantify the presence of different minerals and organics during analog field research and laboratory research.","FLEXEMS has many uses outside of NASA.

Currently, NASA uses different sensing technologies to analyze planetary samples. The use of multiple instruments increases the weight, complexity, power consumption as well as the probability of system malfunction. It is critical to develop lightweight miniaturized multi-functional sensor to enable NASA's multiple-mission needs and therefore make the best use of limited resources by reducing the cost, size, and the number of instruments. Crystal Research Inc. (CRI) proposes a novel compact optical sensor with multiple in-situ sensing capabilities for measurements of various inorganic and organic samples for planetary study and search of biomarkers. The proposed technique is based on a nonlinear coherent interaction process to detect the backward spectral signals from the targets. The detection is enabled by using our novel electro-optic (EO) switchable spectral filtering technique to eliminate spectral artifacts and nonresonant background. The standoff scheme facilitates the implementation of multiple measurements by using a single sensor for nondestructive analysis of different samples on land surface or in atmosphere. It eliminates the sample preparation process, contamination and other related accessories.","The successful development of the proposed sensor system will have extensive NASA's applications. The proposed system will create an opportunity to extend and enhance the capability of traditional NASA Earth and Planetary detection efforts in current platforms. It meets NASA's multiple-mission requirements for the best use of limited resources by reducing the risk, cost, size, weight as well as power consumption.  It will also enable new measurements with enhanced sensitivity for the planetary study. In addition, the proposed sensor will be useful for the study of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane which are great contributors to an overall global warming trend. It will help to identify the sources of greenhouse gases and thus understanding the terrestrial carbon cycle and its contribution to the climate change.","Besides NASA applications, the proposed sensor system has significant commercial and defense applications. It will benefit the civilian R&D including materials study, spectral imaging, remote sensing, atmospheric physics, geology, seismology, and medical diagnostics. In addition, the proposed sensor can be used for environmental monitoring such as industrial pollutions, chemical facility monitoring, forest fire detection and agriculture monitoring, etc. Therefore, there are many potential civilian and commercial applications for the proposed lightweight, compact sensor. The proposed standoff sensor can also help law enforcement agencies to discover potential explosive devices from terrorist threats; for example, it will be useful for the explosive detection in commercial airports and various public events to counter terrorism. Finally, the sensor may also be used to detect and track toxic plumes and gases during chemical and biological threats.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Analytical Methods; Fiber (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Photonics); Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Infrared; Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Visible"

We propose a non-contact optical instrument similar to ChemCam that will be capable of measuring not only complete elemental compositions but also isotopic abundances of the key elements in surface materials. We intend to utilize and further develop our recently published technology: Laser Ablation Molecular Isotopic Spectrometry (LAMIS). Our concept is simple, scientifically proven and already endorsed by two innovation awards we received. In Phase I, we concentrate on demonstrating the resolution and sensitivity required to determine these isotopes in synthetic samples and natural minerals relevant to Mars. The immediate focus is on Mars but our concept is also highly germane to future landing missions to the Moon, other planets and their moons, asteroids, and to a broad range of applications in ecology, agronomy, nuclear industry, radio-chemotherapy, forensics, security and other fields. We will advance the development to TRL4 by the end of Phase II with the further aim of integrating our LAMIS detector with a ChemCam-like instrument. The proposed instrument leverages and advances the technology developed for ChemCam. The added strength of measuring isotopes will greatly expand the capabilities of the ChemCam, which is now the most frequently used instrument onboard ""Curiosity."" In Phase II, we will develop a breadboard prototype of the instrument that can be amended to measure other key isotopes (B, Cl, Mg, Ca, Sr, etc.). We plan further infusion in NASA missions and commercialization in Phases II-Ex and III. Our instrument can be used for stand-alone landing missions or for in situ sample characterization prior to sample return.","Our non-contact optical instrument will rapidly measure complete elemental compositions (~30 elements simultaneously) and key isotopic abundances in planetary surface materials. The ratios of C, H, N, O isotopes will provide important constraints on the history of processes on Mars, particularly related to past organic and water activities. We aim at the key life-forming elements but our technology can be further extended to other chemical species. This technology is directly relevant to several NASA objectives for Mars: (i) characterization of geological features contributing to deciphering geological history; (ii) determination of surface chemical composition including elements known to be building blocks for life; (iii) characterization of organic compounds and potential biomarkers in representative bedrock and regolith; (iv) identification of potential chemical and isotopic biosignatures in rocks and regolith; (v) characterization of the local environment, the state and cycling of water and CO2, and the near-surface distribution of hydrogen. NRC's decadal survey recommended a plan leading to Mars Sample Return. As part of this program, there is a need to conduct in situ analysis to select the best and most varied set of samples to return to Earth. Our proposal is particularly focused on Mars but highly relevant to applications on the Moon, other planets, their moons (Titan, Europa, Io, etc.) and comets. Similar studies are very important to NASA's Earth Science missions.","Our concept of an integrated instrument capable of both elemental and isotopic measurements has a significant potential for commercial applications and infusion into other Government agencies, academia and industrial markets. LAMIS is poised to speed up, to simplify and to make isotopic analysis more affordable than at present. Multiple applications are anticipated in the nuclear power industry, medical diagnostics and therapies, forensics, homeland security, carbon sequestration, natural gas and oil exploration, ecological and agronomical studies. Carbon isotopes are indicative of primary bio-productivity and energy cycling and are important for the understanding of biochemistry. The biological enhancement of 12C over 13C can be up to 5%, and is measurable by LAMIS. Carbon isotopes are used in soil difference studies; various crops studies (rice, wheat, barley, cotton etc); forest studies; studies of vegetation and different ecosystems. Such studies include isotopic measurements of soils, flora, fauna, air, groundwater and the results of human activities. The stable isotope 15N is often used as a marker, particularly to track the efficiency of fertilizers in agronomy: how plants uptake the fertilizer from roots to leaves and how much of it being lost. In animals and humans, stable isotopes are used to study host-parasite relationship. Measurement of the D/H and oxygen isotopic ratios is essential in paleoclimatology, material sciences, biological and medical research.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Biological Signature (i.e., Signs Of Life); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Detectors (see also Sensors); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Ultraviolet; Visible"

The other four included Lunar South Pole-Aitken Basin Sample Return, Saturn Probe, Trojan Tour and Rendezvous, and Venus In Situ Explorer. The Lunar and Venus missions could also benefit from the development of this sampling approach.The sampling probe in the proposed effort could be applied to any number of planetary bodies with a microgravity environment where sample return is desired.","Non-NASA applications for this technology include sampling of contaminated soils and liquid from hazardous environments (near nuclear reactors, oil spills, chemical spills etc). Key subsystems such as the sampling probe, flipper mechanism and hermetic sealing canister could be re-purposed for sampling terrestrial sites. These systems could potentially be deployed from a helicopter with a tether, acquire a sample, hermetically seal it on the ground, and be reeled in with the sample inside the sealed canister.

Here, Uranus as an ice-giant offers important potential for new discoveries with special relevance for understanding newly discovered exoplanets, and an atmospheric probe for Saturn could be used in testing the helium differentiation hypothesis. For both Uranus and Saturn, determination of the relative abundance of hydrogen, helium, chemical compounds, noble gases and their isotopes can help address fundamental questions about nebular evolution and the origin of the giant-planets in the Solar System.

In filter-based technologies, the x-y 2D imaging is usually taken at once, while the wavelength dimension is performed by tunable filters that are mounted in front of a monochrome IR camera. Several types of tunable filters are currently available, including mechanically tuned Fabry-Perot etalon (FP filter), liquid-crystal Lyot-Ohman filters and acousto-optic filters. However, these EO tuning technologies have some shortages, such as slow tuning speed, bulky design, limited working band and small aperture. Boston Applied Technologies, Inc. (BATi) proposes a unique remote sensing system which is based on a tunable filter with under millisecond tuning time for high speed detection of gas concentration. The core part, tunable filter, of the proposed system is made of patented OptoCeramic® material. The system features high speed, wide spectral range from visible to MWIR, low cost, light weight, big aperture, and robust.","The primary goal of the final product is to provide NASA a mobile/airborne imaging system for remote detection of gas emission source. The core technologies developed in this SBIR project, a high speed tunable filter, can also be applied to combustion research for jet engine diagnosis. By capturing emission spectrum and using multi-wavelength algorithm the 2D temperature measurement of flame can be realized at once. With proper design of multi-chamber enclosure this temperature measurement is applicable in harsh environment up to 4000F. Same approach that is used in this SBIR project for gas detection can also be applied to measurement of specie concentration in flame. In addition, the proposed tunable filter is a great candidate for general airborne hyperspectral imaging.","The proposed system itself can be used for environment monitoring, military surveillance, firefight department and homeland security. The proposed core technology, a high speed tunable filter, will find wide non-NASA applications.  Generally, any measurement requires fast acquisition of x-y 2D cube data is a potential application of this filter. For example, it can be used for high temperature measurement, which is a useful means for kilns, the steel and iron industries to monitor temperatures throughout the product making process. 2D spectral data is also desirable in clinical applications such as in vivo skin cancer diagnosis, hemoglobin dynamic monitoring, and pathological analysis.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Ceramics; Filtering; Image Analysis; Image Capture (Stills/Motion); Infrared; Multispectral/Hyperspectral; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics)"

The AirCore system consists of the AirCore gas sampler and the support system to accomplish its high altitude (nominally 70,000+ ft.) mission.

As the Arctic region responds to climate forcings, monitoring how aerosol distributions respond and modify their impact on radiative transfer will become increasingly important in refining climate models and predictions. NASA, along with other agencies, has launched several programs such as ARCTAS to increase observations of the region and incorporate findings into large scale climate models. In order to supplement satellite observations and given the difficulty of ground-based observations in the Arctic, instrumented Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) represent one means to efficiently monitor large areas. Measurement of the vertical profile of atmospheric aerosol optical properties can provide new data crucial to understanding climate change in the Arctic. New instrumentation is required to enable routine, widespread measurements with good precision from unmanned aircraft. These new observations will have important implications for global climate change modeling and, ultimately, international energy policy making. In the Phase I program, we will develop a complete conceptual design for a flight-worthy, compact, eye safe lidar that will enable vertical profiling of aerosol optical extinction and scattering and that will be deployable on a compact unmanned aircraft system like the SIERRA or ScanEagle. In the Phase II program, we will fabricate, test, and field demonstrate a prototype sensor.","The proposed airborne lidar will enable measurements of aerosol optical extinction on a wider scale and at higher frequencies than are possible now. This is especially important in monitoring climate change in the Arctic. The larger database from more frequent studies will directly benefit the goals of NASA's climate change research efforts. One future NASA program that might benefit from the proposed airborne lidar is the GEOstationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE) mission. Although a satellite-based program, the program might benefit from airborne corroborative observations of aerosol optical depth and aerosol absorption optical depth, much as was done for the Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) program by manned aircraft. The basic sensor platform will be adaptable to applications requiring measurement of aerosols where sensor robustness and size are critical to performance, such as monitoring networks for boundary layer meteorology, as well as hazardous volcanic ash clouds.","The proposed airborne lidar will enable measurements of aerosol optical extinction on a wider scale and at higher frequencies than are possible now. Non-NASA commercial applications are likely to include many ground-based applications such as CBRNE detection, visibility and Asian dust monitoring, hazardous volcanic ash cloud monitoring, regional air quality and human health assessments.

The proposed system offers a significant cost advantage relative to both imagers and hyperspectral imagers presently available in this spectral range as it does not require a costly infrared focal plane array (FPA).  Moreover, the MSF-CI makes efficient use of compressive sensing and matched spectral filtering, resulting in minimized data bandwidth while preserving the information of interest.  In addition, the use of the DMD in place of a conventional FPA offers significantly better image uniformity, pixel operability, signal to noise at low light levels, and dynamic range.  The overall package is expected to be compact and rugged, making it ideal for airborne/space based applications.

Michigan Aerospace Corporation (MAC) proposes to demonstrate the concept feasibility of a Raman Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system to obtain real-time information from volcanic ash clouds, to be named VADER (Volcanic Ash DEtection Raman LIDAR). The instrument will be designed to operate from an airborne platform, and as such, will be compact and light weight. This approach benefits from returning real-time measurements, in contrast to sampling methods (impactors) that require post-mission analysis. This project will utilize MAC's extensive heritage of rugged LIDAR system design and construction.","An airborne volcanic ash detection/characterization system, such as VADER, will have wide applications in the study of the threat volcanic ash poses to aircraft and for other scientific study of volcanic plumes. Studies carried out with VADER will allow NASA to refine their models of volcanic ash dispersion based on more data than is available at present.  There is potential to combine such a system with MAC's optical air data system and turbulence-detection systems into a unified system that would sense both volcanic and turbulence hazards ahead and report airspeed along with air, temperature and density routinely.","VADER will have similar utility for non-NASA civil organizations (NOAA, FAA, etc.) and military services (US Air Force, etc.) in conducting scientific studies of volcanic ash characteristics and dispersal. A next generation of VADER, more compact, would be mountable aboard UAVs to ""scout"" the airways during major eruptions in order to confirm that commercial and military aircraft cannot fly or give clearance for flights if the concentrations are not judged high enough to be a threat. With enough data, this will allow commercial and military aviation to continue safely during eruptions without widespread disruptions. Future systems could potentially be mounted aboard commercial and military aircraft as a warning system and/or as part of a unified system gathering data on ash concentrations from wherever the VADER-equipped aircraft are flying, providing even more data for entry into models and for warning purposes.  Combined with MAC's optical air data system and turbulence-detection systems, a single sensor system may be devised that would detect both volcanic and turbulence hazards ahead and report airspeed along with air, temperature and density routinely, providing commercial aircraft with a valuable new optically-based multi-function warning/air data system.

The fundamental of the proposed device is based on differential photoacoustic absorption spectroscopy (DPAS). It will be able to be remotely controlled and operated at high altitude. Background interference from NO2 absorption and acoustic noise of aircraft engines will be significantly reduced due to a specific acoustic cell design.The Phase I project will provide a proof-of-concept demonstration. The ultimate goal of this study is to design and construct a portable PM absorption monitor for NASA's airborne measurement programs. The tasks of the proposal will include:   1) Construction of a laboratory prototype DPAS PM absorption monitor;   2) Development of an absorption calibration scheme;   3) Comparative study on optical absorption of laboratory soot  particles with multi-angle absorption photometer (MAAP); and   4) Performance evaluation at a variety of sampling pressure. This SBIR Phase study will be performed by Aerodyne Research, Inc., in collaboration with United Technologies Research Center (UTRC). Both companies have been major participants in past NASA/FAA-sponsored aircraft emissions programs with extensive experiences in the study of PM optical absorption as well as soot formation and evolution in the atmosphere.","The primary NASA need for this technology is to measure PM light absorption at different altitudes for its Airborne Measurement program. At present, PM absorption is measured by collecting sample on a filter subtract and measuring light extinction and scattering of the collected samples during the airborne measurements. This method suffers from a number of intrinsic errors such as low sensitivity, ambient-pressure sampling and scattering light interference. The proposed DPAS technique will be far more sensitive than the filter-based techniques, and is capable of sampling at different pressures and providing 1s data acquisition measurement on absorption.In addition, emissions of small particulates (PM10 and PM2.5) are regulated by the EPA. The impact of particulate emissions from aircraft engines, which have a direct effect on radiative forcing, is magnified by the fact they are typically emitted in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere where their influence is greatest.  Past NASA programs such as EXCAVATE, APEX, UNA-UNA, and AAFEX have had as a major focus of their work, the measurement of black carbon (BC) emissions from civilian aircraft engines. The proposed DPAS PM absorption monitor can be used as a BC emission monitor to provide a cost-efficient, compact, fast and real-time BC measurement on aircraft engines.","We expect that the DPAS PM absorption monitor developed under this program will significantly benefit the scientific community interested in characterizing the radiative properties of ambient aerosols. The ability of one instrument to simultaneously measure particle absorption with good time resolution and high precision will enable continuous measurements of the particle optical absorption that can be directly used by regional and global climate forcing models. In combination with the Cavity Attenuated Phase-Shift (CAPS) extinction monitor, single particle albedo of ambient aerosols could be directly determined.The development of a DPAS PM absorption monitor would have a large impact on the ambient air quality monitoring community. PM2.5 and PM10 levels must be routinely monitored as part of ambient air pollution monitoring programs. Current techniques rely on use of collection filters and subsequent weighing, a procedure which is labor intensive (and thus expensive) and prone to human error.  There are 5000 sites in the U.S. alone which must monitor particulates under the mandate of the Clean Air Act of 1970. Particulate emissions from stationary combustors like power plants must also be monitored and an automated DPAS instrument would provide considerable savings over current technology, which costs on the order of $80,000-100,000 per unit!","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Detectors (see also Sensors); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Visible"

The approach, which is based on near-infrared heterodyne spectroscopy using solar occultation (i.e., direct solar viewing), is called Precision Heterodyne Oxygen-Calibrated Spectrometer, or PHOCS.  Oxygen measurements will provide dry gas corrections and – more importantly – will determine accurate temperature profiles that, in turn, improve the precision of the carbon dioxide column retrievals to better than 1%.  Planned instruments will complement results anticipated from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2), Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS), and ground-based Fourier transform spectrometers.  PHOCS instruments will be small (not much bigger than a pair of binoculars), light weight, and low power.  In keeping with one of the goals of this SBIR topic, planned instruments will be initially configured for operation on the ground, and have size, weight, and power (SWAP) characteristics suitable for easy ground mobility and well as airborne or space-borne deployment.  The Phase I project will test an all-fiber-optic heterodyne receiver that will simplify optical design and ensure long-term optical alignment.  Oxygen measurements will use the near-infrared band the 1.27 micron wavelength region instead of the more commonly used band at 0.76 microns.  The longer wavelength band is weaker; precise lineshapes of many individual rotational lines will be measureable without complications due to highly saturated absorbances or instrument line shape functions (ILS).  Carbon dioxide measurements will use the well-characterized band at 1.57 microns.","Motivation for the NASA commerical applications is described well by Rebecca A. Washenfelder in her Ph.D. thesis (Caltech, 2006),"" To predict future climate change, we must accurately predict future atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and CH4. The current budget has typically been inferred from top down analyses of measurements from a global network of surface sites. These measurements are highly accurate, but have limited spatial coverage. In addition, accurate knowledge of local planetary boundary layer dynamics is necessary to determine fluxes. Column measurements, defined as the vertical integral of gas concentration, can complement the existing in situ network. Because column measurements sample a larger portion of the atmosphere, they exhibit less variability than surface data, while retaining information about surface fluxes. Column measurements are not influenced by planetary boundary layer dynamics, and do not suffer from the resulting correlation between exchange and transport.""PHOCS is intended to help meet this research need.  Our approach is particularly useful because of its flexibility in deployment methods.  Commercial instruments can be mounted on the ground, on board ships, or on aircraft and research balloons.  Size, weight, and power (SWAP) parameters make PHOCS suitable for Raven-class UAVs.","Applications of near-infrared heterodyne remote sensing include environmental and industrial monitoring of gases including carbon monoxide, ammonia, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen fluoride.  Of these, ammonia has the largest commercial potential because ammonia emissions (primarily from agricultural sources) leads to formation of fine particulates (PM2.5) that have serious pulmonary health effects and can nucleate cloud formation (a climate issue).  The EPA has constrained ammonia transport across parts of the US midwest and passive remote sensors are ideal for monitoring compliance.  Constraints have also been placed on emissions from concentrated animal feed operations(CAFOs)including 900 CAFOs subject to a compliance agreement with the EPA.  Monitoring hydrogen fluoride emissions from aluminum smelters and ceramic and brick factories also define a commercial niche for the proposed technology.  Large area measurements of carbon monoxide are important for urban areas in which seasonal weather effects drive CO concentrations above safe levels and that can trigger mandatory restrictions on fireplace use.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Infrared; Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Radiometric"

Multi- or hyper-spectral absorption of particles and dissolved materials is routinely measured in the laboratory and in situ in order to characterize, for example, the quantities and types of phytoplankton based on concentrations of specific absorbing pigments. Similarly, backscattering is employed to estimate the concentration of suspended material. Measurements of absorption and backscattering concurrently, and at multiple wavelengths, are useful as proxies for biogeochemical measurements such as particle composition, concentration of particulate organic carbon, and particle size distribution, as well as for remote sensing calibration and validation.The current state of the art for phytoplankton observation using optical sensors on autonomous platforms relies on linking biomass with optical backscattering and chlorophyll. The ability to quantify phytoplankton using absorption not only overcomes limitations of backscattering and fluorescence-based approaches, but multi-spectral (visible wavelength) measurements of absorption also provide the means to discern the presence of accessory pigments and pigment packaging, ultimately leading to not only improvements in phytoplankton biomass estimates, but also the potential for resolving phytoplankton functional types.Briefly, the proposed sensor emits a collimated beam of light into the water and measures the backscattered light as a radial function from the beam location. An inversion algorithm is then used to convert this backscattered intensity as a function of distance from the beam to the inherent optical properties absorption and backscattering. Multiple source wavelengths are used and the sensor is packaged in a compact, flat-faced geometry easing integration into autonomous platforms.","The proposed sensor addresses several NASA interests under the S1.09 ""Surface & Sub-surface Measurement Systems"" subtopic, including particle characterization, water quality, IOP measurements for calibration and validation of ocean color data, proxies for biogeochemical particle composition, and properties of aquatic environments such as detection of phytoplankton and their functional groups. All aspects of optical oceanography research, including biology, particle analysis, and ocean color remote sensing rely on measurements of these key IOPs. Researchers using autonomous platforms are a key market since absorption is not currently measured on these platforms due to limitations of current absorption sensors (e.g., flow-through design, size, power demand, fouling). The flat-faced design also allows for easy incorporation of shutters or wipers to prevent fouling for moored and other long term deployments such as in ocean observatories. The simple and compact design is highly desired for incorporation into existing profiling CTD rosettes used routinely in oceanography.The proposed sensor measuring absorption and backscattering across a wide range of platforms and scales has wide applicability in the field of ocean optics and ocean biology and biogeochemistry. NASA scientists and NASA-funded researchers in these fields routinely measure in-water IOPs and the target market for this sensor is extremely broad.","Similar to the NASA Applications, the target market for the proposed sensor is extremely broad.

This Phase I SBIR proposal addresses two critical areas in MEMS DM development towards the goal of developing flight-like hardware. Namely, Phase I research will further develop Iris AO's proven hybrid MEMS DM technology to: 1) make a critical assembly step in the fabrication process scalable to wafer scales and 2) increase drive electronics resolution to 16 bits while simultaneously reducing power requirements more than three-fold over existing 14-bit resolution electronics. The increased spatial and actuator resolution afforded by the development here will enable picometer resolution DMs required to reach 10^10 contrast levels necessary for direct detection of Earth-sized terrestrial planets.","Iris AO technology can be a key enabling component in a host of future NASA missions, including the space telescopes of the 'Origins' program including Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF), Space Astronomy Far Infrared Telescope (SAFIR), Life Finder, and Planet Imager. Four recent ASMCS concepts require multiple DMs to implement coronagraphs. Two of these, DAViNCI and EPIC, specifically require segmented MEMS DMs. Other potential programs such as Structure and Evolution of the Universe (SEU) and ultraviolet telescopes will also require adaptive optics. Finally, ground based telescopes, like the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), Keck, and Gemini North & South, require adaptive optics to remove aberrations caused by atmospheric turbulence.Another potential area for Iris AO technology is in laser communications with satellites. Iris AO DMs are capable of handling tens to hundreds of Watts of optical power with dielectric coatings. The DMs could be used to compensate for atmospheric turbulence that inhibits downlink and uplink bandwidth.","The proposed adaptive optics technology would find immediate application in several military communications and imaging products. Systems used in military surveillance such as in the Predator drone and Global Hawk would benefit from the high-resolution, light weight, and low power consumption afforded by Iris AO's MEMS. Amtospheric correction enabled by these low-cost but highly capable devices would benefit space situational awareness surveilance applications as well.In the commercial sector, adaptive optics has been employed in research systems in biological imaging, most notably in vision science and microscopy. Several research universities are reporting results using AO-equipped systems. The high segment-count devices enabled by this proposal would lead to unprecedented levels of spatial fidelity for biological imaging applications. Other commercial applications include metrology, laser processing, coherent combination of multiple fiber lasers, and laser beam quality improvement and drift compensation. Iris AO segmented mirrors are uniquely well-suited to higher power applications such as laser processing, combining fiber lasers, and laser beam quality improvement. This advantage lies in the relatively thick segments that enable the use of dielectric coatings which tend to warp conventional surface micromachined MEMS DMs. The precision open-loop operation of Iris AO DMs greatly simplifies the use of DMs in these applications.","Adaptive Optics; Characterization; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and smaller; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Processing Methods; Prototyping"

The overall goal of the SBIR program will be to develop a new class of Application Specified Integrated Circuit (ASIC) driver technology to be used in driver electronics of a deformable mirror (DM) system for reducing power dissipation, improving controllability, enforcing multiplexing bandwidth, and significantly reducing the form factors of the entire DM system for adaptive optics. Through the Phase I project, we aims to transform the technology readiness level from TRL 1 to TRL 2, and in Phase II, the technology readiness level for the proposed ASIC driver system will be promoted from TRL 2 to TRL 4 within a 2-year time frame.","The driver ASIC and a DM will work together to enable NASA's applications including high-performance adaptive optics systems for (1) correction of aberrations in large-aperture, space-deployed optical interferometers and telescopes (e.g. for nulling coronagraph), (2) high-resolution imaging and communication through atmospheric turbulence, and (3) optical path alignment. Based on this NASA-supported ASIC driver platform technology, the products to be enabled through the program will be a series of driver ASICs for serving the deformable mirrors being used and/or to be implemented in NASA's future adaptive optics instrumentations. Not limited to the unique DM solution that our company is developing for NASA, but also applicable to drive DMs developed by other companies as long as the actuators are capacitive and within the working ranges of the driver ASIC. Differentiating itself from traditional driver solutions is its ultralow power dissipation, uncompromised board bandwidth (from quasi-static to up to 100 kHz), compactness, lightweight, and low cost, and should these features be demanded by a specific AO system design, the proposed ASIC technology will be worthy of considerations.","As an enabling technology for deformable mirrors, the ASIC will work together with DMs to enable a commercial application as well. Future non-NASA applications for deformable mirrors include laser beam shaping, ophthalmology and other microscope applications. In our commercial strategy, we plan to develop imaging enhancement chip to meet ophthalmology retinal imaging requirements. In addition, for the Department of Defense, if needed, we would build prototype ASIC/DM integrated module based on the Phase II results and apply these to military seekers, FLIRs and commercial adaptive optical systems. For MEMS industry, the ASIC circuit could be combined with piezoelectric and electrostatic microactuators to serve a large variety of device applications including those in optical MEMS, RF MEMS and Bio MEMS. For example, for electrostatic based MEMS portable display light engines, the ASIC could be implemented to further reduce the power dissipation of the entire display device.","Adaptive Optics; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Image Capture (Stills/Motion); Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and smaller; Mirrors"

Key to the performance of the occulter is achieving sufficiently high out-of-plane stiffness to withstand maneuvering loads as well as meet the shape-tolerance requirement.

The proposed ion-assisted evaporation process is directly scaleable to SiC mirrors several meters in diameter.  The process is based on a novel, low temperature, ion-assisted, evaporation technique (IAD), whereby the coating stress of a silicon film may be manipulated from compressive to tensile, in order to produce a near-zero net stress for the complete layer.   A cladding with little intrinsic stress is essential to minimize bending that would otherwise distort the figure of very lightweight mirrors.   Current methods to produce a polishable silicon cladding utilize CVD processes that produce highly stressed Si coatings.  The current processes require high-temperatures (hundreds of degrees Celsius) and are not readily scaleable to large mirrors.  CVD Si cladding is currently limited to mirror substrates less than 1-meter in diameter.   The proposed IAD process produces little heat, and the mirror size is limited only by the size of the vacuum chamber.Large silicon carbide (SiC) mirrors (3-4 meters in diameter) are being considered for future space-based UVOIR astronomy missions.   These lightweight mirrors will likely require a highly-polishable layer of silicon (10 to 50 microns) applied on top of the SiC.   A relatively thick layer of Si is desirable for the purpose of reducing figuring time and for achieving a super-polished surface, suitable for UV astronomy.  Normal incidence 4-meter class UVOIR telescopes have been cited as a high priority by multiple government review panels including; the National Research Council's (NRC) study of NASA's Space Technology Roadmap and Priorities, The Office of the Chief Technologist, The Cosmic Origins Program and NWNH Decadal.","The ultimate goal of this research is to make silicon clad mirrors for lightweight telescopes.

As diameters of mirrors become larger, existing manufacturing capabilities of single crystal silicon (SCSi) cannot supply sizes that are larger than about 450 mm in diameter. Onyx Optics proposes to develop a process based on our established technique of Adhesive-Free Bonding (AFB®) of single crystals, optical ceramics and glasses that can produce sizes that are larger than commercially available SCSi. The precision composites, consisting of SCSi components, are expected to perform as well as a single crystal. Precision grinding and polishing of large composite SCSi without subsurface damage is a desirable feature for large scan mirror substrates. As part of the proposed manufacturing process, Onyx Optics proposes to develop a technique that is based on electrolytic in-process dressing (ELID) of grinding wheels of decreasing diamond grain sizes. The process is generally applicable to ductile grinding of hard materials such as glass, sapphire, silicon carbide, silicon nitride and SCSi and is known to result in low stress components. Composite SCSi interfaces will be charactized interferometrically at 1.55 micron by their transmitted wavefront. Heat transfer measurements across bonded interfaces of SCSi will be performed at room temperature and liquid nitrogen. Equi-biaxial fracture strength of composite disks will be determined and compared with control disks.","Technology continues to be developed at NASA GSFC to produce SCSi lightweight mirrors for cryogenic and other applications. This proposal aims to contribute to this effort by developing a process to supply mirrors of larger diameter than can readily be produced directly by crystal growth, i.e. larger than about 450 mm diameter.

AOS proposes development of an efficient and accurate metrology system to enable the manufacturing of sements with performance of 0.5 arc-second or better.

Recent X-ray telescopes, such as the Chandra Observatory, utilized reflectors made from zerodur which were up to 20mm thick. The thickness of the reflector as well as the mass limited the number of nested optics that could be implemented. The current state of the art reflectors are made from electroformed nickel/cobalt which is on the order of 1mm thick. The implementation of these thin optics have greatly increased the number of nested reflectors possible. XMM-Newton uses such optics and consists of 58 nested reflectors compared to 4 for Chandra.Aside from the manufacturing cost of the reflectors themselves, the mass of the telescope is a large factor that determines the overall cost of the mission, mainly due to the requirements of the launch vehicle. The proposed innovation seeks to improve upon the current state of the art by replacing much of the NiCo with a stiff, lightweight ceramic material. A thermal spray process will be developed to allow for the deposition of porosity graded alumina onto the rear surface of the reflector. Several diagnostic techniques will be used to adjust the inflight particle state as well as the resulting residual stress of the coating as to not adversely affect the figure accuracy of the optic. The gradation of the alumina layer will allow for CTE matching with the electroformed shell as well as optimization of the ceramic stiffness.By reducing the NiCo layer from 1mm to less than 100um and adding a 200um alumina layer as the support structure the overall mass of the telescope can be greatly reduced and thus reduce the overall cost of the mission. Additionally the overall thinner optic would allow a greater packing density and increase the capabilities of such X-ray telescopes.","X-ray astronomy is highly dependent upon focusing optics as illustrated by the profound influence that results from the Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku observatories are having upon astrophysics. X-ray measurements address many of the major scientific objectives of NASA. They involve the entire range of X-ray emitting objects from the most distant supermassive black holes to planets and comets in our own solar system. Any innovation that can reduce the mass, lower the cost or improve the resolution of a telescope would be important as it would allow future missions to occur sooner and be more effective.The development we are proposing includes fabrication and manufacturing techniques that can benefit X-ray telescope technology and the success in fabricating and testing new lighter weight, stronger material optics will allow high throughput X-ray integral mirror shell telescopes to be substantially lighter weight, with improved angular resolution. This endeavor would lead to the design and development of X-ray optics for future NASA missions such as the Advanced X-ray Spectroscopic Imaging Observatory (AXSIO) and the construction of hard X-ray telescopes for future missions, including Explorer missions.  Future X-ray astronomy missions such as Smart-X will require large effective area and will utilize a segmented optics approach. Our technology studies to fabricate lighter weight substrates which may also be useful for future missions requiring segmented optics.","While the development focuses on x-ray optics, significant possibilities exist for multi-spectral systems (i.e. UV, visible, infrared). These applications can be applied to the area of defense telescopes, commercial space exploration and medical imaging.The proposed innovation of coating microstructure gradation for supporting the precise x-ray optical surface can be applied to other applications due to highly robustness of thermal spray processes including surface conforming ability, large area deposition, fast deposition rate, and versatile process parameter variation as compared to vacuum deposition coating processes. Free standing multi-layer thick coating pipes and tubes manufactured via thermal spray forming process and separation from a graphite mandrel have already been tested. Residual stress management of the multi-functional layers is critical to achieve the uniform geometry as well as good cohesive strength. In conjunction, microstructure gradation via porosity level will reduce the overall system weight while provide enough structural stiffness.TS process is applicable for membrane-type solid oxide fuel cell fabrication in a consecutive and economical deposition process from dense electrolyte layers to porous electrode layers.

This provides two key advantages:  (1) The system can make the transit to Venus in a low-pressure state, which significantly decreases system mass, and (2) the effect of leakage during operation is minimized, providing confidence in long mission lifetime.","The proposed technology would significantly improve energy conversion efficiency for space power systems and enable a unique capability of simultaneously generating electrical power and refrigeration.  The main application for NASA is the Venus lander that will require this duplex capability but in a much more extreme environment.  However, any NASA space power program that requires the generation of electrical power from solar or nuclear sources will be able to transition this technology to accommodate the energy source.   NASA will be able to take advantage of the TASHE driver with no moving parts at the hot end and efficiency as high as any power conversion system currently in use.  Another NASA application for this technology is for ground support equipment for cryogenic propellant densification or zero boil-off where long life, highly reliable compressors will be required to operate cryocoolers.",Potential non-NASA applications include power conversion systems that would use solar concentrators.  These applications could include satellites for in-space applications and ground-based power generation stations.  Department of Defense applications are similar but may use nuclear sources for heat generation.,Conversion; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation)

Localized arc discharges can cause a flashover plasma expansion, that can lead to further discharge of charge stored on dielectric surfaces such as solar panel arrays, which can cause catastrophic events over large areas of the panel array surfaces. While spacecraft charging has been studied for a long time, the dynamics of flashover currents and propagation of the expanding plasma have not be well-characterized, although they are key in order to understand how to mitigate damage to solar panel arrays during discharge events. This project will improve the understanding of arc discharges and expanding plasma effects on dielectric structures such as solar panel arrays so that NASA will better be able to protect satellites from damaging vacuum arc discharges. We will develop accurate numerical simulations that model localized arcs, plasma expansion, and dielectric charging and discharging, under both simulated LEO and GEO plasma conditions. We also plan to extend our models to include the effects of non-uniform ambient plasma densities, secondary electron emission effects, and photo-electron effects.  In Phase I, we will validate our numerical models against the theoretically known problem of expansion of a plasma into a vacuum, and will develop detailed simulations of a new AFRL round-robin experiment to test plasma propagation speeds in the presence of a charged dielectric material.  We also plan to develop easy-to-use GUI interfaces so that NASA scientists will be able to use high-performance computing resources to examine the parameter space for these types of problems without having to dive deep into the code infrastructure and numerics of the simulations.  At the conclusion of Phase II we plan to provide NASA and AFRL scientists with tools that they can use to better understand discharges on satellites and mitigate damage to solar arrays.","Other NASA missions will benefit from this work.

We will undertake several approaches to this problem:* investigate new dielectric materials that will allow a refractive index intermediate between those of the materials that are currently in common use as ARCs; * investigate a dielectric codeposition processes that will allow the fabrication of materials with a wide range of refractive indices; and * investigate oxidation of Al-containing III-V semiconductor compounds as a mechanism for forming a more transparent window layer.

Inc. proposes to develop a high throughput, nominal 100 W Hall Effect Thruster (HET).  This HET will be sized for small spacecraft (< 180 kg), including nano-spacecraft (<20 kg).  An Edison small satellite demonstration mission could feature this thruster fueled by iodine or xenon.The Phase I program has five technical tasks.   In the first task, we will determine the throttling capabilities of an improved version of our flight model 200 W thruster.  The improved thruster includes permanent magnets and a modified magnetic circuit. Based upon test results, the basic dimensions of the new 100 W thruster will be determined.  In the second task, the mechanical design will be created.  In the third task, the magnetic circuit will be modeled using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) tools.  In the fourth task, the plasma discharge will be modeled using existing simulation tools.  In the final technical task, the design will be modeled thermally using COTS tools.  The third, fourth, and fifth tasks will feed back into the design, which will be tailored to balance efficiency against lifetime, operating temperature, mass, volume, and other considerations.In Phase II, the high throughput low power thruster will be manufactured, tested, and improved.  Performance, lifetime, and plume properties will be evaluated.  Testing will include both xenon and iodine.  Recent testing of a BHT-200 fueled by iodine vapor yielded stability and performance comparable to that observed with xenon, along with lower beam divergence.  Iodine also offers many system level benefits including much higher stored density and much lower stored pressure than xenon.This proposal responds to topic S3.03, ""Propulsion Systems.""  Both the ""Electric Propulsion"" and ""Micro-Propulsion"" sub-topics are relevant.  The proposal also addresses several of NASA's Grand Challenges, including Efficient In-Space Transportation, Space Debris Hazard Mitigation, and Economical Space Access.","The HET is an efficient form of electric propulsion that is typically used in space for orbit-raising and orbit maintenance.  The size, low alpha (kg/kW), and simplicity of Hall thrusters make them ideal for many NASA applications including deep space exploration. The proposed device will be well sized for spacecraft < 180 kg.  Integration with nano-spacecraft (<20 kg) is also feasible.  Continuous thrust functions for small, power-limited spacecraft would include orbit insertion and maintenance, in-space maneuvering, orbit raising, and de-orbiting.  In pulsed mode, the thruster could also provide high precision impulse bits for station-keeping and attitude control, precision positioning, and constellation maintenance of small and micro-satellites.  The first NASA application of this technology could be a small satellite demonstration mission.  Such a system could use xenon or iodine propellant.  Subsequent science missions that could utilize thruster technology include NASA Flagship, Frontier, Discovery class missions to Asteroids, comets, dwarf planets, outer planets.  Depending on the destination and capabilities of the spacecraft, thruster could function either by itself or in conjunction with a larger Hall thruster.  The ability to thrust efficiently at multiple power levels is critical for an interplanetary system.  Other applications could include an upper stage for NASA's Nano/Micro Satellite Launch Vehicle (NMSLV), described under topic E1.02.","Hall thrusters are attractive for commercial and military spacecraft due to their high performance, small size, low mass, and relatively low cost.  Continuous thrust functions for small, power-limited spacecraft in LEO would include orbit insertion and maintenance, in-space maneuvering, orbit raising, and de-orbiting.  The thruster is appropriate for spacecraft as small as 5-10 U in size.  Applications for geosynchronous spacecraft would include station-keeping and repositioning.  In pulsed mode, the thruster could provide high precision impulse bits for station-keeping and attitude control, precision positioning, and constellation maintenance of small and micro-satellites.

Sub-kiloWatt EP systems require cathode technology that can produce sufficient current while consuming little or no gas or power.  The most promising technology for meso-scale neutralizers is field emission.  In field emission, electrons are extracted directly from a cold bulk solid material by an intense applied electric field at the solid-vacuum interface with no gas flow and no heating required.  While many methods have been proposed to incorporate field-emission neutralizers in EP systems, the inherent fragility of the technology – specifically the reliance on solid structures with nanometer-radius tips – ensures that device failure due to tip degradation will be a near certainty for any application depending on field emission cathodes. The goal of research proposed here is to develop arrays of field-emission neutralizers for use in sub-1-kW EP that eliminate tip degradation not through attempts to minimize tip wear, but instead by incorporating self-assembling nanostructures that can repeatedly re-generate damaged emitter tips in space and fully restore the functionality of a damaged or degraded device.","Proposed technology could be used for any function requiring electron emission in space.

As launch costs can be up to a third of total mission costs, stepping down to a smaller rocket can be a mission enabling technology in today's budget constrained environment.  While missions such as Dawn have used this to visit multiple asteroids after launch from a small launch vehicle, ExoTerra's SolRider Direct Drive (DD) SEP module allows interplanetary missions to take the next step down in launch cost to package within standard rideshare envelope and mass contraints.  Our module integrates multiple technologies to provide up to 8.6 km/s within an Atlas Aft Bulkhead Carrier rideshare or 14.6 km/s of delta-V within a standard ESPA.  This can enable launch costs below $5M.Our integrated DD SEP module uses a combination of SEP technologies to create a highly efficient system to package within the rideshare envelope. We use a 175 W/kg and 60kW/m3 rolled composite tube solar array deployment system to package within the tight volume.  This provides 300 V power to the thruster through a direct drive system, eliminating the cost, mass and electrical losses of the traditional power processing unit. A Hall Thruster uses the high voltage power to efficiently propel the craft with over 1600 s of Isp.  The thruster receives the propellant from a cryogenic Xenon feed system, allowing an order of magnitude drop in tank mass.  When coupled to Microsatellite electronics, the system can deliver up to 5.5 kg of payload instruments to Mars orbit.","The Microsatellite DD SEP Module enables multiple missions for NASA such as asteroid surveying, interplanetary exploration, sample return systems and technology demonstrations.  NASA has identified over a dozen potential asteroids for human exploration.  Using low cost microsatellites to fly past these objects and determine their composition ahead of a manned mission provides a means for mission planners to select a destination with the highest chance of mission success.  Additionally, the low cost of the satellites enables small, low cost missions to be flown to the Moon, Mars or Venus. While the payload capability of each mission is reduced, a series of missions can be performed at fraction of the cost of a single large mission. Similarly, the high delta V system can be used to return small samples from distant bodies such as the Moon, Mars, Mars' moons or asteroids.  These missions typically require large delta-Vs and small packaging to be financialy viable.Lastly, the system enables technology demonstrations identified by NASA such as SEP spiral-out from LEO, DD plasma/array interaction, and radiation belt measurement to be performed at low cost.","In addition to NASA, the technology provides capabilities to many other users.  In particular, there is a growing number of small/micro launch vehicles such as ALASA being developed.  The DD SEP module provides a means to boost these payloads from LEO to as far as GEO, enabling longer orbit lifetimes and mission possibilities for commercial and government operators.","Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Distribution/Management; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Main Engine"

Note that CHIPS is easily scalable to smaller or larger sizes, depending on mission and payload requirements, by changing the tank volume.  Battery size can either be scaled, or kept the same size if recharging between thrust events is practical for the mission.","The CHIPS thruster provides a compact, non-hazardous, propulsion technology solution that will be made available in a family of sizes that can meet the differing needs of users in NASA, DOD, industry, and academia for CubeSat and nanosatellite missions.",Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Propulsion; Fuels/Propellants; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Spacecraft Main Engine

A much desired silicon MOS gate control is provided readily compatible with the conventional gate drivers, making a proposed module a plug-in replacement for conventional Si IGBT modules offering smaller size and higher power density, lower conduction and switching losses, and higher operating temperature for a wide range of civilian, aerospace and military applications, where compact power converters are needed with minimum cooling requirements.The proposed hybrid Si/SiC cascode approach offers substantial improvement in module power density, by up to 50%, with unique packaging approach, greatly reduced size of a power switch, and elimination of separate antiparallel diode, which is replaced with an intrinsically fast and efficient body diode of a low-voltage Si MOSFET. Significant reduction in static and dynamic power losses compared to Si IGBTs and SiC MOSFETs are achieved by utilization of a fast switched normally-on SiC JFET with ultra-low on-resistance and hence much lower static and dynamic losses than state-of-the-art Si IGBTs and SiC MOSFETs.It is hard to understate the need for compact power converters in aerospace applications, where the allowed on-board space and the weight for the power management systems are very limited. The proposed cascode power module will also enable circuit designers to provide significantly smaller, more reliable, more efficient and lower cost solutions for more mainstream applications such as power factor correction circuits, photovoltaic micro-inverters, power supplies, motors & pump drives, industrial power converters, and consumer appliances.","Compact power management and conditioning systems are of great interest in aerospace applications, where the allowed on-board space and the weight for the power conversion units are very limited. Proposed power module will be a plug-in replacement for conventional IGBT modules, offering substantially smaller physical module size and higher power density, lower conduction and switching losses, higher operating temperature with minimum cooling requirements.  Power device modules capable of operating at higher junction temperatures with reduced conduction and switching losses can help to eliminate the active cooling, or at least reduce the size and weight of the required heat-sinks. Higher switching frequency of silicon carbide device modules will lead to significant reduction in size and weight of passive power converter's components, such as capacitors, filters, inductors.","Funding this proposal will lead to the development and commercialization of a unique compact,  efficient and reliable power SiC JFET power module technology for a wide range of civilian, aerospace and military applications, where compact power converters are needed with minimum cooling requirements.The USCi proposed solution targets the principle ease of use issue and in so effectively becomes an enhanced drop in replacement to existing Si based switches and modules. The application of present state-of-the-art Si MOSFETs, IGBTs and state of the art commercial SiC MOSFETs is limited to junction temperatures of about 150 C. The USCi proposed cascode configuration will raise the steady-state operating junction temperature to over 175 C rating. Proposed cascode power module will enable circuit designers to provide significantly smaller, more reliable, more efficient and lower cost solutions for applications such as power factor correction circuits, photovoltaic micro-inverters, power supplies, motors & pump drives, industrial power converters, and consumer appliances.

To provide a near term commercial focus in addition to NASA space applications, BT is augmenting this team with Astral Infinity (AI) to provide one target application that requires flywheel energy storage systems with characteristics that exceed current flywheel systems and exceed lithium battery capabilities – a solar powered high altitude long endurance unmanned air vehicle. This proposal, focuses on making a major near-term advancement in flywheel energy density, with high potential for further longer term advancements, by exploiting ANI carbon nanotube expertise and CEM/BT flywheel technology. After having plateaued for two decades, there is a good probability of attaining near-term improvement of 30%-50% for flywheel rotor specific energy by reinforcing the carbon fiber composite matrix material with CNT. Subsequently, there is a potential improvement in the medium to longer term of an order of magnitude or more by also replacing the current carbon fibers with fibers composed of CNTs. Our program focuses on the near-term objective and is a first and appropriate step in the longer term objective. In particular, for this Phase I project our team will:1.Develop a concept design for a flywheel rotor that relies on CNT reinforced composite flywheels for a 30%-50% increase in  flywheel stored energy per kg to substantially exceed the specific energy performance of chemical batteries (e.g., lithium batteries) for most space-based and terrestrial applications of a few kW-hrs or more, and 2.Complete an initial round of CNT materials testing to support the design.","Our team's carbon nanotube (CNT) reinforced carbon fiber composite system enables substantially improved flyhweel specific energy (kW-hr/kg) in the near term and long term that enables many NASA energy storage and power management applications – especially when coupled with very reliable high speed low-loss bearing systems (e.g., Balcones Technologies high temperature superconducting magnetic bearings).  The prime space applications are those where long term (greater than five years) operation, extremely low losses, and high reliability are at a premium.  The energy density and cycle life of 100,000 cycles of the flywheel rotor for this system greatly exceeds that of available battery technology, leading to a lower cost over the life of the device.  Applications that could benefit from this technology range from satellites, to long term space labs like the ISS, to lunar colonies, or explorations.  Terrestrial applications include community energy storage systems, power and energy management, and backup for launch facilities or data centers.  The technology can also be applied to high altitude long endurance air vehicles which could support NASA's Airborne Science, Atmospheric Composition and Radiation Sciences, Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry, and Applied Sciences programs as well as the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS).","Our team's carbon nanotube (CNT) reinforced carbon fiber composite system enables substantially improved flywheel specific energy (kW-hr/kg) in the near term and long term that enables many commercial energy storage and power management applications especially where long life (greater than five years) operation and load leveling, extremely low losses, high stability and high reliability capabilities are at a premium.  There are numerous existing commercial applications where battery developers are struggling to meet the requirements, including the large installations required for windmill farms, large solar installations, and support of micro grids.  The proposed CNT reinforced composite technology is critical in enabling flywheels to address those markets.  However, our primary near term focus is the use of flywheel energy storage to enable a solar powered high altitude long endurance (HALE) air vehicle to stay aloft for an indefinite period of time for a wide range of commercial, space, and military applications.  Astral Infiniti's research indicates that a high energy density flywheel is an enabling technology due to its improved performance over available battery technology and the ability to directly convert rotating flywheel motion to propeller motion.  HALE can be used to replace cell phone towers in urban and rural areas and provides a lower cost alternative to satellites that are used to broadcast radio, television, and internet communications.",Attitude Determination & Control; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Nanomaterials; Navigation & Guidance; Polymers; Processing Methods; Storage

These units are simpler and lower cost to manufacture than photonic or capacitive coupled methods of measurement and possessing and furthermore provide far greater (galvanic) isolation capability than is presently achievable.  Moreover they can safely/reliably operate over a wide temperature range to as low as cryogenic.  The innovation eliminates the present need for separate isolation and gain stages as these are now accomplished in a single step as to reduce design complexity and risk.  The effort is to show that these new striction power flow monitoring capabilities can measure power characteristics over wide bandwidth to DC and are highly suitable for widespread NASA use in wide temperature range and high radiation environments.  The proposed modular design will be easy to install and reduces the spares requirements.","Power flow monitoring is pervasive and essential across all NASA platforms and subsystems, but the highest pay-off of the new technology innovation will be to NASA missions that need to operate in harsh exposure missions requiring high temperature (extreme cold or extreme hot) and radiation tolerance.

The proposed effort will focus on the engineering work involved with the retrieval of volcanic ash plume samples.  This work will build upon a previous NASA SBIR Phase I project Latitude Engineering completed in 2011: the development of an Advanced Guided Dropsonde (AGD).   Though the tested prototype received favorable reviews, funding restructuring of the SBIR program within NASA prevented funding for Phase II.  To keep the momentum behind this innovative airborne platform, Latitude Engineering is proposing to build upon this accomplishment: refine the current dropsonde design and develop a sampling system for atmospheric particulates that will be integrated into this 4 cm diameter research vessel.  Miniaturized particulate sampling equipment for airborne missions is not commercially available.  Even for full scale systems, many research programs develop their own collection and sensor systems.  With the small size limitations of the AGD, a multi-stage particulate sampler can be developed that can collect size segregated particulate including aerosols.  With the significant need for atmospheric particulate sampling, the AGD can offer unprecedented access to atmospheric samples including those at high altitudes.The key goals of this Phase I proposal are to demonstrate the capability of the AGD to be released from a host manned aircraft, collect an atmospheric particulate sample from a pre-programmed altitude and location, and deliver the protected sample to a pre-programmed recovery area. This system, engineered to be cost compatible with existing dropsonde launch systems, is recoverable and re-useable.","Latitude's AGD was designed to fit the MIST dropsonde system used on NASA's Global Hawk UAV.

Of particular interest is the Ice Bridge mission, which takes observations in support of Arctic and Antarctic research by identifying ice sheet motion, three-dimensional ice features, and other atmospheric and surface effects. These UAS aircraft may be equipped with a variety of sensors, with each aircraft potentially completing a unique set of objectives, only some of which take advantage of or require distributed sensing. Such a flexible system demands that vehicles be capable of seamless entry and exit of aircraft from any distributed sensing task. The approach proposed here satisfies these needs through a distributed sensing architecture that allows cluster sensor information to interface with and influence a multi-aircraft, high-precision, closed-loop path planning and control system. In addition, the UAS path planner is capable of managing dynamic flight regimes, including high winds and turbulence, while ensuring proper target tracking. This combination of features maximizes mission utility and path repeatability.","Distributed sensing for UASs has immediate significance for NASA's Ice Bridge project, which fills the gap between IceSat-1 and IceSat-2 for identifying ice sheet motion, three-dimensional ice features, and other atmospheric and surface effects. Characteristic measurements include some which require just one aircraft and others which will achieve significant improvements through distributed sensing. UAS sensing is important for other terrestrial science applications and has potential to support multiple aspects of the U.S. Global Change Research Program. These range from tracking severe weather events through the Genesis and Rapid Intensification Process (GRIP) program, which uses both manned and unmanned probes, to enabling aircraft-based interferometric synthetic aperature radar (InSAR) for tracking biomass distribution and ice sheet motion in anticipation of the Deformation, Ecosystem Structure and Dynamics of Ice (DESDyNI) spacecraft.","Non-NASA agencies can also realize benefits from both a distributed sensing architecture and robust path planning methodology for UASs. Such a system would enhance United States Geological Survey (USGS) vegetation assessments in low-accessibility swamplands and forests by reducing overall program costs and improving measurement fidelity through the use of multiple simultaneous sensors. The Civil Air Patrol and Coast Guard would both benefit from tracking applications similar to those proposed for Ice Bridge, which could be used to aid in ground or maritime search operations in inclement weather to both track and effectively locate emergency signals; this enhanced ability to find vessels in distress in otherwise dangerous weather would significantly improve survival rates by ensuring timely location of vessels in distress. As costs for UAVs decline, border patrol and state law enforcement could use this technology to track persons or goods through inaccessible or difficult locales without endangering ground personnel.","Ad-Hoc Networks (see also Sensors); Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Sequencing & Scheduling; Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)"

Current remote-sensing methods for sampling soil moisture often fail to provide measurements with adequate spatial and temporal resolution, or any indication of moisture content at typical root depths. This work involves the integration of existing sensor, airframe, and autopilot technologies to construct a novel sensing platform.  The scientific payload will be  a passive microwave sensor in the L-band to map soil moisture content. The airframe utilized is the Tempest, originally designed for sampling tornadic thunderstorms and is a robust, easy to operate design that can takeoff and land on unimproved surfaces. The avionics will be based on the SwiftPilot system which consists of an autopilot board, wireless link for communication, command and control, ground station, and tablet based user interface.  The SwiftPilot system provides a simple, intuitive interface for conducting sUAS missions making it ideal for scientific applications. Tight integration of the sensor with the sUAS avionics and airframe will enable precise flight control for low altitude missions in the range of 15m-30m above ground level (AGL) enabling the sensor to accurately map soil moisture with a resolution approaching 15m. The PI's working knowledge of the regulatory environment surrounding sUAS will be used to inform the development of the system and associated concept of operations. This will facilitate operation in the national airspace following FAA approval. The technical goal of this Phase I proposal is to design the interfaces; mechanical, electrical, and software required for integration of the sUAS. This will include the design of experiments for testing and validating this unique sensing platform in Phase II to assess the the performance in the desired scientific missions.","Two applications have been identified that build upon the results from prior NASA projects where small UAS were not used as a delivery platform.  The use of remote-sensing techniques to measure soil moisture is well established in a number of scientific disciplines such as hydrology and environmental studies among others.  The NASA systems typically used in the past for this purpose focus on satellite based systems such as the AMSR-E radiometers mounted on the EOS Aqua satellite, and the C and X band radiometers specified for the HYDROS mission. A sUAS system carrying similar radiometers will be able to improve on both the spatial and temporal resolution achievable through satellite based measurements. Furthermore, sensing at low altitudes enables the use of lower frequency radiometers (e.g. L band) that can penetrate deeper. This has the advantage of providing soil moisture measurements less likely to be confounded by canopy moisture. sUAS based systems can also complement data obtained from manned aircraft missions. Dr. Gasiewksi previously led a NASA funded research effort at the University of Colorado Center for Environmental Technology (CET) to map soil moisture in a region of North Texas and Oklahoma that suffered from severe flooding. A P-3B aircraft operating a Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer (PSR) was used for this purpose.  The proposed technology will be able to replicate the capabilities and validate the results of the CET mission at a fraction of the cost.","The sensor-bed on the proposed technology can be used for a host of non-NASA applications such as land cover mapping, soil content characterization, water table analysis, and drought management among others. Given the current FAA regulations restricting commercial UAS usage in the NAS, potential lead users are currently limited to the public sector. As a preliminary application domain the focus will be on by providing comprehensive information for drought management.  This will be achieved by collaborating with of the Colorado State University Agricultural Extension Service located in close proximity to our facilities. This  public entity has a well-established, reputable research and consulting mandate targeted at providing actionable information to end-users in the agricultural market. The distribution network of its consulting arm is an attractive and convenient mechanism to deploy the technology, once developed. To-date, preliminary interviews have been conducted by Black Swift Technologies with both the Agricultural Extension Service and the Colorado Department of Agriculture to identify the crop varieties and geographic domains where targeted data gathering on water management and application would be most useful.",Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Microwave; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)

These goals are supported in three direct capacities:1)by expanding capabilities of autonomous systems as outlined in the Robotics, Tele-Robotics, and Autonomous Systems (Technology Area 04) Roadmap.

This theme is highlighted by our industry partner's willingness to support the MAMS project at this early stage of development as shown by their letter of support. Future development plans of the system include expanding vehicle capabilities to include all forms of unmanned aircraft, as well as transition to autonomous surface, underwater vehicles, and towed systems for naval uses and autonomous robotic ground platforms. The MAMS has great potential in the field of disaster and environmental event monitoring: the system could be used to more precisely monitor volcanic ash clouds, such as those that severely disrupted air travel during the Iceland volcano eruptions in 2010; to direct teams of UAVs and autonomous surface vehicles to monitor oil spills such as the BP oil spill disaster in the summer of 2010; or to provide sensor coverage to measure chemical or nuclear release such as in the Fukushima Power Plant accident in 2011. In addition to disaster monitoring, the system could also be used in disaster relief scenarios.

The proposed tether system is capable of determining the location and orientation of marsupial robots as they navigate difficult terrain.  The tether system will also provide shape and tension information along the entire tether, distinguishing elevation changes, tension due to snags, and potential points of harm.  The tension feedback is particularly crucial, as it can be used to determine whether the rover has fallen down a slope or cliff, lost traction, or whether it is still moving under its own power.  The system is based on Luna's unique fiber optic position and shape sensing technology, and is an enabling technology for obtaining images, data, and samples in areas with difficult terrain.  In addition to providing new, vital feedback, the fiber optic shape sensor within the tether is lightweight, small, and flexible.  Luna's unique shape sensing fiber also has the potential to provide both communication and power through the same fiber, further reducing the size and weight of the total tether package.","NASA's Mars rovers have exceeded all goals and expectations, but they are still limited in the types of terrain that they can cover.  Small, rugged marsupial robots with self-localizing and tension-monitoring tethers have the potential to reach critical sampling sites, explore steep craters, and navigate up and down sheer cliff faces on Mars, the Moon, asteroids, and other large bodies within our solar system.  Self-localizing tethers also enable higher levels of precision for precursor-mission construction and manipulation robots sent to build infrastructure for later human missions to Mars, the Moon, and beyond.","Robots used for urban search and rescue have a significant challenge with localization since typical means such as GPS are not available inside a collapsed structure, and rubble and difficult terrain can snag tethers without the robot's knowledge.

This system employs an innovative lightweight 'orbital winch' with the capacity for rapid tether deployment and high load retrieval or towing.  The unique design of the orbital winch accomplishes cable winding and deployment without rotating the spool, minimizing mass and power consumption, while eliminating the need for electrical and optical slip-ring.  The SPIDER system also integrates a launcher that can be used to deploy a wide variety of tethered end-effectors to provide new capabilities for sample retrieval and sensing.  A carousel of these stowed end-effectors will allow selection of appropriate implements for a desired task.  For example, tethered anchor end-effectors could give planetary rovers the ability to rappel down ravines, tow themselves up steep slopes, or free themselves from a stuck position.  Sensing and sampling end-effectors with data- and power- transmitting tethers can be deployed and retrieved from otherwise inaccessible areas, giving in-situ feedback via optical fibers.  The SPIDER system can also be a launch platform for subsurface boring or ice-penetrating probes such as the Cryobot.  Moreover, by launching an RF transmitter/receiver, the system could improve communications for a planetary rover entering a geologic feature that would impede radio contact, such as a lava tube. The Phase I effort will mature the SPIDER to TRL 4 by testing prototypes of key components, and the Phase II will mature an integrated system to TRL 6 by testing and qualifying a prototype in a relevant terrestrial environment.","The SPIDER system will allow NASA exploration missions to extend scientific investigations in previously inaccessible terrain.  It will enable rovers to explore craters, cliffs, caves and gullies.  It will enable sensor, sampler, and communication device placement and retrieval.  The SPIDER system may also be used for deployment and retrieval of sampling systems in zero-G environments.","The SPIDER system could enable small robots used by Search and Rescue teams to locate victims in rubble due to earthquake or mine collapse.  It could provide greater mobility for military and recreational vehicles.  Additionally, the SPIDER system can providing high-bandwidth communications and power for mobile robots and ROV's in military and civilian applications, such as urban tactical operations and underground environments, exploration of caves or mines, inspection of ship hulls, and inspection of water, sewer, and oil lines.",Cables/Fittings; Deployment; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Surface Propulsion; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)

Bear developed a complete planetary sample acquisition system called the Universal Sampling System (USS) which includes the baseline drill with Non-Rotating Technology (NRT Coring Drill) which was funded under a SBIR Phase 2 contract.  Bear has several concepts for creating additional capabilities among them is the proposed Surface Abrasion Tool (SAT).  The proposed innovation is a critical system component for meeting the science objectives of planetary sample return. Bear proposes to research and advance a Rock Abrasion (MER Rovers) like tool that can attach to and is driven by an existing coring drill thus requiring no additional motors.  The proposed innovation has broad significance for the exploration of planets and small bodies. The proposed project is directly relevant to the topic as it addresses the importance of technologies for robotic mobility, manipulation, and sampling for in-situ analysis or return to earth from planetary small bodies, including Mars, Venus, comets, asteroids, and planetary Moons.Two main goals of the research are to:1. Develop a method for attaching the surface abrasion tool to the larger coring drill without additional motors or wires. 2.  Research the possible benefits/tradeoffs of cutting rather than grinding to remove rock surface with power constraints.Regardless of which technique is used to prepare the surface (cutting or grinding), the passive tool will strive to reduce the time it takes to prepare rock surfaces versus state of the art.","As part of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)/National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s planetary exploration missions, its scientists and engineers are developing in-situ sample collection mechanisms. The mechanisms need to be compact, efficient, low mass, and consume low power.  [7] It is believed that this SAT will meet and exceed the need described in the subtopic and appeal to both the overall strategy of planetary exploration and to the flagship mission of Mars Sample Return [8].  The device can be tailored to any planetary science mission.","If the concept of cutting for large area surface abrasion in harsh environments proves out, the technology has applications for surface abrasion on earth. The design can be modified specifically for underwater research applications from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) where sample collection for study of coral colonies is also a program requirement.  (Solicitation:  NOAA 2012-1)  Additionally, the abrading method and tools that result from the research can prepare harsh environment earth surfaces for sample collection and testing; for example, mining environments, volcanoes and deep sea areas of scientific interest.  There is potential to use the abrading tool in nuclear sites as well.  SBIR funding supports Bear's 10-year commercialization and growth strategies.  Bear has two main focus areas: 1.

Scaling down of liquid propulsion systems, as shown in the figure, is difficult.  In the 100-kg class of vehicles, liquid propellant vehicle designers should expect a propellant fraction of only 0.75.  In contrast, solid rocket motors (SRM) scale down much easier, so designers should expect a propellant fraction of at least 0.92.  To be practical, however, the SRM must operate in extreme low temperature environments, which is difficult for state of the art polybutadiene binders.  ASI proposes to develop a new, low temperature binder based upon siloxane.  Siloxane polymers have glass transition temperatures below 150K, making them ideal for use on Mars with little or no external heaters required.  A siloxane binder SRM-based MAV will easily achieve the propellant fraction needed for a sample return mission.","Our primary technology insertion opportunity within NASA is the Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission.  The Mars climate enforces a uniquely stressing environment that every propulsion system must deal with.  However, we are also aware that NASA is focusing upon spacecraft and lander missions to asteroids and other near-earth bodies that will require operating at extreme low temperatures approaching -270�C—a scant 3�C above absolute zero—that will test the limits of every known material.  From a propulsion system perspective, such missions demand, to an even greater extent than MSR, the kind of performance siloxane binders appear to offer.  We are not aware of any polymer with a glass transition temperature near the liquid temperature of helium, so these missions will require electric heaters for the motor.  Siloxane binders would reduce the power requirements for such spacecraft.Other potential NASA uses will be in the Space Launch System (SLS) program, perhaps used as ullage settling motors (USM), tower jettison motors, or even crew escape system motors.  We are aware, of course, that motor designs currently exist (and have been tested) for these uses, but there may come a time when the additional structural margin at low launch temperatures is needed.  Siloxane binders can fill that need.","Tactical missiles and rockets are generally required to operate between -65�F and +160�F, a temperature range often referred to as the tactical temperature limits.  However, there are several systems in the field today that are restricted to minimum operable temperatures well above the lower tactical limit because grain structural margins are not adequate at -65�F.  This is a direct result of a mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion between propellant and case, as well as from the high glass transition temperature (Tg) of HTPB.  The propellant stiffness goes up dramatically as Tg is approached, which has an undesirable effect on the allowable stresses and strains in the grain.  A siloxane-based composite formulation, with its significantly lower Tg, could ease those low temperature firing limitations.  Additionally, the hydrophobic nature of siloxane polymers may also have a positive benefit to motor service life, since hydrolytic scission of the binder—a major component of composite propellant aging—will no longer be possible.Ballistic parachute deployment is a commercial market in which a motor that uses the proposed binder would serve well.  It is also a market with which we already have an association. In the spring of 2007, ASI was approached by Ballistic Recovery Systems for help in scaling their current deployment motor.  We will re-engage that company during execution of this Phase I to determine whether the new binder system would fit their needs.","Atmospheric Propulsion; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Fuels/Propellants; Launch Engine/Booster; Polymers; Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Surface Propulsion"

COARSE consists of a series of high level goals with specific set of execution steps, rather than complex interaction with ground control.  This proposal plans to develop and simulate a basic optimizer for the purpose of a robotic spacecraft in proximity operations to an asteroid for a sample return mission, and implement in a spacecraft avionics software environment.

While large asteroids in the asteroid belt can exhibit a significant amount of gravity, most near-earth asteroids are small and show a surface gravity of less than 0.1% of earth.  Landing, and staying on the surface of such a small object is a challenge, especially for manned missions.  Just the movement of an astronaut in and out of the lander during excursions would most likely dislodge the vehicle.  Similarly, drilling for a sample return mission requires the ability to exert force onto the surface without pushing the lander off the surface.  A solid anchoring system is required, but made difficult due to the potentially rubble-like consistency of small asteroids, which makes classic mechanical anchoring difficult.Adherent Technologies, Inc. (ATI) has developed innovative materials for space use for over a decade.  These include inflatable structures, self-sealing membranes, coatings for satellites and solar sails, and vacuum-deployable foams.  The proposed program will combine these technologies to produce an anchoring system that deploys either a sticky screen that can attach to a solid rock formation or a foam injection anchor that can bind a large amount of rubble as an anchoring point.  The system is modular, and a decision which anchoring method to use only needs to be made on location.","With the potentially large commercial potential of asteroid mining, the anchoring system is not a one-shot application.  Multiple ""path finder"" missions will be needed to identify lucrative asteroids, and a modular anchoring system capable of supporting a variety of mission profiles have the potential for series production, at least by space mission standards.","A second space application is the removal of orbital debris using the anchor screen to capture objects in space and de-orbit them using a small rocket motor.  The large number of identified orbital debris parts will again require a long-term production of such units to clear commercially or militarily important orbits.  Additionally, the same type of units could be attached to newly launched satellites or the space station to provide a close in debris defense mechanism when changes to the space craft orbit are too energy intensive or would bring the space craft into the trajectory of other debris.The foams developed for this program also have applications in emergency ground stabilization, remediation of mining tailings and in the stabilization of asbestos prior to removal.","Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Polymers; Prototyping; Resource Extraction; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors)"

Performing large-scale, massively parallel computations on modern supercomputing platforms is a very challenging task in and of itself. It requires huge amounts of analyst resources to construct datasets, transfer files, build codes, submit and monitor jobs, and analyze and archive results. This workflow requires significant attention to detail, and it is easy to miss steps, set up incorrect file or directory structures for datasets, spend inordinate effort to understand each computing platform and its unique job submission requirements, and decide how and where to archive potentially terabytes of simulation results. Collaboration among engineers is hampered by non-centralized storage of results, permission issues, and the sheer size of simulation result sets. Even for seasoned, veteran HPC users, the complexity of the overall HPC use process can be a barrier to daily use. We propose a system to streamline this workflow, provide audit trails for data used in simulations, code versions used, and storage locations of results, as well as integrating tools for file transfer, job submission, batch visualization, and other tasks that require engineer's time that is better spent considering the simulation itself. Further, the proposed SLMIR application (Simulation Lifecycle Management – IllinoisRocstar) sets up the infrastructure for collecting simulation data across an organization or organizations, so that engineers and scientists may discover information generated by others in their research areas, potentially saving time and money by leveraging previous work and avoiding duplication. The envisioned system targets users of HPC tools in the field, rather than developers writing those tools, since engineers and scientists in manufacturing and engineering industries are heavily invested in the results of using the tools.","This project will provide pathways to three products available to NASA -- software, engineering services, and turn-key systems.

As such, it is anticipated that the system can be tailored to specific NASA customer's cluster-based simulation needs, as industry moves to depending on simulation technologies for competitive advantage, and purchase clusters of their own. This market will be tied to Engineering Services, and if Phase III funding can be identified to support a strong open-source support organization at IllinoisRocstar, then an open-source engineering services model can be considered.","The goal of the SLMIR project is to provide interfaces and services that make HPC a viable resource for non-HPC experts to use. In addition to software, it is anticipated that many organizations do not want to deal with the expense and in-house costs of developing and maintaining the hardware necessary for HPC either. We anticipate configuring our software, along with customer-requested software on commercial systems, and testing, and delivering the complete solution to commercial clients. Consulting services will be available based on the extensibility of the proposed system. IllinoisRocstar has the broad-based experience with a wide variety of supercomputing platforms to allow support of the proposed system on platforms located at industrial locations, NASA, DoD components, DOE, and other private companies. We anticipate specializing interfaces and processes for companies to use their own in-house codes with the system.","Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

This has resulted in what is known asthe ""communication gap"" for communication-bound HPC applications: theircommunication-to-computation time-ratio is so large, that the processorsremain mostly sub-utilized, with lots of ""disposable"" FLOPS available. Inthe last few years, scientists have proposed to use these disposable FLOPS(which otherwise would be wasted idling) to compress and decompress thecommunicated data so to effectively speed up the underlying application.Although the idea bears tremendous potential, efforts in this direction haveconsistently rendered very poor results, with typical resulting speedupsaveraging below 1.5x. In this project, we identify the strongest reasons whytraditional data compression has fallen short in terms of speedupperformance for HPC, and propose novel techniques particularly crafted forgroundbreaking performance within the HPC framework. Preliminary resultsshow that these techniques break the 10x speedup markup consistently for awide class of HPC applications of primary importance to NASA. We propose todevelop the theory and methods behind these techniques, which ultimatelywill result into a library product for transparent acceleration of HPCcommunication platforms, such as MPI.

Some of the most representative areas include the following:- Aerospace/automotive industries, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), defense, weather and climate research, computational molecular dynamics, combustion, computational electromagnetics, and weather forecasting.Nowhere is the role of supercomputing more important than at NASA. Given the magnitude of NASA's broad-based computer applications, where large-scale simulations are required ubiquitously, this organization has traditionally been at the vanguard of supercomputing advances. The proposed technology enables a significant leap in performance for applications at the core of NASA's mission, and we expect the commercial opportunities that arise from this project to be large and impacting.","Several HPC applications in industry and other Government Agencies apart from NASA also have the potential to be accelerated through novel compression techniques such as the ones proposed in this SBIR project.

Futures are a tool used to manage or hedge risk, reduce volatility, improve food security, and maximize efficiency and profit on the open market. Currently, the rice futures market has little high quality and timely information available to make strategic or application specific decisions to reduce risk and maximize profit.

The emphasis is on visual analytics which will allow all these diverse geospatial data to be integrated and analyzed on a real-time basis in an intuitive manner.

Often, this involves semi-autonomous exploration to collect a representative set of different scenes and objects so that research scientists and mission controllers can decide what regions are of particular interest and should be explored further. The lack of bandwidth to transmit all this data back from deep space has prompted the need to determine what data is relevant, important, and interesting enough to be sent back immediately. A common understanding among potential consumers (including the general public) of what signifies as an image or sensor reading of value is needed. To make these decisions quickly, the data needs to be presented intuitively using a common semantic vocabulary that describes interesting or anomalous features or events (e.g., composition of a certain mineral above some threshold, visual evidence of terrain features created by moving water, or a volcanic eruption in real-time during an orbital pass) so that opportunities for further inspection and analysis are not lost to long transmission times. We propose a framework for onboard intelligent data understanding algorithms to mitigate this opportunity risk and improve collection efficiency and effectiveness by summarizing the data and enabling the download of a subset containing the most valuable portions called Discovery of Interesting Patterns and Semantic Analysis in Remote Space (DIPSARS). DIPSARS is a framework for semantically characterizing, detecting, and fusing interesting and anomalous 1D sensor measurements and 2D imagery onboard remote spacecraft and planetary rovers to conserve transmission bandwidth. We do this by summarizing data events so that mission controllers and research scientists can analyze representative feature data and provide instructive feedback to seize emergent opportunities for data collection.","Advanced pattern recognition, knowledge modeling, and visual analytics are core business areas for Charles River Analytics, making the success of this effort fall squarely within our corporate interests and competencies. We will leverage our expertise in these areas to ensure the success of the technologies developed under the DIPSARS program beyond the end of the SBIR contract. The mature research developed under the DIPSARS effort will provide NASA with the capability to detect and semantically characterize interesting and anomalous 1D sensor measurements and 2D imagery onboard remote spacecraft and planetary rovers. Use of the capability will conserve transmission bandwidth by summarizing data using representative samples and semantic labeling so that mission controllers and research scientists can analyze representative feature data and provide instructive feedback to seize emergent opportunities for data collection. Primary NASA commercial application candidates include the XSearch and Monitoring Inductive Software System (AMISS) projects in support of potential NASA planetary rover missions (e.g., Mars Sample Return (MSR)) and celestial body observation missions (e.g., Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN)).  Other applications cited in NASA's Technology Area Strategic Roadmap for Modeling, Simulation, Information Technology and Processing may also become candidates with the maturation of the technology.","We expect the full-scope DIPSARS to have immediate and tangible benefits for a number of military planning and visualization systems. The capability will enable more effective semi-autonomous mobile robotic missions in the Special Operations and ISR communities by increasing the efficiency of operators and analysts during tactical situations.

Engineering framework tools now provide a new level of integration with systems engineering, high fidelity computation, mission modeling, and collaborative infrastructures. Innovative visualization technology is required to represent the larger and more complex outputs generated by these frameworks. Our proposed solution will address these issues by developing a visualization environment designed from the start to handle extremely large data sets and providing greater flexibility in terms of the graphical output types that can be produced. This work will involve the use of software technology to parallelize operations, use the GPU, improve memory allocation, and use modern libraries such as OpenGL for efficient rendering. Algorithms to study the ""white space"" in trade spaces and extend Pareto frontiers into these blank areas will be included. New data mining and clustering algorithms for obtaining insight into complex data sets, involving many parameters, will be built into the visualizer.  Features to interact with the underlying computational model (in ModelCenter) and change it easily to observe its effect on the visualized output will be provided. A representative example will be created as a means of demonstrating the new features to NASA and industry. The example will incorporate several new framework technologies (MBSE, mixed fidelity modeling, etc.) and show how the new visualization environment complements these. The new visualizer will be incorporated and commercialized within ModelCenter as a plug-in alongside existing visualization environments.","A major benefit of the proposed visualization environment is that it is generic and can be applied to the entire life cycle of any complex project. The new technology reaches up to the broader systems level, through MBSE tools, and down to the higher fidelity engineering levels. Target markets within NASA are expanded, therefore, to include a wider audience. These include Science, Human Exploration and Operations, and Aeronautics Research directorates. Indeed, ModelCenter and its current visualizer are used in these areas today. By providing visualization that takes a whole systems approach, involves large data sets, and allows for insightful viewing of these, opportunities beyond the traditional engineering workgroup will present themselves. Initial applications are anticipated in the Science mission area dealing with advanced opto-mechanical design of space telescopes or robotic exploration. Another ripe area is at JPL, for visualization of architectural alternatives in fractionated satellite systems. As the benefits are demonstrated, additional applications will be pursued within NASA directorates that include space transportation and air vehicle technologies. Government agencies that partner with NASA on joint programs such as DOE, NSF, and FAA could constitute a related target market. Prime NASA contractors such as Boeing, Space X, Orbital Sciences, and Sierra Nevada are strong candidates for application, several of which already use Phoenix technology.","Beyond NASA, Phoenix Integration's commercialization efforts will be focused primarily on the aerospace and defense sector where companies are already actively interested in the visualization technology discussed in this proposal. Phoenix Integration is well positioned to introduce this technology to leading organizations in this business sector such as BAE, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Pratt and Whitney, and Raytheon, since they already utilize the company's products. Phoenix Integration software tools are widely used by domain level engineers to analyze, design, and optimize the subsystems, components, and processes that make up complex aerospace systems. By leveraging this existing installed base, it will be possible to quickly achieve initial sales and establish a core user base for the new technology.  After establishing penetration in aerospace and defense, Phoenix Integration will build upon the successes to pursue secondary markets such as automotive, heavy equipment, green energy, shipbuilding, transportation, and process industries.

In order to guarantee FM effectiveness and control the cost, tools are required to automate fault-tree generation and updates based on design models specified in standardized design languages such as AADL.  Accordingly, we propose a fault tree generation and augmentation environment (FTGA).  Equipped by a fault class model and an FM method catalog, FTGA evaluates not only failure behavior in the application under analysis but also FM's capability and adequacy for failure mitigation.  Moreover, when an inadequacy in FM is revealed during fault tree generation or analysis, the fault tree will be allowed for augmentation through FM method insertion and be followed by a quantitative evaluation for FM effectiveness validation.  Therefore, unlike traditional fault tree analysis which plays a passive role in FM, the automated FTGA environment actively and explicitly influence system design and updates, enabling ""fault-tree-in-the-loop"" for a system's life cycle.  Further, by separating its generic functions (which we collectively call ""shared package"") from design-language-specific functions (which we collectively call ""interface package""), FTGA will be an extensible modeling environment.  The anticipated results from the Phase I project will be a preliminary prototype of FTGA and a demonstration for concept validation.","An immediate application of FTGA will be NASA missions of Science Mission Directorate.  Especially, FTGA can be applied to Spacecraft and Satellite Command and Data Handling subsystems, in order to balance between the objective for the quality of FM and the concern about the monetary budget.  Other important NASA applications include 1) design of avionics systems in spacecraft, 2) devices and computers for long-life missions for which traditional repair and maintenance are not possible, 3) deep-space network communication systems which are critical to mission control and success, 4) design of contingency plans for robotics missions to outer planets, 5) design and development of the approaching, entering, and landing processes for deep-space missions to outer planets, 6) design of fault-tolerant sequences for robotics missions, and 7) design and development of radiation-tolerant field-programmable gate arrays.","Military and commercial avionics systems, as well as command and data handling subsystems, are also very relevant for FTGA applications.  For example, AADL-model-based risk analysis and mitigation can be applied to Army's helicopter avionics systems to aid in simultaneous determination and placement of high assurance partitions and related guard mechanisms to meet application requirements on dependability, safety, and confidentiality.  All those aspects are crucial to military aircraft, including unmanned aerial/ground vehicles (UAVs/UGVs) in which data confidentiality is a critical aspect in case of a crash occurring in enemy's field.  Since our model-based, integrated method which offers not only analytic solution and results but also ""prescriptive solutions"" to resolve discovered risks,  FTGA applications are highly appropriate for the automobile, truck, and commercial aircraft industries of which good dependability and safety ratings are the most important criterion for manufactures to gain and maintain the competitiveness of their business.","Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Architecture/Framework/Protocols; Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Command & Control; Computer System Architectures; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Distribution/Management; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Network Integration; Process Monitoring & Control; Quality/Reliability; Recovery (see also Autonomous Systems); Recovery (see also Vehicle Health Management); Sequencing & Scheduling; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems); Tools/EVA Tools; Training Concepts & Architectures; Transport/Traffic Control; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems); Verification/Validation Tools"

Designed to run in a distributed environment, DyMA-FM enables model-based reasoning and predictive modeling for FM applications. With the appropriate hardware, DyMA-FM can respond to signals at the device level while still placing each signals in context with the larger system and the overall mission objective. This functionality is enabled by a layered software architecture and decision-making hierarchy where each level receives signals from the level below and context from the level above. The contextual processing reduces false alarms and increases fault coverage. The distributed architecture, meanwhile, speeds processing time and reduces the burden on the communication system, enabling faster and more robust response to fault conditions. Building on our current and past experience with distributed system management and mathematical modeling, we will implement and test a prototype of the proposed software. Test data will be provided by Boeing Corporation and will consist of a representative set of signals from an actual spacecraft, collected either under actual use conditions or during a system test. Implementation will require the development of mathematical models that represent the relationships between the test signals, and this portion of the Phase I tasks will result in an analysis of the model's ability to support fault detection and management. Testing will focus on the software's fault coverage, the speed of the system responses, and the system's sensitivity to timing issues such as message lag and message collision. Results from initial tests will be reviewed, and suggested changes to the software will be documented. The final output from the project will include the system prototype, test results, and an analysis of the DyMA-FM's ability to produce superior fault coverage.","A modern spacecraft will have thousands of sensors and hundreds of systems.

This FM architecture will include algorithms to be run on each cluster module for fault detection, isolation, and recovery, software to be used at a ground station to direct recovery actions, and protocols for communication of fault information between cluster modules and between modules and the ground station. Individual components of the architecture will be designed so that they do not work together directly, but interact through predetermined interfaces. This will allow for flexibility, scalability and robustness. During Phase 1 of the proposed research, the focus of the research will be a fault detection and isolation system to be incorporated into the FM architecture.","The proposed FM architecture has the potential to significantly improve the robustness and survivability of missions that could not be performed with a single monolithic spacecraft, as well as those involving cooperative rendezvous and docking. Thus, the proposed system could benefit missions as basic as docking with the ISS or commercial space stations or as advanced as missions where small spacecraft work collaboratively to create sparse arrays, synthetic apertures, or other distributed sensor networks. Other applications include spacecraft that are used to assemble large space structures, like a manned mission where the Orion MPCV docks with another Orion MPCV or other spacecraft like the Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle or Deep Space Habitat. Other commercial crew platforms that could utilize this technology are SpaceX's Dragon, Boeing's CST-100, and Sierra Nevada's Dreamchaser.Finally, the technology stands to benefit cooperative satellite servicing missions as well as UAV and Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) missions.","The technologies developed in this project will be integrated into our work for DARPA's System F6 project. It can also be used to support other DoD or commercial multi-satellite missions that involve cluster flight, orbital rendezvous or even docking. It is anticipated that in a few years commercial manned spacecraft will dock with the ISS or other commercial space stations.  Commercial systems are especially sensitive to size, weight, power, and cost and will benefit from the proposed FM enhancements when building rendezvous capable vehicles at any scale.As mentioned previously, the applications of the proposed FM enhancements are not limited to space.  Non-space applications include flocks or formations of UAVs, groups of marine vessels, and autonomous transportation vehicles.  Any cluster of vehicles with both GPS/CDGPS navigation and relative measurements available is a potential target for commercialization.","Architecture/Framework/Protocols; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Navigation & Guidance; Recovery (see also Autonomous Systems); Recovery (see also Vehicle Health Management); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

The base technology has been applied for prognostic purposes for various government-sponsored programs, but FFP signature modeling and processing has not been applied for the area of Fault Management, nor does it include such features as fault dictionaries, lookup tables, and management algorithms. The technology includes Ridgetop-designed and developed algorithms to do the following: (1) perform Kalman Filtering to reduce noise; (2) transform sensor signal data to reveal underlying (hidden) FFP signatures; (3) normalize units-of-measure dependent signal data into dimensionless FFP signatures to facilitate re-use and reduce the time to characterize and define new FFP signatures; (4) define and use model definitions that reduce memory requirements and support fast and accurate processing and calculations; (5) two forms of trajectory curve characterization, both straight-line and curvilinear; (6) a fast yet accurate, graphics-based mathematical routine to adapt an FFP model to received data; (7) amplitude and time updates similar to Extended Kalman Filtering to estimate how long it will take an adapted FFP model to reach a defined failure threshold; and (8) produce SoH and RUL estimates that rapidly converge to the estimated time-to-failure (TTF) solution. The FFP signature modeling and processing will include additional innovation to support FM to minimize application-specific programming, those include algorithms to simplify fault identification and isolation.","The proposed FM design and development tool suite is potentially a highly valued solution in fault management (FM) for detecting, identifying, isolating, and mitigating faults, especially degradation fault modes that lead to failure. The technology developed under this program will provide substantial benefits for fault mitigation of complex systems having autonomic recovery requirements. NASA has a need for new and innovative fault management (FM) approaches, architectures, and tools to improve the FM design, development, verification & validation, and operation processes. For this reason NASA is investigating methodologies with the main objectives of increasing reliability of FM systems and reducing costs. This technology could be implemented in several of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) programs as well as those from, for example, Ames Research Center (ARC) and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Key applications include space vehicles for space missions, commercial and military aircraft.","Main customers for the FFP signature modeling and processing will be firms such as The Boeing Company, UTC Aerospace, and Northrop Grumman, among others that will be willing to employ FM.  Ridgetop received a letter of support from Northrop Grumman expressing interest in this technology and will provide subject-matter expertise and consulting services during the phase 1 of this SBIR. If phase 2 is awarded, Northrop Grumman is interested in validating and evaluating this technology in their laboratories and implementing it into some of their programs.","Analytical Methods; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Quality/Reliability; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Tools/EVA Tools; Training Concepts & Architectures"

Based on the Ph.D. thesis work of Krozel (Purdue University, 1992), the theoretical approach for ""intelligent path prediction"" is used in the INTENT algorithm to identify the most likely intent of the vehicle being tracked.  In intelligent path prediction, data describing the environment around the vehicle, for instance, the location of weather, navaids, alternate airports, turbulence, Special Use Airspace (SUA), and operational data are used to determine plausible routes for travel.  The outputs of the INTENT algorithm are an inferred intent, a level of confidence in the intent, and a continuous predicted path.  Because environmental and operational considerations are taken into consideration, the INTENT algorithm is expected to perform better than a Kalman filter for long prediction times.  The INTENT algorithm increases the safety of flight by adding predictability to displays and other avionics systems and helps reduce congestion by providing meaningful long-term predictions.",,"An intent inference algorithm and long term trajectory predictor has commercial application in several areas:  the flight deck (FD), Air Traffic Management (ATM), and Airline Operations Centers (AOCs).  For the FD, we provide the ability to verify intent data from and ADS-B message and the ability to predict long term trajectories, which is useful for other avionics systems on the FD.  Embedding our algorithm into systems provided by FD avionics systems manufacturers represents potential commercial applications.  Applications also include ATM, where our algorithms assist terminal area and en route automation systems in identifying intent for display to the controller or for input to conflict detection algorithms.  Our algorithm is useful to the AOCs to provide long term predictions for traffic congestion, weather congestion, and estimated delays and times of arrival."

RLI has large dynamic range (up to 180 dB in acceleration) and provides very wideband measurements (0 to 262 kHz or higher).  Moreover, it has excellent linearity across the frequency range and its performance is independent of environmental temperature at the measuring poiont.  A large dynamic range means the sensor can pick up small emissions buried in large vibrations.  In other words, the sensor is much more sensitive than conventional contact type sensors.  Wideband measurement capability means the sensor is very versatile for various diverse applications.  The second element of FPMC is an automatic fault detection and isolation tool developed by IAI that consists of Fast Fourier Transform, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and a neural network classifier.  We will use common aerospace materials to demonstrate the performance of FPMC.

To address this need, Broadata Communications, Inc. (BCI) proposes a unique, elastically-controlled data network (ECDN) technology to support high performance, remote testing applications.  The ECDN will allow deterministic control of multiple, diverse sensor data stream characteristics, each with different clock speed, data bandwidth, jitter requirement, and delay variation.  In other words, ECDN will compensate for network uncertainties encountered by individual sensor data streams.",,"In addition to the NASA's remote testing applications, the ECDN can also be used for many applications in mission-critical entrepreneurial networks, business-to-business transactions, wireless IP, and entertainment broadcasting."

First, ammonia can be found in stripped sour gas streams, which contain water and H2S.  If ammonia is present in these streams, undesirable reactions occur, causing a number of problems in the refinery.  Thus, a catalyst that would completely oxidize ammonia to nitrogen would eliminate these problems.  In addition, because of the strict regulatory requirements, the catalysts must not produce NO or NO2.  Selective ammonia oxidation could also be used to reduce ammonia emissions from selective catalytic reduction (SCR) units, which are currently used to reduce NOX emissions from stationary sources."

Likewise, in both situations most people reveal an ability to adapt to these imposed conflicts and the disruptive responses are reduced or eliminated.  Thus, overcoming motion sickness, correcting performance, and regaining normal perception in space may involve many of the same processes as adaptation to perceptual rearrangement in general.  In this Phase I research, we propose to run studies in which graded motion sickness is induced through the systematic distortion of the relevant characteristics of a VR device, exposure is repeated until adaptation is attained, and then, generalization of this adaptation is tested in a related but different device?an (OKN) Drum.

The responses most likely to be affected are head and eye movements. It is possible that these learned nausea-avoidance responses continue to affect an astronaut?s performance adversely although he or she may have no direct awareness of their presence. Based on recent studies with visual reality (VR) devices conducted in our laboratory we are able to produce systematic and replicable changes in the incidence and severity of motion sickness symptomatology among participants.

Because the chambers reached temperatures of nearly 2600?C during testing, a water-cooled injector was used.  That will not be an option in space, so an injector must be developed that will be able to withstand these extreme temperatures and minimize thermal soakback to the valves.

BNS proposes to draw on its expertise in the development of high-speed binary and multi-level SLMs to develop a 1024x1024 pixel, 1000Hz, multi-level SLM.  BNS proposes during Phase I to perform conceptual design efforts for the 1024x1024 multi-level SLM.  During Phase II, the new 1024x1024 SLM and drivers would be fully designed and developed.  As the only supplier of high-speed multi-level liquid crystal SLMs and a long-time developer of optical systems, BNS is the most qualified company to complete such a program.",,"BNS has built substantial business around our SLMs because we designed them exclusively for optical processing applications.

Most of our customers select our product because our primary competitors are only interested in the high volume display market, and hence their products do not meet all of the specifications that are important to the optical processing community.  Since the introduction of our 128x128 multi-level SLM, we have received numerous requests for a higher resolution, high-speed, high-contrast, multi-level SLM such as the 1024x1024 multi-level SLM that we are proposing.  Potential customers that have shown interest in this development include those in optical correlation, holographic storage, beam steering, 3-D display, high-speed printing, atmospheric correction, and optical computing.  These inquiries have come from the space, military, commercial, and academic communities in our country as well as abroad.  With the successful completion of the proposed Phase I and II efforts, we will be in a position to offer this 1024x1024 multi-level SLM as a product, the likes of which cannot currently be found anywhere."

Also, the searching (data mining) of terabyte databases (such as NASA experiments produce) will benefit from a quadratic speed-up. Noiseless encoding techniques also become available through the use of quantum data compression algorithms, with application to both NASA/DoD and commercial data transmission. The quantum error-correction and fault-tolerant computational techniques made available address DoE missions of nuclear stockpile stewardship by providing access to the simulation of physical (nuclear) systems at the quantum level.

The water produced in the RWGS reaction is electrolyzed; the oxygen is stored and the hydrogen recycled to the RWGS reactor.  The COMORS is similar to some hydrogen/ilmenite reduction methods proposed for Lunar missions.  Unlike the hydrogen based methods, however, the carbon monoxide/RWGS cycle can operate with higher energy efficiencies, lower losses, and lower temperatures.

The economics of steelmaking will be further improved since the COMORS provides an on-site source of high-purity oxygen than can be used for decarburization, desiliconization, and reduction of heating times (resulting in increased productivity). The primary commercial advantage of a combined metal oxide reduction/RWGS system is that it can cut CO2 emissions dramatically since it consumes only an electrical energy input and produces a clean oxygen effluent.

Unfortunately, many monopropellants are toxic and dangerous, ruling them out for EMU thruster application. Thus, EMU thrusters have relied upon cold gaseous nitrogen, which offers very low specific impulse and propellant mass fraction.

The market for NOMRs is potentially large, and goes well beyond EMU propulsion. Hydrazine is commonly used as a monopropellant in attitude control thrusters in spacecraft.  Unfortunately, hydrazine is extremely toxic.  NOMRs, however, use a benign monopropellant, and so much less care and expense is necessary, while still achieving similar performance. NOMRs would be much more profitable and attractive to use than current common monopropellant rockets systems, and should be able to dominate the market for liquid monopropellant propulsion systems, such as are used in attitude control of spacecraft.  Currently, some 1700 satellites are planned for launch in the next 10 years, and all will need attitude control systems.

For deep space missions, high Isp thrusters are needed to minimize on board propellant mass. For electric thrusters such as the Pulsed Plasma Thruster and the Vacuum Arc Thruster, a challenge is feed of the propellant during long missions requiring >kg of total propellant. If the feed mechanism involves moving parts, its reliability is an issue, especially with active control. An innovative solution to this problem is proposed: deploy an array of individual, static thrusters, each of which delivers ~10g of total eroded propellant. An array of 100 such devices would then deliver a kg of propellant, with no moving parts. The innovation is the use of miniature solid-state switches in our inductive PPU driver that enable programmable switching of the drive power pulses from one thruster to another. By so doing, one effectively switches power out of a given cathode once it has completed its useful mission life. Such a Clustered Vacuum Arc Thruster array (CVAT) has no moving parts and yet delivers ~1kg propellant loads for various nanosatellite missions.",,"The primary application of the specific electric propulsion thruster to be developed in the proposed work will be for small spacecraft ~10 kg.

Some gravity assist missions need their solar array to operate at earth distance, near-sun and far-sun conditions, as well as planetary orbits which pose their own thermal problems due to planetary radiation and albedo. This SBIR investigates a concentrator design that has high concentration ratio to allow reasonable fluxes onto the solar cell when far from the sun, limits flux onto the solar cell when the solar array is near the sun. In addition, the design limits the thermal absorption of planetary albedo, and limits thermal rejection when far from the sun to prevent excessively cold operating temperatures. The Deep Space Concentrator design is based on a one-axis, parabolic trough reflector with a separate radiator, and uses a unique solar cell receiver aperture limitation, and a thermostat radiator to allowing operation in a wide variety of solar illumination and thermal flux environments.",,"Solar concentrators have commercial space and terrestrial applications because of the ability to replace expensive solar cells with inexpensive reflectors. High concentration ratios (CR) provide the best economic performance, since the solar cell material per watt is significantly reduced, but optical and thermal management techniques and their associated components are critical design features. This work advances the state-of-the-art of these critical design features, and could allow very high CR designs to be implemented, enabling the use of the most expensive, most efficient solar cells, and thereby decreasing balance-of-system costs associated with energy collection and conversion."

Achieving these capacities has been inhibited by crystal structure changes that occur during intercalation.  The PSI synthesis method uses a V2O5 gel precursor to produce a nanostructured cathode with projected high capacity, and discharge rates.  The cathodes produced by the PSI process are expected to exceed the performance of the benchmark LiCoO2 system, at a significantly reduced cost.  PSI anticipates cathode gravimetric capacities in excess of 300 Ah/kg, and a capacity fade of less than 10% over 300 cycles based upon improvements in published values for lithium capacity in V2O5.

Additionally, the increased use of composite structures in the civilian fleet, such as in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A380, make the understanding and/or improvement of composite durability, particularly durability of repairs, even more critical.  Several areas have been identified as targets for improvement in composite aircraft repair.  These include the development of rapid, low temperature repair methods and associated materials as well as development of the quality of repairs when they are made.  Adhesion of bonded repairs is one area that needs to be addressed. In the Phase I program Adherent Technologies, Inc. demonstrated a novel moisture-resistant primer system for use in repairs of standard carbon/epoxy composites used in many subsonic aircraft.  Our proprietary chemistry comprised of a reactive coupling agent and a carrier resin compatible with standard aerospace epoxy resins bonds directly to the prepared aircraft composite surface while retaining residual functionality that can be cured directly into the matrix of the repair leading to a covalently bound repair, thereby strengthening the repair interface.  An increase in bond strength for primed samples relative to unprimed control specimens was noted; the improvement in the fracture toughness of the bonds was particularly of note.The Phase II effort will focus on the optimization of these primer systems and associated application and activation methods.  Water-based systems will also be developed and demonstrated.",This system is being designed to support the need for improvements in durability of repairs for subsonic aircraft.,"The proposed primer technology, which will improve the quality of composite bonded repairs as well as composite bonding in general, will used throughout the aerospace composite materials market as well as having potential applications in civilian infrastructure (e.g. CFRP bridge decks and the like).  The civilian aircraft market is projected to be a particularly significant consumer.",Airframe; Composites

Simultaneously emphasizing affordability and performance, this antenna subsystem will uniquely enable near-term wide deployment of airborne hazard detection and avoidance radar systems with greatly enhanced performance and functionality relative to currently fielded systems.  This technology comprises a proprietary integrated ""quasi-monolithic"" feed/phase-shifter/radiator topology exclusively realized using low-risk low-cost flight-proven, manufacturing materials, components, and processes.  In addition, this architecture is ideally-suited for simplified compact integration with a highly reliable, low-cost, low-power consumption beam steering controller (BSC) utilizing pre-existing COTS components.  The expected RF loss through the feed, phase shifter, and radiator of this low-cost/high-performance topology is less than 1 dB at X-Band, which is no greater than (and in most cases less than) that of ""traditional"" (much) higher cost ESA implementations.  Building upon the Phase I preliminary antenna subsystem design and highly successful phase-shifter risk-reduction verification testing accomplished in Phase I,  the Phase II program will directly demonstrate and prove both the performance and revolutionary cost reduction potential of this new ""no compromise"" ESA architecture and technology.   In addition to the targeted aviation hazard detection radar/sensor application, other benefiting applications would include ground mapping, atmospheric studies, and launch range surveillance radars and sensors as well as communication applications for which an agile highly directional beam is required such as high-gain LOS and NLOS (SATCOM) Data Links.","The technology is useful for a broad variety of radar and communication applications that are of interest to NASA.

The derived performance model was then be used to determine the aircraft flight envelope, performance parameters and the maneuver limits. The estimated data can be used as the basis for designing safe landing guidance laws for damaged aircraft.   Phase II research will refine the algorithms developed during the Phase I research and create a standalone software implementation.

The feedback from these demonstrations was used to establish future development directions for Phase 2. Phase 2 will consist of three major efforts: 1) the design and implementation of the Taiga system, a next-generation enhancement of the SPADE software, 2) an investigation into combining complementary functionality of Taiga with existing code at ISD including the Inductive Modeling System, Mariana and others, and 3) the implementation of a prototype automatic parallelizer, in cooperation with subcontractor Optillel Solutions, for a subset of C++ useful for hardware acceleration of machine learning applications.The scope of the interaction with researchers in NASA ISD will be to explore the relationships between IMS and Taiga and gauge benefits such a Data Handling, Feature Reduction, Visualization and Explainability. We will also investigate heterogeneous ensemble methods by analyzing the Mariana system.Optillel's C++ Parallelizer will reduce MAC's development costs for parallelizing C++ code for multi-core chips and clusters. This effort will build on Optillel's existing body of work that supports graphical programming languages, and will extend their technology to the analysis and parallelization of C++ code.Both the Taiga system and Optillel's prototype have significant commercialization potential in industries as diverse as Chemical, Pharmaceutical, Manufacturing and Aerospace.","MAC's Taiga data mining platform has a variety of important applications at NASA.  The need for next-generation data mining tools to aid in lifecycle support for aircraft, spacecraft, satellites and ships is widely recognized, as exemplified by the scope of the solicitation for this program. The Intelligent Data Understanding (IDU) Group at NASA Ames Research Center is a prime candidate for collaboration in developing and using Taiga. Through productive Phase 1 discussions with IDU, MAC determined that the most relevant area for Taiga at IDU is Discovery and Systems Health (DaSH), whose mission includes monitoring, data analysis, prognostics, diagnostics, and diagnostic decision aids. In this arena NASA will benefit from MAC's experience with Threat Assessment for satellites with the Air Force Research Lab. The Taiga system can be directly applied to problems being examined at DaSH, and it is highly complementary to existing software already being used and tested within IDU, including but not limited to Dave Iverson's Inductive Monitoring System (IMS) and Pat Castle's Mariana.  There is important synergy between Tiaga and these packages; with IMS Taiga complements feature reduction, cluster visualization, explainability, fusion and data synthesis for validation, and with Mariana it complements data fusion and parallelization.","Products for discovering novel events and detecting anomalies are quickly becoming indispensable for the proper operation and maintenance of the complex systems employed by modern industry, medical providers and the military.  Factories, health monitors, aircraft and other vehicles regularly produce hundreds or thousands of channels of telemetry in real time, which must be monitored for possible indications of failure.  These data resources present an extremely diverse market opportunity for Taiga, which will detect events of interest in high-volume data streams of large dimensionality, independent of the raw data source. This diversity is confirmed by the variety of customers who have already expressed interest in MAC's anomaly detection software, including Dow Chemical, Boeing and Space-X. The ""Write Once Deploy Anywhere"" (WODA) component of Taiga represents another major commercial opportunity. The emerging trend in hardware from single to multi-core systems is exposing a fast-growing requirement in the software industry for intelligent development tools to aid programmers in converting existing non-parallel algorithms to parallel algorithms. After Phase 2, Optillel will be positioned to license its technology for C++ on any Integrated Development Environment and leverage an enormous pre-existing market.  MAC will benefit by being the first partner to use Optillel's WODA technology and reduce development costs for multicore-enabled anomaly detection products.","Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Operations Concepts and Requirements; Portable Data Acquisition or Analysis Tools; Telemetry, Tracking and Control"

Traditional time domain terahertz reflection tomographic imaging captures only a single view of an object, generating images of laminar structure similar to an ultrasound ""B-Scan"".  This reflection tomographic imaging is limited, however, in revealing only the laminar structure which presents a clear specular reflection from each interface.  Furthermore, traditional time domain terahertz reflection tomographic imaging has substantial difficulty in determining the layer index of refraction an absorption properties without ambiguity.   In Phase 1 we demonstrated the feasibility TD-THz  axial computed tomography to generate cross-sectional slices of aerospace materials.  This method acquires not one view, but many radial axial views, generating a sinogram which can be used to reconstruct images using a derivative of standard X-Ray CT filtered back-projection.  The sinogram can be generated by the transmission absorbance, transmission time of flight, and, in principle, reflection measurements.  The reconstructed TD-THz CT images are 3D maps of the absorption coefficients and/or the index of refraction of the subsurface material.","The proposed TD-THz CT NDE imager will be valuable in characterizing the aging and durability of aircraft and spacecraft materials and components.  Material examples include Kevlar, Zylon, and other non-conductive polymer matrix composites.  Example NDE applications where these materials are used include inspection of soft shell fan containment,  thermal protection systems, and composite overwrap pressure vessels.  These materials are in systems in which the 3D internal examination of new construction for flaws (voids, disbonds, inclusions, improper geometry and dimensions, and incomplete curing) may be critical.  It will be critical to periodically inspect systems for damage, fatigue and chemical degradation.","Polymer matrix composites are used in automobile and ships and many other consumer and industrial products.  TD-THz CT 3D imaging applications can include inspection of automobile dashboards, imaging inspection for delamination of printed circuit boards, inspection of pipe insulation,  as well as with manufactured parts such as pure plastic and paper products. TD-THz CT imaging benefits homeland security applications under development such as personnel and luggage inspection for concealed weapons and explosives (in luggage, shoes, etc.).

ASROV will provide a turn-key solution for the NASA AirSTAR program with the RTB capability and a development tool kit to allow for rapid reconfiguration.  The open source approach allows the customer to make changes on all levels so project funding is focused on operational requirements rather than OEM customization costs. An Open-architecture design allows the customer to change and upgrade sensors, actuators and datalinks. High speed time synchronized data recording will allow the customer to post process data for accurate performance analysis. The custom control law integration allows ASROV to expand it's capability much beyond the immediate needs of the program. Ground based execution of control laws and piloting makes the datalink a flight critical system with stringent requirements.  Capability to execute experimental control laws including auto flight profile and maneuver execution will give the customer the power to focus on flight based research rather than control and latency issues.","Government agencies such as DoD, DoT, NSA and civil research and development entities such as Universities and defense contractors are all heavily invested in using UAS's for Research and Development.

There is a need for auto flight profile execution to force aircraft into complex maneuvers while applying real time System ID and collecting high speed data. ASROV will be critical for the success of the P-8A by providing a low cost capability to focus funding on research tasks rather than development of custom autopilot system.

Specifically, the adaptive feedforward controller is designed to reduce any atmospheric induced structural vibrations of the aircraft. The adaptive feedback controller is applied as an additive perturbation of the flight control system to suppress any undesired AE/ASE interactions, and prevent the onset of Flutter/Limit Cycle Oscillation (LCO) instabilities within the flight envelope of a flexible aircraft.The proposed research effort fits very well within the scope of the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center topic ""A1.10 Adaptive Structural Mode Suppression,"" specifically within the Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control (IRAC) effort under the Aviation Safety Program. This research will help the original flight control system to robustly recover from or adjust easily to any unforeseen change during its normal operation due to AE/ASE interactions. In addition, practical concerns will deal with the minimal interference with the original rigid-body controller, as well as its feasible implementation using the standard controller's sampling rate frequency.","Being capable of on-line estimation/monitoring of the elastic modes of the aircraft, the proposed adaptive control technology can be automatically adjusted to attenuate any potential adverse aeroelastic/aeroservoelastic effects of an aircraft before a sustained limit cycle and vehicle damage are encountered. Hence, the proposed project will assist NASA in its goal to achieve an integrated flight control system resilient to failures, damage, and upset conditions unforeseen during the development of the aircraft's original control law. Once this adaptive control technology is developed, it can be readily adopted by NASA for a wide class aerospace vehicles ranging from current to the next-generation designs such as F/A-18 AAW, Hyper X, X-43 and oblique flying wing.","The proposed adaptive feedforward and feedback control framework will have extensive application in non-NASA commercial applications. Firstly, due to the potential Flight Control System (FCS) benefits from avoiding notch filters, the proposed methodology can be used by military and commercial aircraft manufacturers for new aircraft designs, modifications and upgrades. Secondly, it brings a variety of applications in other industries. Among others it can be mentioned:  Acoustic noise cancellation in headphone devices  Reduction of the noise level for rotating fans in computer servers  Suppression and/or attenuation of vibrations in large satellite structures  Cabin noise reduction for the next generation executive transport aircraft, such as the  Marcel Dassualt's Falcon 7X.

Because many of the new algorithms differ significantly from the approaches used in most operational vehicles, and because of factors such as non-deterministic behavior due to adaptation, flight certification of the approaches has been challenging.  Verification and validation (V&V) of advanced control laws has received significant research attention, and progress has been made in terms of tools, methods, and architectures for facilitating V&V.  Building on this prior V&V work, the proposed research will develop innovative methods and tools for validation of diagnostic systems.  The Phase I research demonstrated the value of probabilistic analysis in general, and generalized Polynomial Chaos techniques specifically for measuring diagnostic system performance.  The Phase II research will further develop probabilistic methods, and will combine them with worst-case analysis techniques to assess traditional diagnostic system metrics, as well as interactions between diagnostic systems and inner-loop control approaches.  Building on the CAESAR tool control law validation tool, a software package to facilitate validation of diagnostic systems will be implemented, and the tool will be demonstrated on a representative diagnostic system.","The proposed software tool will be a key enabling technology for flight certification of advanced diagnostic algorithms.   Such diagnostic algorithms have significant potential in terms of improving safety of flight in a wide range of fixed-wing and rotary-wing air vehicles.  Diagnostic systems are of particular interest in unmanned and autonomous vehicles, because there is limited or no human interaction to aid with fault recognition, or to identify failures and take appropriate corrective action.  The proposed technology will be applicable to NASA research aircraft such as the AirSTAR both in terms of certifying diagnostic systems for these aircraft, and in reducing the risk associated with flight testing of new diagnostic approaches on these research platforms.  The proposed technology will also aid in realizing the goals of the Aviation Safety Program by helping to transition diagnostic technologies developed by NASA and other to production aircraft.","Non-NASA aerospace applications of the diagnostic validation approaches include commercial and military fixed-wing and rotary-wing air vehicles, and particularly autonomous and unmanned aerial vehicles.  Diagnostic systems play a particularly important role in autonomous systems, which lack human interaction to aid in fault detection and isolation.  With growing interest in autonomous vehicles from both military and commercial users, this represents a large potential market.  The diagnostic validation procedures will also be valuable for marine and ground vehicles, again, particularly autonomous and unmanned vehicles.  Other applications include industrial machinery such as factory automation and power generation equipment.  The Polynomial Chaos tools underlying the validation approach will have even broader potential application.  For example, these tools are already being applied to analysis of uncertainty in aeroelastic systems, which could easily be extended to other systems involving mechanical structures or fluid flows.  Clearly, this represents a huge potential market.","Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Portable Data Acquisition or Analysis Tools; Simulation Modeling Environment; Telemetry, Tracking and Control; Testing Requirements and Architectures"

The success of this effort would represent a significant state-of-the-art improvement in fatigue projections of ceramic matrix composites, since no tools capable of accomplishing this have ever been developed.  The developed algorithm, implemented via user-defined subroutines operating within the ABAQUS public domain finite element software, will represent a significant new addition to the suite tools currently available to CMC designers.","The technology developed here will directly support the design of existing and future NASA space exploration vehicles.  A working model which successfully predicts the thermal and mechanical fatigue life of C/SiC materials and components will enable confident predictions of the useable structural life of CMC TPS components.  Such a tool would also enable inspection and maintenance schedules to be generated for C/SiC materials, using actual data from flown mission environments collected from integral health monitoring sensor systems.  CMC thermal protection system (TPS) elements, ranging from thick leading edges to doubly-curved acreage TPS panels and hot structure control surfaces, will all benefit from the proposed program.  A successful Phase II effort would also provide the beginnings of CMC life prediction tools applicable to oxidation-protected, i.e., coated CMC TPS components.  The successful Phase II program would also lead to a fatigue life prediction tool applicable to propulsion system components exposed to the harmful oxidation effluents, e.g. steam, common in the exhaust stream of turbojet and scramjet engine systems.  Additionally, the fatigue life prediction tools developed in the Phase II program, if successful, will support the development of any hot structure materials used on the Crew Exploration Vehicle and subsequent airframes required for the Mission to Mars.","The technology proposed in the Phase I program will also be of direct interest to the Department of Defense (DOD) to support the development of scramjets, hypersonic missiles, and maneuvering reentry bodies. The results are also expected to be of direct interest to programs including the USAF Common Aero Vehicle, and the DARPA Hypersonic Cruise Vehicle.  Hypersonic vehicles such as USAF global strike vehicles will employ load bearing TPS as acreage regions to minimize the TPS mass fraction for launch.

The proposed Phase II will build upon the Phase I proof of concept study to further develop a fully integrated active supersonic inlet system, including active inlet ramp and deployable flow control devices, as well as the aero/thermo/structural analysis models required to design such systems and subcomponents.  In addition, Phase II will be the continued refinement and characterization of actuator-ready HTSMAs.","By providing foundational research on innovative concepts for propulsion system components for supersonic transport aircraft, the proposed effort will directly support a wide range of fundamental NASA goals in aeronautics.  One key result of the effort will be extended development and characterization of highly promising HTSMA materials, a resource of great potential for high speed and/or high temperature applications in subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic aircraft.  In addition, the Phase I effort will lay the groundwork for enabling technology to provide integrated inlet/engine control to ensure safe, stable, and efficient operation for continuous flight above Mach 2.

In this SBIR project, we propose a novel method, Adaptive Chemistry, to enable such detailed modeling. This method adapts the reaction mechanism used in CFD to local reaction conditions. Instead of a single comprehensive reaction mechanism throughout the computation, smaller, locally valid reduced models are used to accurately capture the chemical kinetics at a smaller cost. Our Adaptive Chemistry approach seeks to obtain a reduced model guaranteed to be valid within the variable range for each grid point, and controls errors rigorously without evaluating the very expensive full model. Adaptive Chemistry also dynamically constructs a reduced model library based on real-time reaction conditions to prevent large memory overhead for arbitrary solution trajectories. This also allows Adaptive Chemistry to be easily extendable to transient problems. Finally, Adaptive Chemistry allows users to set a constraint on the largest model size by using a skeletal model, but selects each reduced model based on the full, detailed chemistry, which obtains a guaranteed optimal solution more efficiently compared to the traditional skeletal model methods.In this project, we will develop an error-controlled reduced-species Adaptive Chemistry software package that can be easily interfaced with any CFD solver. The first objective of this work is to continue developing needed methods for error-controlled reduced-species Adaptive Chemistry for steady-state reacting flow simulations. The second objective is to implement the available methods into a modular package that can be easily interfaced with any CFD solver. We will also develop an Adaptive Chemistry module that can be coupled with the PREMIX program for commercialization.","As a result of this SBIR project, an Adaptive Chemistry interface to any generic reacting flow solver will be constructed. Adaptive Chemistry offers a combination of high efficiency, low computational cost, and enhanced accuracy on reacting flow simulations. The interface developed in this work will complement NASA's combustion research, and NASA's in-house combustion codes can be integrated with the techniques developed in this project to enhance its efficiency and simulation capability. Specifically, NASA's capability of modeling emissions performance of a gas turbine combustor, which requires incorporation of detailed combustion chemistry, will be greatly enhanced. This technique will be valuable to NASA's on-going efforts to design more efficient, lower emissions gas turbine engines. Other NASA applications related to reacting flow simulations, such as rocket or aircraft plume modeling, will also be benefited.","Successful implementation of Adaptive Chemistry software package will bring the benefit to a wide array of industrial and governmental customers outside NASA who are engaged in reacting flow simulations with detailed chemical kinetics.

In recent years, visualization diagnostics have evolved substantially in terms of spatial and temporal resolution. The advancements, coupled with a tool to conveniently quantify the results obtained relative to the breakup process offer the potential for a marked increase in understanding of this phenomenon.

The EAB concept is applicable to 1) next-generation, conventional tube and wing aircraft (current generation +1) and 2) advanced integrated airframe/propulsion system configurations (current generation +2, +3).  Potential retrofit opportunities are also envisioned.  Phase 1 analysis on NASA's Source Diagnostic Test (SDT) fan stage suggests that an EAB could realize three to four decibels overall noise reduction under the approach flight path by generating a swirling exhaust with drag equivalent to one to two turbofan-sized bluff bodies per powerplant. Such drag generation could enable slower and/or steeper and/or aero-acoustically cleaner approach trajectories. A Phase II development program is proposed to 1) perform aerodynamic designs of dual-stream, swirling bypass flow nozzles and experimentally assess their performance and noise, 2) develop conceptual aero-designs that address current engine architecture issues such as pylon duct bifurcations, and 3) develop a prototype design of an EAB for validation in a model-scale rig. The final deliverable to NASA will be a written report presenting design, analysis and experimental results from blown nozzle testing, plus a prototype EAB design.","The proposed technology can assist NASA in the development of next generation quiet aircraft, including tube and wing (current generation +1) and integrated airframe propulsion system configuration (current generation +2). These aircraft are likely to have noise sources from the engine and airframe that have comparable levels. A quiet air-brake device will allow noise reduction by creating drag without the associated unsteady flow structures of devices such as flaps, slats, and undercarriage. In addition, these devices will enable steep approaches, thereby locating the noise source further from the affected communities. An additional application for swirling exhaust flows is in the area of wake vortex avoidance and induced drag management. For example, swirling outflow devices placed on wing tips could be used to counter- or co-swirl relative to the bound vortex that is shed by a finite wing, resulting in potential induced drag reduction or increase (possibly of value in a quiet drag sense).","The commercial potential for this system extends beyond NASA's development programs related to next-generation quiet aircraft. The larger, shorter-term market potential relates to the retrofitting of existing engines so that they can meet future noise standards and/or allow steeper glideslopes without increased noise. The midterm opportunity relates to engines which are currently being developed for commercial deployment in the next seven to ten years by the large engine manufacturers where there is potentially still an opportunity to incorporate features of this concept into the final design.

The result will be a stand-alone radar/tip timing radar module for current conventional NSMS users (as an upgrade) and new users.  The hybrid system will use frequency data and relative mode vibration levels from the radar sensor to provide substantially superior capabilities over current blade vibration technology.  This frequency data, coupled with a reduced number of tip timing probes, will result in a system capable of detecting complex blade vibrations which would confound traditional NSMS systems.  The hardware and software package will be validated on an existing compressor rig at MSI.

Preliminary experiments on separation control over a trailing edge flap on a NACA 0015 airfoil, V-22 wing section for download reduction, cavity tones and jet thrust vectoring have shown encouraging results for these actuators.  Based on the results from Phase I, and the commercial interest from a leading aircraft manufacturer, we propose to conduct a systematic study of the scaling parameters of the fluidic actuator arrays in relation to the geometric and aerodynamic parameters of the wing using wind tunnel tests on a specially designed airfoil model.  This will include the effects of actuator spacing, array location, pressure gradient and wing sweep on the actuator effectiveness.  Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) will be undertaken to estimate the risk of the proposed technology.  A rapid inspection technique will be developed for conducting quick, in situ testing of the fluidic arrays. Projecting to the future, a synchronous array of actuators will also be developed.","The proposed work would be of interest to the ARMD for the aerodynamic flow control needs of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), subsonic fixed wing and rotary wing programs and transonic flow control programs.  The fluidic actuators would also be of interest to the Active Combustion Control, Active Stall Control and Active Inlet Control and Jet Noise Control Programs at NASA.  Such arrays can also be used for de-icing systems using either hot air or de-icing liquids since the fluidic jets work with both liquids and gases.","Aerodynamic flow control has a large number of applications in the commercial and military aerospace industry. We foresee applications of our technology to separation control over leading and trailing edge of airfoils to achieve high lift and minimum-drag configuration for aircraft wings, control of jet exhaust noise in aircraft engines, intake flow control, and internal flows in gas turbines. One other area of application we are exploring is the flow control and de-icing over wind turbine blades.",Aircraft Engines; Renewable Energy

The model will permit analyzing high-speed, nonequilibrium flows about entry and aeroassist vehicles based on extensions to Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) codes, and a new database will be developed for these extensions.  The new approach offers potential for treating other complex nonequilibrium flow physics including ionization and radiation in a more direct manner than has been previously used and therefore offers potential improvements in accuracy.  These tools will provide essential data for assessing the aerothermodynamic performance for a wide range of vehicle designs over a wide range of vehicle attitudes and flight conditions.  The improved accuracy offered by our proposed chemical kinetic modeling approach offers significant benefits in the design of vehicles for both unmanned planetary missions and manned missions to the Moon and Mars.","The proposed chemical kinetics model software and database has substantive market potential for NASA return-to-space related activities, in terms of its broad-based applicability to vehicle design for both high-altitude continuum (60-85km) and rarefied flights.

A distributed array of bimorph tuft sensors is embedded in a flexible, self-adhesive backed sheet of polymide substrate.  The proposed separation sensor array will provide real-time, accurate determination of separation across a wide range of flight conditions.  The self-contained blanket array can be quickly and easily applied to aircraft surfaces in question.  No wiring, external power, or remote viewing is required for acquisition.  After testing is complete, the system can be quickly removed and reused.  Additionally, the system could be miniaturized for use in ground test facilities or other types of vehicles.  The bimorph tuft based separation sensor array promises to provide a realizable, accurate, efficient, and cost effective measurement system.

The goal of this project is to develop the next generation of Schlieren for Aircraft in Flight (SAF) systems. SAF is a technique for obtaining schlieren images of aircraft as they fly past the edge of the sun. In its original form, images were recorded with a time delay and integration (TDI) camera using slit masks that conformed to the edge of the sun. Problems arise if the cutoff mask is not precisely aligned with edge of the sun, or if the TDI camera is not aligned and synchronized with the aircraft flight path. These problems can be solved using the synthetic TDI method, where the aircraft transit of the sun is recorded on high-speed video, and then the TDI process is carried out computationally using programmable masks. Synthetic, TDI-based SAF systems are less sensitive to movement of the observation platform, and can be used with non-cooperative targets whose flight paths and velocities are not known in advance.","Flight testing is often used as a final critical check of aerodynamic designs developed by computational and wind tunnel methods because the information obtainable in wind tunnels is subject to interference. Outdoor schlieren systems using the sun and moon make it possible to examine shock waves and other phenomena from aircraft in flight. Applications exist in all forms of research and development associated with turbulent flow fields, including aero optics, flow control, drag, boundary layer transition, and flow separation. The proposed developments will be extremely important in flight-testing, where few such instruments can perform in a flight environment.","Potential commercial applications include aero-optics, flow diagnostics, flow-control, free-space laser communication, active laser imaging, high bandwidth video transmission, spectroscopy, and high-resolution imaging.",Optical

In practice, this has necessitated the use of external hydraulic dampers which suffer from high maintenance costs. High operational (lifecycle) cost has prompted rotorcraft industry to use elastomeric lead-lag dampers that result in ""dry'' rotors. However, complex behavior of elastomers provides challenges for modeling such devices, as noted by rotorcraft airframers. Currently used analytical models oversimplify the complexity of operational environment and make radical assumptions about operating parameters that, at best, lead to excessively simplistic, and often unreal, device models. These first order linear device models require costly and time consuming experiments to construct them; moreover, they do not directly relate to either the material characteristics or the geometric configuration. In Phase-I SBIR, MTC team pursued a fundamentally radical approach wherein elastomeric dampers are derived from first-principle-based modeling rather than device model-based analyses. Our Phase-I program was tailored towards successfully demonstrating closed loop simulation, i.e. a finite element based modeling of elastomeric materials integrated into a multibody dynamics framework for rotorcraft analysis. During Phase-II, comprehensive and sophisticated material models will be implemented and streamlined into a single comprehensive analysis framework. These implementations will be fully validated against bench and flight test data of Bell M429 elastomeric dampers.

In this phase the MSA design would be refined as a cement-and-forget-device (except for the battery).","Test and measurement of airplanes during flight as well as on ground with various simulated loading scenario.  Devices cab used in hard to reach remote locations and locations to which hardwired instrumentation is not possible.  The low cost MSAs are designed for cement-and-forget applications with long battery life. By adding real time aircraft dynamic modal assessment software, real-time correlation and control algorithms, the MSA could be utilized in light weight, flexible and unstable aircraft structures.","The resulting technology can be employed many commercial test applications.  It can also be used in hard to access or remotely located nodes on any structural test and measuremnt scenario.

(RSI) proposes to develop the Friction-Sensing Reflector Array Patches (FRAP), a technology that will measure the shear stress distribution on aerodynamic surfaces in ground test facilities with high resolution, sensitivity, and bandwidth.  Unlike the oil-film interference method, FRAP patches will not be thinned as a function of time during a test.  No knowledge of the streamlines of the flow will be needed in order to calculate the local stress distribution; this will avoid the tracers needed with the oil-film interference approach.  Flexible patches of FRAP arrays, inexpensive due to simple, mass-production-compatible microfabrication techniques, will be interrogated using a light source and camera. FRAP will be independent of the flow species and applied as a very thin, flexible, adhesive material.  The Phase II goals will be to improve the design and fabrication of the sensors, fully calibrate taking into account competing effects such as normal forces and temperature, demonstrate feasibility in a wide range of test environments from subsonic to heated and cold supersonic, and provide prototype units to NASA.  The result will be a product that will address a critical NASA instrumentation need.","RSI will use its experience in microfabricated structures and sensors to employ a highly innovative technology  a sheer-stress-sensing reflecting array  in order to non-intrusively measure skin friction in NASA ground test facilities.  The FRAP technology will avoid the use of a depleted fluid and tracer elements that are inherent to the existing oil film interferometry method, and will address a key NASA need for non-instrusive diagnostics as well as flight test diagnostics and vehicle monitoring.","Several non-Government applications are possible.  Flow sensors have a lucrative commercial market in manufacturing (for process monitoring) and medical diagnostics, as well a healthy market in scientific applications.  Commercialized flow sensors are used in applications ranging from industrial processing and medical diagnostics to high-speed shock testing in chemical explosions.  It is expected that the newly developed FRAP arrays will compete aggressively in these existing markets.  In addition to NASA, target U.S. government customers will be the Air Force (for ground testing, flight tests, and vehicle monitoring) and the Navy (for similar applications).","Composites; Instrumentation; Multifunctional/Smart Materials; Optical; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Telemetry, Tracking and Control; Testing Facilities"

Ezal,kezal@toyon.com,"6800 Cortona Drive, Goleta, CA 93117 - 3021",(805) 968-6787,,,,,,6 to 7,"Attitude determination of spin-stabilized platforms is especially challenging. Current low-cost gyroscope technology does not lend itself to attitude determination of platforms spinning in excess of one rotation per second. Traditional GPS-based attitude (GPS/A) sensors require three or more antenna elements separated by large baselines. Single-element designs require extensive calibration of the satellite signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and are not very accurate. Toyon Research Corporation proposes to develop a small, single-aperture low-cost GPS/A sensor for space launch vehicles, and to demonstrate the sensor in an operational environment. The sensor determines the platform attitude with a single GPS antenna having a diameter of approximately 6.5 cm. The standalone performance of Toyon's GPS/A sensor on a spinning platform is better than 2.1 degrees for roll, and better than 1.2 degrees for yaw and pitch (one-sigma). The system performance can be further improved when integrated with accelerometers and/or magnetometers. Although current low-cost gyroscope technology does not allow their use on spinning platforms, non-spinning platforms may take advantage of gyro measurements for further improvements in attitude performance. During the proposed Phase II program Toyon will develop, build and test a prototype system that will be delivered for validation onboard an actual space launch vehicle.","Toyon's Miniature Integrated Direction-finding Attitude-determining Anti-jam System (MIDAAS(TM)) provides drift-free and temperature insensitive GPS-based attitude (GPS/A) measurements for small expendable launch vehicles and micro-satellites in a small package and at a lower cost than array-based GPS attitude systems. The stand-alone MIDAAS sensor performs equally well for spinning and non-spinning platforms, and can be integrated with alternative sensors such as accelerometers, magnetometers, and gyroscopes, when feasible. The MIDAAS technology has direct applications to any navigation system requiring 3-D attitude measurements including manned and unmanned vehicles and robots. When feasible, the integration of low-cost gyroscopes results in a ten-fold improvement in navigation accuracy without significant increases in cost: the MIDAAS sensor provides tactical-grade performance when integrated with a commercial-grade inertial measurement unit (IMU).","The MIDAAS GPS-based attitude (GPS/A) sensor technology is applicable to a wide range of military and civilian applications including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), micro air vehicles (MAVs), unattended ground sensors (UGS), handheld positioning units, recreational and military virtual- and mixed-reality orientation devices, radio-controlled (RC) vehicles, ground vehicles, and far-target locators, as well as military spin-stabilized munitions and platforms. The technology appeals to customers who desire robust position and attitude measurements for spinning and non-spinning platforms that have stringent cost and size, weight and power (SWAP) constraints.","Attitude Determination and Control; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Perception/Sensing; Telemetry, Tracking and Control"

TEMBOREG Reflectors incorporate non-tensioned graphite composite membranes that are formed using conventional construction techniques and stiffened using CTD's TEMBOREG shape-memory composite panels to allow practical packaging and deployment without complex mechanisms.  The simplicity of the design provides a significant cost advantage when compared to existing deployable reflector technologies, (4-fold cost reduction over mesh antenna and 2-fold reduction in manufacturing time) and the continuous graphite surface enables high frequency antenna operations at Ka band and above.  CTD can stow either a Cassegrainian (center-fed) or Gregorian (offset-fed) 5m TEMBOREG Reflectors in a Falcon 1e launch vehicle. To moderate cost and fabrication time, the TEMBOREG reflector is supported by a deployable backing structure.  In the proposed Phase II effort, CTD will further refine innovative backing structure developed in Phase I as well as to develop additional precision capability to enable both the high frequency (Ka band and above), large aperture (5 to 8 meters) performance required for near-term and future NASA programs.","NASA Earth surveying missions such as the Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission and DESDynI, are specific near-term NASA missions with  needs for large aperture reflectors to provide L-band radar and radiometers.  Although these missions are within the frequency capability of mesh reflectors, JPL has expressed concern that the poor side-lobe performance of mesh reflectors may significantly degrade the performance of the L-band radiometer. This poor side-lobe performance on the mesh reflectors is believed to be due to edge infringements inherent in the mesh reflector design. The TEMBO solid-surface deployable reflectors being developed by CTD, , exactly meet this need. Also, Space Science missions, such as the proposed Europa Lander CADMUS  and a Venus Radar instrument being developed by JPL will need large aperture deployable antenna reflectors. CTD's TEMBOREG Reflector could also be key to the success of these missions by providing increased deployed aperture and high-frequency capability at low cost and risk.","CTD has been working with the Air Force and the Missile Defense Agency to develop and implement components and subsystems based on CTD's Elastic Memory Composite materials.  For example, CTD has delivered EMC hinge/actuators to MicroSat Systems, Inc. to deploy an experimental solar array on the Air Force's TacSat-2 mission, which is currently scheduled for launch in late 2006.  Enhancements to CTD's Solid Surface TEMBOREG deployable reflectors are of interested to Operationally Responsive Space for lower frequency applications and in the future for other DoD applications.CTD has begun to identify several commercial terrestrial markets where nano-particle-reinforced TEMBOREG materials show great promise.  In one case, we have received $325K of funding from a customer to develop a prototype product, which is planned for field-testing in 2007.  This prototype represents the first of many possible applications for this customer, and we are currently negotiating development agreements for additional prototypes.  Our customer is the leader in the target market of interest.  Their 2002 sales of products that could incorporate some TEMBOREG products was $481M.  If TEMBOREG materials were used on only 25 percent of these products, and CTD received only 5 percent of these revenues as sales of TEMBOREG materials, this would result in $6M in annual sales.  We believe this is but the tip of the iceberg for the commercial potential for TEMBOREG polymers and composites.",Composites; In-situ Resource Utilization; Kinematic-Deployable; Large Antennas and Telescopes; Multifunctional/Smart Materials; Operations Concepts and Requirements; RF; Testing Requirements and Architectures

Flexible antennas are highly desired in many scenarios, such as pressurized rovers, pressurized habitats, space suits, and any other applications that require conformal profiles. Existing flexible electronics has an intrinsic low switching frequency due to their low carrier mobility.  The CNT network in solution we used has carrier mobility as high as 46770cm2/Vs and a large current-density carrying capacity of ~1000 mA/cm2, corresponding to a high carrying power of over 2000mW/cm2. Such high carrier mobility and large current carrying capacity allow us to achieve high-speed (>100GHz), high power flexible electronic circuits and antennas. A prototype of a fully printed S-band 4-bit 2D (4x4) 16-element PAA on flexible substrate such as Kapton, including FET based T/R module and phase shifters will be developed and optimized. For the FETs working as switches/amplifiers, the switch speed, on-off ration, the gain, noise figure, insertion loss and power consumption will be significantly improved through finding better gate dielectric material, increasing the CNT purity and the optimizing the FET geometry including the channel length and the channel width. Performance features of the printed PAA will be characterized including frequency/bandwidth, gain/efficiency, and power consumption. To survive NASA's stressing environment, the operating temperature range will be investigated and the performance under shock and vibration will be evaluated. The humidity test and aging tests will also be carried out. Radiation hard test will also be carried out in Phase II under the program manager's guidance.","The flexible PAAs can be used in lunar communication networks, space suits, large inflatable PAAs, high power electronics/antennas, and etc. (1) For Lunar local networksLunar local networks are expected to provide coverage for short (~10m) to medium range (~5-10km) communications at UHF/S/C-band, with date rates not to exceed 19 Mbps. The S-band PAA is specially designed for the lunar local communications. (2) For space suits during EVACompared with the ongoing research at JSC for EVA communications, our fully printed antenna can be ""stick-on"" directly on the outside of the space suit, while the wearable e-textile antenna is integrated into the clothing. It allows for optimal antenna placement for dynamic situations and can be easily peeled-off for exchange or repair.The printing process is much cheaper than weaving into space suite. (3) For large inflatable PAAAmong all large active PAA issues, the most serious is its cost (an electronic phase shifter costs between $200 and $5,000). The printing technology will enable large-area inflatable active PAA deployment, due to the dramatically reduced cost (estimated cost/per element around $20 for large arrays). (4) High power electronics/antennaThe CNT we used has a large current-density carrying capacity of ~1000 mA/cm2, corresponding to a high carrying power of 2000mW/cm2. Such a large power carrying capability allows this technology to be used in high power electronics/antenna applications.","The high operating frequency of the flexible nano-FET is particularly useful in many Non-NASA applications requiring ultra-sensitive and standalone, including:(1) RF  identification tags Omega Optics, Inc. has teamed up with the world leading RFID company, Checkpoint, for collaboration in high frequency RFID development.

Design goals include 20 meter apertures.  In order to minimize mission costs at these large diameters, weight must be severely restricted. Adherent Technologies, Inc. (ATI) has developed two technologies for ultra-light space structures and antennas, the Rigidization on CommandTM (ROC) concept, uses UV-curing resins to stabilize inflated structures and a self-deploying foam antenna concept at small aperture.  These technologies were combined in the Phase I program to produce a foam stabilized antenna with a ROC reflector surface.  The areal density of the 0.6 m devise was 2.2 kg/m3.In the Phase II program, ATI will team with ILC Dover and Allied EM to develop the needed materials, design, manufacture, deploy, and test a 3 m Ka band antenna based on the foam stabilized inflatable technology.  ATI will lead the materials development effort, optimizing the foam formulations and injection methods, as well as create a custom ROC resin for antenna applications. ILC Dover will manufacture the necessary inflatable mold, and Allied EM will be responsible for the RF design and testing.","The technology is designed to stabilize inflated structures in a vacuum environment.  The primary application is for very large aperture antennas as they are needed for interplanetary missions.  The design goal is an areal density of 1 kg/m3, which is easily met by the new approach.The concept is easily expanded for other inflatables like habitat modules for lunar exploration or connecting structures for modular space stations.","At the current development stage, the technology is limited to space applications.  Here it is competitive with state-of-the-art technology satellite antennas due to its low weight.  It has been shown that the foam formulations can also be modified for terrestrial applications.

The proposed RF front-end provides a post-launch, in-orbit reconfigurable RF module and is capable of Hz to >150GHz bandwidth.  Benefits include vastly reduced shelf inventory of equipment addressing different RF requirements and permits ever-ready deployment capabilities using a single piece of equipment featuring this proposed RF front-end.The UTR/FPMA's modular open architecture fully complements the flexibility of SDR technology. The UTR/FPMA services communications or radar functionality, narrow (kbps) to ultra-wideband (GHz) modulation bandwidths, center frequencies scalable >150 GHz: herein UHF to Ka band.

Only the local oscillator circuitry will need to be designed.  Appropriate application vehicles include, but are not limited to the CEV and LSAM.  The present UTR technology is highly compatible with Ka-band applications due to the fact that the associated six-port network can be implemented on-chip.  However, for lower frequencies below Ka band, the 6-port network of the present UTR technology will have to be off-chip.

In the Phase I project, treatments of the electrode materials resulted in increases of relative capacitance (2x), relative energy (4x), and relative power (25%). These results surpassed those of commercially available ECs for relative power and will fulfill NASA's need for energy storage materials for communications and navigation. We will address the following in the Phase II program: (1) Increase performance through exfoliation, activation, and other surface treatments; (2) Use these materials as supports for the deposition of pseudocapacitive species to form a nanocomposite electrode; (3) Improve the test cell fabrication to decrease equivalent series resistance (ESR) and passive layer formation; (4) Purify electrode materials and electrolyte to decrease leakage current and self-discharge; (5) Perform environmental testing including temperature, pressure, and vibration; (6) Fabricate, test, and deliver functional prototype cells to NASA at the end of the Phase II project. This technology is currently at a TRL of 3-4 and we expect to achieve a TRL of 5 with delivery of prototype cells to NASA for testing.","NASA is interested in electrochemical capacitors for transient power demands that are capable of rapid discharges, typically on the order of milliseconds. Such demands shorten battery and fuel cell lifetime. ECs will be used to complement an energy storage system (load leveling), dramatically lengthening battery/fuel cell lifetimes while reducing the required sizes of the batteries/fuel cells. Specifically ECs can be used in burst communications systems that require high power transients on the order of millisecond durations with a short number of total pulses to avoid detection. Other NASA applications would be flash LIDAR for Object Detection and Avoidance (ODA) systems (for avoiding rocks when landing) and autonomous rover guidance on a planet surface. Finally, NASA is looking to replace hydraulic systems with electromechanical actuators that require high transient power delivery. These requirements can be fulfilled by ECs which store charge that can be quickly discharged without burdening batteries or fuel cells.","Other applications include maintenance-free power sources for microcomputer memories, backup power for actuator and solenoid valves, and power supplements for consumer electronic devices. The biggest potential market of ECs will be the automotive sector for launch assist and regenerative braking in electric vehicles. ECs with improved performance (greater relative energy and power, improved charge/discharge capacities) are generating increased interest among producers of battery operated equipment. ECs can have a prominent impact on hybrid electric vehicles, where their implementation will accelerate the development of this technology. Successful development of this technology will improve the fuel efficiency of these HEVs significantly since the need for large batteries is reduced.

The combination of a visible dielectric mirror constructed on one side of a membrane and a band-pass filter on the second surface, offers a means of creating a very efficient solar reflector with relatively few coatings layers.  The exceptionally thin and flat optical substrate will minimize degradation of the laser signal.  2-meter membrane filters are sought by NASA to prevent over-heating of ground-based laser communication receivers operating during daylight hours.In Phase II, the designs will be scaled to large membrane substrates approximately 2-m in diameter.",This research will benefit future NASA programs requiring interplanetary laser communication.,"High quality membranes coated with precision optical coatings may be useful for large ground-based, segmented telescopes such as TMT and Hobby-Eberly.

This enormous market is waiting for low-cost, high quality substrates to achieve performance and fabrication economies of scale. After achieving dislocation densities below 1E7 cm-2 in the phase I work, this NASA SBIR phase II project addresses the development of a dislocation filter that can routinely prepare low-stress GaN thin films with threading dislocation densities below 1E6 cm-2. The method relies on using a low-angle ion beam to induce both nanofilter for defect reductions and to inhibit droplet formation at low growth temperatures. Dislocation densities have so far been determined by standard etch pit densities method. The goal the project to optimize the multiple defect nanofilter with smoothening by transition layers in between filters to reduce the TD to less than 1E6 cm-2 and process, fabricate high performance HEMT for solid state high power amplifier (SSPA) applications. To obtain a more practical evaluation of the effectiveness and commercial viability of the method, heterojunction field effect transistors with high electron mobility will be fabricated in these ultra-low defect density films. These high-quality material based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) will enable high linearity power amplifiers with excellent thermal stability and frequency response.

DTN forwarding is a mature technology, but requires an adaptable routing algorithm that covers opportunistic and scheduled modes of operation under stable or disrupted connectivity. SSCI, in collaboration with Boston University and BBN Technologies proposes novel adaptive hybrid routing protocols and efficient data set reconciliation algorithms that will significantly enhance the scalability and performance of state-of-the-art DTN approaches.

GEMS will provide situational awareness for distributed ground systems, and an understanding of how events and automated actions impact the system in real-time.  Recent software advancements have improved sustainability, extensibility, fault tolerance, and ease of automation for ground systems.  These traits are important for NASA's missions, from Exploration to Earth and Space Science, but can pose challenges, especially when the system has a high degree of interoperability and communications between components that isn't visible to the end-user.  Operators can quickly become overwhelmed with the increased complexity of software components constantly exchanging data and the volumes of information being passed around behind-the-scenes.  In fact, for largely distributed systems, as much ""situational awareness"" is needed for the ground system as for the spacecraft itself.  GEMS will provide a centralized integration framework that is needed to provide operators with transparency into the ground system, its state, and its component interactions.  GEMS will enhance plug-and-play integrations while providing information management and system coordination.  The innovation that enables GEMS is the development of ""data-driven"" algorithms and software adapters that gather data from the various components of the ground system to construct a data model that captures the system state, organizes the data, and displays it to the mission operators.","GEMS can support any NASA project that requires a ground system, including earth-orbiting satellites, lunar, deep-space, and interplanetary missions, as the key ground system technologies for these different classes of missions are inherently the same.  The concepts we propose allow GEMS to adapt to existing ground systems as well as integrate with ground systems in development.  A high percentage of NASA projects, especially the middleware-based projects, can benefit from the increased awareness of the ground system state and automation.  As such, under a Phase II proposal, Emergent will demonstrate GEMS to candidate missions for early adoption.  Emergent has had recent involvement integrating modern IT technologies with the SSMO Multi-Mission Operations Center, GMSEC, and TRMM.  Emergent employees have also worked with the Earth Observing System (EOS) missions in the past.  Current and future missions that could be targeted include the lunar missions such as LRO and exploration missions like Orion. Some potential NASA ARC missions for a GEMS implementation include GeneSat, PharmSat, LCROSS, LADEE, SMEX, and potentially others.","The GEMS system can be applied to commercial and other Government space industries directly.  Sample commercial applications could include the OrbImage satellites or the replenished ORBCOMM and Iridium satellites.  DoD and NOAA are government agencies that operate many satellites as well.  During Phase 2, Emergent will seek proposal calls and Broad Agency Announcements for opportunities to integrate GEMS into Non-NASA missions.  Looking outside of the space domain, GEMS could be applied to domains which use a large number of distributed systems and are highly automated, such as manufacturing.  Opportunities outside of the space industry would be pursued in a Phase 3 effort.","Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Computer System Architectures; Data Acquisition and End-to-End-Management; Database Development and Interfacing; Expert Systems; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation; Telemetry, Tracking and Control"

Such LIDAR systems offer the advantages of excellent spatial resolution, high efficiency, and high beam quality. We propose to design and fabricate a resonantly pumped, passively Q-switched Er:YAG laser for eye-safe wavelength operation. We will incorporate the Er:YAG crystal and saturable absorber into the pump module, creating a compact, robust, and efficient Q-switched solid-state microchip laser.

The performance of these devices will be enhanced by the addition of volume Bragg gratings (VBGs) for improved temperature stability and narrowed spectral line width for enhanced pump absorption. The development of these fiber coupled pump modules will be of great use to NASA for the pumping of future Er:YAG and Er-doped fiber laser systems, enabling high pulse energy eye-safe LIDAR systems.","The development of an eye-safe Er:YAG micro-chip laser is an enabling technology for future spaceflight missions. Lower power (sub mJ range), variable repetition rate LIDAR systems should be of particular interest to NASA for proximity sensing, spacecraft docking, landing and rendezvous aid, laser altimeters, backscatter LIDAR, and for laser ranging systems. Where powers in the 1-20 mJ range are needed, for atmospheric backscatter measurements or laser altimeter measurements, the pump power, crystal dimensions and saturable absorber can be designed to meet the mission requirements. Additional applications of the Q-switched pulses at 1.6 to 1.65 um are for the remote detection of CO2, Hydrogen, or methane. This program will also enable the development of ultra-high brightness eye-safe pump modules at 1470-1532 nm. In the case where longer wavelengths are needed for the remote sensing of industrial pollutants, the solid state crystal, dopants, and pump wavelength can be reached by mutual agreement between NASA and nLIGHT. The approach being taken lends itself to other pump sources and solid state crystals, such as Ho:YLF pumped at 1938nm or 1892nm or Thulium-based solid state crystals pumped between 1600 and 1750 nm. No fundamental change in architecture would be required, resulting in enhanced cross-mission utilization.

The proposed Phase II efforts are directed at designing and building a bench-top HSRL 532nm receiver that is capable of taking accurate measurements of aerosol scattering ratio, extinction coefficients, molecular temperature and line-of-sight (LOS) velocity.  This demonstration unit will verify a new adaptive interferometer measurement technique, called the Programmable Edge Technique (PET), which makes use of a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) in conjunction with a Fabry-Perot interferometer and two photo-multiplier tubes (PMT).  The completed bench-top receiver design will serve as the baseline for future aircraft mounted implementations.","This research is directly applicable to the highly-modular HSRL system at NASA Langley Research Center. Subsequent development of this work will result in a system that can validate and extend the current HSRL system. A 532nm implementation of this work will allow cross-validation of the HSRL and PET techniques, as well as add extended capability for temperature, density, pressure and line-of-sight (vertical) wind velocity estimation.","The atmospheric measurement capabilities made possible through this research aids in military areas such as atmospheric mitigation for snipers, long-range gunnery and precision landing zones for manned and unmanned aircraft as well as meteorological monitoring to assist in Nuclear/Biological/Chemical (NBC) threat analysis and tracking.Non-military applications include clear-air turbulence sensing for commercial aircraft, meteorological monitoring of tropospheric and upper-atmosphere winds, and site selection and improved efficiency for wind farms.",Optical; Photonics

These instruments such as the HIRAD (Hurricane Intensity Radiometer), SFMR (Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer), and LRR (Lightweight Rainfall Radiometer), provide unique data accumulation capabilities for observing sea surface wind, temperature, and rainfall and significantly enhance the understanding and predictability of hurricane intensity. These microwave instruments require extremely efficient wideband or multiband antennas. For the Phase I SBIR program Spectra Research, Inc. teamed with Scientists from the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) to apply new technological antenna advances and new antenna design tools toward solving the challenge of designing small, multi-function antennas that reduce the space, weight, and drag demand on the platform.The results of the analysis and numerical design in the Phase I program show strong potential for an antenna array that will satisfy all design requirements of a high efficiency replacement for the Hurricane Intensity Radiometer (HIRAD) array. Multiple fragmented aperture arrays were employed in a thin antenna element to achieve exceptional gain (within 0.2 dB of the aperture limited gain) over the entire band from 4-7 GHz with a superb VSWR of < 1.5.","The detailed analysis conducted on this program along with the numerical design shows strong potential for an antenna array that will satisfy all design requirements for a drop-in replacement for the Hurricane Intensity Radiometer (HIRAD) array with improved performance. The completed design will be reformatted in the Phase II program to specifically address the element size and spacing requirements required for a direct replacement of the thicker, lower performance, stacked patch antenna array currently utilized for the HIRAD application. In addition, the antenna array can be redesigned in the Phase II program to be a multi-band array rather than a wideband array if the HIRAD program team would prefer. The thickness of the antenna array can be further reduced (to a dimension as small as 5 mm) through the application of specialized meta-materials to accomplish all design objectives. This advanced antenna array employing fragmented aperture technologies provide NASA with the opportunity for continued improvement of the SFMR (Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer), and LRR (Lightweight Rainfall Radiometer) and increase NASA capabilities in accurate weather prediction and tracking.","The proposed Phase II effort is an important step towards continued commercialization of thin conformal antenna arrays for electronically scanned antennas for military and civilian utilization. There is a significant civilian market for low cost phased array antennas, particularly for mobile satellite communications applications. There is a clear market pull for phased arrays for both military electronics and the commercial broadband wireless and satellite communications arena.  In addition, there are numerous opportunities for other tunable devices in the commercial wireless sector.

It consisted of a waveguide to microstrip transition, an input coupler, the balanced amplifier, an output coupler, and a microstrip to waveguide transition. The MMIC chip that consisted of the input and output coupler and balanced amplifier was 1.4mm long by 1.23mm wide. The simulated performance demonstrated a gain of 25.6dB with a noise figure of 4.4dB midband.

Many of NASA's remote sensing satellites for weather forecasting and tracking presently have water band sensors that operate at G-Band. However, these sensors have limited capability since low noise amplifiers are not available at the present time. These systems presently have mixer front ends with limited sensitivity. The G-Band low noise amplifier will greatly enchance the sensitivity of these systems as well as providing more accurate weather forecasting and tracking of storms such as hurricanes.

The SVHM instrument is capable of making high accuracy vector component measurements of Earth and planetary magnetic fields. The major SVHM innovation is use of scalar field measurements made with the SVHM sensor to self-calibrate the vector measurements thereby eliminating the standard suite of three fluxgate vector magnetometers and the independent scalar magnetometer required to correct for fluxgate drifts and offsets. The SVHM bread-board conceptual design can achieve a dynamic range of ¡Ó65,000 nT, both vector and scalar accuracy with self-calibration of ¡Ó1 nT, and sensitivity of <10 pT /©Hz. The SVHM bread-board will be miniaturized to meet volume, power and mass goals. The SVHM bread-board will utilize a fiber-coupled laser pump source and resonance drive, which permits reduction of helium cell volume by a factor of 10 and eliminates resonance drive coils and cables. The feasibility of designing a brass-board SVHM model using advanced laser and digital components was established in Phase 1. The SVHM bread-board will be calibrated and the self-calibration function demonstrated at a NASA coil facility during Phase 2.","The accurate measurement of the magnetic field components and their orientation in space is recognized as a basic requirement for space research. Conventional scalar and vector magnetometers measure the Earth¡¦s scalar field value in the range from 25,000 nT to 100,000 nT. The SVHM will be used to map near-Earth and distant-Earth magnetic fields in orbit and high-altitude aircraft. The major feature of the SVHM is its outstanding accuracy. This feature makes possible a major mapping project similar to MAGSAT with SVHM instruments on multiple satellites. On the Earth and other planets, the magnetic field provides unique information on the structure and dynamics of the planetary interior, fluid flow within and upon its surface, and the influence of the solar environment. The SVHM vector mode can provide high accuracy vector measurements of solar and planetary magnetic fields equal to or less than the Earth¡¦s field.","The SVHM characteristics of outstanding accuracy, omni-directionality (no dead zones), and high-frequency signal response will open up a variety of commercial and military applications. The SVHM will be used at the Earth's surface for geophysical airborne and surface magnetic prospecting as well as the new standard for geomagnetic observatories.

Recent advances in sensor technology at NASA and other government laboratories, in academia, and in industry have led to the development of very small mass spectrometer detectors, as well as other analytical instruments needing high vacuum, such as scanning electron microscopes.  However, the vacuum systems to support these sensors remain large, heavy, and power hungry.  To meet this need, Creare proposes to build a miniaturized vacuum system based on a very small, rugged, and inexpensive-to-manufacture, molecular drag pump (MDP).

The pump represents an order-of-magnitude reduction in mass, volume, and cost over current, commercially available, state-of-the-art vacuum pumps.  The new pump will form the heart of a complete vacuum system optimized to support analytical instruments in terrestrial applications as well as on spacecraft and planetary landers.  Furthermore, the miniature high-speed motor will be designed so that it can be used in a wide range of high vacuum pumps, including pure molecular drag, pure turbomolecular, and hybrid turbomolecular/molecular drag pumps that can be tailored to the requirements of specific missions and applications.","A number of current NASA initiatives seek to reduce the size and power requirement of scientific instruments.  Success in these efforts will lead to new generations of sensors that can be deployed on smaller, less expensive platforms, including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), balloons, microspacecraft, and miniature interplanetary probes.  Our proposed rugged vacuum system directly supports these goals by reducing the size, weight and power consumption of vacuum systems required to run these instruments.  In addition, the pump technology that we will develop under this program is currently baselined as a part of the MOMA instrument being developed (under NASA funding) by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory for a 2013 Mars mission as well as part of the development of a NASA/GSFC, next-generation laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometer that has significantly improved capabilities and robustness for in situ astrobiology missions which were recently selected for funding under the NASA ASTID program.","Numerous commercial applications exist for the proposed rugged, low-cost vacuum system, primarily to support portable analytical instruments such as mass spectrometers and leak detectors.

The self contained thruster system shall be capable of delivering ~75µN with sufficient total impulse to de-tumble spacecraft such as LISA. The proposed Phase 2 work builds upon a highly successful Phase 1 effort where the key principals of the innovation, a propellant isolation membrane and a passive capillary feed system, were unequivocally demonstrated.  The proposed system is completely passive with no moving parts and requires no valves to ensure its high reliability.  In order to inhibit propellant contamination prior to operation in space, a unique isolation membrane will separate propellant from the emitter.  Upon heating the isolation membrane dissolves, allowing propellant from a collocated reservoir to flow forward to the electrospray thruster without contamination.  The thruster consists of an array of self adjusting emission sites that are activated by application of an electric field that initiates emission.  The delivered thrust is modulated by varying the applied electric field. The significant innovations of the proposed colloid thruster include: a compact, low power, modular thruster system containing no moving parts, which is capable of delivering sufficient thrust for spacecraft tip-off control and ACS applications.","Busek has recently delivered two colloid thruster clusters with eight complete thruster systems to JPL for use on the LISA Pathfinder mission, a precursor to LISA.  Both missions require very precise, low noise micro-thrusters that are specific to the science portion of the mission.  Such thrusters are not well suited for the more general thrusting task of launch vehicle separation tip-off cancellation, which requires larger thrusts.  Using the same thrusters for the science portion of the mission that are designed for the tip-off requirements compromises their achievable performance and limits lifetime, suggesting that a secondary thruster system is preferred to perform short term, higher thruster maneuvers.  We believe that the simple colloid thruster proposed herein is capable of meeting the tip-off requirements for the LISA mission, thus allowing the primary colloid thrusters to be designed based solely on science mission requirements.  The completely passive, compact, self contained tip-off colloid thruster system will have minimal impact on overall spacecraft system design.  This thruster will also be useful for other missions where a compact, bolt-on propulsion system is necessary for short-duration, high-thrust maneuvers.","There are ongoing trends toward miniaturization of spacecraft to very small sizes, however, developing an efficient miniaturized propulsion system is seen as a challenge to achieving widespread commercial, military and government application.  While electronics and sensors have made great advances in miniaturization, studies have shown that micro-satellites are constrained by lack of suitable propulsion.  This represents a significant market opportunity for colloid propulsion.  The colloid thruster proposed here combines a small footprint, simple construction, and a strong technological heritage (e.g. ST7) that enables it to fulfill primary, ACS, and tip-off thrust operations for a wide range of micro/nano-satellites.",Electrostatic Thrusters; Feed System Components; Micro Thrusters; Propellant Storage

Time and fuel-optimal maneuvers are only a part of the optimization problem.  Selecting the maneuver waypoints (number and location) determines the quality of the synthesized image.  The number of S/C, the size of the sub-apertures, and the type of propulsion system used also impacts imaging rate, propellant mass, and mission cost.  Capturing all of these mission aspects in an integrated mission optimization framework helps mission designers to select the most appropriate architecture for meeting the needs and constraints of missions such as SI.","The SIMO technology is directly applicable to, and motivated by, NASA GSFC's Stellar Imager mission. However, other NASA missions requiring staged control are the Space Interferometry Mission, Terrestrial Planet Finder Mission (Interferometer and Coronagraph), SPIRIT, and SPECS.  In fact, the Terrestrial Planet Finder Mission  Interferometer requires both sub-aperture reconfiguration as well as staged control.  Of particular interest may be the LISA mission.  NASA and ESA are currently trying to validate the ability to free-float a proof mass, measure its motion to pico-meter accuracy relative to the encompassing spacecraft, measure range between spacecraft as well as capture and maintain this knowledge.  This has proven to be a financially challenging endeavor.  The capabilities being developed for SIMO, as well as the potential to transition it to the micro-gravity environment of ISS, creates an opportunity to test staged sensing and control in support of LISA at a fraction of the cost.","We anticipate that there are other applications both within NASA and beyond, and in military and commercial sectors. The DARPA F6 program is creating a virtual satellite architecture where elements are flown in loose formation to enhance staged deployment, technology upgrade, payload reconfiguration, and survivability using the technologies of distributed communication/computing, power beaming, and cluster flight.  The AFS-MIT team is a member of three of the four competing teams under DARPA's F6 program, providing a direct path for SIMO technology transfer.

When two surfaces are brought into contact, the actual contact area is usually much smaller than the apparent contact area, resulting in a thermal barrier at the interface. The problem becomes even more severe in vacuum and low temperature environments. Therefore, high thermal conductivity and vacuum compatible thermal interface materials are crucial to thermal control of electronic devices in space applications.","The proposed thermal interface technology is believed to be applicable to many uses in thermal management.

The goal of this SBIR program is to enhance the operating tolerance of high efficiency III-V solar cells by employing nanostructured materials in advanced device designs.  A larger fraction of the solar spectrum can potentially be harnessed while maximizing the solar cell operating voltage by embedding thin layers of narrow band gap material in a higher band gap matrix.  Nanostructured devices thus provide a means to decouple the usual dependence of short circuit current on open circuit voltage that limits conventional solar cell design.  While previous experimental work on quantum well or quantum dot solar cell devices has typically employed GaAs as the wide band gap matrix, we take a different approach, instead employing InGaP as the barrier material.  During the Phase I effort, we observed that thin InGaP layers can be extremely effective at reducing the dark current.  A novel device structure resulted in over a 100 mV enhancement in the open circuit voltage of GaAs PIN diodes solar cells without any degradation in the short circuit current.   The Phase II program will aim to further optimize single-junction nanostructured InGaP solar cells and then utilize these cells as building blocks to construct robust, multijunction photovoltaic devices with power conversion efficiencies approaching 40%.  Ultimately, the technical approach employed in this program has the potential of achieving conversion efficiencies exceeding 50% with a single p-n junction device, enabling improved overall performance and lower manufacturing costs.","Future space exploration missions will require photovoltaic power systems capable of operating over a wide range of conditions, ranging from extreme environments with high temperatures and tremendous radiation exposures to low temperature, low intensity conditions.  Conventional multijunction solar cells can provide high conversion efficiencies, but only under limited environmental conditions.  The near term objective of this SBIR program is to build a solar cell using nanostructured wide band gap materials that matches the conversion efficiency of conventional multijunction technologies while performing over a much wider range of operating conditions.  The technology developed during this program is expected to have immediate market opportunities as power systems for NASA science missions.","The SBIR project described here is part of a larger effort to realize the ultimate objective of third generation photovoltaics, namely ultra-high conversion efficiency at low costs.  The wider operating conditions enabled by nanostructured InGaP solar cells would substantially enhance the overall performance of terrestrial concentrator photovoltaic systems.  This technology could thus accelerate the adoption of photovoltaics into the renewable energy market to address the world's growing energy needs without degrading the environment.  In addition to its potential commercial value and social benefits, this SBIR program will enhance the technical understanding of quantum well and quantum dot devices.",Photovoltaic Conversion; Radiation-Hard/Resistant Electronics; Renewable Energy; Semi-Conductors/Solid State Device Materials; Solar

It is an on-going challenge to maximize electrical power available to spacecraft while reducing overall stowage volume and mass of solar array, which requires developing more efficient solar cells with higher specific power density. The objective of this SBIR project is to develop a generic approach, based on novel functional nano-materials, to significantly increasing the solar cell efficiency (~10%), specific power density, radiation resistance and lifetime, without adding much cost or weight to the existing solar cells. The feasibility to synthesis such nano-materials has been explored and demonstrated in Phase I. Without optimizing, preliminary test on commercial solar cells show an efficiency gain approaching 5% after applying such nano-materials. Such nano-materials will be further improved for energy efficiency and environmental durability in Phase II, to reach the objective of at least 10% gain in energy efficiency on majority of commercial solar cells.","The novel nano-materials will find major applications in many NASA space programs.

Majority of previous lunar lander concepts with the precision/pinpoint landing capability required expensive and risky development of new GNC and landing sensors (scanning lidars, multi-beam mm-ww radar, etc.). Our proposed alternative consists solely of existing and low-cost sensors that synergistically leverage each capability and compensate for individual sensor weaknesses. For example, we can use a simple single-beam low-frequency radar altimeter (available at low-cost off-the-shelf, and proven on several Mars lander missions). The low-frequency radar can meet the maximum slant range requirements much easier than the mm-wave sensor but it does not have the adequate multiple narrow beam capability of the Apollo LM or Viking lander radar. However, the optical descent imaging measurement (using DSMAC-type sensor) can supplement the single beam radar measurement and obtain the same information about the complete state vector. There are several similar concepts implemented in this sensor suite of complementing strengths and weakness of individual sensors.","The successful integration of low-cost GNC suite would open wide area for sales of that system for several other applications besides the lunar lander (Mars and asteroids mission, and proximity and rendezvous operations in LEO).

The new star sensor proposed here will focus on PnP compatibility for NASA missions of interest, with a mass goal of 0.5 to 0.75 kg.  Anticipated NASA applications necessitate a modified version of the baseline MicroMakTM sensor, including: 1) Interfaces compatible with a new PnP avionics architecture, 2) radiation-hardened CMOS focal plane arrays (FPAs), and 3) processing electronics to enable longer mission life. The baseline MicroMakTM sensor was designed with inherent radiation-tolerant features: FPAs with no direct view of space, and all-reflective optical elements.

This sensor can also support multiple applications, including spacecraft attitude determination, formation flying, and rendezvous and docking. The expected PnP compatibility and low mass, power, and cost will fill the near term need for improved, low cost attitude sensing technology with lower cost, complexity, mass, and power than traditional solutions.  When combined with other sensors, such as an IMU, the new star sensor will have additional capabilities. Microcosm's precision navigation with integrated attitude determination sensor is directly applicable, providing an opportunity to enhance the new star sensor by adding a low-cost micro-electromechanical IMU and GPS receiver. This device can provide higher attitude output rates, up to 100 Hz, supporting additional applications.","The sensor will also have applications for other government systems with similar PnP, attitude accuracy, mission lifetime, and radiation tolerance requirements. Programs seeking rapid spacecraft integration cycles, employing PnP architectures, will also benefit from this new sensor.  The Air Force Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) program may be a customer. Microcosm is currently selling components in the satellite attitude determination and control system market, and the MicroMakTM star sensor should be ready for market in the next two to three years. The proposed new PnP star sensor could be ready for operational flight status in this same time frame, if its development is pursued aggressively in parallel with the baseline MicroMakTM sensor.  Both LEO and GEO satellites could take advantage of such a sensor as well, facilitating rapid, low-cost integration, and possible new applications, such as mounting directly to a communications antenna to get significantly improved determination of antenna pointing.","Attitude Determination and Control; Guidance, Navigation, and Control"

In this thruster, propellant gas is introduced into the thrust nozzle through a fast acting gas valve where a short, high voltage pulse is applied to break down and heat the propellant gas. The heated gas expands in the nozzle generating a high impulse (~mN-s per pulse) at a high specific thrust (120 £gN-s/joule). The specific impulse (Isp) will be in the range of 500~1500 sec. This process can be repeated at a frequency to meet the spacecraft thrust requirements. The thrust generating mechanism of the proposed thruster is gasdynamic expansion, not magnetohydrodynamic interaction. The proposed thruster is different from the conventional pulsed electrothermal thruster in that the joule heating of the propellant takes place as the propellant gas expands through the divergent nozzle, thereby eliminating the heat and momentum losses at the nozzle throat. Our Phase II objectives are: (i) develop an engineering model; and (ii) develop a proto-flight model of the proposed thruster system.","The Pulsed ElectroGasdynamic (PEG) thruster, when developed to technical maturity, will be used for satellite mobility, such as rapidly changing position for rendezvous, attitude control, orbital maneuvering and controlled satellite constellation formation. These maneuvers require a relatively high thrust (mN ~ N) at a moderately high specific impulse (Isp l 1000 sec) and a high electric efficiency (~60%). The PEG thruster will meet this requirement in a broad thrust range. For example, when operated at 1 Hz, the PEG thruster will generate a thrust of 1 mN with 10 W of electric power input. At higher pulse rates, 100 Hz for example, 100 mN of thrust will be generated with 1 kW of electric power. Higher thrust can be obtained by scaling up the thruster size. The PEG thruster in a low power mode will also be used for station keeping applications. To this end, a PEG thruster suite can be added to any spacecraft equipped with a N2H4/NTO Monopropellant/Bipropellant propulsion system without incurring a mass penalty for high precision ¡§digital¡¨ attitude corrections at a higher Isp than is obtained with the conventional monopropellant solution. Furthermore storable ¡§Green¡¨ propellants such as N2O and NH3 are very suitable as PEG thruster propellants. The PEG thruster will serve NASA¡¦s Science Mission Directorate needs in earth orbit, near-earth and in deep space.","The Pulsed ElectroGasdynamic (PEG) thruster will be very useful for military applications that require: (i) wide dynamic range in thrust; (ii) high Isp; and (iii) high electrical efficiency. For purely commercial applications, the PEG thruster will be useful for satellite station keeping, orbit raising, and attitude control. For such applications the following advantages of the PEG thruster can be fully exploited: (i) various kinds of propellant gas can be used; (ii) thrust level can be adjusted by changing pulse frequency over 2~3 orders of magnitude; (iii) the life time of the thruster hardware will be much longer than the other thrusters; and (iv) construction of the thruster is simple and can be scaled easily.",Micro Thrusters

This environment will be designed to streamline processes at the NASA Ames Mission Design Center. Several key concepts are introduced. The proposed environment introduces modern Product Data Management and Product Lifecycle Management (PDM/PLM) tools and processes to satellite mission design. Specifically, the notion of product structure, or bill of material (BOM), is expanded to a simulation BOM, or SBOM, with the capability to manage engineering analysis data, files and processes in the context of a product, in this case satellite mission. This approach constitutes a significant step beyond mere document management, which limits the traceability of which model of which analysis belongs to which version of the geometry or other analysis. It is a key enabler for model re-use. A Linked Model Environment (LME), i.e. an environment where all engineering analysis models are associatively linked, which was developed concurrently in the commercial aerospace and automotive industry, will extended to satellite mission design. This environment significantly reduces the amount of manual intervention engineers have to perform to translate information from one simulation tool to another. The concept of digital mockup (DMU), which typically addresses form and fit of components in an assembly, is expanded to include function, such that the inclusion of components in a satellite assembly that are functionally incompatible is rejected. Repetitive-iterative engineering tasks will be automated with the help of an integration framework tool which automates the execution of a sequence of codes and provides the capability to wrap drivers like optimizers or quality engineering tools around an automated analysis workflow.","The results of this research directly benefit the NASA Ames Mission Design Center in their activity of assembling Small Satellite missions. Currently, the Missions Design Center does not employ an integrated, PLM-based approach in their design activities. The Mission Design Center receives geometric information from component suppliers in a variety of formats. The current in-house CAD package is Solidworks. Analysis tools such as STK and disciplines such as structural and thermal analysis need subsets of the detailed CAD geometry in particular formats that they can process. Currently, much time is spent converting geometry from one format to another, and critical information can be lost in the process. The proposed work will directly address these issues.In addition, there are a number of additional potential applications of this technology. For example, JPL could use our tools in the design of exploratory space probes. The tools could also play a role in the development of micro and nano satellites all the way to manned space missions.","The proposed VSIE is directly applicable to the Plug&Play space vehicle design approach currently being investigated by the US Air Force at AFRL Kirtland AFB. The goal of the plug and play space vehicle design approach is to apply the proven capability of computer peripherals to integrate themselves with computers to space vehicle components. This will enable space vehicles to be assembled quickly enough to meet rapidly developing operational needs where time is the critical factor.  Advatech Pacific is currently working with AFRL Kirtland AFB to develop the ISET tool which enables pre-conceptual/conceptual level design of space vehicles by both traditional approaches and utilizing standardized plug and play space vehicle components.  The enhanced DMU and data management concepts suggested in the present proposal will be directly applicable to support this Plug&Play scenario. This type of technology will be a key enabler for the Responsive Space Launch program by the US Air Force. On the commercial side, any of the primes or first tier suppliers could benefit from the tools being developed, specifically on small satellite projects.",Launch and Flight Vehicle; Modular Interconnects; Power Management and Distribution; Simulation Modeling Environment; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation; Structural Modeling and Tools; Testing Requirements and Architectures; Wireless Distribution

The prototype agile stations will operate in a wide band used by NASA and other science and technology satellites and will be able to switch between communications frequencies, modes and data protocols, in real time, to service multiple satellites. The stations will be remotely programmable to store portfolios of satellite applications, and will switch between applications on demand from the largely automatized Ground Station Management and Maintenance Center (GSMMC). Multiple station sites will provide a high level of back-up capability and link opportunities at up to 3.5Mbits/s and will eliminate down-times. The GSMMC will interface with the different satellite Mission Operation Centers, and oversee the scheduling and programming of the station system. The prototype system will be implemented on the existing HETE-2 network of three stations, opening that system to service multiple missions at very low cost, while significantly enhancing its capabilities and performance.","The Open System of Agile Stations will be of interest to many developers of NASA science and technology missions. Developers of SMEX projects for example are and will be interested in a ready-made low cost ground system that provides a flexible, reliable and economical solution to their spacecraft communication requirements, at up to 3.5 Mbit/s, and more in future versions.Another application is as a back-up system for NASA and other missions. Existing and future NASA systems, operating in the S-band (and beyond in future versions) could  have their specific applications on file at all the ground stations in the network, ready to be activated when the need arises. This for the small cost of developing and testing SDR code adapted to their communication system, which can be done in a few weeks. Current  NASA projects such as TESS have already expressed a strong interest in using the prototype system, and are encouraging its development. There is no doubt that when the Open System of Agile Stations prototype is build and tested it will find NASA applications, and requirements will grow.","DoD experimenters have a potential need for a network of agile stations to support experimental missions with a high level of flexibility and at low communication costs. AFRL promoted the development of a pilot SDR ground station system to support the PnPSat project and test the Agile Station concept.  DoD has specific requirement concerning data security that can be accommodated by separate clusters of agile  ground stations. We expect that when the Phase II prototype Open System of Agile Ground Stations is developed and tested, a DREN version of the system will be of interest to DoD experimenters.Non governmental projects have also expressed similar needs and interest, and the Open System of Agile Stations has potential  users within the low-earth-orbiting projects where it can be used either as the primary system or as a back-up and an easy alternative way to download additional data or send commands to the satellites.","Architectures and Networks; Telemetry, Tracking and Control"

Flash Ladar Video Cameras are 3D video cameras that return range and intensity information for each pixel in real time, and is functionally equivalent to 16000 range finders on one chip.  Actual data collected, at the JPL mars yard, using ASC's compact Flash Ladar system demonstrated in a previous NASA phase I SBIR effort confirm that the ASC Flash LADAR Video Camera (FLVC) system can meet the requirements for Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL).   The FLVC's small size, low power and very fast range data frame rate (30Hz) the sensor can be configured for a variety of EDL missions. An existing Phase two effort is fabricating a compact FLVC for delivery to NASA for field testing, however the system is not hardened.  The proposed Phase 2 effort will produce a space qualified sensor engine which can be integrated with the system being delivered to NASA.  The sensor engine is the break-though enabling technology for the FLVC.  The sensor engine will be fabricated, tested and used to upgrade the camera JPL.  As a result of these improvements, the TRL level of this sensor will be at 6-7.  Flash Ladar is ideal for determining real-time spacecraft trajectory, speed and orientation to the planet surface, as well as evaluating potential hazards at the landing site is required for precision landing.  Sloped ground, craters, rocks and surface composition are among the potential hazards.  The ""framing camera"" nature, of Flash LADAR systems, makes them well suited as hazard avoidance sensors for EDL.  Flash LADAR can provide a direct, real-time measurement of the altitude of the spacecraft during descent as well as surface relative velocity and orientation, while simultaneously mapping the topography of the terrain below to identify landing hazards and provide localization information.","This sensor will increase the success of NASA operations such as: Mars Landed Exploration  Exploration of Moons (ALHAT, Jupiter Icy Moons)  Asteroid and Comet Rendezvous and Sample Return  ISS Rendezvous and Docking  Space Situational Awareness  Rock Abundance and Distribution Maps  Topographical Mapping  Rover Mobility and Navigation NASA Langley Research Center has purchased two of ASC's existing FLVC systems for performing laboratory, field, and airborne test and evaluation of this technology for use on the ALHAT program.

Obtaining and delivering a sample can be a complex engineering problem, especially if it's done autonomously thousands of miles away. To accommodate future missions, these subsurface access and sample handling technologies must be developed to meet a broad range of potential requirements, including a variety of rock or subsurface materials, rigorous sample preservation requirements, and the general problem of autonomous operation in the presence of dust and with limited resources. The one-to-three meter range has been identified as a critical regime for planetary exploration and while there has been some technology development in this regime, there is currently no proven flight-like approach to robotically achieving this depth through layers of challenging material from realistic roving or landed platforms. The Phase 1 research has resulted in proving the benefits of rotary-percussive drilling system as it pertains to breaking of formation and cuttings transport. The primary objective of the proposed effort is to develop, via testing in a simulated Mars environment, a breadboard one-meter sampling drilling system for acquiring a small volume of drilled cuttings and a core (if necessary) from a target depth on Mars. This project would build on the existing knowledge base of Mars drilling, and its particular strength lies with its capability of performing drilling tests under simulated Martian conditions of temperature and pressure and CO2 atmosphere.This is a component technology effort that includes the development of a rotary percussive drill head and a sampling lead drill string. Honeybee Robotics will leverage drill head development by utilizing voice coil percussive actuator technology developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for the Mars Science Laboratory Powder Drill.","The Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group has identified subsurface access as a major technology need for future Mars science missions - key to understanding conditions favorable to life including the presence and morphology of forms of water, as well as for geological investigations. Potentially relevant missions may include Astrobiology Field Laboratory, Mid-Size Rovers, Mars Scout, and Mars Sample Return. A subsurface access tool (robotic or astronaut-assisted) for the Moon be of scientific interest and also necessary for ground truth for resource mapping (including the presence, form, and concentration of potential polar cap water ice, potential in the 1-3 meter depth range) and regolith geotechnical properties assessment. A drill with sample acquisition and analysis, could identify regolith composition for the purposes of determining the presence and quantities of lunar resources for future in situ resource utilization. In addition, regolith geotechnical properties may also be roughly inferred from drill telemetry. This information is important for understanding excavability, load-bearing capacity and trafficability of lunar regolith for ISRU and lunar infrastructure development in preparation for lunar human bases. A 1m class drill could also be modified for Venus, comets, Europa and Near Earth Objects. In addition the lessons learned from this effort may be extrapolated to shallow surface drilling as well as deep drilling missions.","Low cost, low mass drills could be used to quickly assess hazardous areas (oil spill sites around the refineries, toxic waste disposal sites, volcanoes, etc.) without endangering human life. In addition, the Department of Defense could deploy such rovers in conflict zones to assess the road trafficability potential prior to deployment of rescue teams as well as for identifying buried items such as mines. The petroleum and mining industries have also shown interest in robotic sampling. Honeybee Robotics is currently leveraging our experience in this area by working with a major mining concern on developing the ""Mine of the Future"". There is also a great need for this type of drill for Arctic sampling and extreme biology studies to acquire uncontaminated samples.",In-situ Resource Utilization; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Manipulation; Perception/Sensing; Tools

Paramount to this is exploration missions capable of in-situ analysis of core samples that deliver the stratigraphy of the target. These sample handling technologies must be developed to meet a broad range of potential requirements, including a variety of rock or subsurface materials, rigorous sample preservation requirements, and the general problem of autonomous operation in the presence of dust and with limited resources. Honeybee seeks to develop critical subsystems for a small, low-mass, low-power Rotary-Percussive Corer (RoPeC) capable of autonomous sample acquisition and delivery from a depth of 5 cm. Specific attention will be given to the tall-pole items including the core break-off, retention, delivery, rotary-percussive drive, and gas flushing subsystems. Near term applications include the Astrobiology Field Laboratory and Mars Sample Return missions. Previous coring tool development has focused on integration and far-horizon proof of concepts; resulting in complete systems designed around specific requirements. The path forward lies in maturing specific aspects of designs quickly. The Phase 1 research has resulted in a survey of existing sampling systems as well as a conceptual design of the RoPeC with a focus on modularity. In Phase 2, Honeybee will mature the design of RoPeC subsystems; including the integration of a percussive voice coil actuator developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Powder Acquisition Drill System. A focus on modularity will ensure that subsystems can be redesigned independently; enabling the acquisition of core samples in targets including MEPAG suggested rocks, MSL Mars analogs and Phoenix analogs. This will lead to the a TRL of 5-6.","Future robotic astrobiology missions such as Astrobiology Field Laboratory or Mars Sample Return will benefit greatly from the ability to capture rock and regolith cores. The drill could be also deployed during lunar sortie missions by astronauts (hand held coring drill) since it is desirable to bring a small core back as opposed to a large rock.From a science standpoint, core samples have a distinct advantage over collected drill cuttings in that the stratigraphy and morphology of the sample is preserved. This facilitates detection of localized organics and fossil biosignatures, as well as analysis of geochemistry and mineralogy. The need for a flight-ready surface coring tool has been evident in various NASA program reviews, mission concepts, and mission baselines.RoPeC, a low-mass, low-power drill, will reach a depth of 5cm in rock, regolith, and icy soil, and will be robotic-arm-mountable, enabling access to outcroppings and other non-horizontal target formations. Using a rotary-percussive drilling mechanism will enable penetration of strong basaltic or icy targets without unduly compromising tool life or power requirements.  During phase 2, Honeybee will perform a comprehensive study to determine the mass/cost/schedule requirements to make RoPeC flight ready.","Rotary-percussive drilling has many terrestrial applications in industry, as well as in research and development.  Scientists often use coring tools to acquire core samples for the study of everything between geological classification to ocean drilling and surveying. Traditionally, petroleum engineers will use large cores to extract information about boundaries between sandstone, limestone, and shale. This process is time consuming so smaller cores are sometimes taken. This method of sampling is called sidewall coring and provides more information to the petroleum engineering than simply logging data. Both rotary and percussive methods are currently utilized, but increased efficiency is likely possible through a combination such as utilized in the RoPeC design. Scientists studying earthquake mechanics could also benefit from the use of the RoPeC in a similar fashion. Automation of this process would save time and money; enabling the science goals of the research with reduced schedule and budget risk/impact. The RoPeC also has applications for the study of terrestrial biology, such as coring into rocks in the Arctic, Antarctic, or other desirable locations.

A key element of our technology is the stack oriented rather than a framework driven approach which allows it to interoperate with common existing scientific visualization software thereby eliminating the need for the user to switch and learn new software. The result is a versatile 3D visualization capability that will significantly decrease the time to knowledge discovery from large, complex data sets.Typical visualization activity can be organized into a simple stack of steps that leads to the visualization result.  These steps can broadly be classified into data retrieval, data analysis, visual representation, and rendering.  Our approach will be to continue with the technique selected in Phase I of utilizing existing visualization tools at each point in the visualization stack and to develop specific tools that address the core limitations identified and seamlessly integrate them into the visualization stack.  Specifically, we intend to complete technical objectives in four areas that will complete the development of visualization tools for interactive visualization of very large data sets in each layer of the visualization stack.

The NASA Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP) has been developing several core autonomy capabilities, one of which is called a procedure representation language (PRL). PRL can be automatically translated into code that can be executed by NASA-developed autonomous executives.  Another type of automation being developed by ETDP is automated planning aids. These will be needed to increase the number of missions that existing levels of flight personnel must be able to handle. But PRL has few constructs to enable automated planners and schedulers to take advantage of the procedures resulting from PRL.  In Phase 1 we developed extensions to PRL to add planning information  resource, constraints and sub-procedural information  so as to produce code useable by automated planning software. In this project, we propose to develop an interactive planning aid for flight controllers to show that such an aid can process our enhanced PRL files to generate mission plans and to test their feasibility via an execution system.  Besides refining our previous modeling efforts, this work will show that the availability of computer-useable planning information can lead to practical applications of NASA's automated planning efforts.","Procedures are at the core of all NASA missions, especially human space missions.  Mission planning is also at the core of all space missions due to the high cost of space assets such as astronauts, equipment and communication links.  Our technologies will have applications across many NASA programs, from Mission Control to on-board NASA vehicles and outposts.  We expect applications of our technology to immediately impact NASA's Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP). Two areas of ETDP will be immediate beneficiaries of this technology.  First, the Centaur robot at NASA JSC is already using a preliminary version of PRL and a simple user interface to allow a remote supervisor to command the Centaur over a communication link.  Our work will provide connection to automated planning technologies.  Second, the Automation for Operations (A4O) project run out of NASA ARC is using PRL to enhance spacecraft operations.  Our PRL extensions and planning technology would also be immediately applicable to spacecraft operations. We will work closely with representatives of both of these projects (Dr. Robert Ambrose at NASA JSC and Dr. Jeremy Frank at NASA ARC respectively) during Phase 1 to ensure our relevance to these two projects.","The military is currently a large customer for unmanned vehicle operations. Unmanned vehicles, both air and ground, are becoming more common in battlefield  situations.  In addition, Congress has mandated that one-third of all military vehicles must be unmanned by 2015.  As these unmanned vehicles are increasingly deployed in tandem with dismounted forces coordinating software will be necessary to ensure successful operations.  Procedures and mission planning play a large role in these kinds of operations. We also see a need for procedures and planning in operations such as refineries, chemical plants, nuclear and other power plants and any installation that has established standard operating procedures that must be carefully followed under often stressful situations, but whose procedures are currently paper, just like NASA's.  Moving these industries to electronic procedures tied to system telemetry and integrated with planning will allow for more efficient and safer operations.  We expect to tailor PRL and our PRL-related software to these industries and team with existing operators to evaluate and embed our software.

The PowerPC 750 architecture is used in the radiation-hardened RAD750 flight-control computers that are utilized in many space missions. The resulting tool will be capable of formally checking: 1) the equivalence of two instruction sequences; and 2) properties of a given instruction sequence. The tool will automatically introduce symbolic state for state variables that are not initialized and for external inputs. We bring a tremendous expertise in formal verification of complex microprocessors, formal definition of instruction semantics, and efficient translation of formulas from formal verification to Boolean Satisfiability (SAT). We will also produce formally verified definitions of the PowerPC 750 instructions used in the project, expressed in synthesizable Verilog; these definitions could be utilized for formal verification and testing of PowerPC 750 compatible processors, for FPGA-based emulation of PowerPC 750 executables, as well as in other formal verification tools to be implemented in the future.","The benefits to NASA will include state-of-the-art SAT-based technology for formal verification of PowerPC 750 executables. The PowerPC 750 architecture is used in the radiation-hardened RAD750 flight-control computers that are utilized in many space missions, including Deep Impact, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Mars Rovers, and is planned to be used in the Crew Exploration Vehicle that will become operational in 2011. NASA will benefit from such a tool by being able to: 1) ensure that compiler optimizations have not introduced bugs in an executable; 2) formally verify properties of code sequences that are written directly in assembly language for performance reasons; and 3) formally verify properties of executables provided by other organizations that do not supply the source code. After Phase 2, our technology will become applicable to any microprocessor architecture to be adapted by NASA in the future, as the tool that we will develop will allow to automatically generate a symbolic simulator for any instruction set architecture, given a formal definition of its semantics. As another deliverable, NASA will get synthesizable Verilog definitions of the PowerPC 750 instructions used in the project; these definitions could be utilized for formal verification and testing of PowerPC 750 compatible processors, for FPGA-based emulation of PowerPC 750 executables, and for implementation of internal formal verification tools in the future.","The capability to automatically generate a symbolic simulator for an ISA, given a formal definition of its semantics, will dramatically increase the potential for commercialization of the proposed technology. All companies that either manufacture microprocessors or develop IP of microprocessors, as well as all their clients, will be potential users. As embedded microprocessors are increasingly used in safety critical applications, it will become the norm to formally verify the executables for such applications. The immediate non-NASA commercialization will target the members of Power.org, an organization whose purpose is to develop, enable, and promote PowerPC Architecture technology. Power.org has over 40 member companies. The PowerPC architecture is used in many safety-critical embedded systems. Non-NASA customers of this technology will similarly be able to use the tool to formally verify the equivalence of two instruction sequences, and to formally check properties for a given executable. Furthermore, non-NASA customers will be able to use the tool to detect security vulnerabilities in programs, thus ensuring their robustness to security attacks, as well as to detect malicious intent in executables. The last application will allow the technology to be used in sophisticated virus scanners, utilizing formal reasoning to ensure robustness to software obfuscations of malicious intent.","Architectures and Networks; Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Computer System Architectures; Expert Systems; General Public Outreach; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Highly-Reconfigurable; Human-Computer Interfaces; On-Board Computing and Data Management; Operations Concepts and Requirements; Pilot Support Systems; Radiation-Hard/Resistant Electronics; Simulation Modeling Environment; Software Development Environments; Spaceport Infrastructure and Safety; Testing Facilities; Testing Requirements and Architectures"

Effective software testing is especially important in mission-critical software, where erroneous behavior poses a risk to safety or mission success.  Automated test case generation can make testing more efficient and effective, saving resources and reducing risk.  Under Phase 1, Safeware Engineering Corporation successfully developed the algorithms necessary to streamline software testing by automatically generating test cases directly from SpecTRM-RL models.  SpecTRM-RL (Specification Tools and Requirements Methodology  Requirements Language) is a requirements language that was designed to be highly readable, allowing even non-specialists to understand them, but is also completely formal.  Test cases generated from the black-box models written in SpecTRM-RL will focus on the intended behavior of the system.  The test case generation tool will be designed to allow the user to choose between a smaller set of test cases, allowing for more rapid error identification, and a larger set providing more comprehensive coverage.  The phase II effort will implement these algorithms, adding test-case generation to SpecTRM, the tool suite which allows for editing, analysis and execution of SpecTRM-RL models.  The new test case generation tools will be tested on the Max Launch Abort System.","NASA is involved in the development of complex systems that are highly reliant on software, such as human-rated space vehicles.  NASA has recognized the need for innovative requirements analysis methods and automated tools; the basic SpecTRM toolset was developed under a NASA SBIR.  The addition of automated test case generation to the SpecTRM toolset will provide testers with valuable assistance, streamlining software testing.  The tool based on the algorithms developed in Phase I could potentially apply to any NASA project with a need for reliable, safe and cost-effective mission-critical software.  It should be particularly important in systems with significant software control and in large projects.  As stated in the abstract, during Phase II arrangements have been made to test the test case generation tools on the Max Launch Abort System, a potential component of the Orion spacecraft, and which is being used on the Flight Test Vehicle.","The need for innovative requirements analysis methods and automated tools has been recognized across industries as varied as aerospace, automotive, defense, and medical device, providing an ample market for such a tool.  In fact, the basic SpecTRM toolset, which was developed under a NASA SBIR, is now used in the aerospace industry, for example, the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA and JAMSS) use it extensively on their space projects, it is also being used in the United States defense industry.  JPL completed a successful Technology Infusion project to evaluate the use of SpecTRM for TeamX and is now planning how to use the tool on JPL TeamX projects. Lockheed Martin Space Systems has expressed interest in using SpecTRM and other SBIR-supported tools now in Beta Test on the Orion space vehicle.

A significant percentage of the structures used in these spacecraft will be made of composite materials, and the Ares V payload shroud will be one of the largest composite structures ever built.  This offers many challenges, not only for design and manufacturing, but also for inspection and maintenance.  Inspection of large composite structures using traditional NDE methods is time consuming, expensive, and often not possible when access is limited (e.g. covered by a thermal protection system), resulting in a conservative (higher weight) design.  Acellent proposes to develop a robust, state-of-the-art structural health monitoring (SHM) system to overcome these concerns.  The Phase II will optimize the design and quantify the benefits for SHM on the Ares V payload shroud, and then expand the results to include other Ares V components such as the Altair Lunar Lander Structure, Earth Departure Stage (EDS) payload adapter, forward skirt and intertank, and the Core-to-EDS interstage.

Specifically, the proposed program will be focused on attaining three milestones.  The first goal is to achieve commercial-grade readiness of a HyDE Developers Pack (HyDE DP) to TRL 6 or higher.  To facilitate Phase III NASA transition, the second program goal is deploying HyDE DP to Kennedy Space Center's (KSC) Integrated Ground System in support of the Constellation Program.  Finally, to facilitate Phase III commercial transition and dramatically improved the embedded capability of HyDE, preparation for Beta-site deployment and tech transition with PARC on a commercial printing platform will be performed.  Building off the significant Phase I SBIR accomplishments, the Impact team believes that the proposed Phase II program is the ideal mix of innovative development work in the form of modeling, simulation, validation and verification tools for HyDE DP and tech transition activities designed to position HyDE as the diagnostic and reasoning engine for a broad application space that spans NASA, commercial and military domains.","As developers of HyDE, NASA has already utilized HyDE (and its predecessor; Livingstone) for some limited ISHM applications.  However, the proposed program will make major strides towards a comprehensive and commercial-grade readiness level for a HyDE Developers Pack (HyDE DP) that will be focused on supporting the new Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Integrated Ground System (IGS) for the Constellation family of launch vehicles.  Furthermore, HyDE DP is anticipated to be valuable to NASA Ames as it continues to utilize and market the Advanced Diagnostics And Prognostics Testbed (ADAPT).  It is anticipated that these case studies will generate the necessary exposure of HyDE DP to NASA ISHM developers so further proliferation of the software product can be established.","The need for improved ISHM design tools and reasoning capability within the DoD is very significant given aggressive diagnostic and prognostic requirements for major new acquisition programs like Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) and Future Combat Systems (FCS).

The results of our Phase I definitely indicate that we will be able to reach this goal.  These materials are being made from new nano-composites, using fabrication techniques developed at Eltron. The thermoelectric composite's matrix had already demonstrated exceptional ability for functioning in the environment of space.  Used in a cooling system, these materials will provide an effective means for controlling the temperature of surfaces subject to the rapidly changing temperatures encountered in space.  We have proven that this matrix works exceptionally well at providing support and allowing for convenient (and therefore economical) deposition of our materials.  We have also demonstrated that the thermal conductivity in these new nano-materials has been reduced by well over an order of magnitude!  In addition we have shown that we get an increase in the Seebeck Coefficient for materials we tested as well.  These new thermoelectric materials can be used to prevent development of large temperature gradients and thereby prevent the mechanical stresses that accompany them.  Used for power-generation, these new materials will be very efficient because of the properties that both the nano-phase materials and its matrix bring to the thermoelectric material.  Because of the difficulties presented in the harsh environment of space, thermal management and power generation is most easily provided through devices that do not have any moving parts, are very durable, do not require maintenance, and operate efficiently over a wide range of temperatures.  The proposed materials meet all these requirements.","In the past, NASA's interest in thermoelectric systems has stemmed both from the need for an effective means of temperature control via the Peltier effect for surfaces exposed to the rapidly changing temperatures that occur in space, and for use in generating electrical power via the Seebeck effect for space vehicles too distant from the sun for effective use of solar panels.  The new materials being developed here will be capable of withstanding both high and low temperatures and so they can be used to prevent development of large temperature gradients and the mechanical stresses that accompany them on missions such as the upcoming Mars and Venus trips.  This is particularly true of the Venus landing, where materials will need to withstand up to 500 C temperatures.  The improvement in efficiency possible from these materials as demonstrated during the Phase I could make them competitive with solar cells as a power source for space missions.","Development of this technology will result in considerable improvement in efficiency over currently used evaporative systems used in consumer and industrial refrigeration.  This technology will also be of great value to the electronics industry.  Systems incorporating this new technology will run more quietly and will produce much less pollution than current refrigeration and air conditioning systems.  They will not be subject to the maintenance problems common in the compressors used today.  An efficient, solid state electrical power generator that uses heat as its energy source would also result from successful development of this technology.

The innovation in the program is the development of a variable conductance heat pipe (VCHP) that passively accommodates the changing thermal load and environment.  This allows the heat pipe evaporators (and any attached heat exchanger) to remain at an almost constant temperature. In addition to passively controlling the thermal load, the non condensable gas allows the fluid in the heat pipe to freeze in a controlled manner as the heat pipe is shut down, avoiding damage.  The gas in the VCHP also helps with start-up from a frozen condition.  The overall technical objective of the Phase I and Phase II programs is to develop a VCHP radiator that can passively adjust to changing temperatures/powers in the Lunar and Martian surface environments while maintaining the coolant outlet temperature in an acceptable range.  During the Phase II program, a radiator panel and heat exchanger will be fabricated, then tested in a thermal vacuum chamber. Tests will include thermal cycling, as well as the ability of the radiator to startup from a frozen state.","The immediate NASA application is for Lunar and Martian radiators that can passively accommodate the large swings in environmental conditions between Lunar (or Martian) day and night, including long periods at very low temperatures.  In addition, the VCHP can passively accommodate large changes in thermal load, and avoid damage during periods of low thermal load.  Furthermore, the non-condensable gas in the VCHP will help with start-up during sudden increases in thermal load.","A commercial application is VCHP heat exchangers in fuel cell reformers.  In a fuel cell reformer, diesel fuel and air pass through a series of high temperature reactors to generate hydrogen.   The operating temperature of the reactors must be closely controlled to maintain their chemical equilibrium.  A typical system must maintain inlet and outlet temperatures within ±30oC despite a turndown ratio of 5:1 in reactant flow rate.  The current scheme uses a bypass valve, which has several drawbacks: it requires active control and electrical power, and has a large pressure drop.  A VCHP heat exchanger can replace the current heat exchanger and control system with a passive system that automatically maintains the output stream from the heat exchanger at a constant temperature.",Cooling

As advanced high power, high performance electronics in space based and terrestrial applications produce ever increasing heat fluxes, heat pipes with improved thermal capacity are sought. Illuminex Corporation has demonstrated that using copper nanowire arrays as the wick in heat pipes increases the heat transfer capabilities. Phase I developed processing techniques to engineer copper nanowire arrays on copper sheet that were subsequently incorporated into vapor chamber style heat pipes as the wicking material at the evaporator region. In Phase II, the program will be advanced to manufacture large area copper sheets fully covered with nanowires on one side. This material will be used to construct the entire heat pipe, package and wick. This will enable the development of high performance, lightweight, low-profile (< 1 mm) heat pipes with enhanced thermal transfer properties. The decrease in weight and size is desirable for NASA space projects and will find commercial application in radar systems, servers, and portable electronic devices. The use of less material in heat pipe manufacture will result in lower production costs while the superior performance and smaller size will provide electronic system designers with greater flexibility in thermal management system design.","Heat pipes require no maintenance and consume no power, making them attractive components for cooling electronics in space vehicles, satellites, and astronaut support systems. Illuminex innovation results in size and weight reductions that are desirable for space applications. Currently, NASA is developing nuclear electric propulsion systems for long-duration space missions like the Jupiter Icy Moon Orbital mission. Heat pipes are proposed for the transfer of waste heat from the power generation systems and for use in the radiator systems used for the dissipation of the waste heat. Heat pipe thermal control technology has also been proposed for electric power generation for a lunar habitat, for the Space Solar Power Project, and spacecraft thermal control. Improved capillary pumping capabilities in zero gravity and under acceleration in nanowire heat pipes could prove valuable in space applications where gravity assisted systems are not functional.","The thermal characteristics of high-power-density CPUs in today's high-end computing applications are rapidly outpacing the cooling capabilities of commercially available strategies. The primary devices driving the market for nanowire heat pipes are high performance microprocessors.  Technological advances in thermal control are needed to accommodate rising power densities in new electronic and optical devices and a steady replacement of traditional heat sinks by hybrid heat sinks with embedded heat pipes.

The wearable beat-to-beat blood pressure monitor proposed by Linea Research Corporation can be used to continuously monitor the physiological effect of prolonged space missions (including exposure to reduced gravitational environments) and the effectiveness of its countermeasures. During Phase I of the program, we demonstrated the feasibility of a novel, non-invasive beat-to-beat blood pressure monitor using a lightweight (<40 g) and low-power (<100mA @ 5V) initial prototype. Measurement of beat-to-beat blood pressure was successfully verified during human studies (tilt table tests) using a cuff-based blood pressure monitor as reference. Measurement of the beat-to-beat blood pressure was also verified against an arterial line in animal (porcine) studies using epinephrine to induce blood pressure changes. During Phase II of the program, we will develop and fabricate a field-capable, light-weight, wearable beat-to-beat blood pressure monitor that will be ready for demonstration on space missions. In addition to supplying the blood pressure monitors for use by NASA, Linea plans to introduce the technology for use in ambulatory blood pressure monitors. Linea will subsequently introduce the technology for integration into high acuity as well as home based blood pressure monitors. One patent has been filed and three are currently being prepared to protect the intellectual property. A business plan has been prepared to address the commercialization opportunities.",Autonomous medical care for the crew during human exploration missions is critical in preventing degradation in health due to adverse physiological responses to space flight environments. A wearable physiological monitor that provides continuous blood pressure (and heart rate) measurements will be extremely valuable in providing proper medical support for both normal activities and medical emergencies. The device can be used to monitor the long-term physiological effects of hypogravity and the effects of the countermeasures against hypogravitational environments. The device can also be modified to monitor the health status of crew during extravehicular activities. The device will provide wireless connectivity to a monitor (e.g. laptop already onboard) to allow transfer of both real-time and historical physiological data. The system will be developed as a single-unit wearable device which necessitates low power consumption and compact and lightweight form factor. The size criterion is a key factor for space applications as launch costs are directly determined by the weight of the device.,"The proposed device has the potential to fundamentally change the half-billion dollar blood pressure monitoring device market. The technologies developed under the NASA program are most immediately applicable to ambulatory blood pressure monitors, but can also be applied to high acuity (e.g. arterial line replacement) as well as home blood pressure monitoring devices. For the ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring segment, the technology developed under this program will enable beat-to-beat blood pressure measurement which will allow continuous measurement of blood pressure. Another significant advantage of the proposed beat-to-beat technology is that it does not require the inflation of the cuff except for calibration measurements. The inflation of the cuff can be uncomfortable for many users and can result in complications such as petechiae on the arm. The key advantage of the proposed technology over arterial lines used for high-acuity applications is the non-invasive nature of the measurement. Blood pressure monitoring based on arterial lines involves invasive procedures requiring percutaneous insertion of catheters into the radial or brachial arteries. Cannulation of the artery requires a skilled health professional and can often take significant time. In addition, cannulation can result in a number of complications including bleeding, infection, and rarely but significantly, lack of blood flow to the tissue supplied by the artery.",Biomedical and Life Support

Although, no effective treatments or prophylactics have yet been defined, it is important to monitor bone loss during missions. As such, the sensor must be compact and facile to operate in spacecraft. Operational Technologies Corp. (OpTech) proposes to complete development of its successful Phase I competitive fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-aptamer assays for several bone loss markers and calcidiol. In Phase I, OpTech developed several rapid (15 minutes) specific competitive polyclonal FRET-aptamer assays with low nanogram/ml sensitivity.  OpTech also cloned and sequenced 110 bone marker and calcidiol aptamers which will be individually screened in Phase II for optimal FRET assay performance. During Phase II, OpTech will shift its FRET to emit in the red (> 600 nm) to avoid the intrinsic fluorescence of urine and serum.  OpTech will also lyophilize and package optimized FRET-aptamer assays for use with a bubble-free plastic cuvette and body fluid collection system.  The assay system will be coupled to a modified version of the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Picofluor[TM] handheld battery-operated fluorometer customized to detect bone markers and calcidiol in body fluids.  OpTech will deliver the packaged assays, handheld reader and software to NASA for testing.","NASA would use this technology as a portable means for astronauts to sensitively self-monitor their bone loss or bone preservation treatments with one-touch ease from urine or serum samples. Monitoring of other clinical analytes such as glucose and environmental microbe monitoring in water supplies by astronauts would also be possible, if appropriate FRET-assays were developed.","Women and the elderly could use this system as a rapid and facile point-of-care (POC) diagnostic system to monitor osteoporosis and the efficacy of therapeutic regimens. The system might also be used to monitor bone repair following severe fractures or skeletal procedures related to plastic or reconstructive surgeries. In a broader sense, OpTech is developing FRET-aptamer assays for a wide array of analytes on Earth including foodborne pathogens and other bacterial, viral and clinical analytes.",Biomedical and Life Support; Biophysical Utilization

Due to restricted volume and mass capabilities within the newly-developing Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM), there is a need for a multi-functional, compact exercise machine that can incorporate both resistive and aerobic exercise capabilities during lunar sortie missions. The proposed innovation is an exercise device, the multi-functional Constant Force Resistive Exercise Unit (CFREU), that can provide a whole-body workout for aerobic exercise and resistive exercise. The device provides constant force eccentrically and concentrically during multiple exercise configurations, allows resistance selection in 2.5kg increments, requires no power to operate, requires no on-orbit maintenance, and can be stowed in an area of 1 cubic foot. During the Phase II performance period, we propose to develop a fully-functional CFREU, as well as to perform a usability study.","Valeo's competitive advantage lies within the CFREU design. The unit is compact, easy to use, requires no power to operate, and requires no on-orbit maintenance or calibration. There is an evident need for a gravity-independent exercise unit that can provide a constant force for resistive exercise with integrated aerobic capability fashioned in a compact and lightweight design that offers familiarity, safety, and comfort during exercise.","Rehabilitation institutions would benefit from the multi-functional CFREU design. A portable exercise machine that can provide aerobic and constant force resistive capabilities in such a small volume is essential in clinical settings, and would prove especially beneficial in treating patients confined to bed rest. Physiologically, the constant force resistance provided by the CFREU is comparable to a traditional weight stack machine, but without the bulkiness and mass of weight plates. The personal home exercise equipment industry would also benefit from the multi-functional CFREU device. The compact force packs of the CFREU allow the overall unit to be small enough for easy use as a home gym. For the home gym design, future force packs can be designed such that they may be purchased individually by a consumer, and used as portable exercise devices when not in use with the full CFREU. Thus, the force packs replace the need for expensive, heavy, and bulky traditional weight plates, and allow portability.",Biomedical and Life Support

CogGauge, while engaging astronauts in an entertaining experience, combines predictive tools for assessing cognitive workload with metrics that assess performance decrements.  CogGauge uses a hybrid approach combining predictive workload values with behavioral/performance-based workload assessment across a number of task difficulty levels.  This comprehensive approach takes into consideration learning effects across a number of cognitive tasks (i.e., mini-games in the gaming context) and derives assessment of performance decrements related to cognitive deficits to identify probable causes of cognitive decrement.  Feedback from CogGauge may be provided to astronauts and/or flight surgeons to determine impact on space flight and missions.","CogGauge, once developed, forms a foundation for several potential tools for use within NASA.  For example, the underlying framework that utilizes a combination of predictive workload and performance/behavioral measures can be used to build several tools that could be integrated within shuttle (or its future replacements) controls to assess astronaut cognitive workload during a mission.  Another possible expansion is to assess ground operations centers workload while monitoring a mission progress.  In essence, the concepts/approach implemented in CogGauge could potentially expand to several applications within NASA that involve intense human-system integration.","In terms of other government and commercial markets, CogGauge could be potentially tailored for use by aircraft pilots to assess their cognitive workload before/after long flying hours.  In many situations, the approach/algorithms implemented in CogGauge could be used to model an operator interacting with a complex system, such as Command and Control, Power Plant Control Units, Nursing Stations, and so on. In today's net-centric work environment, operators are required to consume multiple streams of data simultaneously from several monitor stations, which can lead to issues of cognitive overload, decreased performance, and loss of situation awareness. CogGauge could be adapted to monitor operator workload in real-time and drive potential adaptations to displays/task demands to minimize times of overload.  Such an extension of CogGauge may be useful in domains such as airport security checkpoints, customs, police stations, etc.",Biomedical and Life Support; Human-Computer Interfaces; Portable Data Acquisition or Analysis Tools

In essence, they are 'laboratory' measures that appear unrelated to the real-world environment. This leads to user non-compliance or rejection. The present proposal describes a technique for integrating traditional cognitive performance measures with assessment of the system and mission in which the individual must operate. This yields quantified measures of the person's cognitive ability to perform specific jobs in space. Specifically, an entertaining and scientifically rigorous assessment tool is integrated with a sleep/fatigue model and a quantified workload estimate for each task. This is accomplished by selecting tests based on task analyses of what the astronaut actually has to do, using the Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool (FAST) to predict performance capacity as a function of sleep/rest, and integrating a mathematical vector to quantify the workload of specific tasks. The resulting ""Person-System-Mission (PSM) index"" provides a totally new and unique way not only to assess present cognitive capability, but to diagnose specific causes of decrement, and to suggest remedial actions.","Measurement and prediction of the cognitive effects of stressors such as fatigue and workload on specific tasks required of the astronaut are critical to NASA. The existence of a valid metric that is expressed in terms of the individual's ability to carry out specific tasks, rather than in terms of esoteric cognitive skills, will dramatically increase the value of an assessment tool to the individual, the commander, and the flight surgeon, thereby increasing user acceptance. This will lead to incorporation of such a metric on all spaceflights, especially those of long duration.","The principal non-NASA Government applications for the technology developed here will be in the Department of Defense and the Homeland Security Department. Mission- and safety-critical jobs frequently involve stressful conditions such as fatigue and high workload in both of these agencies. In DoD, for instance, the need to assess the combat readiness of the dismounted warrior has led to the establishment of the ""Cog-Fit"" program, which is attempting to model the effects of combat stresses on the person's ability to perform their job. The Air Force has similar programs. Homeland security, in addition to Coast Guard operations, requires personnel such as airport screeners to maintain high levels of cognitive alertness for long periods of time. It is expected that each of these agencies will have immediate applications for this technology. Non-NASA commercial applications will involve marketing the technology to transportation, shipping, and freight organizations that routinely carry out safety-sensitive operations, as well as to educational, industrial, and self-help organizations that will recognize the value of a scientifically well-grounded, entertaining cognitive assessment system.",Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Testing Requirements and Architectures

This project focuses on the problem of efficient removal of nanoscale (10-100nm) and larger lunar dust particulates from air using a nanostructured fiber media containing carbon nanotubes. Lunar dust presents an important challenge to Lunar exploration and habitation, nonetheless it has some unique properties that can be taken advantage of in designing specialized filtration media capable of achieving efficient removal from air. As demonstrated in Phase I, rough surface shape combined with the electrically and magnetically charged nature of the dust means that rough, electrically activated filtration media will be effective tools for filtration. Seldon's work with its proprietary fused carbon nanotube media offers a unique path to significant new purification applications that meet important needs for NASA's Lunar Exploratory Initiatives. The unique physical properties of the carbon nanotubes will be capitalized upon to create a filtration media with high efficiency and low pressure drop that can be electrically powered to enhance filtration of charged lunar dust particles.","There are important applications for this product throughout NASA's operations from protecting human life on lunar explorations, to cleaning the air of clean rooms, to reducing emissions from its vehicle fleet. The potential health and environmental impacts of airborne ultrafine particles are now known to be significant. Typical filtration solutions struggle to remove these very small contaminants. As a result, energy is wasted and, because of cost, some filtration applications are just not pursued. Products based on this technology will protect astronauts and sensitive equipment from lunar dust in the air handling systems of spacecraft and even in personal breathing apparatus. They will efficiently remove very small particulates from the air in NASA's clean rooms. Finally, filters will help to clean the emissions from the many earthbound diesel and other engines NASA operates to help reduce NASA's carbon footprint and improve the health of its employees and communities.","According to the Centers for Disease Control the inhalation of fine particles is now estimated to be the ninth leading cause of death in the US. In the past, the best, most expensive filters have typically been used in clean rooms where the quality of products are dependent on the lack of contaminants in the environment. The market size for clean room air filters is estimated to be approximately $0.5 billion worldwide. As the production of sensitive equipment increases and employers acknowledge the health risks of their employees' exposure to some ultrafine particles, the market for such filters will continue to rise dramatically.The estimated global market size for air purification equipment is estimated to be about $2.5 billion.  The tremendous surface area of Seldon's media and its ability to effectively capture and/or destroy pathogens with a relatively open structure gives the product an extended life making it a more effective barrier than available technology.  Further, the material's high electrical conductivity offers an additional means for enhancing the purification efficiency by adding electrostatic attraction capabilities. Other product opportunities include incorporating the media into facemasks, gas masks, vehicle cabin air filters, and filters in building HVAC systems.",Air Revitalization and Conditioning; Composites; Sterilization/Pathogen and Microbial Control

We used this information to develop a predictive performance model for the oxygen concentrator to aid in a conceptual design and to allow NASA mission planners to conduct trade studies on metrics including the generated oxygen rate per compressor mass and power requirements. For the Phase II program, we will produce operational prototype electrochemical concentrators that produce 3000 psia oxygen from ambient pressure sources of air or oxygen. These concentrators will be sized to produce 2 kg of oxygen at 3000 psia within a 24 hour time period. By the end of the Phase II effort, this concentrator will be at a Technology Readiness Level of 4-5.","Applications of this technology to NASA include generating oxygen for sub-critical storage on lunar habitats and within spacecraft environments.

Carbon monoxide formation is a reliable indicator of evolving fire threats and this gaseous combustion product allows rapid early detection.  A highly sensitive carbon monoxide sensor is proposed for early, fast and unfailing fire detection.

This is most readily achieved by reduction in space suit weight and volume, and increased hardware reliability, durability, and operating lifetime.  Considerable progress has been made with each successive generation of space suit design; from the Apollo A7L suit, to the current Shuttle Extravehicular Mobile Unit (EMU) suit, and the next generation Constellation Space Suit Element (CSSE).  However, one area of space suit design which has continued to lag is the fluid pump used to drive the water cooling loop of the Primary Life Support System (PLSS).  Conventional electric motor-driven fluid pumps are heavy, bulky, inefficient, and prone to wear and water contaminants.  A new pump type is needed.  In Phase I, the feasibility of reducing the power consumption of Lynntech's electrochemically-driven fluid pump by employing high conductivity hydrocarbon-based electrochemical membranes was demonstrated.  In Phase II, Lynntech will develop a fluid pump significantly more robust, and more efficient than the pumps currently used in space suit PLSSs.","A rugged, long life, low power, compact fluid pump will have applications in the thermal subsystem of the Primary Life Support System (PLSS) of the next generation space suit.  Lynntech's fluid pump will be more efficient, lighter, and more robust the centrifugal pump currently used in the Shuttle Extravehicular Mobile unit (EMU).  Additionally, Lynntech's pump does not suffer from cavitation issues and is not susceptible to water impurities, like the Shuttle EMU pump.","With the increasing power density of electronics, there is a growing market for miniature, low-power pumps for use in the thermal management of consumer electronics.

Utilizing a novel material choice for both an expansion diaphragm and the PCM case itself, the PCM can accommodate both the expansion of the freezing water-based material and very low temperature of approximately -250F.  The water-based PCM itself would be non-toxic and non-flammable, but additives will be included to preclude deterioration of wither the PCM container or the diaphragm material.  The use of a water-based PCM gives the highest heat capacity for the mass.  This is highly limited due to the needs for portability as required for an Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA). The total heat capacity of an operational unit would be for 4 hour duration EVA use.  Through a logical progression of tasks including concept of operation formulation, requirements formulation, concept design reviews and detail design reviews that include design and thermal analysis using Thermal DesktopTM models, this effort can progress from the TRL 3 achieved in Phase I to TRL 4-5.  The team will continue development by designing a Variable Conductance Interface (VCI) for protecting water in the Liquid Cooling Garment (LCG) from freezing due to the temperature of the heat sink used by the PCM. The team will also develop system improvements identified during Phase I testing.  The PCM will be tested to confirm heat input/temperature performance and cycling capability. The test bed will allow for accurate heat input knowledge, temperature monitoring and cycling capability. The results will be compared to the thermal model to ensure accurate prediction capability for the next phase unit and system implementation.

Hence, the primary application will be for the purpose of providing this heat rejection capability in a compact, reliable form for use within a PLSS, and therefore NASA's Constellation Space Suit Program is a prime customer. However, the application of this technology may go well beyond this to PCM use within:1. The emerging Orion vehicle design. 2. The future Altair Lunar Surface Access Module design3. PCM utilization within any lunar surface habitat4. PCM utilization within any lunar rovers (Small Pressurized Rover)Each of these potential NASA applications could be augmented, and perhaps greatly enhanced, through the use of the high heat capacity and heat of fusion of water. In the case of the lunar vehicles or habitats, the access to a thermal environment that is very cold (Shackleton crater region on the moon) will allow for quick regeneration.","There are multiple industries within the commercial sector that could use a portable and robust cooling system.

The temperature swing is achieved through cooling to well below metabolic temperatures.  The coolant can be water, liquid CO2 (LCO2), or any cryogenic fluid.  Water or LCO2 is used as coolant by expanding the liquid to below sublimation temperatures when exposed to low pressure or vacuum environments.  Subsequent super heated vapor, as well as additional coolant, is used to further cool the astronaut.

Coolant flexibility enabled by the application of MTSA technology makes possible one PLSS design for use on the moon and on Mars.  Given the multiple processes involved, there are several potential spin-offs of MTSA technology development for other NASA applications.  For example, sublimation heat exchanger technology can be applied in surface habitats and small pressurized rovers (SPRs) where forced sublimated convection minimizes dust contamination.  The entire MTSA concept can be possibly applied at the vehicle level.  For example, habitat air revitalization could be performed by means of water recycling (rather than rejection and loss) as well as CO2 collection for oxygen regeneration or coolant production.","Non-NASA applications include a wide variety of portable life support systems for the Department of Defense and Home Land defense in chemical warfare agent shelters.

The receiver could also be used for materials processing, processing lunar resources into materials such as concrete, fiberglass, and aluminum.","One commercial application is VCHP heat exchangers in fuel cell reformers.  In a fuel cell reformer, diesel fuel and air pass through a series of high temperature reactors to generate hydrogen.   The operating temperature of the reactors must be closely controlled to maintain their chemical equilibrium.  The current scheme uses a bypass valve, which has several drawbacks: it requires active control, requires power, and has a large pressure drop.  ACT believes that VCHP heat exchangers can replace the current heat exchanger and control system with a passive system that automatically maintains the output stream from the heat exchanger at a constant temperature.  The second application is adding pressure control to ACT's current line of commercial isothermal furnace liners, which are annular alkali metal heat pipes that provide nearly isothermal temperature uniformity.  Adding pressure control will allow the temperature to be controlled within millikelvins, adding in isothermal processing of materials, thermophysical properties characterization, and calibration of temperature references.",In-situ Resource Utilization

LSCS sorbents are based on lunar soil iron compounds that trap sulfur contained in hot in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) product gases. Small amounts of polishing sorbents are used as needed to reduce equilibrium sulfur concentrations to the ppm or sub-ppm level. The LSCS is an effective technology for protecting in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) hardware from damage caused by the corrosive effects of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and other sulfur-containing gases. Saturated sorbents can be regenerated for reuse, and desorbed sulfur can be converted to elemental sulfur. Key process steps include bulk H2S capture on lunar soil, further capture of H2S on polishing sorbent, regeneration of soil sorbent for re-use, recovery of high-purity H2S, and conversion of H2S to elemental sulfur. The LSCS reduces the risk of using Earth-based sorbents for primary sulfur capture by ensuring a ready supply of sorbent in the event of poor regeneration performance or process upset. The LSCS primary sulfur sorbent can be used as a non-regenerable sorbent if necessary without significant consequence to the ISRU process.",The primary initial application of the LSCS is for lunar sulfur capture and recovery. The LSCS has direct use to both protect ISRU hardware and catalysts and to produce useful amounts of sulfur for other lunar ISRU applications. The LSCS is directed at reducing the mass penalty and risk associated with the use of Earth-based sorbents for hydrogen reduction and other lunar oxygen production processes.,"The LSCS has direct commercialization potential for thermal-catalytic synthesis processes that require sulfur removal from reducing gases derived from coal, biomass, or other impure hydrocarbon feeds in support of fuels and chemicals manufacture. The closed-loop aspect of the LSCS sulfur recovery system is particularly attractive as a potential zero-emission sulfur recovery system for terrestrial applications.",In-situ Resource Utilization

The individual cells of the MCTB contain a thermal storage media that is specifically designed for optimal performance at a given temperature range. Each of these cells is charged with thermal energy from hot regolith that has been used in a lunar ISRU application. Once the MCTB is charged, the heat is transferred from the battery to newly harvested regolith. In this manner over 85% of the heat can be transferred from the expended to the new regolith. This is a large improvement especially considering that this reduces the heating requirement to produce 1000 kg of O2 from lunar regolith from an average of 1 kW to only 0.15 kW (assuming 3% O2 recovery by weight). The other irreducible power consumption of lunar ISRU O2 production is electrolysis which consumes at least 0.3 kW. Hence, using the MCTB decreases the irreducible power consumption of lunar ISRU by 65 %.","The primary purpose of the MCTB is to meet the needs of NASA's lunar base program by minimizing the power required to produce oxygen on the Moon. The MCTB can be a key component of the lunar exploration program by allowing available power sources to enable production of oxygen on a sufficient scale to significantly reduce Lunar base logistic requirements. Depending upon the rocket propulsion system employed, oxygen can compose between 70% and 85% of total propellant mass. Ascent propellant, in turn, can compose 50% or more of the mass delivered to the lunar surface on a piloted Lunar mission. Therefore, the ability to produce oxygen in quantity on the lunar surface can have a major role in reducing total program costs.","In addition to its NASA applications, the multi-cell thermal battery can also be a valuable tool wherever heat needs to be stored either for a long time or for a short period of time. Any chemical process that is requires high temperatures and a batch mode would greatly benefit from using the MCTB to conserve energy. In such a process the expended product can be used to fill the thermal battery with heat and this heat can then be used to pre-heat the following batch. As shown before, this can lead an energy savings of over 85%. Thus, large scale applications of MCTB's could make a significant contribution towards reducing industrial power consumption, thereby helping the nation achieve the important goal of energy conservation. An important benefit of the thermal battery is that it can store heat at high temperatures and release this heat on demand. This may be especially useful in climates where heat is solar heat is abundant and other forms of clean energy are scarce. According to the World Health Organization indoor smoke from cooking and heating causes 1.5 million deaths from respiratory illness each year. Many of these deaths are in regions with abundant sunlight such as Africa and India. The use of a thermal battery can displace some of the heating requirement that is currently met by burning dung, wood and other biomass.",Energy Storage; In-situ Resource Utilization; Renewable Energy; Thermodynamic Conversion

Existing discrete element method (DEM) or finite element (FE) models lack adequate fidelity for fine cohesive powders comprised of friable particles with irregular shapes and exhibiting substantial bulk dilation upon initial excavation.  As such, they are inadequate for assessing the reliability of regolith excavation and handling systems, and even less so for evaluation of engineering trade-offs between total system mass, power and energy consumption.  Also, current simulation tools do not include the effects of triboelectric and photo-ionization-induced charges on regolith particles.Building on the successful Phase-1development of a new charge-patch electrostatic model and a comprehensive cohesive particle interaction model for DEM, Grainflow Dynamics proposes to develop a high-fidelity predictive calculational tool, in the form of a DEM module with calibrated interparticle-interaction relationships, coupled with a FE module utilizing enhanced, calibrated, constitutive models which, together, are capable of mimicking both large deformations and the flow behavior of regolith simulants and lunar regolith under conditions anticipated in ISRU operations. This will not only provide unparalleled fidelity but also will leverage the computational efficiency of the continuum FE codes to drastically reduce the simulation time and resources necessary to perform engineering analyses on regolith systems. In addition, the modules will be parallelized to maximize their usefulness in multi-core and cluster computing environments. This work will lead to an improved engineering design tool that can be used by NASA engineers and contractors developing designs for ISRU equipment to evaluate both the reliability of various configurations as well as the trade-offs of system designs.","The pharmaceutical industry has a large number of applications, which would benefit from significantly improved simulation capabilities for cohesive powders in a variety of pharmaceutical material manufacturing, transport and handling operations, including micronization, granulation, coating, blending, tableting, dosating and capsule or blister-pack filling  especially powders designed for pulmonary delivery.

The fine surface dust is highly abrasive and can both be a health hazard for the crew and the main contributor to equipment failure.  Regolith is also the only material readily available to build protective shelters for the crew to prevent exposure to lethal doses of high-energy particles during solar eruption events.  To achieve the needed cover, methods have to be developed to convert regolith into a stable building material with minimal need for terrestrial supplies.  The technology should also be applicable to stabilize regolith in place, for example on excavated slopes or around air locks and landing fields where dust is disturbed by gas flows.In the Phase I program, Adherent Technologies, Inc. has developed the needed chemical formulations and application technologies to achieve both objectives.  Regolith can be formed into solid building material using only 5% earth-supplied binder, and the same binder can be used to stabilize loose regolith in the vacuum of space.  The proposed Phase II program will optimize the formulations and techniques developed previously and will design and build prototype applicators, both for spraying thin layers and for automated brick fabrication.  Testing in a vacuum environment will demonstrate the capabilities and design concepts for deployable, weight optimized application systems will be included.","The technology developed to convert loose regolith dust into building blocks using only 5% earth-supplied resources is an enabling step for long-term lunar habitation projects.  Being able to use the abundant regolith to protect the crew from radiation is imperative to reduce the risk of long-term stays.  Additionally, dust mitigation is important to prevent premature equipment failure due to the abrasive nature of the regolith.","While the specific application developed in the Phase I program is a vacuum environment technique unique to space applications, the ability to coat large areas with a thin layer of strong urethane for dust mitigation has attracted great interest from environmental remediation companies.

The structures must also be very durable and have the ability to survive punctures without collapsing.  Ways of increasing available crew-load volume without greatly increasing launch weight or volume are also sought.Inflatable structures are ideal candidates for habitat structures for several reasons: (1) they feature the low stowage volume and payload weight required, (2) deployed volume can be easily increased without large increases in launch weight or volume, (3) they offer unique opportunities for incorporating intelligent and/or multifunctional systems such as self-healing capability, power generation and storage, sensor systems, and radiation protection.Adherent Technologies, Inc. is proposing an inflatable, rigidizable shelter system based on our Rigidization on CommandTM (ROC) technology.

The successful design of a high-torque prototype mechanism and the subsequent Phase I demonstration of the prototype under vacuum conditions lays the groundwork for the technology to reach product status and commercialization success in both NASA and non-NASA applications.

Honeybee Robotics is therefore developing a small-envelope, high-performance scanning LIDAR system, geared primarily towards robotic navigation and secondarily to site inspection and survey. The proposed Phase II will draw on the results of a DARPA-funded design study and Phase I of this effort, which resulted in successful proof-of-concept, as well as testbeds and proprietary software tools.The Honeybee 3D Miniature LIDAR (3DML) uses a novel scanning mechanism in conjunction with a pulse-time-of-flight optical rangefinding subsystem. The 3DML architecture, developed with expert input from Sensor Designs, an electro-optical systems consultancy, achieves wide field of view and high resolution while maintaining ultra-compact package size. The proposed Phase II will include development of a functional brassboard system prototype and its integration and test on a K10 research rover. Phase III will pursue a multi-pronged commercialization effort, including preflight development, production of a unit for terrestrial research, and incorporation of 3DML into a flight program.","The Honeybee 3DML is ideally suited to mobile robotic platform navigation, thanks to the wide field of view and high angular resolution. A key long-term goal is to produce flight units for NASA's Lunar Surface Systems, to facilitate robotic site operations support. In addition to rover navigation, a flight 3DML could be employed as a sensor for lunar vehicle and structure inspection. Adding long-range survey capability would result in an all-in-one navigation/inspection/survey sensor. Whether autonomous, teleoperated, or even manned, lunar mobile platforms will require 3D sensing to perform safely and effectively.Rover missions for Mars exploration could also make use of a compact, robust 3D LIDAR system. Future Mars rovers, including the AFL, the Mid-size Rovers, and the MSR rover, will be developed to increasingly sophisticated levels of automation, and will demand sophisticated sensor facilities.In the much nearer term, terrestrial 3DML units can be used for robotic research at NASA centers. The functional brassboard resulting from this Phase II effort will be delivered to Ames Research Center's Intelligent Robotics Group for continued use on their K10 test rovers. An 3DML trial on a K10 at a Moses Lake field test has also been discussed. Following a short development iteration, similar units for terrestrial research will be ready for sale to robotics labs in NASA and academia.","This technology enjoys broad commercialization potential due to the very basic need for 3D vision that it satisfies. An immediately targeted market is military robotics, where 3DML will be an enabling technology for greater autonomy and easier navigation and operations. Given the high performance and relatively low cost of the sensor, this technology is also more broadly applicable to general ground robotics. This includes hazmat response and search-and-rescue, but also mining, agricultural and industrial automation, such as sensors for unmanned forklifts on a factory floor. The primary competitor to the 3DML technology is solid state ""flash"" LIDAR systems. While attractive for certain applications, flash LIDAR lacks the high resolution and flexibility of 3DML. Compared to the current and projected state of the art of flash systems, 3DML promises to achieve higher performance at lower cost. The 3DML architecture can be scaled down to a much lower-cost version by reducing the demands on the optomechanical and electro-optical subsystems, permitting incorporation into many consumer and commercial devices. For automotoves, a low-resolution version of 3DML could be used for blind-spot or guardrail warning systems.

Honeybee has heritage in developing mechanisms for extreme, dusty environments. Near-term applications of such a connector include the utility and electrical connections that will be used on the next-generation Lunar EVA suit being developed for NASA JSC by Oceaneering Space Systems, as well as cryogenic utility connections that will be used to pass liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen during in-situ¬ resource utilization (ISRU) activities. The Phase 1 research has resulted in the development of a dust-tolerant, manual electrical connector for the battery recharge circuit of the Portable Life Support Backpack (PLSB) being developed for the Constellation configuration two (Lunar EVA) suit.  Phase 1 breadboard testing showed 53 successful mate/de-mate cycles in the presence of JSC-1AF simulant prior to failure. In addition, this failure appears to be the result of a late addition to the mechanical configuration that can be revised for even better performance. In Phase II, Honeybee will revise the design of the dust-tolerant connector, investigate design configurations for utility connections for ISRU activities, and test a connector brassboard in a chamber capable of closely reproducing conditions on the Lunar surface. This effort will lead to the development of a dust-tolerant electrical connector with a focused application to the Constellation configuration two (Lunar EVA) suits. This will result in a TRL 6 Lunar dust-tolerant electrical connector.","The dust-tolerant reusable connection mechanisms to be developed through this project will be an enabling technology for extended Lunar operations in that they will allow several cycles of utility connection and disconnection for EVA and surface operations.  Future mission scenarios involving erectable structures, diverse EVA-compliant tools, Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)-to-rover or EMU-to-robot interfaces, and other in-situ assembly or interconnection activities will all call for dust-tolerant reusable connectors. In particular, the Constellation configuration two (Lunar EVA) suit being developed by Oceaneering Space Systems (OSS) has many connectors on it that require dust-tolerant technology.  Initial discussions with personnel from OSS have already begun, and OSS has signed-on to the Phase 2 effort as a consultant.  The will provide data, requirements, and technical criticism of the connector developed during the Phase 2 effort. The technology developed here is also applicable to the exploration of Mars (where frequent global dust stomrms occur) and asteroids, but is driven by the especially abrasive characteristics of Lunar dust.","Military and homeland security operations are often conducted in uncontrolled environments. An increasing use of high-technology tools provides for improved performance, but also introduces new risks. The incorporation of dust-tolerant reusable connection mechanisms in military couplings will allow greater reliability and flexibility for modular electronics in operational scenarios, especially in dusty, dirty, sandy environments. Incorporation of dust-tolerant connectors would also reduce maintenance, repair, and overhaul costs by reducing select component failures due to degradation by dust and sand. Current connectors meet stringent mil-spec environmental requirements when connected, but the connection itself must be made under relatively clean conditions. We expect that adding a tolerance to making and breaking connections under off-nominal conditions will result in an increased service life for modular electronics for use in military and homeland security applications. There is also broad commercial potential for dust-tolerant reusable connectors in several commercial applications requiring the reliable performance of modular electronics in uncontrolled environments, including oil and gas exploration, first responders and emergency services, heavy and highway construction, and mining. By employing dust-tolerant connectors, rather than attempting to seal dust intolerant connectors against the environment, the connectors used in these applications may be truly ruggedized.",Airlocks/Environmental Interfaces; Earth-Supplied Resource Utilization; Fluid Storage and Handling; Human-Robotic Interfaces; In-situ Resource Utilization; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Liquid-Liquid Interfaces; Manned-Maneuvering Units; Modular Interconnects; Portable Life Support; Suits; Testing Facilities; Tools

ORBITEC is proposing to continue developing high-fidelity lunar dust simulants that better match the unique properties of lunar dust than existing regolith simulants (such as JSC-1AF).  Current lunar regolith simulants do not have enough of the very fine particles, most lack the agglutinitic glass and complex surface textures that dominate lunar dust, and none of them have nanophase iron (Fe0).  High-fidelity lunar dust simulants approximate the size, morphology, composition, and other important properties of lunar dust (including nanophase Fe0).  High-fidelity lunar dust simulants are required to physically evaluate the effects of lunar dust on the operation of all Exploration Surface Systems and to verify the effectiveness of dust mitigation strategies and technologies.  During Phase 1, several prototype lunar dust simulants were created, samples of the prototype lunar dust simulants were delivered to NASA for characterization (TRL 4).  The proposed Phase 2 effort will refine and demonstrate the production process for lunar dust simulants that will be characterized and delivered to NASA for a variety of applications (TRL 6).","High-fidelity lunar dust simulants are required to evaluate the effects of lunar dust and verify the effectiveness of dust mitigation strategies and technologies for all Exploration Surface Systems, including: extravehicular mobility suit material composition and cleaning operations, lunar habitat construction design, mechanical performance (radiators, seals, valves), electrical performance (tools and equipment), landing operations (vision systems), and all manners of surface operations.  Since there is strong evidence that the prototype lunar dust simulants contain the critical metallic iron component (including nanophase Fe0) along with the morphologies of lunar dust particles, it will also be applicable to human health and toxicity studies.","High-fidelity lunar dust simulants are being developed to support the needs of the NASA lunar exploration program.  However, industry and research institutions that are developing any EVA equipment for use on the lunar surface will also require high-fidelity lunar dust simulants to physically evaluate the effects of lunar dust on the operation of all Exploration Surface Systems and to verify the effectiveness of dust mitigation strategies and technologies.   Much of this work in the near future will be under NASA contracts.

The objective of this effort is first to correlate the microscopic morphology that occur within the Nafion-clay nanocomposite membranes with the reduction in hydrogen penetration produced by the clay addition.  A second objective is to control the microscopic morphology and establish a process to develop the most effective Nafion-clay nanocomposite membranes, leading to advanced MEAs.

Successful completion of ElectroChem's Phase II technology effort will enable NASA to meet its requirement for a RFC electrolyzer that will operate very efficiently both at low current densities and at high pressures (Lunar surface energy storage application).  Operating the RFC electrolyzer at high-pressure eliminates the need for external gas compression prior to reactant storage, which reduces total system weight and volume. The drawback of high-pressure operation, however, has been the increased diffusion of hydrogen across the electrolyzer membrane, which effectively decreases the efficiency.  ElectroChem's Nafion-clay nanocomposite membranes advance will overcome this drawback.ElectroChem's Advanced IFF PEM Electrolyzer will also produce a more stable and passive RFC for providing power for missions at remote locations, and for providing UPS backup power for NASA needs.","For terrestrial applications, ElectroChem's IFF PEM Electrolyzer is ideal for supplying hydrogen fuel for future auto refueling stations.  Also, IFF PEM RFCs, containing the advanced electrolyzer design, will be strong candidates for supplying power to remote sites with solar and/or off-peak utility power as sources of electrolyzer input power.Because of difficult maintenance problems, ElectroChem's reliable, long life IFF PEM RFC will be an excellent replacement for the lead acid batteries used in Navy Overseas Bases.

Development of high temperature, high efficiency heat exchangers is critical for next-generation nuclear power and space propulsion systems. In Phase I, Ultramet and Sandia National Laboratories demonstrated the feasibility of using high surface area foam core heat exchanger technology to substantially improve the power conversion efficiency of liquid metal-to-gas high temperature heat exchangers for fission surface power systems. Preliminary design and modeling suggested a substantial improvement in the efficiency of a liquid lithium-to-helium component relative to conventional plate-fin heat exchangers, and hardware fabrication and testing demonstrated the manufacturability, performance, and simplicity of the foam-based design. Open-cell foam is a natural coolant channel that does not require extensive, expensive machining of intricate coolant passages and eliminates the need for braze-bonding or welding of numerous individual sections. Initial testing showed the ability of textured, vapor-deposited lithium-compatible coatings to be uniformly wetted by liquid lithium at low temperature. The technology has the potential to best minimize the temperature difference between the maximum lithium reactor coolant and helium working fluid temperatures, as well as to reduce system mass and volume through the use of high surface area, low density open-cell foam, and increase safety and reliability by minimizing the number of piece parts and associated joints. In Phase II, Ultramet will team with Sandia to expand on the Phase I success by performing comprehensive design and stress analysis, determining physical properties, and establishing performance through high temperature (1000 K) thermal response and flow testing of coaxial heat exchangers using the Helium Flow Loop and Liquid Metal Integrated Test System at Sandia's Plasma Materials Test Facility.","Lunar bases and colonies would be strategic assets for effective utilization of abundant lunar resources and development and testing of space technologies required for further exploration and colonization of favorable places in the solar system.

Long duration surface missions necessitate reliable autonomous operation, and manned missions impose added requirements for fail-safe reactor protection. There is a need for an advanced instrumentation and control system for space-nuclear reactors that addresses both aspects of autonomous operation and safety.  Highly reliable, earth-based reactor instrumentation systems can provide an excellent reference for space-based designs, however there is currently no earth-based reactor control system that is practical for use in space.In Phase I, we established the feasibility of adapting proven terrestrial reactor instrumentation for space application, and developed a preliminary architecture on which to base a flight system.

All of these applications will require autonomous systems for control, safety and monitoring of the reactor.  Space-qualified reactor instrumentation and control systems will be a useful COTS product for manufacturers of space-qualified nuclear reactors.  The predicted total demand is subject to the development of space-based nuclear reactors but it is not unthinkable to forecast demand on the order of a dozen a year.","The primary non-NASA customer is likely the DoD, as part of future space-based surveillance or missile defense systems. Given the energy levels, mission durations, and reliability requirements necessary to carry out the DoD's mission over the next two decades, it's very likely that space-nuclear reactors will be needed in the future.

We propose to develop two tools that can be used together or independently to evaluate performance of flight deck technologies aimed at improving runway safety. We will deliver a computational cognitive model (Adaptive Control of Thought-Runway Safety; ACT-RS) that realistically emulates pilot performance, thus reducing the need for human pilots early in the design process. In addition, we will deliver a measurement tool (Performance Measurement (PM) Engine) that can measure the impact of the flight deck technology on the performance of ACT-RS and a human pilot, making it useful across the technology lifecycle.","ACT-RS and the PM Engine will be useful to NASA researchers within the Aviation Safety Program and the Airspace Systems Program as tools that will allow them to: (1) assess the impact of flight deck technologies aimed at improving runway safety throughout the design lifecycle, (2) identify the underlying factors driving experience-based effects of technology implementation on pilot performance, and (3) provide flexible modeling and software frameworks for assessing performance in different conditions and domains.","ACT-RS and the PM Engine will appeal to customers who are developing flight deck technologies aimed at improving runway safety and those who develop and conduct training for pilots on new flight deck technologies. Avionics developers can benefit by using the proposed tools to collect and provide objective data that is evaluative in terms of FAA regulations, policies, and standards. Airline Training Directors can also benefit by using ACT-RS and the PM Engine to understand the effects of new runway safety technologies and to develop training curriculum that prepares pilots for these changes.",Human-Computer Interfaces; Simulation Modeling Environment; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation

OZ virtually eliminate the need to scan flight instruments and provides superior performance for flight in low visibility conditions compared to current integrated avionics displays.  eSky licensed OZ and is commercializing it for general aviation applications. eSky previously demonstrated the superiority of OZ over current integrated avionics PFDs in high workload situations.NASA Langley and the German Aerospace Laboratory invented researchers H-mode, a collaborative flight control system that shares flight control between pilot and automation allowing the pilot to remain in-the-loop with a high level of situational awareness while retaining aeronautical decision making authority.  In phase 1 eSky designed an integrated system (H/OZ) that uses OZ as the primary flight display in the H-mode flight control system (HFCS).  H/OZ allows the pilot to maintain superior situational awareness while remaining engaged in the managing and directing the flight.  eSky incorporated into both HFCS and OZ graphical elements new to both that support improved functionality.H/OZ has the following primary advantages over current integrated avionics systems:superior situational awareness; critical navigational information displayed on the PFD;  real-time seamless allocation of control between pilot and automation;  Point to Program (P2P) mechanism for visually selecting  airspace elements for guidance; Focus to Display (F2D) mechanism for displaying on PFD and MFD screens only situationally relevant airspace information.  eSky will integrate HFCS and OZ into a prototype H/OZ simulator with new functionality and conduct extensive usability and performance tests of the H/OZ system using human volunteers.","Space Shuttle.  OZ was initially developed with the space shuttle application in mind.  The lack of power simply means that the bent wing and strut configuration can be used for energy management during the approach and landing phase.  Addition of the H-mode automation adds to the capability of precisely navigating any winged spacecraft during reentry.  The bent wing symbology allows precision angle of attack control in all configurations during descent.NASA Aircraft.  OZ was licensed by eSky for general aviation applications only, but the terms of the license allow its integration into any aircraft from a Piper Cub to an Airbus 380.  Any conventional (and even unconventional) aircraft operated by NASA can benefit from OZ.  Addition of the H-mode collaborative flight control system adds capability to any aircraft.","F2D control of airspace element display and incorporation of the OZ airspeed graphic symbology into an advanced airspeed/power management indicator are applicable to any commercial aircraft.  OZ is applicable to all fixed wing platforms, both powered and non-powered.  H/OZ system adds to OZ the capability of replacing traditional autopilot and flight director systems with an intelligent, collaborative flight control system.  This is compatible with air transport aircraft as well, as a key component of an integrated avionics system.  Military aircraft, in addition to superior IMC flight capability, can use energy management for both tactical situations and aircraft carrier landings.  FAA certified light sport aircraft (LSA) are limited to 1320 pounds gross weight and limited airspeed and horsepower, with a maximum of two seats.  In addition to purely recreational flying, LSAs represent a new generation of training aircraft for pilots with private, commercial and air transport pilot ratings.  These trainers need IMC flight capability.  A substantial fraction of LSAs used as training aircraft will benefit from OZ technology.","Attitude Determination and Control; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; On-Board Computing and Data Management; Pilot Support Systems"

Design goals include 20 meter apertures.  In order to minimize mission costs at these large diameters, weight must be severely restricted. Adherent Technologies, Inc. (ATI) has developed two technologies for ultra-light space structures and antennas, the Rigidization on CommandTM (ROC) concept, uses UV-curing resins to stabilize inflated structures and a self-deploying foam antenna concept at small aperture.  These technologies were combined in the Phase I program to produce a foam stabilized antenna with a ROC reflector surface.  The areal density of the 0.6 m devise was 2.2 kg/m3.In the Phase II program, ATI will team with ILC Dover and Allied EM to develop the needed materials, design, manufacture, deploy, and test a 3 m Ka band antenna based on the foam stabilized inflatable technology.  ATI will lead the materials development effort, optimizing the foam formulations and injection methods, as well as create a custom ROC resin for antenna applications. ILC Dover will manufacture the necessary inflatable mold, and Allied EM will be responsible for the RF design and testing.","The technology is designed to stabilize inflated structures in a vacuum environment.  The primary application is for very large aperture antennas as they are needed for interplanetary missions.  The design goal is an areal density of 1 kg/m3, which is easily met by the new approach.The concept is easily expanded for other inflatables like habitat modules for lunar exploration or connecting structures for modular space stations.","At the current development stage, the technology is limited to space applications.  Here it is competitive with state-of-the-art technology satellite antennas due to its low weight.  It has been shown that the foam formulations can also be modified for terrestrial applications.  This opens a whole new area of stabilized inflatable structures as a potential market.

Since entry of EVs in planetary atmospheres results in significant heating, thermally stable aero-assist technologies are required to avoid the high heating rates while maintaining low mass. Polymer adhesives are used in aero-assist structures because of the need for high flexibility and good bonding between the different layers of polymer films or fabrics. However, current polymer adhesives cannot withstand temperatures above 400 C.  Therefore, polymer adhesives capable of withstanding high temperatures (> 400 C) are highly desirable for NASA applications. The present proposal, a collaborative effort between NEI Corporation and a NASA supplier of inflatable structures, aims to utilize our nanotechnology capabilities to address this need. The goal of this program is to develop high temperature adhesives that exhibit high thermal conductivity in addition to increased thermal decomposition temperature. Enhanced thermal conductivity will help to dissipate heat quickly and effectively to avoid temperature rise to harmful levels. This, together with increased thermal decomposition temperature, will enable the adhesives to sustain transient high temperature conditions. A key innovation of the program is to control the nanoparticle morphology so that enhanced thermal conductivity can be realized at relatively low nanoparticle loading levels. Building upon the Phase I proof of concept, the Phase II program will further develop the technology and implement it in NASA and commercial prototypes, thereby increasing the TRL to 4 or greater.","Adhesives of various types are used for different NASA applications, and newer adhesives with even higher temperature capabilities will be needed for future NASA space missions. Generally these applications include bonded joints, seams and sandwich structures (such as metallic facesheet with bonded core). Examples of space structures that need high temperature adhesives include support toruses, solar concentrators and antennas, aeroshells, inflatable aerocapture decelerators, and deployable space structures (antennas, trusses, solar arrays).","The HAA (High Altitude Airship) is an unmanned lighter-than-air vehicle which will be used to enhance the Ballastic Missile Defense System. Hull temperatures can increase significantly due to solar radiation, requiring high-temperature capable seaming solutions. These seaming solutions require high temperature adhesives.  Adhesive applications in the commercial markets are many and varied. High temperature adhesives, especially those that are polyimide-based, are used heavily in the semiconductor industry.  Polyimide and related adhesives are also used in circuit boards; MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems); opto-electronics; anti-static/high temperature control release dicing tapes; high temperature and anti-static doubled-sided tape for wafer thinning; thermal interface materials for thermal dissipation from CPU¡¦s, video chips, power models, and memory modules.",Composites; Cooling; Inflatable; Manned-Maneuvering Units; Portable Life Support; Spaceport Infrastructure and Safety; Suits; Thermal Insulating Materials

Current PV technology horizons do not meet the requirements for expanded mission capability.  Although inorganic PVs hold the record for solar power conversion efficiency, they are inflexible, heavy, and expensive to produce.  There is increasing interest in a new type of PV technology that is based on organic semiconducting materials.  However, the performance of these devices has been limited by the availability of stable n-type (acceptor) organic semiconductors.  TDA Research, Inc. proposes to use a new class of n-type conjugated polymers to produce more efficient organic PV devices (OPVs).  The first generation of our new acceptor materials is already commercially available through Sigma-Aldrich, and the current technology readiness level (TRL) at the end of the Phase I stands at 4 with proof-of-concept results, OPV prototypes, and commercial sales.  A successful Phase II project will lead to several commercial n-type organic semiconductor products being sold by Sigma-Aldrich to both the research and commercial markets, and the use of our products in the full scale production of lightweight flexible OPVs (TRL 6-7).","A successful project will produce a new class of n-type conjugated polymers for high efficiency, thin film organic solar cells.  This technology will revolutionize PV power generation where cost, weight, flexibility, and form-factor are major concerns.  Spaced-based platforms such as manned and unmanned vehicles, probes, and rovers all require lightweight, high efficiency, single-use power generation and will benefit greatly from the realization of this new technology.","New semiconducting polymers with good electron accepting and transport properties are needed for the fabrication of highly efficient organic solar cells.  Potential immediate applications of organic PV devices include disposable flexible power sources, foldable and deployable arrays, charging systems for smart magnetic cards and for smart packaging materials, photovoltaics on fabric and textiles, and various military applications.

The prototype agile stations will operate in a wide band used by NASA and other science and technology satellites and will be able to switch between communications frequencies, modes and data protocols, in real time, to service multiple satellites. The stations will be remotely programmable to store portfolios of satellite applications, and will switch between applications on demand from the largely automatized Ground Station Management and Maintenance Center (GSMMC). Multiple station sites will provide a high level of back-up capability and link opportunities at up to 3.5Mbits/s and will eliminate down-times. The GSMMC will interface with the different satellite Mission Operation Centers, and oversee the scheduling and programming of the station system. The prototype system will be implemented on the existing HETE-2 network of three stations, opening that system to service multiple missions at very low cost, while significantly enhancing its capabilities and performance.","The Open System of Agile Stations will be of interest to many developers of NASA science and technology missions. Developers of SMEX projects for example are and will be interested in a ready-made low cost ground system that provides a flexible, reliable and economical solution to their spacecraft communication requirements, at up to 3.5 Mbit/s, and more in future versions.Another application is as a back-up system for NASA and other missions. Existing and future NASA systems, operating in the S-band (and beyond in future versions) could  have their specific applications on file at all the ground stations in the network, ready to be activated when the need arises. This for the small cost of developing and testing SDR code adapted to their communication system, which can be done in a few weeks. Current  NASA projects such as TESS have already expressed a strong interest in using the prototype system, and are encouraging its development. There is no doubt that when the Open System of Agile Stations prototype is build and tested it will find NASA applications, and requirements will grow.","DoD experimenters have a potential need for a network of agile stations to support experimental missions with a high level of flexibility and at low communication costs. AFRL promoted the development of a pilot SDR ground station system to support the PnPSat project and test the Agile Station concept.  DoD has specific requirement concerning data security that can be accommodated by separate clusters of agile  ground stations. We expect that when the Phase II prototype Open System of Agile Ground Stations is developed and tested, a DREN version of the system will be of interest to DoD experimenters.Non governmental projects have also expressed similar needs and interest, and the Open System of Agile Stations has potential  users within the low-earth-orbiting projects where it can be used either as the primary system or as a back-up and an easy alternative way to download additional data or send commands to the satellites.","Architectures and Networks; Telemetry, Tracking and Control"

The nature of flutter mandates that flight testing be cautious and conservative. In addition to the flutter instability, adverse aeroelastic phenomena include limit cycle oscillations, buffeting, buzz, and undesirable gust response. The analytical prediction of aeroelastic phenomena in the transonic regime has historically been troublesome and requires high fidelity simulation models to obtain accurate predictions. The models are, however, computationally expensive. Traditional uncertainty analysis is therefore not often applied to flutter prediction. The proposed work is to develop computationally efficient methods that reduce the existing computational time limitations of traditional uncertainty analysis. Building upon the successful Phase I demonstration, the coupling of Design of Experiments and Response Surface Methods and the application of robust stability techniques, namely Ý-analysis, will be combined into a comprehensive software toolbox: STI-Aeroservoelastic Robustness Toolbox. STI-ART will have the flexibility to use computational unsteady aerodynamic and structural finite element models from a variety of sources, ranging from simple potential flow models (e.g., doublet lattice methods) and linear structural models to solutions based on modeling of the full Navier Stokes equations and non-linear structural models with many elements.","NASA is a research leader in aeroelasticity. Recent advances include innovative experimental excitation mechanisms for more accurate vibration data, wavelet analysis for signal processing, stability estimation and nonlinear identification, and robust flutter boundary prediction. The proposed work naturally follows from and compliments these topic areas. The resulting toolbox, STI-ART, will be a valuable asset for the many NASA programs that involve the design, analysis, and test of air vehicles. This is true of both transports and high performance aircraft including those routinely used at NASA DFRC. As part of a research program, all of these aircraft will normally go through analysis, ground loads testing, and flutter testing to ensure safe operations for the given research mission. STI-ART will provide a new means to define the aeroelastic stability flight envelope with greater accuracy to insure safer testing. Furthermore, the toolbox will save analysis time via the more efficient algorithms.","STI also has long standing relationships with numerous manufacturers of both commercial and military aircraft. This places STI in a unique position to demonstrate this product directly to likely potential industry users. STI-ART will benefit both the aeroelastic assessment of commercial transports and military aircraft that routinely operate near or within the critical transonic speed regime. With the many external and internal load configurations and higher g maneuvering envelope of military aircraft, a tool such as STI-ART has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of the aeroelastic analysis process. Another post application market for the software package is academia, where the toolbox can provide a user friendly environment to evaluate new CFD/FEM modeling techniques.
